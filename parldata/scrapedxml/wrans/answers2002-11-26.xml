	<p pid=".153W.2/1">The UK is already providing 100 per cent. debt relief to Ethiopia. As a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Ethiopia is eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative. In November 2001 Ethiopia reached Decision Point under the initiative and qualified for interim debt relief on payments due. For its part the UK goes further than is required under the terms of the HIPC initiative and always provides 100 per cent. debt relief. The UK Government are working with other donors, the World bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Ethiopia reach Completion Point under the HIPC initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.2/2">At that point debt will be irrevocably cancelled. To reach Completion Point Ethiopia will need to have demonstrated a clear commitment to poverty reduction, and show how its country-owned poverty reduction strategies will be able to use the resources released by debt relief to reduce poverty. The IMF and World bank estimate that Ethiopia could reach Completion Point as early as July 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".156W.9/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Sir Sydney Chapman, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-26">26 November 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking if he will institute an inquiry into the accuracy of <i>(a)</i> the 2001 Census population figures and <i>(b)</i> the 2001 mid-year estimate population figures. (82946)</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/4" class="indent">I am confident that the 2001 Census figures provide the most accurate estimate of the 2001 population, both nationally and locally. The 2001 Census results are the first to represent the entire population. This was achieved through a new strategy known as the 'One Number Census'. One of the key elements was an independent follow-up survey&mdash;the Census Coverage Survey (CCS), which involved an intensive face-to-face survey of a sample of over 16,000 postcodes containing 320,000 households covering every local authority in England and Wales. By combining the results of the Census and the CCS, it was possible to estimate the total resident population in 2001&mdash; the 'one number'&mdash;to a high level of precision, plus or minus 0.2 per cent, and to provide information on the characteristics of those persons missed by the Census.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/5" class="indent">Thus in 2001, the Census results represent 100 per cent of the population. Census response, that is the proportion of people returning a form in England and Wales, was 94 per cent. The 6 per cent of people estimated to have been missed by the Census have been added to the counts using a statistical process that was subject to extensive consultation, and based on the results of the CCS.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/6" class="indent">In addition, the 2001 Census has undergone rigorous testing and quality checking throughout both the fieldwork and processing. Census tests were carried out in 1997 and 1999 and a survey designed to measure the accuracy of response to each question has been completed. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of verification and validation checks were built in to the processing of the data, and data quality played a key role in all aspects of processing the forms. All information on accuracy will be contained in a Census Quality report to be published in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/7" class="indent">The population base for the 2001 Census was defined so as to be entirely consistent with that used in the calculation of the mid-year estimates, and the 2001 Census figures will form the basis of the mid-year population estimates throughout the next decade. Thus, the 2001 mid-year estimate was calculated by adjusting the census figures to take account of births and deaths and an estimate of the net migration in the interval between Census day (<phrase class="date" code="2005-04-29">29 April</phrase>) and the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/8" class="indent">However, in the light of the evidence, shown by the 2001 Census figures, that the previous (pre-2001) mid-year estimate series had been over-estimating the size of the population and growth in the population over the last few years, the Office for National Statistics will be conducting an assessment of accuracy of the mid-year population estimates that is aimed at learning lessons from the 2001 Census results and making improvements to the method and data sources used to produce mid-year estimates in the future. The results of this assessment are due to be published on the National Statistics website in February 2003. A National Statistics Quality Review on international migration is also currently underway.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/9" class="indent">Some local authorities have experienced an unexpectedly large shift between their population estimates for mid 2001, and the Census values. We are working with several of these to examine our explanation of the differences.</p>
	<p pid=".156W.9/10" class="indent">For the above reasons, I therefore do not feel it necessary to instigate any further inquiry into the accuracy of the 2001 Census and 2001 mid-year estimate figures.</p>

The Lord Chancellor's Department provides core funding to the charity Reunite&mdash;International Child Abduction Centre, which provides advice and support to parents in fear of, or who have suffered, the abduction of their child.

The group meets quarterly and is looking at other action to raise awareness and prevent child abduction.</p>

The procurement strategy for CVF does not rely on a 'bid' process, rather the two candidate prime contractors (BAE Systems and Thales) have been assessed on a continuous basis over the last three years. It is this continuous assessment that will form the basis of our forthcoming selection of preferred prime contractor. In terms of jobs, it is still too early to be definitive as to the numbers that will be involved but early indications suggest that the CVF programme could sustain and create some 10,000 jobs across the United Kingdom during the design and manufacture of the carriers; this would be true irrespective of which of the two candidate primes is eventually selected.</p>

Arrangements for the transportation of low-level waste took account of the route over which the waste had to be moved, and the nature of the waste itself. Waste was routinely moved from the Nuclear Complex to the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, a distance of about one mile, by motor vehicle. Within the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, waste containers were moved by fork-lift truck, although some very low-level wastes were moved over short distances by a hand-operated electrical lifting vehicle, where this was judged to be safe. Large items of intermediate level waste were usually transported within the dockyard under a police escort.</p>
	<p pid=".172W.8/2">Very low-level waste for disposal by the local authority, and low-level wastes for delivery to the National Disposal Service at Harwell and to the national repository at Drigg, were usually transported by road vehicle, although on occasions waste was transported by rail. All transport of radioactive materials on the public highway or by rail was in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.</p>

	<p pid=".173W.3/1">Solid radioactive waste was stored in the purpose-built Solid Waste Disposal Complex at the eastern end of Chatham dockyard. Other industrial buildings within the dockyard were also used as radioactive waste stores, as and when necessary. These buildings were monitored for radioactive contamination after use and, where necessary, decontaminated. Solid radioactive waste was stored in accordance with the Factories Act 1955, national ionising radiation regulations and Royal Naval instructions for radiological protection that were in force at the time. The arrangements were subject to inspection by the Factory Inspectorate.</p>

	<p pid=".177W.5/2">Since my appointment as Minister for Veterans in March 2001,1 have had regular contact with ministerial colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) through the Veterans Task Force which normally meets every six months to give direction to the Government's Veterans Initiative. I have also agreed to become a member of the Ministerial Committee on Homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/3">Officials from the Ministry of Defence and ODPM meet representatives of veterans' organisations regularly through the Ex-Service Action Group; in recent times there has been increased contact in order to develop a work placement programme which will be provided in partnership with the Prince's Trust XBusiness in the Community&quot;. The programme will be up and running next year.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/4">Officials from ODPM are members of a working group on service resettlement established as part of the Veterans Initiative. I have tasked the group with enhancing processes to ensure a more successful transition to civilian life for the small minority of vulnerable service leavers who need support.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/5">The MOD had a number of discussions with the ODPM earlier this year in order to assume financial responsibility for the housing advice staff provided by the English Churches Housing Group in Catterick Garrison and Shelter at the Military Correction and Training Centre in Colchester.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/6">Officials from both Departments have also been discussing how best to make local authority housing officers around the country aware of the change in the 1996 Housing Act Priority Needs Categories, issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-31">31 July 2002</phrase>, which extends the groups of homeless people considered to be in priority need of housing to include the few armed forces personnel who are vulnerable to homelessness due to their institutional background. MOD has also been engaging with the appropriate authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that the same issues are taken into account in their future legislative proposals for housing allocations.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.5/7">More recently, my officials have been finalising arrangements with the ODPM's Homelessness Directorate and the local authority in Richmond, North Yorkshire, for a project to convert a disused art-gallery into 13 self-contained studio flats. The flats will be used to provide short-term accommodation (six to nine months being the norm) for service leavers who are most vulnerable to homelessness.

	<p pid=".182W.2/25">There is no single reason why individuals decide to leave the services and reasons are not necessarily the same across all three services, but some common reasons can be gleaned. These are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/26">Current and future job satisfaction;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/27">Wish to take up another career;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/28">Better employment opportunities outside;</p>

	<p pid=".182W.2/30">Promotion prospects;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/31">Separation from family.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/32">For the Naval Service from the Ratings Notice Giving Survey 2001&ndash;02, the following are the most common reasons listed in order of importance as to why people leave the service: The desire to live at home; Wish to take up another career; To marry/raise a family; Ability to plan long term; Time spent on mundane tasks; Level of job satisfaction experienced; Extent of family disruption; Pay in general; Always intended to leave after a number of years. The Army routinely carries out a survey of leavers. The six most frequently cited reasons for leaving the Army given by leavers are identified below.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/33" class="indent">Lack of job satisfaction;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/34" class="indent">Amount of separation from spouse/partner;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/35" class="indent">Better civilian job opportunities outside the Army;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/36" class="indent">Effect of the Army lifestyle on marriage/relationship;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/37" class="indent">Staying longer will make it more difficult to start a new career;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/38" class="indent">Compassionate reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/39">For the RAF, the Command Scientific Support Branch (CSSB) compiles an annual leavers survey that examines why airmen, airwomen and airmen aircrew are leaving the service. They also administer a questionnaire to all officers who have actively decided to leave the RAF, either at an option point or on PVR terms. The findings from the 2000&ndash;01 administration show that there is no single prevailing reason for leaving the RAF. However, the main reasons (which are similar across all branches and trades) are as follows. For officers the five most important individual items from the questionnaire were:</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/40" class="indent">Future job satisfaction;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/41" class="indent">Employment opportunities outside the RAF;</p>

	<p pid=".182W.2/43" class="indent">Current job satisfaction;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/44" class="indent">Service morale.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/45">For other ranks the five issues found to account for the majority of airmen's reasons for leaving were: Lack of job satisfaction;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/46" class="indent">Promotion prospects;</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/47" class="indent">Staying any longer would make it difficult to start a second career;</p>

	<p pid=".185W.2/2">No net costs resulted from the ministerial direction. There were some associated management and legal charges, which would not otherwise have been incurred, offset by savings in the terms of the service contract. The shipbuilding contracts themselves had already been negotiated by the service provider and the Ministry of Defence assumed responsibility for contract payments. These will be recovered from the service provider when the ships are completed.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.5/1">The review of the statistical classification of deaths in the armed forces is still underway. Whilst this is going on, the category of Xself inflicted deaths&quot;, which had been the basis of some Parliamentary Questions and some official statistics, will not be used. This category had included coroner confirmed suicides and open verdicts, broadly in line with the Office for National Statistics definition of suicide, but coroners' verdicts of accidental death and death by misadventure, together with unknown and outstanding verdicts, were also included. This wider Xself inflicted&quot; category was often misinterpreted as meaning suicide. One of the aims of the review is to remove such confusion by putting the definitions on the same footing as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) use. This will allow more meaningful comparison between military and civilian populations. Furthermore, in answering future questions specifically about the number of suicides, both coroner confirmed suicides and open verdicts will be shown. The Defence Analytical Services Agency are liaising with colleagues in the ONS, and intend to publish an analysis of trends and method of suicides among the armed forces compared to civilians in the first part of 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.2/1">In January 2001, we jointly commissioned research with the Coalfield Communities Campaign that looked into patterns of educational achievement in the coalfields. Evidence showed that coalfield areas are benefiting from the literacy and numeracy strategies at primary level, but attainment declines by Key Stage 3 level (11&ndash;14 years olds) and is well below the national average by GCSE stage. The research also showed, however, that there is no particular 'coalfield effect' and that similar problems occurred in other comparable areas that had experienced industrial economic decline. The full research report is available on the Department's internet site (DfES research report 314) and in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".188W.2/2">We have several strategies already helping to raise educational attainment in deprived areas, although we recognise there is still work to be done.</p>

This includes Excellence in Cities, Excellence Clusters and Education Action Zones We are working with coalfield organisations to clarify issues characteristic to coalfield areas and to agree a joint agenda for action.</p>

	<p pid=".191W.4/2">All export licence applications for over-sized handcuffs are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria and other announced Government policies. This includes consideration of the risk of the over-sized handcuffs being used as, or converted into, leg irons or shackles.</p>

	<p pid=".191W.7/1">We cannot answer on behalf of the UN. However, it is in the public domain that an investigation by Physicians for Human Rights in January 2002 reported claims from captured Taliban that 1,000 men had suffocated on their journey to Shiberghan prison in late November 2001. Their bodies were allegedly buried in mass graves at Dasht-e-Leili.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.7/2">A preliminary UN investigation into the alleged grave sites recommended in May 2002 that a full investigation be carried out, when the conditions for witness protection allowed. In order to protect witnesses the UN cannot release any detailed information at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.7/3">We are concerned about the alleged human rights abuses at Shiberghan. The British embassy in Kabul has raised our concerns with the Afghan Transitional Administration, the UN, the US authorities and the Afghan Human Rights Commission (AHRC). The embassy also recently raised the issue with Afghan Interior Minister Wardak. He agreed the matter was serious and undertook to co-operate in a UNAMA/AHRC investigation. We also welcomed the Transitional Administration's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-21">21 August</phrase> that they would fully co-operate with human rights organisations in the investigation of these alleged mass graves.</p>

Conclusions were agreed by consensus and no formal votes were taken.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/2">General Affairs Session</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/3" class="italic">Progress of work in other Council formations</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/4">The Council took stock of the Presidency report on the work of other Council configurations (doc. 14057/02), noting decisions reached at the ECOFIN meeting of <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase> on modifications to the EIB's statute and the increase to the ECB's capital and foreign exchange reserves, in the context of enlargement.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/5" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council in Copenhagen</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/6">The Council endorsed the draft annotated agenda (doc. 14257/02) for the European Council, which lists two items only: enlargement and the functioning of the Council in view of enlargement. The European Council will also be updated on the work of the Convention by the Presidency of the Convention and will have its customary meeting with the Presidency of the Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/7">The European Council is expected to take all necessary decisions to conclude all negotiations with the 10 candidate countries as identified at the Brussels European Council in October.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/8" class="italic">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/9">The Council discussed the way ahead with a view to concluding accession negotiations with 10 of the acceding countries in time for the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-13">13 December 2002</phrase>. The Council decided that their accession would take place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, allowing acceding countries to participate in European Parliament elections of 2004. The Commissioners from the new Member States will join the Commission upon accession and will fully participate in the forthcoming Inter-governmental Conference, while candidates that are still negotiating will participate as observers.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/10" class="italic">Reform of the Council Presidency</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/11">The Council held a broad debate on reform of the Council Presidency, in advance of a report by the Presidency to be given to the European Council. While some Member States indicated a preference for maintaining the features of the present rotating Presidency and extending co-operation between successive presidencies, others underlined that it would be necessary to consider measures going beyond that.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/12">The Presidency also proposed that the role of the High Representative should be strengthened to help overcome Presidency weaknesses in the area of external relations. Proposals include chairing specific Council meetings, representing the Union in international organisations or in meetings with third countires, negotiating international agreements in the areas of CFSP/ ESDP and supervising EU special envoys.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/13" class="italic">Commission's legislative and work programme</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/14">The Council took note of a presentation by the Commission on its legislative and work programme for the year 2003, following the Annual Policy Strategy presentation in February 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/15">The Commission's work programme is built around three priorities: making enlargement a success; security and stability (fight against terrorism, immigration policy, the new neighbours initiative); and a sustainable and inclusive economy.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/16" class="italic">Terrorism: follow-up to the Action Plan</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/17">The Council took note of the roadmap, outlining progress made in the fields identified by the Action Plan on the fight against terrorism, (doc. 13909/02)</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/18">External Relations Session</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/19" class="italic">Middle East</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/20">Ministers discussed the situation in the Middle East, international efforts and work on the road map. Concern was expressed at the continued violence and further development of settlements.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/22">The Council welcomed the unanimous adoption of the UN Security Council resolution 1441 on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-08">8 November 2002</phrase>, which paves the way for weapons inspectors to return to Iraq. The EU's objective on Iraq is clear: disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions. The EU will whole-heartedly support the UN on this.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/23" class="italic">Cyprus</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/24">The Council noted the UN Secretary General's presentation on a plan for settlement, regarding the initiative as timely. The Council expressed the hope that the UNSG's proposals would form the basis for a negotiated agreement. The Presidency reiterated its desire to see negotiations reach a conclusion prior to the Copenhagen European Council in December, to allow a re-united island to be welcomed into the EU. <i>Belarus</i></p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/25">The Council re-examined the situation in Belarus, following its <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase> declaration expressing concern. It urged the authorities to avoid disruption of the activities of the OSCE Advisor and Monitoring Group (AMG) in Minsk. The Council noted that most Member States planned to implement measures to prevent entry to their territories by the President of Belarus, the Head of Presidential Administration, the Prime Minister, four government ministers, and the Chairman of the Committee of State Security.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/26" class="italic">Korean Peninsula</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/27">The Council reiterated its grave concern at the North Korean revelations concerning a uranium enrichment programme for nuclear weapons. It expressed deep concern that such a programme violated North Korea's international obligations via the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA safeguard agreement, the North-South Joint Declaration on Denuclearization and the Agreed Framework. The Council urged North Korea to immediately dismantle its programme in a verifiable manner and comply fully with its international commitments. Future international co-operation with the international community would be conditional on this. The Council stressed the EU's commitment to act in consultation with all relevant partners to resolve the situation peacefully.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/28">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/29" class="italic">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/30">The Council welcomed the agreement reached by political leaders in Serbia on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-05">5 November 2002</phrase> and urged them to ensure political stability, including a conclusive result for the forthcoming Serbian Presidential election, to allow all vital reforms to continue. The Council recalled that further strengthening of democracy in the FRY and Serbia requires prompt solutions to pending issues. It called on FRY political leaders to abide by democratic principles to ensure the effective functioning of institutions. It also called on them to rapidly adopt the Constitutional Chart and Action Plans on the internal market, trade and customs, to make progress towards the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/31" class="italic">FRY/Kosovo</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/32">The Council welcomed the recent free and fair municipal elections in Kosovo and regretted that, following its boycott of elections, the Serb population of Mitrovica had no democratic representation. The Council welcomed the successful Donor Co-ordination Meeting of <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-05">5 November 2002</phrase> which underlined the need for continued engagement with the international community.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/33" class="italic">Arms sales</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/34">The Council expressed its deep concern at recent reports concerning illegal arms sales from FRY, Bosnia and Herzegovina to Iraq and Iran, in clear breach of UN sanctions. Such illegal sales tarnished the international reputation of the countries concerned and complicated their progress toward the EU. Measures had to be introduced to ensure such violations do not recur. The Council called upon all potential candidates for EU membership to adhere to the EU code of conduct on arms exports without delay. <i>The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)</i></p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/35">The Council reaffirmed the high importance it attaches to co-operation with ICTY. It expressed disappointment and growing concern at the insufficient co-operation by the FRY, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and in some cases, Croatia. The Council reiterated that failure to comply would seriously jeopardise further movement toward the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/36" class="italic">Stability pact for South Eastern Europe</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/37">The Council expressed full support for the Special Co-ordinator of the Stability Pact, Dr. Erhard Busek. It invited the Special Co-ordinator to present a report on this ahead of the June 2003 'Zagreb Process' Summit in Thessalonika.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/38">ESDP</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/39">The Council underlined the importance of ensuring co-ordination of the EU's civilian and military crisis management instruments in order to be able to respond effectively when needed. The Council welcomed the Action Plan on this and the intention to complete the strengthening of civil-military co-ordination by the end of the Greek Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/40" class="italic">Military capabilities</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/41">The Council considered all relevant aspects of EU military capability development, including the Rapid Response elements of the Headline Goal, common training and the Mediterranean Dimension. It welcomed the High Representative's report on efforts to reach agreement between the EU and NATO and invited him to pursue his contacts and report back at its next meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. The Council welcomed the PSC's progress report on Military Capabilities and noted that the overall assessment is encouraging. 19 panels are considering the shortfalls to be remedied and will issue final reports, evaluating the military implications of each proposed option, examine ways of filling potential gaps, study possible solutions and identify whether remaining shortfalls impose constraints on the delivery of the Headline Goal, by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-01">1 March 2003</phrase>. The Council agreed to task the PSC and EUMC to finalise the work on rapid response elements as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/42" class="italic">Civilian capabilities</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/43">The Council endorsed the declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs at their meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase> at a Civilian Crisis Management Capability Conference. The declaration notes that an EU police planning capability already exists and that an appropriate EU planning and mission support capability should be established within the General Secretariat of the Council for the other areas of civilian crisis management as a matter of priority. As a result of the commitments made so far the EU has been able to set up a European Union police mission (EUPM) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will take over from the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase>. Ministers stressed that the development of the EU's civilian crisis management capacity is an ongoing process. They stressed that a solution to the financing of civilian crisis management operations under title V of the Treaty in European Union would have to be found as a matter of priority in order to meet the EU's ambitions in the field.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/44" class="italic">International trade in coffee</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/45">The Council held an exchange of views and expressed serious concern about the situation. Although there were no quick, short-term solutions, initiatives needed to be taken. The issue needed to be looked at in a broader context, including with a view to sustainable development. The Council noted the Commission's willingness to explore possible solutions for the general commodities situation.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/46">Trade and development</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/47" class="italic">Trade and poverty reduction</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/48">The Council welcomed the Commission's communication on Trade and Development and recalled the joint Council-Commission Statement on the European Community's Development policy of November 2000, which highlights Trade and Development as a priority of poverty- reducing Community development activities. The Council reiterated that trade liberalisation in itself is not sufficient to combat poverty in developing countries, but must be part of a wider, country-owned poverty reduction strategy combining trade and development objectives with sound domestic policies, including good governance and anti-corruption measures.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/49" class="italic">Integrating trade and development strategies</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/50">The Council recalled the Doha Declaration objectives and its commitment to placing development at the heart of the work programme through: better market access for developing countries; balanced trade rules that developing countries can apply progressively and flexibly; willingness to solve the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) problem; and through strengthening the capacity for developing countries to adhere to technical standards and regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/51">The Council welcomed the outcome of the 2002 Monterrey Financing for Development conference, underlined its strong commitment to the Cotonou Agreement and welcomed the initiation of negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the ACP countries in September 2002. The Council emphasised that the XEverything But Arms&quot; (EBA) initiative demonstrates the EU's leadership on trade and development and calls on other industrialised countries to emulate this.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/52" class="italic">Enhancing trade-related assistance</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/53">The Council invited the Commission to ensure that trade-related assistance is stepped up as part of a coherent assistant strategy within Country and Regional Strategy Papers (CSPs and CRSPs). It also endorsed the Commission's proposal to focus trade-related assistance in three main areas: assistance for WTO accession, multilateral and other trade negotiations; support for implementation of WTO commitments; and strengthening capacity to adhere to Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). It invited the Commission to pursue all initiatives that ensure trade, development and environment policies are mutually supportive and urged the Commission to work to ensure an ambitious outcome for the Doha Development Agenda. The Commission will present a comprehensive report on further trade and development recommendations in the first half of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/54" class="italic">Untying of aid</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/55">The Council heard a Commission presentation, based on a recent communication on untying aid. The Commission proposed that all aid should be untied on two conditions: the agreement of the recipient country would be required and full untying would take place only on the basis of reciprocity between donors.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/56">Follow-up to international conferences</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/57" class="italic">Monterrey</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/58">The Council held an exchange of views on commitments made at Monterrey (March 2002) and Johannesburg (September 2002) and stressed the need for adequate monitoring of implementation of these in order to meet the Millennium Development goals.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/59" class="italic">Humanitarian crisis in Southern Africa</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/60">The Council reviewed the humanitarian situation crisis affecting Southern Africa, and in particular, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Council called on the Commission and Member States to consider offering further aid in response to UN appeals. The Commission was requested to make a more detailed needs assessment prior to the Council's meeting in December.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/61" class="italic">New Neighbours initiative</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/62">The Council adopted conclusions without debate, expressing its wish that the EU put in place further conditions which would allow it to enhance its relations with its Eastern European neighbours: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. It recognised the need for the EU to formulate an ambitious, long-term and integrated approach towards each of these countries, with the objective of promoting democratic and economic reforms and sustainable development and trade. The Commission and High Representative were invited to prepare more detailed proposals on how to take this initiative further.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/63" class="italic">Sri Lanka</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/64">The Council adopted the conclusions on Sri Lanka, undertaking to strengthen the EUs engagement in the peace process in Sri Lanka and participate in the Oslo donor conference on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-25">25 November 2002</phrase> and contribute to the donor fund to be established.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.5/69">The Council adopted a Decision on the signing and conclusion on behalf of the Community of the International Cocoa Agreement, 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/70" class="italic">Liability and compensation for damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea</p>
	<p pid=".192W.5/71">The Council adopted a Decision authorising the Member States, in the interest of the European Community, to ratify or accede to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1, 1996 (the XHNS Convention&quot;).</p>

With the exception of these two courses, all training has been carried out within Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.5/2">We have provided &pound;1.25 million for an extensive nationwide police communications network to be installed based on VHP and HF technology. Major cities and towns are linked over HF radio. Over 1,000 personal and vehicle radios are in use, and a modern command and control centre has been developed in Freetown. The system is supported by expert advice and training, spares supply and maintenance procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.5/3">We have allocated &pound;3.5 million for 155 Land Rovers, 158 motor cycles, 47 medium carriers, 24 large carriers, 10 ambulances/closed vans and 10 cars for the Sierra Leone Police. In addition spare parts for these vehicles and extensive support has been given in areas of fleet management, fuel control and mechanical training.</p>

Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.5/1">Our policies are giving everybody who can work the opportunity to do so, and providing security for those who are unable to work. We have introduced the national minimum wage, working families tax credit and, from April 2003, the new tax credits to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.5/2">Any decision on increasing the earnings disregard for jobseeker's allowance is a question of fine judgment. We need to balance the benefits of encouraging people into part-time work and maintaining contact with the labour market, against any possible disincentives to full-time work. If the earnings disregard is set too high, then the gap between in-work income and out-of-work benefits becomes so narrow as to discourage people from taking up full-time work.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.5/3">We keep the earnings disregard under review, but there is no set mechanism or formula for increasing it. There is, therefore, no basis on which to calculate an uprated value. We have, however, targeted extra help where it is most needed. For example, for lone parents and certain disabled people the earnings disregard was increased from &pound;15 to &pound;20 from April 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.0/1">From April 2002 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) changed from an annual to a monthly invoicing system for the fees paid by licensed centres. Under this new system the invoices issued each month are based on the number of patient treatment cycles reported to the HFEA in that month, making the reporting and the invoicing easier to reconcile. In addition, the HFEA will visit all licensed centres by the end of 2002&ndash;03 to ensure that the centres are recording all the treatments they have undertaken in their monthly returns to the HFEA. The National Audit Office is continuing to monitor developments, working with the HFEA to establish how it will be able to rely on the results of these visits in order to draw conclusions on the accuracy and completeness of income due to the HFEA.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.6/1">Specialist cancer care for children is concentrated in a national network of paediatric oncology centres, under the umbrella of the United Kingdom children's cancer study group (UKCCSG). There are 16 National Health Service paediatric oncology centres in England. These are:</p>

	<p pid=".216W.6/18">Paediatric oncology centres provide specialist and complex treatment for children with cancer. In addition, there are paediatric oncology shared care units around the country that can provide support, including certain investigations and treatment, nearer to the child's home. This reduces travelling and disruption to families, without compromising quality of care or outcome and provides support to the paediatric oncology centres. The Department does not hold details of this type of unit.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.6/19">The Cancer Plan set out the Government's commitment that an extra &pound;570 million would be made available for cancer services by 2003&ndash;4. The Department does not collect figures on the cost of services provided by the NHS in a way that enables an accurate estimate of funding for paediatric oncology to be calculated.</p>

Her Majesty's Government are already well placed to implement the undertakings in the Code. We already have strong measures in place for tackling the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The United Kingdom scrutinises export licence applications for any possible diversion of the goods to a missile programme of concern. We play an active part in the Missile Technology Control Regime, that co-ordinates national export controls on missile-related technology. Bilaterally, the United Kingdom encourages countries to show restraint in missile programmes and testing, emphasising the adverse effects they have on regional stability.</p>
	<p pid=".221W.0/3">In implementing the ICOC, in line with Part 4 of the Code, the United Kingdom will exchange with other subscribing states pre-launch notifications on ballistic missile and space launch vehicle launches and test flights. Also, in line with the Code we will share annual declarations on the United Kingdom's ballistic missile and satellite vehicle policies and launches.</p>

	<p pid=".224W.0/2">Chemical Industries Association (CIA), member companies and operators of nuclear installations have been carrying out contingency planning since strike action by the firefighters became a real possibility, and keeping the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) informed.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.0/3">The CIA has discussed with member companies the need to review the adequacy of existing plans and procedures, and to consider any additional steps they might take in the absence of emergency assistance from the Fire Brigade. The nuclear operators are likewise acting in the light of their responsibilities for safety on their sites and for emergency preparedness, and are keeping under review the implications of possible further strike action for their day-to-day activities.</p>
	<p pid=".224W.0/4">The Health and Safety Executive has offered advice to employers operating onshore major hazard sites and nuclear licensed sites. In essence, this advice is for businesses to review their risk assessments in the light of the changed circumstances and consider what additional actions might be necessary. Overall, the HSE view is that the existence of a strike should not, of itself, cause the vast majority of legitimate industrial or commercial activities to be curtailed, since emergency plans and evacuation should not be dependent on the presence of the fire brigade. The HSE's advice, and other advice to relevant industries, is available on HSE's website: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/firefighters.htm">www.hse.gov.uk/firefighters.htm</a></p>

	<p pid=".227W.5/1">A Xlicence agreement&quot; is not a recognised instrument of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended). However, the Act does allow the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to attach conditions to nuclear site licences in the interests of safety or with respect to the handling, treatment and disposal of nuclear material and within the arrangements made by licensees under those conditions the HSE does use formal Xagreements&quot; to effect its permissioning role.

	<p pid=".227W.5/2">Any changes, on the part of a licensee, relating to the storage of nuclear waste at the site would be subject to the acceptance of a revised safety case by HSE. Such changes would need to meet Licence Condition 32, which specifically addresses the accumulation of radioactive waste within the standard set of 36 conditions,. In enforcing this and other licence conditions, HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate takes into account Government policy on radioactive waste management, as set out in Cm2919.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.5/3">Additionally the licensee's policy on the management of radioactive waste is reviewed through the quinquennial review process, as required by Government policy. Changes in licensee's policy will be identified by this process and assessed by HSE.

	<p pid=".233W.9/2">The Food Standards Agency is engaged in a wide range of activities to promote the uptake of a healthy, balanced diet. Details of these are available from the agency's nutrition action plan on the agency's website (<a href="http://www.food.gov.uk">www.food.gov.uk</a>). This encompasses work in schools, information and advice to consumers, including through the agency website and funding research and surveys on barriers to uptake of a balanced diet and how these can be overcome.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.9/3">The Department's initiatives, as highlighted in the XNHS Plan&quot; (2000), address both access and information. Actions on the latter include generating awareness on breastfeeding, a Five a Day programme to promote fruit and vegetable consumption, support for healthy weight maintenance and initiatives in schools and elsewhere to promote a balanced diet and physical activity.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.5/1">The most recent assessment of farmers' markets in England and Wales was a business survey carried out by the NFU in July 2002. This reported that the 450 regular farmers' markets currently operating have an annual turnover of approximately &pound;166.3 million with the average earnings of each stallholder being around &pound;8,700. With average farm incomes for 2001 of &pound;7,861, the economic benefits for local farmers participating in farmers' markets are clear.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.5/2">The business survey did not specifically consider the impact of farmers' markets on retailers but it did report that 80 per cent. of locations had seen increases in trade for neighbouring businesses. This supports the findings of an earlier study carried out on behalf of the Countryside Agency in 2001 on farmers' markets in the South East. This reported that in the opinion of those market organisers and town centre managers that responded most considered that local shops had benefited.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.2/1">Both DEFRA and the Environment Agency have a responsibility to all taxpayers to ensure that value for money is obtained for investment in flood alleviation schemes. My understanding that there is little likelihood that a further flood alleviation scheme could be justified in Shrewsbury is based on the Agency's judgement that the costs of providing such schemes would outweigh the benefits, using the currently agreed methodology. However this methodology is subject to review next year and the Agency will consider any impact on the viability of defence measures for parts of Shrewsbury.</p>

	<p pid=".237W.5/2">The agreement provides South Africa, Botswana and Namibia with the prospect of a one-off sale of legal stocks of raw ivory after May 2004 provided that a number of strict conditions have first been met. These include verification of trading partners by the CITES Secretariat (to prevent illegal ivory entering legal markets), a requirement that baseline data on population and poaching levels is available from the MIKE system (Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants) and any funds raised must be used for elephant conservation. If any of the conditions are not met, the sale will not take place.</p>
	<p pid=".237W.5/3">The Government believe that the agreement strikes the right balance between meeting the legitimate expectations of the southern African states that they should be able to engage in sustainable utilisation of their natural resources, whilst establishing strict controls to secure the conservation of wider elephant populations.</p>

The status of seal populations in the UK is reported annually by the National Environment Research Council (NERC) based on data produced by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), University of St. Andrews.

However, this is being addressed by a GB-wide research contract, XDesign and pilot a multi-species terrestrial mammal monitoring project&quot;. The overall aim will be to design and pilot, using a volunteer network, a winter monitoring project involving both visual recording of mammals and recording their signs. It is intended to form a building block for an integrated mammal-monitoring system.</p>

This survey is looking at the number and variety of mammals seen in gardens. This survey will be annual and will give information about urban mammal populations; the results from the first year should be available early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".246W.0/2">The ability of police forces to respond to a terrorist attack involving the use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials is being strengthened through the increased provision of specialist police training. Home Office funding is being made available to meet the full running and equipment costs involved. Information about specific numbers of trained police officers in each local authority area is not at present held centrally, but in each police force, four senior officers have so far received training to Gold and Silver Command level. The total number of CBRN trained officers in London to date is approximately 1,100, with approximately 1,250 further officers CBRN trained in police forces in the United Kingdom. The training programme is on-going and I will update these figures on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/3">I understand from my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister that individual records for firefighters training are not available centrally. Interim guidance on dealing with contaminated casualties following a CBRN attack was issued in December 2001. The majority of Fire Service personnel will have received training in these interim procedures, and approximately 120 of the Services' senior commanders have received multi-agency training, which is on-going.</p>
	<p pid=".246W.0/4">All sides in the current firefighters dispute have agreed to provide cover for large scale terrorists or other civil contingency incidents.</p>

	<p pid=".248W.2/2">The Government have set out its strategy for tackling organised immigration crime: trafficking and smuggling in the White Paper XSecure Borders, Safe Haven&quot;, published in February. New criminal offences and penalties for trafficking and smuggling were introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, carrying heavy terms of 14 years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.2/3">We have established Reflex as a multi-agency response to organised immigration crime into the UK, including Northern Ireland. Reflex is led by the National Crime Squad and engages all the key agencies involved in combating organised immigration crime, including police, immigration services, security and intelligence agencies and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), in building up intelligence and planning operations against the traffickers. Reflex feeds into the Organised Crime Strategy Group, chaired by the Home Office, on which Northern Ireland Office officials sit, and in turn into the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force, established by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which co-ordinates multi-agency activity against organised crime in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.2/4">The scale of illegal immigration into Northern Ireland does not appear to reflect national trends. While the number of applications for asylum have increased significantly in recent years, they are very small in comparison with the rest of the UK. However, a strategic project to examine organised immigration crime in Northern Ireland is currently being undertaken by Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in co-operation with a number of other Government and law enforcement agencies through the offices of the Organised Crime Task Force. This aims to provide a baseline understanding of the scale and potential growth of the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".252W.3/1">The Prison Service is taking a number of steps to stifle the availability of drugs in prisons. These measures, which include mandatory drug testing, operate alongside a comprehensive treatment framework and the provision of voluntary drug testing. The overall impact on drug use is demonstrated by the reduction in the positive rate of random mandatory drug tests from 24.4 per cent. (1996&ndash;97) to 11.3 per cent. (year to date). The complementary nature of some supply reduction measures, e.g. drug detection dogs, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and low furniture in visits areas, and the complex nature of drug supply make it difficult to determine the impact of any single factor in reducing the availability or use of drugs.</p>
