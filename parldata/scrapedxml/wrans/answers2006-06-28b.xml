We are currently considering the North West region's advice, which the North West regional assembly were involved in determining, on the priority it attaches to the Carlisle northern development route and other major transport schemes in the North West. We hope to announce our response to the region's advice before the parliamentary summer recess. This scheme is currently assumed to be funded through the private finance initiative (PFI) with only a small element coming from the regional funding allocation. We are currently considering Cumbria's bid for an increase in PFI funding requirement.</p>

The casualty figure takes account of lost output (which includes any non-wage payments paid by the employer), medical and ambulance costs and human costs based on willingness to pay values representing pain, grief and suffering. The accident figure is higher because it includes non-casualty specific costs such as the costs of policing, insurance and administrative costs and damage to property, and because on average more than one casualty is involved in each accident.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.2/3">Included within these values are the costs to public funds for medical, ambulance and police costs (emergency services) which in 2004 averaged at &pound;817 per fatal casualty and &pound;7,076 per fatal accident.

	<p pid="b.387W.9/2">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is responsible for the maintenance of the Rural Land Register (RLR), and information from the RLR is used to support claims to the Single Payment Scheme. The process of digitising land and amending existing land registrations has been amended recently, with activity brought back onto RPA's main computer system. This followed a period when an outsourced provider was used to digitise land during a period of exceptionally high demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.9/3">The digitisation process itself includes a number of quality checks to ensure that the correct land parcel and area are digitised. Where errors are found they are corrected before maps are issued to customers. Further amendments are made where customers identify issues with the maps they receive. RPA is aware of a number of cases where there have been issues with maps sent to customers. The re-establishment of an in-house process will aid the cross check of new and amended land areas to customer details.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">19 June</phrase>, the National Control Centre of CEFAS, Weymouth Laboratory confirmed that viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) has been detected in a sample of grayling taken from the River Nidd below the outlet of the farm infected with the disease, although the infected fish showed no clinical signs of the disease. Further comprehensive sampling and testing is taking place on fish in the river, both below and above the infected farm.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.2/3">Fish disease experts at CEFAS advise that although there is no scientific evidence that VHS virus infection causes significant outbreaks in wild freshwater fish stocks, any persisting infection in wild stocks could be a source of infection or re-infection for trout farms in the vicinity through VHS virus contamination of the river supply to the farm.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.2/4">There are no plans at present to carry out compulsory slaughter of fish on farms in the areas of the River Ouse and River Don affected by the current outbreak but the matter will be kept under review. No further cases of VHS have been detected on fish farms.</p>

This is part of a package of measures to enable the UK to meet the requirements of the landfill directive and move towards sustainable waste management.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.2/2">As part of the programme, WRAP is working with 13 major retailers to reduce the amount of waste from supermarkets, including looking for ways to redesign packaging as well as support for research and development into waste minimisation. It is also working with local authorities to establish greater participation in home composting through its targeted National Home Composting Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.2/3">In its recent consultation on the review of its Waste Strategy, the Government identified the importance of waste prevention for reducing waste, including in the household.

	<p pid="b.390W.5/1">Article 5(2) of the EC Landfill Directive sets three target years (2006, 2009 and 2016) by which member states must reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill in proportion to the amount produced in 1995.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/2">The directive also allows member states which landfilled over 80 per cent. of their municipal waste in 1995 to postpone the targets by up to four years. The Government have informed the European Commission of their intention to make use of this four-year derogation, which means the target years for the UK are 2010, 2013 and 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/3">The UK target for 2010 is to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to no more than 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995. For England, this equates to 11.2 million tones in 2010. It is estimated that in 2003-04, around 14.7 million tonnes was disposed of in this way, with a provisional estimate of a further reduction to around 13.9 million tonnes in 2004-05 (i.e. 124 per cent. of the 2010 target).</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/4">In preparation to the first 2010 target year, the UK have already taken steps to reduce the amount of waste being sent to landfill. The Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS), was launched in April 2005, and is one of the Government's key measures to encourage progressive reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste that disposal authorities are able to send to landfill sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/5">Should any waste disposal authority have landfilled more waste than it holds allowances for, it can use the sixth month reconciliation period (from March to the end of September), to trade, borrow or bank allowances to manage their liabilities. Any waste disposal authority which has landfilled biodegradable municipal waste in excess of the allowances it holds at the end of the reconciliation period will be liable to a financial penalty of &pound;150 per tonne (according to section 9(2) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003).</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/6">The LATS regulations also provide for supplementary penalties (in addition to any penalties for exceeding allowances) that are proportional to (a) any fines imposed on the UK in respect of obligations under the Landfill Directive and (b) the amount by which an authority exceeds its allowance in a Landfill Directive target year, or subsequent scheme years following Landfill Directive target years.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/7">Due to the nature of a tradable allowances scheme, it is not possible to assess accurately now whether any waste disposal authority is likely to landfill biodegradable municipal waste in excess to that which it holds allowances for until the Environment Agency has completed the reconciliation process for the LATS year 2005-06, expected by the end of September.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.1/1">DEFRA published a consultation document on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase> setting out the Government's thinking in a number of key areas to be addressed by a Marine Bill. These include marine spatial planning, nature conservation, licensing reform, and the possibility of setting up a new marine organisation. We had already undertaken initial consultation on some fisheries issues that will also be dealt with in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.1/2">The final scope of our proposals for a Marine Bill, including the strategic direction we should take, will not be decided until we have fully considered the responses to the consultation exercise.

	<p pid="b.392W.1/3">We will need to take these responses into account before any decision is made on the timing of further consultation on detailed proposals for a draft Bill. Introduction of a Marine Bill will follow later in this Parliament, subject to the availability of parliamentary time. We want to move forward swiftly, but this is a complex area and we must make sure that we take sufficient time to consult effectively and get our proposals right.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.1/4">The Government's primary purpose for a new Marine Bill is to introduce a stronger framework for the seas, based on marine spatial planning, that balances conservation, energy and resource needs. Together with a planning system for the marine area, we have proposed a number of possible approaches for the reform of marine nature conservation legislation. These include new mechanisms for the conservation of marine ecosystems and biodiversity, including protected areas for important species and habitats.</p>

The Government are considering what further steps are needed to tackle household waste as part of the review of the Waste Strategy, which will be published later this year. We are also looking at the spending pressures local authorities face, with regard to waste management, ahead of the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.6/2">Variable charging is one of a number of tools that could be used to encourage waste minimisation and recycling of household waste. Local authorities already have powers to run incentive schemes or require householders to separate their waste for recycling. Recent research shows that at least half of English local authorities have run, or are running, some form of incentive scheme and some, such as Barnet, require householders to separate their recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.6/3">Many countries, including some in the European Union, have introduced successful household waste charging schemes, achieving reductions in waste and increases in the separation of waste for recycling. (Evidence from studies of this international experience shows a small increase in fly-tipping incidents when schemes are introduced, but this quickly tails off where schemes are well designed and effective enforcement action is taken.)</p>

	<p pid="b.395W.8/2">State Veterinary Service (SVS) staff are instructed to slaughter cattle suspected of being affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) at the time of their examination. In a minority of cases, the SVS arrange for live suspects to be transported to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in Weybridge, subject to an assessment of fitness to travel and journey time considerations. BSE suspects received at the VLA are slaughtered within 72 hours of arrival. However, most BSE suspects are slaughtered on-farm.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.3/1">There are three types of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Burma. These are (with the latest available numbers, from October 2005):</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/2" class="indent">(i) people in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities (340,000);</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/3" class="indent">(ii) villagers who have been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into designated relocation sites (108,000); and</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/4" class="indent">(iii) civilians hiding from the Burmese Army in areas most affected by armed conflict (92,000).</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/5">The recent military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of civilians hiding in conflict areas by at least 15,000. DFID's approach to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to use our comparative advantage (the fact that we have a small presence inside the country and a strong network of relationships with ethnic minority and other groups) to reach the IDPs using local community groups inside Burma. This is a complementary approach to the use of relief teams operating cross border from Thailand, and it enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through a mechanism which is much less well supported by other donors. The development of civil society within the country is also a fundamental step in a successful transition to democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/6">The number of IDPs that we can reach from inside the country is limited. Access is difficult, and the small local groups with whom we are working do not currently have the capacity to deliver greater volumes of emergency relief, although we are working to strengthen their ability to do more. Those delivering assistance to IDPs cross border from Thailand face similar challenges. Therefore we recognise the importance of maintaining co-ordination with all donors (both those delivering assistance cross border, and those working inside the country) to ensure that together we manage to reach as many IDPs as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/7">DFID also provides support to IDPs in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas in eastern Burma through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to which we provide &pound;500,000 a year, of which approximately 75 per cent. is attributable to work with displaced people in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/8">In addition, our health, education and rural livelihood projects provide assistance in eastern Burma, and support internally displaced people in temporary settlements and designated relocation sites there, as well as other vulnerable people. For example, in Karen State, our Fund for HIV/AIDS in Burma supports World Vision projects in two townships, Save the Children UK projects in four townships and Care projects in five townships, as well as supporting other national non-governmental organisations (NGOs). DFID-funded rural livelihoods and pre-primary education projects are also about to start in Karen State.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/9">DFID is also providing support to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working among displaced Burmese people in the refugee camps on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border&mdash;as a grant to the Thai Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) of &pound;1.8 million over three years. In addition, the UK contributes approximately the same amount again as its share of the EC's support to the TBBC. The British embassy in Bangkok advocates on behalf of Burmese refugees living in Thailand through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to improve the situation in the refugee camps in Thailand and to bring about a relaxation of the regulations prohibiting freedom of movement and employment outside the camps.</p>

	<p pid="b.403W.5/1">The Royal Military Police (RMP) Special Investigations Branch (SIB) has a minimal interface with the general public in comparison to their civilian counterparts. As a result, complaints by third parties unconnected to the armed forces about the conduct of the RMP (SIB) are far less likely to occur. We do not therefore consider it appropriate for the RMP (SIB) to be brought under the oversight of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.5/2">However, a comprehensive redress of complaints system exists for all service personnel, including service police personnel, who wish to complain or express a grievance about any matter related to their service. Improvements were proposed under the Armed Forces Bill which included a redress panel system where panels would include an external, independent member for certain types of complaints, and an external reviewer focusing on process, delay, fairness, and the effectiveness of the procedure, and providing recommendations for improvements where necessary. Further to the Deepcut Review, we plan to extend the role of the external reviewer, renamed the Service Complaints Commissioner, who would have statutory powers to receive a complaint or allegation from a service person, family or other third party, to place it in the hands of the chain of command and to be notified of the outcome. The Commissioner would have direct access to Ministers and would publish an annual report on the complaints process.</p>
	<p pid="b.403W.5/3">These proposed arrangements will now be subject to the full process of parliamentary scrutiny in the context of the remaining stages of the Armed Forces Bill's passage through Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.408W.8/1">Most tourist information centres (TICs) are controlled by local authorities and not funded or managed centrally. The provision of tourism services by local authorities, including TICs, is a discretionary matter for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.8/2">However, VisitBritain has recently conducted a consultation on a strategy for providing national leadership for the tourist information network in England. The proposals, put forward after extensive discussion with the National TIC Steering Group and regional partners, include a range of actions designed to increase efficiency and service standards; increase revenue opportunities; and ensure integration with the 'Englandnet' business support tool.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.8/3">It is hoped that these actions will strengthen the TIC brand and allow VisitBritain to market the network in Britain and overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.8/4">Until March 2006, VisitBritain part-funded One NorthEast and the Yorkshire Tourist Board (YTB) to conduct co-ordination of the network. Between 2000 and 2003, this work was carried out by the regional tourist boards, led by the English Tourism Council. The costs of this work centrally were as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.408W.8/7"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.408W.8/8"> <td>2000-01</td> <td>110,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.408W.8/9"> <td>2001-02</td> <td>100,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.408W.8/10"> <td>2002-03</td> <td>97,070</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="b.408W.8/13"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>56,500</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.408W.8/16">Unfortunately, detailed annual records of the number of TICs and their visitor numbers are not held centrally. There were approximately 560 TICs in 2000 and there are about 514 now. YTB made a rough estimate in 2002 that around 75 million visits were made to England's TICs. The acquisition of improved data on these matters is an important element of VisitBritain's current proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.8/3" class="indent">As Registrar General for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what steps are to be taken to ensure that data on deaths that would be released under clause 11 of the Police and Justice Bill cannot directly or indirectly be misused by commercial organisations; how the activities of commercial organisations will be monitored in relation to the use of such data; and what penalties would be available if the data were misused. (80536)</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.8/4" class="indent">It is the case now that death registration data is in the public domain as soon as any death is registered. The data is, however, difficult to access in bulk in England and Wales and is not accessible using modern technology. The intention of the provision is to reduce the scope for criminal activity arising from the fraudulent use of a dead person's identity, and to do so by making data available more quickly and in a more accessible format than is permitted at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.8/5" class="indent">It is recognised that provision of the data quickly and in bulk does create a need for additional controls. Any commercial organisation seeking to utilise data on deaths would need to demonstrate clearly that it would be used in such a way as to fulfil the intent of the clause by enabling the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences, and no data will be released unless that is the case. A regime is being designed, based on those criteria, to enable rigorous assessment of applications for receipt of the data.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.8/6" class="indent">The data will be released subject to strict conditions, and subsequent misuse of it will, lead as a minimum to withdrawal of the supply of data to the organisation concerned; further penalties would depend on the nature of the improper use.</p>

The Home Condition Report will bring transparency to the process and ensure that negotiations regarding sale price reflect the condition of the property.</p>
	<p pid="b.419W.5/2">The Government commissioned research in 2000 and 2003 on the potential implications of home information packs (HIPs) for low value and low demand properties. They also consulted in March 2003 on whether there should be special arrangements in such cases. The findings of the research and consultation showed that buyers, sellers and local property professionals felt that HIPs could help the functioning of the market in those areas, and that exempting particular properties or areas of properties could reduce demand and therefore prices even further.</p>

	<p pid="b.423W.2/1">Carer's allowance, formerly known as invalid care allowance, has always been available to carers aged below state pension age. From 1994 it was made available to women aged between 60 and 65, and from 2002 we abolished the upper age limit for making a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.2/2">People entitled to carer's allowance can have the additional amount for carers, currently &pound;26.35 a week, included in the assessment of their pension credit. This applies both to those in receipt of carer's allowance and those who cannot be paid because they are receiving at least an equivalent amount from a state pension. It is a basic principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for the same purpose. Even though the circumstances which give rise to carer's allowance and state pension are different, they are both designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or forgone income. We have no plans to change the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.423W.2/3">As at November 2005, more than 42,500 people aged 60 or over were receiving carer's allowance and more than 181,800 had the additional amount for carers included in their pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.425W.3/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (c.13) is the only DWP sponsored primary legislation since April 2005. The criminal offences created in that Act are:</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/2" class="indent">(i) Section (7)(2)(b) adds 'a rail vehicle accessibility compliance certificate' to the list of relevant documents in section 49(1) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, in respect of which it is already an offence for such a document to be forged, altered etc or for a false statement be made knowingly for the purpose of obtaining such a document. The amendment has yet to be brought into force;</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/3" class="indent">(ii) Section 8(2) inserts a new subsection (5) into section 49 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 Act to make it an offence to falsely pretend to be a person authorised to inspect rail vehicles for conformity with rail vehicle accessibility regulations. The provision has yet to be brought into force;</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/4" class="indent">(iii) Section 9 inserts a new section 21A into the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (c.44) in relation to badges issued outside Great Britain; subsection (4) of the new section makes it an offence to display a badge purporting to be a recognised badge unless it is a recognised badge and is displayed in accordance with regulations to be made under subsection (3). Subsection (8) makes it an offence to fail without reasonable excuse, to produce a badge when required to do so by a constable or enforcement officer. This provision came into force as regards England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/5" class="indent">(iv) Section 10(3) inserts a new subsection (2B) into section 16B of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which makes it an offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to make a false or misleading statement to the effect that publication of a particular advert would not be unlawful by reason of the operation of subsection. (2); For the sake of completeness, the following provisions of Schedule 1 to that Act make amendments to other primary legislation which insert new offences into that legislation:</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/6" class="indent">(v) Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 43(3) inserts a new subsection (6A) into section 105 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c.27). This makes it an offence to leave a vehicle stationary in contravention of any prohibition or restriction, where an immobilisation device could have been fixed to the vehicle if it had not been displaying a current recognised badge (defined by section 21A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970), where the vehicle was not being used in accordance with regulations under s21A of the 1970 Act and in circumstances where a concession would not be available to a vehicle lawfully displaying a recognised badge. This provision also came into force as regards England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/7" class="indent">(vi) Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 44(3) inserts subsection (1A) into section 117 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c.27). This makes it an offence for a person to display a badge purporting to be a recognised badge (defined by new section 21A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970) where they are also breaching a provision of an order relating to parking under the 1984 Act and where the circumstances are such that a concession would be available to someone lawfully displaying a recognised badge. The offence will not be committed provided the badge is a recognised badge and is being displayed in accordance with regulations under section 21A of the 1970 Act. This provision also came into force as regards England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/8" class="indent">(vii) Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 46(3) inserts subsection 2A into section 70 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 (c.40). This creates an offence for cases where an immobilisation device could have been fixed to a vehicle in a designated parking space, had a current recognised badge (defined by section 21A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970) not been displayed on the vehicle, if the vehicle was not being used in accordance with regulations under that section and the circumstances were such that a disabled person's concession would not be available by virtue of displaying a non-GB badge.

	<p pid="b.425W.3/9" class="indent">(viii) Schedule 1, Part 2, paragraph 48(2) inserts subsection (5A) into section 79 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 (c.18). This states that regulations to be made under that section shall provide that an offence is created where a person is in charge of a vehicle in circumstances where an immobilisation device would have been fixed to the vehicle had a current recognised badge not been displayed on the vehicle and the vehicle is not being used in accordance with regulations under section 21A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 and the circumstances are such that a disabled person's concession would not be available by virtue of displaying a non-GB badge.

Projections of the number of pensioners eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br/> 5. These projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.<br/> 6. Estimates cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.<br/> 7. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age.<br/> 8. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 family resources survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.<br/> 9.

	<p pid="b.432W.8/1">Neither my Department nor the Ministry of Defence hold the information requested. Officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have contacted the Bermuda Regiment directly and the Regiment has provided the following information.</p>
	<p pid="b.432W.8/2">For 2006, of the 541 men called up for service in the Bermuda Regiment two were registered as Conscientious Objectors, seven were exempted as 'ministers of a religious denomination', 14 were conditionally deferred to serve in the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, and 94 did not report for medical examination, nor explain their absence in advance. Of these 94 men, 51 are believed to reside in Bermuda, while the whereabouts of the remaining 43 is unknown.</p>
	<p pid="b.432W.8/3">The Bermuda Regiment is a part-time regiment, and the maximum accumulated time put in by any member of the regiment is equivalent, at its maximum, to thirty days in one year. The regiment considers that a man who has been absent without leave for more than three consecutive scheduled or ordered appearances is a long term absentee (LTA). At the time of this parliamentary question the Bermuda Regiment has on its books a total of 65 LTAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.432W.8/4">On the question of desertion the Bermuda Defence Act 1965 makes no provision for such a charge.</p>
	<p pid="b.432W.8/5">Under the Defence Act every soldier who fails to perform military duties is charged internally with unauthorised absence. So far in 2006, 21 such cases have been heard, and all have been found guilty. The commanding officer handed out the following sentences: extra duties (three); monetary fines (four); and re-start the military year (11). The remaining three cases have been referred to the magistrates court, for which there is provision in the Defence Act, where they remain outstanding.</p>

	<p pid="b.437W.8/1">The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued warrants for the arrest of five Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) Commanders, including Joseph Kony, in October 2005. Responsibility to implement the arrest warrants lies in the first instance with the states on whose territory the five LRA commanders are believed to be, namely, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan. We have not received any requests for assistance in this regard from the Governments of Uganda, the DRC or Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.8/2">The UK is a strong supporter of the work of the ICC in its efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. We continue to urge the Governments of Uganda, the DRC and Sudan to fulfil their commitments to co-operate with the ICC, and to help implement the warrants for the arrest of the five senior LRA commanders, including Kony, as soon as possible.</p>

The comprehensive report can be found on COMEAP's website at <a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/">www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/</a>. No recent assessment of effects of PM2.5 on the respiratory system has been made. This will be addressed during COMEAP's work on the quantification of effects of air pollutants on health.

	<p pid="b.471W.5/2">Each local authority, through their children's services authority arrangements, is required by the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme to set up an accessible children's services directory, including information on services for vulnerable young people such as those who run away or go missing. Local authorities must also produce a Children and Young People Plan setting out how services, including those for vulnerable young people, will operate. Such services are for local authorities to determine, in partnership with the relevant stakeholders in their area, according to local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.5/3">Many local authorities have already placed their service directories on their existing website, while others have created new sites, giving them easy-to-find titles appropriate to local community circumstances (e.g. Help4me.info in Cheshire and Merseyside).</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.5/4">In 2005 the Department commissioned research by the National Family and Parenting Institute to look at how local authorities were linking up their directories. From those who took part, we have compiled a list of local authority children's services web links. These are available on the Every Child Matters website. However, my Department has no other current plans to collect and publish information nationally on what specific services operate in every area.</p>

	<p pid="b.472W.2/2">The schools pack referred to was developed by Shelter and Connexions, and launched by the Department in 2004. It is available via the teachernet website (teachemet.gov.uk) and Shelter's own website. Shelter also produced a pack for personal social and health education (PSHE) teachers: &quot;Talk before you walk&quot;, which is available via their website.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/3">Opportunity exists within the current PSHE and citizenship frameworks for schools to explore issues to do with recognising and managing risks involved in running away. The Department is however not prescriptive with schools about what issues they must explore, what resources they must use, or how they should access them, to achieve the learning objectives set out within those frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/4">DfES has also run six development projects to test out community-based responses. When we disseminate the lessons learnt so far from these later this year, this will include information, materials and support models from work with schools in the pilot areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.472W.5/1">All new buildings must comply with the latest 2006 edition of Part L of the Building Regulations &quot;The Conservation of Fuel and Power&quot;. Approved Document L (ADL) in support of Part L of the Building Regulations was published in March 2006 and has considerably increased the energy efficiency required of all new buildings including schools compared with the 2002 edition. In addition the new Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method &quot;BREEAM Schools&quot; which all new build schools are required to complete gives credits for improving the energy efficiency beyond the requirements of ADL. DfES expects all major new build and refurbishment school projects to achieve a very good or excellent rating on &quot;BREEAM Schools&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned Edison Schools UK, nor has it made an assessment of the role Edison is playing, to help local authorities meet their duties in regard to special educational needs (SEN). Local authorities have duties to identify, assess and arrange suitable provision for children with SEN and to keep their arrangements for special educational provision under review. Local authorities can buy in consultancy advice to help them with their special needs duties, as can schools, including special schools. The Department does not record how much local authorities have spent commissioning Edison nor what, if any, of this has been spent on SEN consultancy. Through programmed annual performance assessments and periodic joint area reviews of children's services, Ofsted and other inspectorates inspect how local authorities meet their duties, including any arrangements they make with private or voluntary sector organisations.</p>

Relatively few such schools select in this way. When the Department last collected such data in summer 2001, only 45 schools or 6.5 per cent. of those that were specialist at the time did so.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.8/1">Funding for Building Schools for the Future is allocated formulaically, based on pupil numbers and our area guidelines for secondary schools, published in 'Building Bulletin 98'. Within 'Building Bulletin 98' swimming pools are considered to be a 'supplementary area'&mdash;in other words they are not part of the core school facilities which we fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.8/2">While Building Schools for the Future funding allocations do not include money for new swimming pools, we do allow existing pools to be refurbished within the programme. It is for each local authority to decide how to make the best use of its overall Building Schools for the Future funding allocation across the schools in a particular project and the scope of works at each school. A decision could be taken locally to put some of the available funding towards a swimming pool instead of the second of the two PE spaces allowed for in our guidelines, but only if the resulting provision satisfies the school's PE curriculum as well or better than the standard provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.8/3">There is also the option of exploring other sources of funding to supplement that from Building Schools for the Future. In order to help facilitate that locally the Department has produced guidance on joining-up funding in the context of Building Schools for the Future.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.11/93">Research by the National Foundation for Education Research (NFER) conducted during 2005 and published by the Department in January 2006 indicated that 92 per cent. of all teachers teaching science were science specialists with 44 per cent. holding a biology specialism, 25 per cent. holding a chemistry specialism, 19 per cent. a physics specialism and 5 per cent. a specialism in another science. An estimated 2 per cent. of teachers teaching science did not hold a post A-level qualification in science. In addition, the research estimated that 76 per cent. of teachers teaching maths were maths specialists. An estimated 14 per cent. held no post A-level qualification in maths. For both maths and science, the research suggested that specialists deliver a greater proportion of the curriculum time than their relative size within the work force would suggest. For example, although only 10 per cent. of teachers teaching science at Key Stage 4 hold a degree in physics, they deliver 43 per cent. of the curriculum time for GCSE physics with the rest supplied mainly by those with a chemistry degree or those with an initial teacher training specialism in science.

	<p pid="b.499W.2/37">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;5.8 billion this year and will rise further to over &pound;6.3 billion by 2007-08. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary classrooms where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.499W.2/38">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short-term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short-term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.501W.6/1">Under project licence authorities issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, a two year carcinogenicity study would involve a series of regulated procedures forming a single protocol. The regulated procedures in the series would entail the administration of the test substance by one of a number of routes, for example, orally, by injection, through inhalation, or applied to the skin. Each route would be expected to produce only mild, momentary discomfort. Occasional blood samples may also be taken in some cases. The licence authorities require that animals will be humanely killed before any tumours produced during the observation period cause serious adverse effects.

	<p pid="b.502W.5/1">CCTV can be an important tool in the fight against crime and disorder. However, evidence shows that its potential has not been fully realised and that a national strategy is needed. The Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers are undertaking a review of CCTV, to determine how it may be used more effectively in reducing and detecting crime and terrorism. The review's findings will be known in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/2">On the subject of deterrence, some work has already been done. In the recent Home Office evaluation of CCTV (Gill, M., and Spriggs, A. (2005) Assessing the Impact of CCTV.

London: Home Office, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors292.pdf">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors292.pdf</a>), it appears that the likelihood of certain types of offence being committed was affected by the presence of cameras. It is the offences where the offender does a quick target 'risk assessment' that tend to be affected by the presence of CCTV.</p>

	<p pid="b.504W.2/1">The Home Office has not made an assessment of the impact on public perceptions of the recording or reporting of particular crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/2">The British Crime Survey routinely provides information on crimes where the offender was perceived to be under the influence of alcohol, and separately also provides information on people's worry about crime, including violent crime. The BCS does not measure people's perceptions of alcohol-related violence specifically, but does measure people's perceptions of antisocial behaviour including people being drunk or rowdy in public places. This information is routinely published in the annual volume and quarterly updates for 'Crime in England and Wales'.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/3">According to the 2004-05 BCS 16 per cent. of people were very worried about violent crime, and 22 per cent. of the people said that people being drunk or rowdy in public places was a fairly or very big problem in their local area. Based on the 2004-05 BCS victims believed the offender or offenders to be under the influence of alcohol in about half of all violent incidents (48 per cent.). This information is available in the Library, and via Home Office website <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0405.html">http://www. homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/crimeew0405.html</a></p>

	<p pid="b.504W.8/1">Capita do not operate the Criminal Records Bureau. The disclosure service operates as a contract between the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita Business Services based upon a public private partnership agreement. Under this agreement, Capita are required to perform contractually specified Services and to develop, deliver and maintain the technical infrastructure of the disclosure service. This is to enable the Home Office to discharge its responsibilities under part V of the Police Act 1997 and other supporting legislation including the Protection of Children Act, 1999, to make available to approved organisations information regarding the criminal or related background of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.8/2">Other services carried out by the Criminal Records Bureau that are not undertaken by Capita are carried out by civil servants and include the sensitive matching of an applicant's personal details to records held on the Police National Computer (PNC) and other lists held by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.8/3">A contract schedule sets out the service levels for Capita to meet. A further schedule sets out the service credits that apply should Capita fail to meet the agreed service levels. There is provision within this contract for liquidated damages to be charged in the event of late delivery to agreed changes in the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.8/4">In each year since financial year 2001-02, the following payments have been received from Capita for service credits and liquidated damages:</p>

	<p pid="b.504W.8/16">However, as an illustration, between August 2001 and November 2001, liquidated damages were applied due to the delays in launching the disclosure service and some of the associated services.

	<p pid="b.506W.0/13">These cases are clearly regrettable, but represent a very small proportion of cases&mdash;0.025 per cent. of the total number of disclosures issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/14">CRB staff use searching and matching techniques and arrangements approved by police forces. As with the police, when making their decision they must bear in mind that the source of much of the information recorded on the police national computer (PNC) database is provided by the individual concerned at the time of his or her arrest. CRB have to consider that the individual may deliberately choose to give or, in the heat of the moment, may be confused and give incomplete or incorrect information. The CRB is acutely aware of the human consequences of making an incorrect matching decision and does not do so lightly.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/15">There may also be occasions when a person's identity has been stolen or their personal details used when someone else is in contact with the police. It is for these reasons that the CRB must err on the side of caution when an individual has the same or very similar personal details to those of someone who has a criminal record. This is because it is better to be safe than run the risk of letting an inappropriate person through.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/16">When a disclosure is disputed the only safe way to resolve the situation is by asking the applicant to have his or her fingerprints taken at a local police station to help either confirm or overturn the original matching decision. There have been instances where the fingerprinting procedure has confirmed that an individual who has challenged the accuracy or the validity of the conviction information has been subsequently proved to be the owner of that conviction record.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/17">The CRB will always apologise if the original matching decision is later found to be incorrect. In the event of a dispute the CRB notifies the prospective employer who would be aware of the CRB's code of practice that asks them not to take any precipitative action and defer any employment decision until the dispute is resolved. When a disclosure is disputed the CRB will inform all parties that this is the case, including the employer. Where the information contained in the disclosure is found not to relate to the applicant, a fresh disclosure will be issued free-of-charge to both the applicant and the registered body. 90 per cent. of disputes are resolved within 21 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/18">A public consultation exercise was conducted in October 2003 about making greater use of fingerprinting at an earlier stage in the application process and to aid the matching and decision-making procedures. The overwhelming response was not in favour of such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.0/19">It is worth noting that under the previous police checking arrangements, individuals were not able to see the criminal records information disclosed about them. The information would have been passed only to the prospective employer and not to the job applicant and the prospective employer would have had no obligation to pass on the contents of the information to the individual.</p>

	<p pid="b.518W.2/2">The most recent information on the re-offending of juveniles was published in June 2006 as 'Juvenile re-offending: results from the 2004 cohort. Home Office On-Line Report 10/06'. The report is available on line at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/hosb1006.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs06/hosb1006.pdf</a>. This includes re-offending rates for juveniles given custodial sentences.</p>
