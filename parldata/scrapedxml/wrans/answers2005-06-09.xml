	<p pid=".617W.11/1">We continue to develop and implement our wide-ranging road safety strategy. The provisional 2004 casualty figures show we are now over halfway towards our 2010 target of a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured, and over three-quarters towards our 50 per cent. target for children.</p>
	<p pid=".617W.11/2">The first review of the road safety strategy identified that, while we are making good progress toward meeting our overall casualty reduction targets, the number of fatal casualties has levelled off. This is a complex issue, affecting other European countries, and it is receiving in-depth analysis and special focus as we develop the strategy further.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.10/1">Over the past six months the Government of Afghanistan has strengthened its resolve to tackle the problem of opium cultivation and placed greater emphasis on the role of alternative livelihoods in a successful counter-narcotics effort. There is evidence which suggests that figures for poppy planting in 2005 may be lower than they were in 2004. This is good news, but the challenge will be to maintain that trend.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.10/2">In view of this, DFID has increased the amount of its funding allocated to the development of alternative livelihoods. This year, DFID is spending around half its total development assistance budget to Afghanistan on alternative livelihoods (approximately &pound;50 million). In total, the international community is providing over US$300 million in alternative livelihoods assistance across all 34 provinces.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.10/3">We know from experience that development of sustainable alternative livelihoods takes time. Sustained reductions in levels of opium cultivation will ultimately be the measure of the success of our efforts, but on their own the availability of alternative livelihoods will not stop people growing opium. People stop growing opium poppy for a number of reasons, including the impact that interdiction and other law enforcement activities have, as well as the availability of other ways of earning a living. Collectively, the UK Government is helping the Afghans to work out how to co-ordinate these efforts better in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.10/4">Examples of what DFID, working closely with the Government, will provide, in terms of alternative livelihoods opportunities over the next year or so, include: 5.8 million days of work, benefiting 190,000 people and providing a range of essential local infrastructure; agricultural inputs e.g. seeds and fertiliser to at least 36,000 farmers; micro-credit to 125,000 new clients and block grants totalling $40 million to 1,090 democratically elected Community Development Councils for small-scale productive and social infrastructure in villages in the top seven poppy growing provinces.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.5/1">The Government is committed to supporting energy crops. Ministers and officials work closely with other Government Departments on the development of policy. Officials are working closely with farmers, project developers and others to promote the potential of energy crops.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.5/2">Aid is available to establish crops for the production of heat, electricity and transport biofuels, and to develop supply chains for crops for heat and electricity generation. R and D programmes and commissioned reports support the development of current and new energy crops. Funding has been provided for farmers' open days and industry conferences. &pound;66 million has been allocated to develop markets for biomass, including energy crops, in heat and electricity generation. The co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels in conventional power stations is promoted under the Renewables Obligation. The biomass study task force, led by Sir Ben Gill, is working with all stakeholders to identify the barriers to developing biomass heat and electricity and will recommend ways to overcome the problems. The production of transport biofuels is promoted through duty rate cuts and the Government is carrying out a feasibility study on the possible introduction of a renewable transport fuel obligation. A number of companies have indicated that such an obligation would encourage them to build processing plants in this country and to include UK-grown crops as a feedstock.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.5/1">The latest available data from the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) is shown in the table. There is no directly comparable data available for 1997. However, the National Audit Office estimated that of claims closed in 1999&ndash;2000, the average time taken from claim to payment of damages was five and a half years, and the average total time from incident to payment of damages was just over seven years. These figures were for existing liability scheme (ELS) cases. The ELS covers clinical negligence claims made against the national health service in England where the incident in question took place before April 1995. While initially, NHS bodies were responsible for handling and funding lower-value ELS claims themselves, since April 2000 all ELS claims have been handled centrally by the NHSLA.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.3/1">All strategic health authorities (SHAs) have undergone a review of their current eligibility criteria to ensure their legal compliance. New cases are now considered routinely as part of hospital discharge. This ensures that patients are assessed first for continuing care, if they do not meet the criteria they are then considered for national health service-funded nursing care only. Assessments are based on the totality of an individual's physical and mental care needs arising from one or more disability, accident or illness.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.3/2">Where someone is assessed as needing NHS continuing care, the NHS directly provides all the services that the individual has been assessed as requiring. If the individual needs to be in a care home, then the care home fees are paid directly by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.3/3">An amendment to the care home regulations obliges homes to provide a breakdown of their fees. When an individual in a care home receives registered nursing care, therefore, it should be clear to the resident which aspect of their fees relate to registered nursing care, and which to residential care.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.3/4">The Department is currently working closely with stakeholders to produce a national framework for assessment for continuing care due for publication in early 2006. This should result in national eligibility criteria and suitable assessment methodologies for access to NHS continuing care. The Department has a number of representations about the development of a national framework, all of which will be taken into account in its development. In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, we will consult on the official guidance and any legislation required later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.9/2">Before the hepatitis C awareness campaign commenced in June 2004, the Department conducted a market research exercise to determine the level of awareness of hepatitis C, amongst health professionals and the general public. This provided the Department with a benchmark from which the effectiveness of the subsequent awareness campaign, for both health professionals and the general public, could later be measured. It is planned to repeat this once the awareness campaign is better established.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.9/3">In addition, the Department will assess progress on the national outcome indicators as set out in the Department's Hepatitis C Strategy for England, August 2002 and the subsequent &quot;Hepatitis C Action Plan for England, 2004&quot;.

	<p pid=".631W.8/2">In line with &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, most national health service funding is now passed on to local NHS organisations so that they can make decisions about local needs and services. There has been substantial increased investment in the NHS, which includes funding for National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)-recommended treatments.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.8/3">Decisions on funding of treatment for chronic hepatitis C at the local level are therefore a matter for primary care trusts and their local partners. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been asked to ensure that local arrangements are in place to provide appropriate services.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.8/4">In June 2004, the then Secretary of State, John Reid announced plans to achieve better and equal access to NICE-recommended therapies. As part of these proposals, it is intended that information about NICE-recommended drugs prescribed and dispensed in hospitals will be available to the NHS. This will enable SHAs to compare their own uptake of drugs recommended by NICE with the national distribution. Where uptake locally appears to be below average, SHAs will be expected to investigate and take action to overcome the barriers to implementation. This information will also be available to the Healthcare Commission, which has indicated that assessing the implementation of NICE guidance will be one of their key priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".633W.2/1">The safety of the food use of genetically modified MON863 maize has been reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which concluded in April 2004 that it is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human health. The EFSA evaluation included an assessment of a study in rats fed MON863 maize grain. EFSA subsequently examined a critical review of this feeding study and concluded that it did not raise any issues that caused EFSA to revise its opinion. EFSA's conclusion on the food use of MON863 maize has been endorsed by the United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.5/1">Phthalates are a family of chemical substances, with a range of properties. Extensive research into the effects of certain phthalates on both the environment and human health has been carried out at a European level, under the auspices for the European Union's Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EC). Details of the programme can be found on the European Chemicals Bureau website at: <a href="http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/">http://ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/</a>. The United Kingdom has commented upon the detailed risk assessments and ensuing risk reduction strategy for the various phthalates which have been studied.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.5/2">These risk assessments and risk reduction strategies concluded that these phthalates do not pose a risk to the environment or, where a risk was anticipated, adequate control measures were already in place on an EU-wide basis to control the potential risk. As a result, the UK has no current plans to commission research into phthalates as an environmental pollutant but will consider each on a case by case basis where new data come to light.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.5/3">These detailed EU risk assessments have indicated that some phthalate compounds have been shown in animal studies to produce toxic effects on the reproductive system and this has led to European-wide restrictions on their use in consumer products, in order to prevent exposure of young children, as a precaution. However, other phthalates have not shown such effects, despite being adequately investigated for reproductive toxicity.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.5/4">The UK takes the view that phthalates must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where the database is insufficient to complete a risk assessment, it is normally expected that the industry will carry out the required additional research. However, the Government have asked their expert committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, to keep the area of environmental chemicals and reproductive health under review and will consider their advice on the need for additional research in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.3/1">The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl, at Porton Down produces only a small amount of crude botulinum toxin to test detection antibodies. This is not tested on animals.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.3/2">However, Dstl does produce an antitoxin to the seven serotypes of botulinum toxin. This could be used to treat personnel exposed to botulinum toxin in the event of it being used as a biological weapon. This antitoxin is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and has been granted a Special Licence to enable it to be administered under the direction of, and by, medical personnel in the event of an emergency. The Ministry of Defence aims to obtain a full product licence for this antitoxin. Part of the regulated production process involves the use of commercially produced botulinum toxin in an animal model to assess the efficacy of the antitoxin.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.3/3">Under the UK's regulations for the approval of new medicines, an application for a product licence needs to be supported by data from animal studies showing the safety and effectiveness of the anti-toxin. All such animal tests in the UK are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

	<p pid=".643W.9/1">Following the judgments against British Coal in both the vibration white finger and respiratory disease litigations, the High Court ordered the DTI to set up schemes, in agreement with miners' solicitors, to assess compensation for both types of claim. Claims had by then been registered through the Claimants Solicitors Group (the CSG), some of which were sponsored by the main mining unions, the NUM and NACODS. The UDM had also registered a large number of claims directly on behalf of their members, through their dedicated claims handling company, Vendside Ltd. The CSG and the UDM were unable to work together or enter into single arrangements for historical reasons. The legal advice received by the Department was that it was appropriate to enter into separate claims handling arrangements with the CSG and the UDM, provided that the compensation delivered to the claimant under both schemes was the same.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.11/1">Decisions which confirmed occupational group (and therefore liability) were originally taken by claims handlers. From late 2001, disputed Group 3 claims have been investigated by a separate team who have substantial direct mining experience. This team also reviewed all claims which were initially denied to ensure the correct liability decision had been made. I am confident that the significant experience of this team, amounting to some 1,300 years in total, has resulted in sound decisions on liability being made. There are dispute procedures where claimants think otherwise</p>

The Committee has set up a website&mdash;<a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk">www.identitytheft.org.uk</a>&mdash;which explains how to keep personal information safe, how to get help if one is the victim of identity theft, and what is being done to tackle this growing crime.</p>

	<p pid=".658W.5/1">The Government take very seriously the abuse and exploitation of migrant workers. Our strategy for dealing with this problem includes tackling human trafficking as a priority for our presidency of the European Union, strengthening the legislative framework, improving the security of administrative processes governing the entry of migrant workers, increasing enforcement action, and developing closer working between departments responsible for enforcing workplace regulations. We have introduced a new criminal offence of trafficking for the purpose of exploitation, including forced labour, punishable on conviction by a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment. We supported the legislation establishing the Gangmaster Licensing Authority, which will tackle illegal employment practices in the agricultural labour provision sector through statutory licensing. We will also introduce on the spot penalties for employers found to be using illegal migrant workers.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.5/2">The current work permit arrangements include checks to ensure work permit applicants are protected from potentially exploitative employment arrangements, and investigations are carried out where there is intelligence of abuse. We are also improving joint working across departmental boundaries. The Home Office is a key participant in Reflex, the multi-agency initiative created to tackle organised immigration crime, including people smuggling and human trafficking. We will also pilot a joint team in the West Midlands to examine the scope for closer co-operation between workplace enforcement agencies in relation to the use and exploitation of illegal migrant workers.</p>

	<p pid=".659W.0/1">Identity cards will provide a convenient and secure way for individuals to prove their identity and, with their consent, for identity verification checks to be made by a range of potential public and private sector users. The Identity Cards Programme Team have had discussions with a number of public sector organisations including: Cabinet Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs, Department for Education and Skills, Department of Transport, Department of Health, DVLA, Department for Work and Pensions, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Her Majesty's Treasury, Immigration and Nationality Directorate, Criminal Records Bureau, Local Government Association, Northern Ireland Office, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Office for National Statistics, E-Government Unit, Association of Chief Police Officers, Scottish Executive, National Assembly for Wales and United Kingdom Passport Service. The Identity Cards Programme Team has also briefed representatives from the private sector including the banking, utilities, aviation and retail sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.0/2">In all cases, verification checks of cards will not give access to the contents of the database or the details of the biometric. They will simply confirm identity and other relevant details, for example to confirm whether a foreign national is free to take employment.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.0/3">It is too early for any detailed discussions on the locations at which identity checks will be carried out and where they will involve biometric checks.</p>

	<p pid=".662W.5/1">The Government do not believe the new voting arrangements in the EU constitutional treaty represent a significant change in the UK or other member states' powers to pass or block the adoption of legislation. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's commentary on the treaty (Cm. 6459) provides a detailed analysis of the changes in voting rules which would be introduced by the EU constitutional treaty if it were to come into force. In addition, the treaty would give national parliaments a direct say in the EU's law-making procedures for the first time.</p>

These changes can only be made provided that member states support any such proposal unanimously, and that national parliaments have not registered their opposition.

Proposes a mechanism by which the UK Parliament will be able to approve or oppose any proposed change under Article IV-444. Under clause 2, the House of Lords will be given 20 days to provide an opinion on any proposal, after which the House of Commons will debate whether or not to approve the proposal. This mechanism is designed to ensure that the elected chamber has the final judgement on any proposal, but that the view of the House of Lords is able to inform the debate in the Commons.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.11/2">Aspects of the Malaysian Government's recent efforts to curb large-scale illegal immigration, which has had a direct and negative impact on the Malaysian labour market, have given rise to potential human rights concerns. EU Missions in Malaysia are monitoring the situation and have supported the efforts of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to minimise the impact of Malaysia's immigration policies on vulnerable groups. Following assurances from the Malaysian Government, EU Missions and UNHCR have agreed to delay making further representations to see if these assurances will be honoured. Conditions for refugees in detention centres remain a cause for concern, but the Malaysian Government is currently considering recommendations for improvements made by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia. The British high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur continues to take appropriate opportunities to address human rights issues with the Malaysian Government, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

The West Midlands Region has been allocated &pound;379 million of funding for housing for the two years 2006&ndash;08 and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently awaiting Regional Housing Board recommendations as to how and where this should be invested. Once priorities for investment have been established, housing providers will be invited to bid for funding. The number of people in Coventry South who will benefit will depend on which bids are successful.

Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer on <phrase class="date" code="">25 May</phrase> referred to 700 sites currently entered on the register of surplus public sector land which is maintained by English Partnerships. The sites' owners and English Partnerships are currently reviewing all registered sites to assess their development potential. A list of the sites, as at March 2005, can be found on the English Partnerships website at: <a href="http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C9Q4340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf">http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C9Q4 340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".674W.2/2">51 sites on the Register as at March 2005 are situated in the Greater London area. One British Railways Boards (Residuary) Ltd. site at Harefield in the London borough of Hillingdon is located in Ruislip-Northwood. This site is classified as green belt land. An updated list of register sites will be published by English Partnerships towards the end of June 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.2/3">In addition, it was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> that a portfolio of nearly one hundred ex-NHS sites, would be transferred from the Department of Health to English Partnerships. The first tranche of 67 sites transferred on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>. Work is ongoing with partners and local authorities to assess each site to identify how they can contribute to local housing and employment needs. It is estimated that the total portfolio of 96 sites could accommodate up to 15,000 new homes nationally, with at least 5,000 being affordable. This estimate is subject to planning permission for the individual sites, and residential development will not be appropriate on all of the sites.</p>

Local authorities should steer development away from areas at highest risk of flooding when allocating land in plans, and where development does proceed local authorities should ensure it is subject to appropriate precautionary measures. The susceptibility of land to flooding is a material consideration in determining planning applications.

	<p pid=".683W.0/1">Article 45 of the new ED public procurement Directive (2004/18/EC) will apply to the award of all public contracts for goods, works and services which are covered by that Directive. The Directive requires that candidates or tenderers shall normally be excluded where the contracting authorities are aware of relevant convictions, and that the contracting authorities may apply to a so-called competent authority in each member state to obtain further information about the convictions of the companies concerned. The Office of Government Commerce is currently considering, with the Criminal Records Bureau, how this need for information on convictions, via a competent authority, can best be implemented in the UK. This will then be reflected in guidance on Article 45, which will be published before the implementation of the new Directive. Companies which fail to notify contracting authorities about their relevant convictions, in response to questions from such authorities, should be considered for exclusion from future contracts and for breach of any terms and conditions for contracts awarded under the new Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".685W.6/1">We are concerned about all forms of absence from school and have made raising attendance our priority. Attendance levels have risen for the last three years and in 2003&ndash;04 stood at a record high of 93.4 per cent. We continue to work with parents, schools and local authorities to improve attendance.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.6/2">We have put in place a range of measures such as extra support for schools and local authorities from expert advisers and through additional resources. In addition, we are promoting effective practice including national truancy sweeps, and practices such as first day contact with parents and e-registration systems. We have also introduced the 'Fast-track Framework' a system to ensure early identification of attendance problems and a time-limited approach to solving them.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.6/3">Another part of our strategy is to ensure parents play their part in supporting schools by ensuring that their child attends school regularly. The vast majority do so. Where parents are in need of support to fulfil their responsibilities, parenting contracts can provide them with the professional support they need and help them focus on what needs to be done to improve their child's attendance. However, where parents are not unable, but simply unwilling, to fulfil their responsibilities, they face strong measures such as penalty notices, prosecutions and compulsory Parenting Orders.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.6/4">By September 2007, we expect all secondary schools to be working together in collaborations, with funds devolved from their local authorities, to manage support and provision for persistent truants as well as those that are excluded or at risk of exclusion.</p>

Schools play an important part in providing drug education and pastoral support to all pupils and in identifying children and young people vulnerable to drug misuse. Those who require extra help should receive it in school or through a referral to other services. Schools should work closely with their local Drug Action Teams (DATs) to ensure that there is appropriate support in place for young people.</p>

An extensive programme of work to improve behaviour and attendance in schools will have an indirect impact on reducing youth crime rates.</p>

The Food Standards Agency and the Department commissioned People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries) to develop a vocational qualification in school catering following a study on secondary school meals. The study recommended that a basic qualification should be developed which included the basics of nutrition and which would give school cooks the knowledge and skills to deliver a healthier school meals service. People 1st consulted a number of organisations in order to produce a Training Needs Assessment report before developing the qualification. It was clear from their research that the training had to be suitable for the part-time nature of the school catering work force.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.2/2">We are currently working with People 1st, the Food Standards Agency, the Teacher Training Agency, the LSC and the QCA to review and build on the qualifications that are currently available (including full NVQs) to ensure we have a ladder of qualifications, which includes information on nutritional standards where appropriate, and will meet the skills needs of all catering staff.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase> that we will be working with partners to develop an 'Education Outside the Classroom' Manifesto. The majority of schools already offer a range of out of classroom learning that enriches the curriculum, builds confidence and increases skills. The Manifesto will set out a joint commitment that all children should have the opportunity of a wide range of high quality out of classroom learning, including at least one residential experience. It will also seek to encourage schools to partner with other schools and out of classroom learning providers and to encourage parents to take an active interest out of classroom learning. It will set out a range of advice and support, provide information and good practice guidance on health and safety issues and set out priorities for the development of out of classroom learning. We part funded the National Foundation for Educational Research to review outdoor learning research. The report was published last year and showed the benefits of out-of-classroom education. We do not intend to commission further research for this purpose.</p>

Risk management is a statutory requirement that covers staff and pupils on educational premises and offsite on educational visits. &quot;Standards for LEAs in Overseeing Educational Visits&quot; (DfES 2002) sets out the principles of risk assessment, emphasising that schools must strike the right balance, being neither overcautious nor careless.</p>

PFI projects for the provision of schools are delivered through contracts between local authorities and private sector contractors. There are currently 89 such projects with signed contracts, of which 50 have operational status.

	<p pid=".694W.5/1">Real progress has been made since 1997 in tackling poor behaviour in schools. Permanent exclusions are 25 per cent. lower than in 1997 and Ofsted indicate that pupil behaviour is good in most schools. We have made record investments in behaviour support for schools.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/2">We have made it clear that we will not tolerate disruptive behaviour in the classroom and we are committed to backing head teachers' authority where pupils' behaviour warrants exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.5/3">We expect all secondary schools to be working together in collaborations by September 2007, with funds devolved from their local authorities, to manage support and provision for pupils at risk of exclusion, persistent truants and excluded pupils. Evidence from schools already working together in this way shows that they are effective in improving behaviour and reducing the need for exclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".695W.5/1">The Government are determined that schools should undertake only essential administration and that this should be done by the most appropriate staff in the most efficient and effective ways. In particular, we are freeing up teachers' time so that they can concentrate on teaching.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/2">We are developing a new relationship with schools that will halve the time and effort of inspection while focusing it even more closely on improving teaching and learning. We are working in my Department and with external parties which want data from schools to ensure that only essential data is collected, that it is then by sample wherever possible, and that data is collected once only and used many times.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/3">We intend to focus a wide range of work concerned with raising standards through a &quot;single conversation&quot; with a dedicated school improvement partner for every school, leading as far as possible to a single school plan. We are consulting on future funding arrangements for schools that will increase local flexibility and simplify accounting.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/4">We have replaced direct mailings to schools with free on-line ordering, prompted by regular emails setting out what is available. This means schools get only the publications they want, and in just the quantities they need.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/5">Our efficiency targets will increase productive time in schools and will be achieved to a large extent through the effective use of a variety of information and communications technologies (ICT). That is why we continue to invest substantially in ICT in schools and encourage the new and more effective ways of working that ICT enables.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/6">Through the national agreement on raising standards and tackling workload we have made contractual changes that from September will give every teacher 10 per cent. timetabled time for planning, preparation and assessment. Earlier provisions of the agreement mean teachers' obligations to cover for absent colleagues are already greatly reduced and support staff have taken over from teachers a wide range of essential administrative tasks.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.5/7">Crucially, we have set up the implementation review unit comprising heads and other school leaders currently working in successful schools. This is the first ever body with a remit to challenge the Department on every aspect of school policy. Their role is to hold my Department and its agencies accountable for ensuring that policies are practicable and have maximum impact on the achievements and well being of our children through simple and efficient delivery in the frontline.</p>

Total funding includes funding via education formula spending/standard spending assessment and grants allocated at an LEA level. It excludes the pensions transfer to EFS and the Learning and Skills Council, and is in real terms. It should be noted that the information also relates to education funding provision for children aged 3&ndash;10 and 11&ndash;15 rather than that which is allocated to an authority's primary and secondary schools through its school funding formula.</p>

LEAs have a good deal of freedom to decide how to allocate the available resources for education through their funding formulae and under the Financing of Maintained Schools Regulations, it is for each LEA to decide for itself what balance to strike between the relative funding of primary and secondary schools, after consulting its schools and its Schools Forum.</p>

	<p pid=".698W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that schools would receive additional funding to help them transform the quality of school meals. Over the three years 2005&ndash;07 to 2007&ndash;08, all maintained schools in England will receive a share of the &pound;220 million set aside to help local education authorities and schools strengthen their support for healthy eating and to provide better quality food. Of this, &pound;30 million each year will go to schools to help meet transitional costs involved in developing and improving their &quot;whole school&quot; approach to food. &pound;30/50/50 million will go to LEAs to enable them to support schools with this process, with an emphasis on schools in deprived areas and schools starting from a low base. The first call on this money will be helping to deliver the Government's pledge to ensure that schools provide meals with ingredients costing 50p or more in primary schools, and 60p or more in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.5/3">The first instalment of this additional funding will be available to schools and LEAs this autumn. Further details about the distribution of both grants will be announced in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.5/4">We are currently considering how best to capture information about school meals provision, including information about patterns of school meals provision in different local education authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".699W.2/2">Existing guidance and resources support all aspects of food education within the national curriculum as well as a range of extra-curricular activities aimed at developing healthy eating habits.

	<p pid=".699W.2/4">In the next three years, beginning September 2005, &pound;220 million of new grants will be given directly to schools and local education authorities to raise the quality of school meals. We want schools to use those direct grants to develop a coherent 'whole school' approach to food, covering all other aspects of food provision in school as well as using the curriculum to reinforce healthy eating principles. The money could also be used to fund training and/or longer working hours for school cooks.</p>

	<p pid=".699W.5/2">Revenue expenditure figures on the maintenance and improvement of schools are likely to vary from year to year depending on the unique circumstances of a particular LEA. For example, revenue expenditure will increase in years where there have been adverse weather conditions (e.g. repairing storm damage) and is also likely to vary with the number and age of the school buildings within the LEA. Revenue expenditure will also be affected by the amounts of capital expenditure employed at a school. Capital spending in Coventry LEA on school buildings has increased from &pound;6.96 million in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;13.57 million in 2003&ndash;04. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;1,000.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.5/1">There are no plans to introduce this type of system.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/2">From September 2006 we will have in place a revised package of student financial support, which includes for new students, the introduction of a new maintenance grant of &pound;2,700 for those students from low income households. Those in receipt of the full &pound;2,700 maintenance grant and who are paying &pound;3,000 for their tuition fees will be entitled to a minimum non-repayable bursary of &pound;300.00 from their higher education institution, although many institutions will be offering much more. From 2006 students will be able to defer payment of their fees by taking out a non-means tested fee loan, which they will only start repaying once they have finished their studies and are earning over &pound;15,000 per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/3">There are a number of initiatives aimed at stimulating closer links between employers and higher education institutions, including the new Sector Skills Agreements being developed by Sector Skills Councils. They provide an opportunity to look at ways that students can acquire higher level skills, including those from low income households. Other initiatives, including Aimhigher and the expansion of Foundation Degrees, are aimed at raising aspirations and attainments and providing new work based higher education opportunities developed with employers. We have also supported projects that promote and deliver paid secondments, work placements and work experience opportunities for higher education students.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/4">We believe that these measures will assist students from lower income households.</p>

Where schools and LEAs need advice or guidance on implementation of the agreement they should speak in the first instance to the National Remodelling Team and its network of advisors based in LEAs throughout the country.</p>
