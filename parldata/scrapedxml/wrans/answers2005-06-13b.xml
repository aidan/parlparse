We are also working with our G8 partners to tackle corruption, for example through the G8 transparency initiative, which focuses particularly on budget and procurement reform.

	<p pid="b.3W.2/1">In December 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that 700,000 people living in developing countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment for HIV compared to 400,000 in June 2004. Reductions in the prices of antiretroviral combination therapy have been a key element in this increase. Competition from generic versions of HIV drugs has been important in reducing drug prices, along with action by pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices for proprietary medicines. The UK supports the rights, consistent with international agreements on trade and intellectual property, of developing countries to make informed decisions on the purchase and use of generic HIV drugs to meet their treatment needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.4W.2/1">UK foreign aid to Botswana between 1997 and 2003 was worth &pound;28.3 million, either channelled through bilateral aid or multilateral institutions such as the European Union, United Nations and the World Bank. DFID's programmes focused on capacity building and policy development in areas such as animal production and range management, support to civil society and HIV/AIDS. UK aid to Botswana has declined over time owing to DFID's commitment to give 90 per cent. of its bilateral aid to low income countries, with only 10 per cent. going to middle income countries like Botswana. The table gives a breakdown of annual figures up to 2003&ndash;04, the last year for which figures are available.</p>

	<p pid="b.5W.2/1">DFID resources are not spent on direct counter-terrorism measures. Under the International Development Act (2002), development assistance must be used for the purpose of furthering sustainable development in countries outside of the UK or improving the welfare of the population of such countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.2/2">However, DFID's work on poverty reduction indirectly benefits global security. Terrorist leaders can exploit the issue of poverty as a means of mobilising popular support and legitimising their actions. Many of the structural factors that increase the risk of terrorism also matter for development: unmet political and economic aspirations, lack of jobs for skilled labour, weak states and poor governance. DFID support to poverty reduction, good governance, social inclusion and education in many poor countries helps to reduce the risk of terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="b.5W.8/1">The most recent reliable source of data on living standards in Iraq is the Iraq living Conditions Survey 2004&quot; conducted by the Iraqi Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology in April and May 2004. The following information is drawn from this survey which can be found at <a href="http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm">http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/2">Access to clean water in Iraq varies significantly between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, 66 per cent. of households have reliable, safe drinking water; 33 per cent. have access to safe water but the supply is unreliable; and 1 per cent. of urban households are receiving unsafe drinking water. In rural areas, 43 per cent. of Iraqi households have reliable access to safe drinking water, 22 per cent. have access to safe drinking water but the supply is unreliable, and 34 per cent. have access only to unsafe drinking water.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/3">Almost all Iraqi households are connected to an electricity network, with little variance between urban and rural areas. However, only 15 per cent. of households report their electricity supply to be reliable: 85 per cent. of households experienced low voltage supply or a supply of less than 12 hours per day. 31 per cent. of households use a private generator to improve their access to electricity.</p>
	<p pid="b.5W.8/4">DFID has committed over &pound;70 million to infrastructure programmes in southern Iraq which are helping to improve water and electricity supplies for more than 5 million people. DFID is providing advisers to work with the Ministry of Electricity in Baghdad on developing a national energy strategy. Water and electricity projects are also being financed by other donors, including the USA, Japan, the United Nations and the World Bank, as well as from Iraq's own budget.</p>

Co(r)te D'Ivoire's outstanding balance of aid loans owed to the UK amounts to &pound;862,000, which will be cancelled (under RTA) as they fall due.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.2/2">The UK actively supports the progress of eligible countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, for example by supporting development of their debt management capacity under the HIPC Capacity Building Project.

It has appalling human development indicators, reflecting decades of mismanagement and corruption by military dictatorships. The administration of President Obasanjo is now making progress and has developed a good poverty reduction strategy, the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). The UK has doubled the size of our programme from &pound;35 million in 2003&ndash;04 to &pound;70 million this year. We plan to increase it further to &pound;100 million, reflecting the progress being made by the federal Government in starting to tackle poverty and in tackling corruption. The UK has also been supporting the case at for debt relief for Nigeria.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.0/1">DFID's programme is aimed at helping developing countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Both DFID and our partner governments must be accountable for the way we use UK public resources to pursue this aim. We must be fully transparent about the way resources are spent; and we must be accountable for results both to the UK Parliament and public, and to the governments and citizens of our partner countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/2">To ensure transparency of its policies and plans, DFID publishes details of its work in our Annual Departmental Report, and in a wide range of other documents openly available on our website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/3">To ensure our accountability for delivering results, DFID has a clear public service agreement (PSA), which assesses the contribution made by DFID to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. DFID reports twice a year on progress against the PSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/4">To ensure transparency and accountability in the way our resources are spent in partner countries, DFID applies robust programme and financial management, and audit systems, for resources we administer directly. Where DFID provides resources for partner Governments or non-government agencies to use through their own systems, we conduct thorough risk assessments of the robustness of these systems, and work with partners to strengthen these systems where necessary. All DFID projects and programmes are subject to audit&mdash;either by partner Government audit systems, or through independent audit. DFID's overall expenditure is subject to audit by the UK National Audit Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.9W.2/1">The UK Government are committed to the goal of 100 per cent. debt relief for poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We continue to press for the rapid and full implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. This initiative is delivering real benefits to some of the world's poorest countries. To date, over $70 billion in debt relief is being provided to 27 countries, including 23 in Sub-Saharan Africa, reducing their debts by around two-thirds on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.2/2">The UK goes beyond the HIPC Initiative and writes off 100 per cent. of bilateral debts for HIPC countries and holds in trust any debt service payments received from HIPC countries that have not yet qualified for debt relief, to be returned for spending on poverty reduction once they qualify. In addition, the UK has pledged a further $479 million to finance the multilateral institutions' participation in HIPC (HIPC Trust Fund and International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.2/3">Despite the successes of the HIPC initiative, the UK believes that we must go further still. At present, many donors have joined the UK in providing 100 per cent. bilateral relief, but multilateral institutions currently provide relief at around half this level. The UK has therefore launched a major new initiative for relief of 100 per cent. multilateral debt. We have committed to pay our share (10 per cent.) of debt service payments owed to the most concessional lending arms of the World Bank and African Development Bank on behalf of eligible countries, and are lobbying other countries to join us in providing full relief. Canada (paying 4 per cent.) and the Netherlands (2.6 per cent.) have already announced that they will participate. We are also urging the IMF to consider options for financing its share of 100 per cent. relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.2/4">We are extending this multilateral debt relief to all countries that have formally completed the HIPC process and all other IDA-only (i.e. eligible to borrow only from the most concessional lending arm World Bank) low-income countries with suitably strong public expenditure management systems to ensure that the savings are directed towards poverty reduction. 14 Sub-Saharan African countries are currently eligible to benefit from this initiative and will receive multilateral debt relief from the UK of over &pound;340 million through to 2015. More countries will become eligible for assistance as they meet the public financial management eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.2/5">In addition, the UK also actively supports the progress of eligible countries through the HIPC initiative, for example building their debt management capacity with technical assistance under the HIPC capacity building project as well as in-country support for the necessary reforms and poverty reduction planning processes that are essential for achievement of HIPC completion point.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.2/6">Non-HIPC countries that are having difficulties servicing their bilateral debts are able to approach the Paris Club for relief. The Paris Club&mdash;an informal group of official creditors&mdash;assesses countries' debt levels and provides appropriate treatment by postponing, and in some cases reducing, debt service obligations. The UK is currently committed to working through the Paris Club to help find a fair and sustainable solution to Nigeria's debt problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.2/1">The Cotonou partnership agreement, signed in June 2000 between the European Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP), foresees the negotiation of a series of World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatible trading arrangements between the parties&mdash;Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). The Cotonou agreement also states that alternatives should be provided to ACP countries that do not want to join these EPAs with the EU. In any alternative, the ACP countries should receive no worse market access to the EU than their existing situation. The ACP have requested a review of alternatives to take place in 2006, rather than 2004 as anticipated in Cotonou. Since it is the EU that will have to present the alternative options, DFID will work with other UK Government Departments and the European Commission to ensure that alternatives are presented for any countries that do not want to be part of the EPAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.2/2">The primary alternative to EPAs is a reformed generalised system of preferences (GSP), a non-contractual trade arrangement which the EU already offers to all developing countries, not just the ACP. DFID has supported research on the reforms which would be needed to make the GSP a viable alternative to EPAs. This research has been made public to inform negotiators' positions in both the ACP and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.2/3">Another alternative for any ACP country not wishing to sign an EPA, would be to enter into a bilateral free trade agreement with the EU. Although the individual ACP country would have greater scope to tailor the provisions of the agreement to its specific needs, a single country could be in a much weaker negotiating position with the EU than with a regional grouping, as in the case of EPAs.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.5/1">DFID is giving priority to tackling HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe. The country is one of the worst affected in the world, with over 3,000 AIDS-related deaths per week; 25 per cent. of the adult population infected; life expectancy now well below 40 years; and over a million orphans.

	<p pid="b.10W.5/2">DFID is one of the main donors supporting AIDS prevention programmes in Zimbabwe, such as supplying condoms and support for voluntary counselling and testing centres. DFID also supports large-scale home-based care programmes for households affected by AIDS, implemented through NGOs. Through UN and NGO partners, we are developing plans to expand anti-retroviral treatment and support for orphans and vulnerable children. Annual spending on this programme has averaged about &pound;8 million over the past few years. We intend to double this in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="b.11W.9/1">A 24 hour military and civil Search and Rescue (SAR) service around the UK is presently provided by RAF, Royal Navy and Maritime and Coastguard Agency helicopters to assist people in distress. Although the Lynx can be used for SAR if required, it is not designed for that role. This role is undertaken by the larger Sea King which is due to remain in service after the withdrawal of the current Lynx.</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.9/2">Limits on the range, endurance and cabin size of any small helicopter prevent them being the ideal platform for SAR. In the military operational environment however, any passenger carrying helicopter such as the Lynx, Merlin or Chinook can be used to rescue personnel if required. The Apache is not a passenger helicopter and therefore there are no plans to use it for either the civilian SAR or military rescue requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.11W.9/3">Currently the main roles of the Army Lynx are attack, reconnaissance, control of firepower and movement of personnel and equipment. The primary role for the Apache is as an attack platform (anti-tank and ground attack). In addition, if required, it can also carry out the control of firepower (artillery and close air support) and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) tasks that are currently undertaken by the Army Lynx.</p>

	<p pid="b.15W.8/1">During the Government response to the tsunami, DFID and Ministry of Defence officials worked extremely closely and productively on the disaster relief effort, the United Kingdom armed forces providing a range of niche capabilities, including airlift, which achieved much in the affected area. Our guiding principle for this operation and for any such future response is that the armed forces will task the most appropriate assets to meet the requirement, as defined by DFID.</p>
	<p pid="b.15W.8/2">As is routine after any operation, the MOD has conducted a review in order to identify what improvements we could make in any such future operation. DFID has been fully involved in this process. In addition, MOD is fully engaged in the Government's efforts to support reform of the UN and EU humanitarian co-ordination mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid="b.18W.9/1">Operating restrictions have been applied to two Trafalgar Class submarines in the past 12 months. Since September 2004, restrictions applied to the operation of HMS Torbay and HMS Tireless which prevented them from operating at sea, and they have remained in HMNB Devonport. As responsible nuclear submarine operators, the MOD keeps submarine and nuclear safety under continual review. This process identified a theoretical safety concern that potentially weakened the submarine safety justification for these vessels. It was decided that further work should be conducted to restore full confidence in the safety justification before these two submarines returned to normal operation. At no stage did this issue take the form of a fault or defect within these submarines and the decision to limit their operation was in line with the MOD's requirement to maintain the highest safety standards. The relevant further work on HMS Torbay's safety justification is nearing completion and work to support HMS Tireless' safety justification will be carried out as part of the previously programmed maintenance and upgrade period which she has just entered.</p>

	<p pid="b.19W.3/1">Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators, which entered into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May 2005</phrase>, established minimum levels of passenger and third party insurance for almost all aircraft operating within Community airspace. Privately owned and operated classic aircraft are subject to these requirements which, in some cases, have led to an increase in premium because the amount of third party cover needed is greater than was in place on a voluntary basis before the Regulation came into force. The Government are concerned that this increase might prevent some historic aircraft from participating in commemorative events and has made representations to the European Commission to see if the Regulation can be amended to reduce the scope of the cover required without prejudice to people and property on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="b.22W.3/1">Network Rail advises that development of a scheme to enhance the interior of Liverpool Lime Street Station is underway. The current package of works includes the improvement of interchange facilities through the relocation of the taxi pick up point to the Skelhorne street side of the station together with the reconfiguration of the vehicular access and short stay car parking area. This work, costing &pound;1.5 million to be funded by Merseytravel PTE, links into Liverpool's city centre movement strategy which will see a number of alterations to the highway network around the station. It will also free up space at the Lord Nelson street side of the station, allowing the development of improved passenger/retail facilities. This scheme is planned to be ready for Liverpool's tenure as European capital of culture in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.22W.3/2">I understand that Merseytravel and its partners have proposals to further enhance Lime street station as a true gateway to the city by relocating the ticket office and travel centre into Lime street chambers and resurfacing the concourse and platforms.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.2/1">Studies have been carried out which attempt to relate the presence of roadside advertisements and other potential distractions to road accidents. However, it is difficult to derive a direct causal relationship because accidents are relatively infrequent, and often are the result of many factors. The Highways Agency does not allow advertising to be placed on its motorway bridges. The placing of roadside advertising alongside the motorway but sited on private land is a matter for the local planning authorities. If consulted, the Highways Agency assesses the impact and likely safety consequences for each case on its merits and reports its findings to the local planning authority.</p>

The number of police force areas taking part in the programme had increased to 24 in April 2002 and to 36 by the end of 2003.</p>

	<p pid="b.31W.2/1">The Department has issued guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land which balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by EU rules on eligibility of land under the Scheme. The guidance is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities. It specifies that paragliding and hang-gliding events may take place on up to 28 days during the 10-month period that farmers must declare, for SPS payment purposes, that they have the required amount of eligible land at their disposal. In addition, such events may take place at any time during the remaining two months of the year. There is no restriction on individual paragliders and hang-gliders, though payment to the farmer will depend on observance of set cross-compliance conditions, which apply for the whole calendar year.</p>

	<p pid="b.31W.5/1">The 48 hour rule states that animals should be slaughtered within 48 hours of arrival at the slaughterhouse and not within 48 hours of sale. This rule was introduced on the basis of veterinary advice following the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. It strikes a proportionate balance between the need to prevent potential disease spread and the ability of slaughterhouse operators to run their businesses efficiently. The veterinary risk remains unchanged, and therefore there are no proposals to amend the rule.</p>
	<p pid="b.31W.5/2">The rules applicable to a lairage depend upon whether it is within or outside the slaughterhouse as licensed by the Meat Hygiene Service. If within then the lairage is considered as if part of the slaughterhouse. If not then the lairage is considered as if it were any other piece of agricultural land, in which case the rules for moving livestock applicable to such land apply.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.0/1">Figures on the visibility of fly-posters on streets for each local authority are not available from 1997. However, the annual Local Environmental Quality Survey of England, conducted by ENCAMS on behalf of Defra, provides statistics on the extent of fly-posting on a regional basis since 2001&ndash;02. This is a measure of the percentage of sites (covering streets and highways, public open spaces and waterside areas) that have significant levels of fly-posting present, so as to be clearly visible to the public. The statistics for all areas combined show that the percentage of transects with unsatisfactory levels of fly-posting has fallen from 2 per cent. to 1 per cent. nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.0/2">As of April 2005, a new best value performance indicator BV199c has been introduced to measure levels of fly-posting based on the LEQSE methodology. Statistics for each local authority will therefore be available from next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.40W.2/1">Game management has played a significant role in creating and maintaining some of the typical habitats of the uplands, especially in northern England. The major influence has been management for driven grouse shooting, which has taken place for the past 150 years. The areas of such habitat are extensive and of national or international importance for their vegetation and breeding birds. It is noteworthy that some 75 per cent. of our heather moorland are classified as areas of national and international importance for wildlife both plants and animals. However, large areas of the English uplands managed for game (red grouse) designated as SSSI/SAC/SPA, are in unfavourable condition due to past poor management practices such as overgrazing, intensive burning and drainage.</p>

	<p pid="b.41W.2/1">The system of litter abatement orders was reviewed in Defra's Living Places&mdash;Powers, Rights, Responsibilities&quot; consultation published in October 2002. Responses to the consultation indicated that most local authorities are able to negotiate a solution before a litter abatement order is lodged. The principle behind the procedure is sound, but the use and application of litter abatement orders needs to be communicated to residents more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.41W.2/2">The environmental charity, ENCAMS, sponsored by Defra, already provides information for the public on litter abatement orders. Defra is building on this further in its roll-out programme for the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which will include guidance on litter covering both existing and new legislation.</p>

However, the evidence for overcompensation is extensive and includes: a National Audit Office (Wales) study, which concluded both that compensation payments in South Wales were between 50 and 100 per cent. higher than comparable 'free market' values and also that there was a significant overcompensation problem in South West England, and two Defra internal audit studies which also concluded that over-compensation was a significant problem in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.41W.8/2">Furthermore, a separate report by the University of Reading concluded that a significant number of beef farms, and some dairy farms, showed a net financial benefit associated with their TB breakdown.

	<p pid="b.42W.8/1">The Department's guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by EU rules on eligibility of land under the scheme. It is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities and was originally drawn up following discussions with representatives of the agricultural industry. Following representations from motor sports interests the guidance has recently been updated with motor sports moving to section B from section C.</p>

It will take into account the fact that there are already a number of policy levers designed to drive the management of waste up the hierarchy. The outcome of the review will feed into the wider review of Waste Strategy 2000 which is also taking place in 2005, consistently with that Strategy's monitoring arrangements.

The grant is intended to underpin core funding, helping to put in place new and more efficient ways to reduce waste and increase recycling and diversion from landfill. Through the private finance initiative (PFI), credits worth &pound;355 million have been made available in the three years to 2005&ndash;06 as an extra source of funding, with a further &pound;535 million available in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.9/6">Alongside the additional funding, we are providing increased support to local authorities through a number of organisations who can offer both advice and funding. The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) has devoted over &pound;150 million over the three years to 2005&ndash;06 to strategic measures helping authorities to divert waste from landfill. It includes a Local Authority Support Unit aimed specifically at assisting local authorities to reach their targets and manage waste in a more sustainable fashion. The unit is providing help, where appropriate, in the form of best practice guidance, practical support and consultancy advice, including public awareness and education programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.9/7">On a national basis, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is a not-for-profit company supported by funding from Defra, the Department for Trade and Industry and the devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is working to promote sustainable waste management by creating stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products. It also runs the Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team which is available to all local authorities in England to provide support and advice on the separate collection of dry recyclables and organic wastes.</p>
	<p pid="b.45W.9/8">We are also engaging with the poorest performing local authorities, which has included meetings with the Minister of State for some of them, to ensure they receive the right support. If authorities continue to demonstrate no commitment to improvement the Secretary of State will use&mdash;as a last resort&mdash;the formal intervention powers under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999.</p>

This will help support around 2,400 applicants over the period.</p>

	<p pid="b.75W.12/1">Following the judgments against British Coal in both the Vibration White Finger and respiratory disease litigations, the High Court ordered the DTI to set up schemes, in agreement with miners' solicitors, to assess compensation for both types of claim. Claims had by then been registered through the Claimants Solicitors Group (the CSG), some of which were sponsored by the main mining unions, the NUM and NACODS. The UDM had also registered a large number of claims directly on behalf of their members, through their dedicated claims handling company, Vendside Limited. The CSG and the UDM were unable to work together or enter into single arrangements for historical reasons. The legal advice received by the Department was that it was appropriate to enter into separate claims handling arrangements with the CSG and the UDM, provided that the compensation delivered to the claimant under both schemes was the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.2/1">As set out in the White Paper Our Energy Future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot; published in February 2003, the Government believes that allowing the free operation of a competitive UK market, within an appropriate regulatory framework, is the most efficient way to ensure security of gas supply. Commercial operators have every incentive to ensure diverse sources of gas, supply routes and entry points so as to reduce the risks arising from supply interruption from any one source. The current UK gas market arrangements are already delivering a number of competing gas import projects, potentially delivering gas from such diverse sources as Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia, Algeria, Qatar, and other Liquefied Natural Gas exporters.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.2/2">We also engage with key producers, both bilaterally and multilaterally, including those in the middle east and the former Soviet Union. For example, the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue encompasses discussion across all energy sectors. We believe that action with Russia to improve energy efficiency in both extraction and use of energy could have a major impact on the amount of oil and gas available for export. This would benefit the EU's security of supply but would also have a very positive effect on the Russian economy and environment. During our EU presidency we aim to re-invigorate the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue to promote investment energy efficiency, network development and energy trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.2/3">An important part of our engagement with energy producing and transit countries is through the multilateral Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), which promotes the rule of law in energy trade, investment and transit between its contracting parties and thereby improves security of energy supply. ECT signatories comprise all of Europe, all the former Soviet Union and others. Since 1999 members have been negotiating a Protocol intended to supplement existing ECT provisions on energy transit by offering negotiated access to pipelines and grids. However, differences between the EU and Russia on key outstanding issues have prevented the Transit Protocol from being concluded. As part of our EU presidency union, the UK will work closely with all relevant parties to try to conclude the Transit Protocol negotiations, although success remains dependent on the EU and Russia being able to resolve their differences.</p>

	<p pid="b.83W.2/1">Security measures are the responsibility of those licensed to run nuclear installations. The licensees bear the cost of these security measures. For those sites for which the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency is responsible, these costs are included in the lifecycle baselines prepared by each site. These are updated annually and summaries posted on the NDA website. The 2005 summaries will appear on the website in November. Security is regulated under the Nuclear Installations Security Regulations 2003 (NISR2003), implemented by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security; the Security Regulator. NISR2003 will cease to apply, and cease to be appropriately enforced, only when an installation no longer requires to be licensed. In practical terms this means that strict security compliance will be required for the lifetime of each nuclear installation. As to what measures are in place, it is not Government policy to discuss the details of security measures at nuclear installations, as this information could potentially be of use to terrorists.</p>

Based upon sample analyses, it is estimated that a further 5 per cent. of prescription items are partly paid for by pre-payment certificates (PPCs), which allow the patient to obtain as many prescription items as necessary during the four or 12-month validity of the certificate for a set fee. Consequently, about 89 per cent. of health service prescription items are dispensed free of charge to patients. Estimated figures for the latter two categories are calculated as follows:</p>

Our aim is to secure a radio system that meets the needs of the FRS and provides value for money for the taxpayer. The imperative is to run a fair and open competition under EU procurement procedures. Some &pound;9 million has been spent on work to replace high risk items of brigades current radio systems to ensure that they continue to be operationally effective until they can be replaced by Firelink. Cost information relating to the main procurement is commercially sensitive.

Rape and forced marriage are both prohibited by Afghanistan's obligations under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, both of which Afghanistan has ratified.

Though not legally binding, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union is a recent and high profile political statement of the rights, freedoms and principles applicable in the EU and as such have since its adoption in 2000 been referred to frequently by litigants, and by the Advocates General and the CFI.</p>

A detailed analysis of the extent to which the judges or the Advocates General relied on the charter in reaching their conclusions on the merits of the case could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

The presidency sought assurances that measures would be taken to protect the people concerned. The British embassy also hosted a meeting between Justice and Peace and the diplomatic corps shortly after the threats became public to demonstrate support for Justice and Peace. We regularly raise specific human rights cases, either unilaterally or as part of the EU, with the Colombian authorities. We also urge the Colombian Government to implement the recommendations arising from successive annual reports from the Colombia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and have offered our assistance to achieve this.</p>

As set out in the September 2004 White Paper on the EU Constitutional Treaty (Cm 6309), the Government are happy with the new mechanism which provides a reasonable balance between passing and blocking legislation. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Commentary on the Treaty (Cm 6459) provides a detailed analysis in the changes in voting rules which would be introduced by the EU Constitutional Treaty.</p>

	<p pid="b.134W.8/1">The Government do not hold such information. The most useful information on this subject is available from the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). Member states are required to report cases of irregularities, including possible fraud, to OLAF. The Commission publishes the resulting figures in its annual Fight Against Fraud&quot; report. These figures include cases of suspected fraud, but OLAF has not until now published separate figures for fraud. The figures for irregularities for 2003 and the previous four years can be found in the annex to the latest report (COM (2004) 573 final, <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-30">30 August 2004</phrase>), available at: <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2003/en.pdf">http://europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2003/en.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.134W.8/2">We expect the report covering 2004 to be published later this year&mdash;probably in August&mdash;and we understand that this will include an analysis of the extent of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.8/3">The Government takes all instances of fraud or suspected fraud very seriously, and continually presses the Commission and other member states to take effective anti-fraud measures to protect the EU budgets, in line with their treaty obligations. Although the Commission has overall responsibility for EU budget implementation, over 80 per cent. of the budget is managed by member states. They, and not the EC institutions, are responsible for any irregularities or fraud occurring in the part of the budget that they administer.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.8/4">The European Commission has carried out reforms during the past few years which are intended to reduce and prevent fraud. The current financial regulation, which governs all transactions entered into by the European institutions, defines accountability, ensures stringent audit requirements and a modernised accounting system, and requires all spending to be subject to objective-setting and evaluation. The new EC staff regulation of May 2004 introduced measures to protect whistleblowers. The Commission evaluated the effectiveness of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) thoroughly in 2003 and the European Court of Auditors' report on OLAF, which will further review OLAF's performance and achievements, will be published shortly.</p>

We also condemn the six bombs that have exploded in and around Beirut since mid-March killing four people and injuring over 50. These terrorist attacks are cowardly and cynical attempts to de-stabilise Lebanon. The Lebanese people have repeatedly demonstrated their support for genuine and peaceful democracy.

To this end, we sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1593, referring the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court&mdash;the first such referral by the Security Council.

	<p pid="b.141W.2/1">We remain greatly concerned about the continuing high tensions in eastern Sudan, and thoroughly condemn the recent kidnapping of Government of Sudan officials by rebel movements. We have made clear to the Eastern Front that they should release the hostages immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.141W.2/2">We are pressing all sides to show restraint and negotiate a political settlement, within the framework of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). We understand that the Government of Sudan are currently in talks with the Northern Democratic Alliance, with a view to bringing them into the political process. To this end, the UK is also looking to fund informal consultations between the Government of Sudan and the Eastern Front.</p>

	<p pid="b.142W.5/1">We deplore the ongoing use of rape and sexual violence in Darfur. Such attacks are abhorrent and totally unacceptable. We have made, and continue to make clear to the Government of Sudan that more must be done to provide security for the citizens of Darfur, and that perpetrators of such crimes must be brought to justice. Tackling rape and gender based violence has been a key point at the regular sub-Joint Implementation Mechanism meetings between the international community and the Government of Sudan, which is chaired by the UN. At the most recent meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-29">29 May</phrase>, the international community pressed the Government of Sudan on the need to ensure that those completing medical reports of rape were not themselves considered to be carrying out criminal acts, such as falsifying information or not following 'due process' in obtaining a police report first, and on better judicial processing of rape cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.142W.5/2">The UK has contributed over &pound;66 million towards the Darfur crisis since September 2003, including &pound;500,000 towards the International Rescue Committee's Darfur programme, and &pound;2.1 million towards Me&quot;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res' health programme. These both contain components to tackle such gender-based violence. We are also providing more than &pound;20 million towards the African Union (AU) mission to improve security in Darfur. The AU is increasingly co-ordinating its patrols to provide protection for women when they leave Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Where this is happening the number of reported rapes have decreased significantly, and we are encouraging the AU to increase this practice.</p>

We also asked Mr.Moran to urge the authorities for unrestricted access to Andizhan for the international community, including organisations like the UN High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The UK's proactive stance was instrumental in the authorities' decision to organise a visit to the region on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-18">18 May 2005</phrase> by diplomats, members of international organisations and the world's media. Although highly orchestrated by the Uzbek authorities, this visit was an important first step towards securing the necessary transparency into the events of 13&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-14">14 May 2005</phrase> in Andizhan (Andijan).</p>

	<p pid="b.143W.11/4">In the aftermath of Andizhan (Andijan), we are concerned by reports of the arrest and harassment of eyewitnesses, independent journalists and human rights activists. Mr. Moran conveyed this point in a meeting between EU ambassadors and Foreign Minister Ganiev on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June 2005</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase> our embassy delivered a note to the Uzbek authorities, registering our concern at the arrest of Saidjahon Zainabuddinov, the head of the 'appeal' human rights NGO.</p>
	<p pid="b.143W.11/5">We will continue to insist, with our partners in the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO, that the Uzbek Government accept an independent investigation.

	<p pid="b.150W.3/2">At the Association of Chief Police Officers' conference on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear that he did not believe that the current structure of 43 forces was the most efficient and effective arrangement for organising policing in England and Wales. He also made clear that he had no blueprint for force amalgamations, but that the initiative for such amalgamations should ideally be driven locally. To inform the way forward, my right hon. Friend has commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine the issue of force structures. As well as looking at the case for structural changes, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will also be examining the case for greater collaboration and co-operation between forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.154W.2/2">In accordance with this, we are committed to working with the police and other partners at national and local level so that, by 2008 every area in England and Wales, rural as well as urban, will benefit from visible and responsive neighbourhood policing teams. The dedicated teams will be led by police officers and involve special constables, community support officers, volunteers and neighbourhood wardens among others.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.2/3">In addition, the Rural Policing Fund was introduced part way through 2000&ndash;01, when &pound;15 million was made available to enhance the policing service in rural areas at no cost to the metropolitan forces. The fund is currently &pound;30 million per annum benefiting 31 forces. This fund enables rural forces to focus on local crime hot-spots and provide a physical presence to deter criminals and troublemakers.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.2/4">In terms of fear of crime, whilst it is statistically lower in rural areas, the impact of crime can be greater in small communities, particularly among older people. Comparative statistics between older residents still however produce lower fear of crime rates in rural areas than urban. Work to reduce further the fear of crime is a key component of the Home Office's public service agreement which looks to increase confidence in the Criminal Justice System and reduce antisocial behaviour and the fear of crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.155W.11/1">There are no plans to publish the confidential policy advice contained in the strategy unit report on drugs. The Government have a comprehensive and balanced drug strategy which we launched in 1998 and updated in 2002. It sets out the range of policies and interventions to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs by 2008. We have achieved a great deal across the strategy. Class A drug use among young people is stable. Where there was once virtually no drug treatment, 154,000 people are now being helped and waiting times are at their lowest ever&mdash;down 75 per cent. since December 2001. Where previously little attempt was made to break the link between drugs and crime, there is now the Drug Interventions Programme doing just that. Crime is falling, and falling faster in areas operating the programme, with over 1,950 drug-misusing offenders entering treatment in April 2005&mdash; the highest number since the programme began. And where in the past communities felt helpless against the problems of drugs there is now a coordinated approach backed by powers such as the ability to close crack houses quickly and seal them for up to six months.</p>

	<p pid="b.158W.2/1">The ID card scheme is being designed to help support civil liberty and human rights by fostering a more inclusive society and allowing people to feel part of the community by easily demonstrating their identity and entitlement to reside in the UK, whatever their heritage. There will be very strong controls in place, including full auditing of all on-line checks to deter abuse of the scheme and ensure that any complaints can be fully investigated. The Register will be designed in such a way to ensure that data is stored in a highly secure manner. In addition, the design of the scheme will ensure compliance with legislation such as, among others, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 &amp; 2005, the Race Relations Act 1976 &amp; 2004 and the Gender Recognition Act 2004. The Government published their response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights interim report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-08">8 February 2005</phrase> which explains in detail why the scheme is in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.2/2">The issuing of some form of identifying document to all residents does not seem to me to be objectionable in principle, nor does the right to private life guaranteed by the Article eight of the Convention preclude it. I carry an identity card myself and find it more useful than annoying.</p>
	<p pid="b.158W.2/3">The information which may be recorded on the National Identity Register is strictly limited by Schedule one of the Identity Cards Bill, and only Parliament would be able to change the information to be held. Unauthorised disclosure or modification of information held on the Register is subject to a criminal offence under clauses 29 &amp; 31 of the Bill. The vast majority of checks on the Register will be made with the consent of the individual under clause 14 of the Identity Cards Bill. There are provisions for accrediting authorised users of the verification service. Even with an individual's consent, this clause only allows a limited amount of information from the Register, for example name, address, date of birth, residential status and status of the card, to be verified. Compulsion to carry the card is strictly prohibited in the Bill and clause 18 precludes any organisation from requiring the production of an ID card as sole proof of identity before the move to compulsion (so called compulsion by the 'back door'). Clause 15 only allows regulations to be made establishing a requirement to make use of the ID cards scheme a condition of provision of public services which have to be provided free of charge or social security payments should the scheme become compulsory. For all types of public services identity checks, rules need to be approved by Parliament on a case by case basis. Circumstances where information can be provided without consent are strictly regulated, as outlined in Clauses 19&ndash;23 of the Bill. Organisations which can be provided with information are listed on the face of the Bill and any changes will require Parliament's approval. There will be independent oversight of the ID cards scheme&mdash;including how the scheme is used&mdash;by the National Identity Scheme Commissioner set up by the Bill and by existing Commissioners such as the Information Commissioner and the Intelligence Services Commissioner.</p>

Parliament must agree the rules under which such information would be provided without consent. The whole of a person's record may be provided to the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency provided it is for the purpose of the carrying out of their functions. The police, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and Government Departments, including Northern Ireland Departments which have been specifically approved by Parliament, may only be provided with the whole of an individual's record for purposes connected with the prevention or detection of serious crime. Any other public authorities approved by Parliament to be provided with information without consent, may be provided with such information for purposes connected with the carrying out of any prescribed functions of that department, or of a Minister in charge of it.

	<p pid="b.167W.5/1">Best Value legislation was introduced in 1999 by virtue of Section 1(1 )<i>(d)</i> of the Local Government Act 1999. The legislation put a statutory responsibility upon police authorities to achieve continuous improvement through application of the Best Value approach, carrying out structured Best Value Reviews (BVRs) of all aspects of police service delivery. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has conducted a significant number of inspections of BVRs each year since the introduction of Best Value. All HMIC Inspection reports and recommendations to police forces and authorities have been published on the HMIC website. A report summarising the work carried out and identified good practice has been submitted to the Police Minister on an annual basis. To the best of HMIC's knowledge, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of the overall impact of Best Value legislation within policing therefore it is difficult to fully quantify the direct benefits to the Police Service or whether the legislation has significantly improved or increased the bureaucratic burden on police forces and police authorities. HMIC has an expectation forces and police authorities should be proactive in securing continuous improvement giving due regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Best Value is one of the many tools that is considered within this process and HMIC has worked with the Service to ensure that, wherever possible, the full benefits of the approach are realised while avoiding the potential downside of excessive bureaucracy.</p>

Key elements of the reform programme include: ensuring every community in England and Wales benefits from neighbourhood policing by 2008; building a stronger customer service culture within the service; strengthened accountability arrangements and a greater role for local people in determining how their communities are policed; further reductions in bureaucracy; ensuring greater national consistency on issues such as IT; consideration of whether we have the right policing structures to meet present and future challenges; and further modernisation of the workforce to enable the service to deliver these changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.171W.5/2">Gloucestershire Race Equality Council (REC) was unsuccessful in its application for funding for this year from the Commission for Racial Equality's Getting Results grant programme. However the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is planning to build the capacity of the voluntary and community sector, including RECs, to deliver local race equality services in the areas of most need. The CRE has set aside &pound;250,000 for this work. I welcome this development and hope it will benefit Gloucester.</p>

	<p pid="b.175W.2/1">A total of &pound;947 million funding has been made available to local authorities in the second phase of the children's centres programme. This comprise of &pound;405,523,772 capital and &pound;542,205,843 revenue. The capital allocation is to contribute to the funding of new children's centre places to be created in phase two, whereas the revenue allocation is to fund both new and existing centres created in phases 1 and 2. Local authorities will develop their children's centres by building on existing provision such as Sure Start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and primary schools which have already benefited from a number of funding streams. The following table sets out the funding allocated to each local authority.</p>

We are addressing very high cost criminal cases in two ways. First, the fundamental legal aid review announced in May 2004, has been examining wider processes on criminal legal aid costs so that better outcomes for those who need publicly funded legal services can be achieved and efficient services delivered for the taxpayer. Second from September 2003 the Legal Services Commission has brought all new eligible very high cost criminal cases under individual case contracts. In these cases all work must be set out in a stage plan in advance, so that the Legal Services Commission can ensure that the work done is proportionate. The Legal Services Commission calculates that during 2003&ndash;04 savings of around &pound;26.5 million were achieved.</p>

	<p pid="b.185W.11/1">We have set up Building Schools for the Future to change the 'patch and mend' approach to the school repair backlog, which unfortunately built up over many decades of underinvestment. Repair backlog was not a criterion for choosing projects. But local authorities were asked to reflect repair backlog at their schools in their proposals for wave 1 and expressions of interest for waves 2 and 3. This information fed into our allocations to each project. We expect each local authority to carry out options appraisals to decide how best to address the condition and other issues at each school, and to invest appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.11/2">Assuming that spending reviews continue in the current pattern, we intend to announce two further waves of investment after each spending review. So, for example, waves four and five would be announced in late 2006, waves 6 and 7 in 2008, and so on. Our planning assumption is that local authorities will submit education visions for agreement within three months of a project starting.</p>

Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.3/2">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence', the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.

	<p pid="b.187W.6/1">We are continuing to develop CAFCASS's role as a key contributor to the Government's work to improve the support available to children and families. In particular, the Green Paper Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&quot;, published in July 2004, and the subsequent Next Steps&quot; document, published in January 2005, set out a major change of approach for CAFCASS practitioners working with families, by moving their work away from report writing to a more active, problem-solving role in facilitating agreement between parents over contact and residence arrangements in the best interests of their children. The Children (Contact) and Adoption Bill will underpin this new role, by giving CAFCASS a clear part to play in facilitating contact and monitoring contact orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.6/2">This shift in the nature of CAFCASS's work closely reflects the view of the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee, in its March 2005 report on Family Justice, which recommended an emphasis on 'overcoming problems' in CAFCASS interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.6/3">In addition, CAFCASS is currently undergoing internal restructuring in order further to renew and strengthen its operational front-line focus for all aspects of its work with children and families.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.2/1">The impact of delay on the welfare of children and their families is a concern for all of the agencies involved in family proceedings and we are concentrating on addressing the causes of delay. It is also a top priority for CAFCASS and, together with the Department for Constitutional Affairs, we are working closely with CAFCASS, the judiciary, local authority social services and others in order to reduce delays in Public Law Children Act 1989 cases (cases that involve social services&mdash;mainly care proceedings and adoptions).</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/2">CAFCASS itself is making progress in this area. For example, for the CAFCASS Key Performance Indicator Target for 98 per cent. of public law work to be allocated within 28 days, 93.5 per cent. was achieved in March 2005, compared with 90.6 per cent. in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/3">Progress is also being made in Private Law work (mainly disputes between separating parents over contact and residence arrangements for their children). CAFCASS has a Private Law Key Performance Indicator Target, where the number of reports unallocated less than 10 weeks before court filing date for the month should be no more than the target of 4 per cent. of the workload. In March 2005 2.0 per cent. of cases were unallocated, compared with 3.2. per cent. in March 2004. There is an expectation that private law reports are completed within 10 to 12 weeks of the date of request being made to CAFCASS. CAFCASS also have managed unallocated&quot; cases where the court has agreed a filing time later than the standard 10 to 12 weeks. In March 2005 10.8 per cent. of cases were managed unallocated&quot;, compared with 15.5 per cent. in March 2004. The CAFCASS waiting list is continuously reviewed and re-prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.2/4">A change in the role of CAFCASS practitioners willalso contribute to reducing court delay in Private Law cases. The Green Paper Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&quot;, published in July 2004, and the subsequent Next Steps&quot; document, published in January 2005, set out a major change of approach for CAFCASS practitioners working with families, by moving their work away from report writing to a more active, problem-solving role in facilitating agreement between parents over contact and residence arrangements in the best interests of their children.</p>

It does, however, ask local authorities to collect statistical data about all allegations of abuse made against teachers and other education staff.

	<p pid="b.193W.2/1">The Education Act 2005 requires local authorities to hold a competition whenever they plan to establish a new secondary school, including a school which is replacing one or more existing schools. This means that if a school is closed, and a new school established in its place, the local authority must invite potential providers to bring forward proposals. A local authority or potential provider may apply to the Secretary of State to publish proposals for a new school without a competition in exceptional circumstances, for example where it is intended to replace a weak or failing school as part of a collaborative restart. In considering such an application, the Secretary of State would have regard to the extent to which the local authority or independent provider's proposals would contribute to the quality and diversity of provision in the area.</p>

The Government intend to enable primary schools to acquire foundation status more easily, and we will set out our detailed proposals in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.214W.2/1">The responsibility for maintaining adequate and appropriate school provision rests with local authorities and Ministers have no direct involvement in decisions to reorganise schools. The Government introduced statutory procedures under the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998 to ensure that the views of local people, and those directly affected by school organisational changes, are heard. These procedures include a requirement on local authorities to consult locally and publish statutory proposals should they wish to proceed with closure, or other significant change to education provision. School Organisation Committees are independent of local authorities and Ministers, and take decisions about school closures when local objections to statutory proposals have been made. I understand that Education Leeds is currently consulting on proposals to reorganise primary school provision across the area and that further decisions will be necessary from the Council's Executive Board before the question of issuing statutory notices arises.</p>

	<p pid="b.214W.5/1">In his March 2005 Budget, the Chancellor announced that in 2008&ndash;09, an additional &pound;150 million of capital will be provided to renew primary school buildings in England, which will rise to &pound;500 million in 2009&ndash;10. This funding is additional to the annual investment in schools of &pound;6.3 billion which we will provide by 2006&ndash;07, and is to support our aim of rebuilding or renewing up to half of all primary schools in England in around 15 years from then.</p>
	<p pid="b.214W.5/2">I am still considering this programme, including issues such as criteria, and I aim to announce further details later this year. This new investment should transform primary schools, renew decayed and unsuitable buildings, and provide the wrap-around and extended school provision for our children that is at the heart of Every Child Matters&quot;. Like Building Schools for the Future, our primary schools programme will drive reform of the primary system and improvements in educational standards, provide good places for teachers to teach and pupils to learn, which are used by the community, and which are well designed and built on time and at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer.</p>

It will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to acquire foundation status, taking into account the views of parents and other stakeholders.

	<p pid="b.217W.8/1">The Government are investing &pound;5.5billion in 2005&ndash;06, rising to &pound;6.3 billion in 2007&ndash;08 to improve school buildings. This will include &pound;1 billion allocated directly to schools for their priority needs. Decisions on how to prioritise investment are made locally through the asset management planning process, which should reflect government aims as well as local needs. The Building Schools for the Future programme aims to bring all secondary schools to 21st century standard, including kitchen and dining facilities. Additional funding of &pound;650 million for primary schools has already been announced for 2008&ndash;09 and 2009&ndash;10, and further details of this programme will be announced later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.8/2">Every school is allocated money to improve its building each year, which can be spent on kitchen and dining facilities. Devolved Formula Capital guidance for 2005&ndash;06 makes clear the priority attached to schools making plans to provide at least one hot meal a day on the premises, and for this to be eaten in reasonable comfort in suitable dining facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.8/3">There are also funds specifically earmarked for the refurbishment of school kitchens in Voluntary Aided (VA) schools. This results from the reform of liabilities and funding arrangements at VA schools in 2002, when their governing bodies took on responsibility for some buildings (including kitchens) which were previously the responsibility of local education authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.8/4">The Secretary of State recently announced that over the three years 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 &pound;220 million new funding grants will be given direct to schools and local education authorities. These grants are part of a wider package to improve the quality of school meals. Decisions on spending these grants will be made at local level, but we have already made clear the importance we attach to school catering staff being given the knowledge and skills they need to deliver a healthier school meals service.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.5/1">An expert panel has been convened to advise the Government on how best to meet their commitment in the Public Health White Paper to improve school food, through the revision of school meals standards. The panel has been asked to produce draft minimum standards to be rolled out to secondary schools from September 2005, with those for primary schools following shortly afterwards. The final version of the standards will become mandatory from September 2006. We are currently considering whether nursery school standards should be similarly revised.</p>

	<p pid="b.220W.11/1">The Department for Education and Skills is currently considering options for taking forward the Government's commitment to support innovation in home to school transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.11/2">A small number of local authorities operate limited yellow bus schemes for home to school transport. The Department for Transport conducted an evaluation of these schemes in 2003, which suggested that well-designed dedicated bus schemes can help reduce car dependency for the journey to school. The Department for Transport has provided &pound;18.7 million to support a large-scale pilot of yellow buses in West Yorkshire. The first phase of this pilot started in autumn 2004, and it will be extended in 2005 and again in 2006. DfT will be working with West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive to evaluate the impact of this large scale pilot.</p>

This transfer is included in the cash terms figures. The principal reason why funding for Haringey is greater than the London average is the high level of deprivation in Haringey.</p>

	<p pid="b.229W.2/1">The National Literacy Strategy, combined with developments in the Foundation Stage, have transformed the nature of teaching, learning and achievement in primary schools over the last seven years. Compared to 1997, around 96,000 more children each year are being helped to reach the expected reading level for their age.</p>
	<p pid="b.229W.2/2">The Strategy have continually evolved to ensure that it benefits from the latest developments in this area, and the time is now right to renew the literacy framework, to accelerate and build on this success. Synthetic phonics is already at the heart of early literacy teaching for every child under the Strategy, and the debate centres not on whether to teach phonics, but how to do so. As part of the renewal of the literacy framework, we have appointed Jim Rose to make recommendations on best practice in the teaching of early reading and synthetic phonics in primary schools and early years settings, covering content and pace of learning. He will also make recommendations on the best support for children with significant literacy difficulties to enable them to catch up with their peers, and the relationship between such targeted intervention programmes with synthetic phonics</p>
	<p pid="b.229W.2/3">Mr. Rose's recommendations will draw on an examination of both academic research and classroom best practice in schools and early years settings, as well as recent reports by the Education and Skills Select Committee, Ofsted and the Clackmannanshire study. He will provide an interim report in November 2005 and make final recommendations early in the new year. Decisions on who will work alongside him as he conducts his review will be made shortly, in agreement with Mr. Rose.</p>

	<p pid="b.230W.8/1">A programme of Initial Teacher Training (ITT) for Citizenship teachers has been running since September 2000 to gradually grow the number of specialists in the subject; over 850 specialists will have been trained by the end of the current academic year. The ITT courses include a component on financial capability. The Department introduced a national programme for certificating effective Continuing Professional Development in PSHE in 2000, which provides the framework for teachers to improve their classroom practice in financial education. The Department is currently piloting a similar programme for citizenship teachers in three centres in England.</p>
