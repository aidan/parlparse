	<p pid="b.1471W.6/1">The Fire and Rescue National Framework sets out the priorities and objectives for all fire and rescue authorities in England, The framework is a statutory guidance document which is laid before Parliament and the current framework is for 2006-08. Within the framework we provide details of any targets set for fire and rescue authorities and for local authorities where they have a fire function e.g. county fire and rescue authorities. Since April 2005 the Government have had a public service agreement target which is:</p>
	<p pid="b.1471W.6/2" class="indent">&quot;By 2010, reduce the number of accidental fire related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. and the number of deliberate fires by 10 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1471W.6/3">Fire and rescue authorities have largely been responsible for delivering this target and the reduction in fire deaths and deliberate fires has already been achieved but this performance must be sustained until 2010 to meet the target in full. Fire and rescue authorities also have an efficiency target to deliver which commenced in April 2005 of &pound;105 million of cashable efficiency savings by 2007-08. Again, fire and rescue authorities are on track to deliver this efficiency target. Further information on these targets and other priorities for the fire and rescue service can be found within the national framework document.</p>

	<p pid="b.1480W.4/1">Operating authorities (OAs), that is, the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards, are required to produce annual Medium Term Plans (MTPs) setting out their proposed flood protection and prevention schemes for the following three years. Each project will include some form of cost benefit analysis and this will form part of the calculation of the priority score for the scheme. A fully detailed cost benefit analysis is only likely to have been undertaken when a scheme comes forward for final approval either internally in the Environment Agency or, historically, by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1480W.4/2">MTPs contain a mixture of schemes, some are well advanced and ready to proceed and others are in the early stages of design. There are many more schemes awaiting funding than are able to be afforded in any one year. The list of schemes in the MTP will be added to as new ones are identified by OAs and may displace others with lower priority scores. There are many schemes in the MTP for which a need can be defined but which have a very low priority score. These are unlikely to receive funding for many years, if at all, but are nevertheless promoted by the OA. These should not be regarded as &quot;cancelled or postponed&quot; because they have never received funding approval and, for this reason, the information is not available in the form requested.</p>

	<p pid="b.1482W.2/1">In 2005, the latest year for which figures have been published, it was estimated that 52.5 million cubic metres of wood raw material equivalent was imported and 8.6 million cubic metres was produced in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.2/2">Exports, including materials produced from both imported and domestically grown timber for use or re-use outside the UK, were 16.5 million cubic metres of wood raw material equivalent, so UK apparent consumption was 44.6 million cubic metres. Imports therefore made up 81 per cent. of apparent consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.2/3">Around one third of the wood products imported to the UK in 2005 were imported as softwood (round and sawn). A further one third were imported as paper, 15 per cent. were imported as wood based panels and 13 per cent. as pulp. Paper (20 per cent.) and recovered paper (57 per cent.) accounted for the majority of exports of wood products from the UK in 2005.</p>

Most infant deaths are preventable through access to basic health services, improved water and sanitation and better nutrition. Improving the health of infants goes hand-in-hand with improving the health of mothers. Levels of infant mortality are reducing in countries like Malawi, Tanzania and Bangladesh where DFID long-term funding is assisting Governments to invest in health workers, increasing access to family planning and skilled birth attendants at delivery, and increasing basic child health services such as immunisation, and treatment for pneumonia and diarrhoeal diseases.</p>

We will do this by addressing the needs of each individual. We will help those already in work to stay in work if they become ill or disabled. We will also provide support to those already without work to help them find the right work for them and we will create the right environment for them to move into and keep a job. The support available includes our successful Pathways to Work programme, new deal for disabled people and a wide range of programmes provided by Jobcentre Plus, which includes Access to Work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1500W.8/1">Our child poverty targets are ambitious and rightly so; when this Government came to power, one in three children were living in poverty. Our labour market polices and the tax credit systems have helped to lift 600,000 children out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1500W.8/2">We know there is much more to do and are committed to meeting the targets. Earlier this year DWP published 'Working for Children', our strategy for parental employment, and this year's Budget included measures which will lift an additional 200,000 children out of poverty. DWP is currently working closely with HM Treasury, the Department for Families, Children and Schools, and other Government Departments on producing a child poverty delivery agreement as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1501W.5/1">We know that women living in families with no one in work are more likely to be living in poverty. All of our labour market policies are gender-neutral although some by their nature help more women than men. As a result of this Government's policies nearly 2 million more women are now employed than there were in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1501W.5/2">However we know there is still more to do. That is why we are piloting New Deal Plus for Lone Parents (NDPLP) in seven areas across the country, including Edmonton. As part of the package of help NDPLP provides, eligible people can claim an In-Work Credit of &pound;40 (&pound;60 in London) a week for up to a year when they move into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1501W.5/3">It is also why we have introduced the Deprived Areas Fund, and are introducing the City Strategy which provides tailored support in some of the most deprived areas of the country to all people in those communities with the greatest barriers to returning to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1501W.5/4">And with a lack of affordable child care being the greatest barrier to getting work for many women we are determined to continue to build on our policies, which, since 1997, have already resulted in a doubling of the number of child care places in England and, with extra help through the tax credit system, have significantly improved affordability. In addition, the London Childcare Affordability Project, which is jointly funded with the Greater London Authority, is testing the effectiveness of providing additional subsidies in the capital, where costs tend to be higher.</p>

	<p pid="b.1502W.5/5" class="indent">This way of working reduces benefit enquiry footfall in our local Jobcentre Plus offices, which means they can then concentrate their efforts in helping customers back to work.</p>

Its twin aims are to use the undergraduates as role models for school pupils and to encourage bright undergraduates into initial teacher training (ITT) by giving them a taste of life in front of a classroom. The Training and Development Agency for Schools, who administer the scheme, are about to carry out an assessment process which will try to ascertain how successful the scheme has been in terms of its twin aims. Data should be available in October 2007. However, previous limited research suggests that around 40 per cent. of participating undergraduates go on to ITT. In recognition of its success, the Treasury will announce on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase> that the scheme will be extended and placements doubled over a three-year period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1508W.3/1">The percentage of 16-year-olds achieving five A*-C GCSE grades or equivalent has risen from 45.1 per cent. in 1997 to 58.1 per cent. In 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/2">Teaching literacy and maths at primary school is the essential foundation for every child's learning. Last year we revised the primary framework for literacy and mathematics for the first time since the national literacy and numeracy strategies were introduced. The revised document embeds best practice in systematic phonics teaching, as recommended by the Rose review, and raises expectations for pupils' progress. For example they are expected to learn their times tables a year earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/3">We have provided schools with significant funding for personalised learning: reaching &pound;900 million this year. This can be used to support small group and one-to-one tuition for those who have fallen behind national expectations in English and maths. The Budget announced further funding sufficient to provide an average of 10 hours of one-to-one tuition in schools for over 300,000 under-attaining pupils a year in both English and mathematics by 2010-11. We have provided schools with guidance and support on how to help pupils who are at risk of falling behind in English and maths through programmes such as Study Plus, which targets pupils who are struggling with English and maths at Key Stage 4 (ages 14 to 16). Changes to the curriculum at KS3 will also, over time, support higher standards of literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.3/4">We know that demonstrating basic competence and the ability to apply practically what they learn in English, maths and ICT is vital to young people's future employability. Competence in functional skills in these areas will be tested as an important part of the new diplomas for 14 to 19-year-olds which are being piloted from September 2008 and will be available nationally from 2013. For students embarking on GCSEs in English, maths and ICT from September 2010, it will also be necessary to demonstrate the appropriate level of functional skills in order to obtain a pass at grades A* to G*. Pilots of functional skills will be taking place in a range of schools and colleges across England from this September, supported by a programme of professional development for teachers to support the necessary changes in teaching and learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1511W.5/1">Where communities are ethnically diverse their schools should aspire to reflect that diversity. However, it is unlawful for schools to take account of a child's ethnic background when allocating places. What is important is that all parents are able to exercise their fundamental right to decide what school they would like their child to attend confident that they will not be discriminated against because of their background. The new school admissions code, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase>, has established a framework to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to attend a good school. In addition, the governing bodies of maintained schools in England have a duty under section 38 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 to promote community cohesion and Ofsted will report on the discharge of this duty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1512W.2/1">We commissioned the Independent Review of the Teaching of Early Reading&mdash;carried out by Jim Rose&mdash;to inform our efforts to improve standards of literacy in primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.2/2">We have revised the primary framework for literacy and mathematics for the first time since the national literacy strategy was introduced in 1998, putting phonics at the heart of the teaching of reading. The renewed framework and associated training are the key vehicle for implementing Jim Rose's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.2/3">To provide further support to teachers we have produced a full, high quality, phonics teaching programme&mdash;'Letters and Sounds'&mdash;which was published on <phrase class="date" code="">30 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.2/4">We are also providing support for children who struggle to learn to read through the Every Child a Reader programme. This three-year, &pound;10 million pilot, funded in partnership with the KPMG Foundation and other charitable and corporate funders, is helping 5,000 six-year-olds with significant literacy difficulties to learn to read. ECAR will be rolled out nationally from 2008-09, benefiting over 30,000 children a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.2/5">Our reforms to the secondary curriculum are designed to support the continued development of functional skills in English, maths and ICT. The curriculum changes proposed by QCA would also create flexibility for teachers to tailor the curriculum to provide extra support for children who are at risk of falling behind in English or maths.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.2/6">In addition to developing literacy skills, we are also taking steps to encourage a broader appreciation of English; for example through our Boys into Books programme, which has made a selection of books likely to appeal to boys available to all secondary schools. We have also worked with the Globe Theatre to develop a podcast to help children to study Much Ado About Nothing.</p>

Functional skills will be embedded in all learning routes, such as apprenticeships and GCSEs, as well as diplomas. This means that young people will need to demonstrate competence in functional skills wherever they work or study.</p>

	<p pid="b.1517W.9/1">Given the complexity of this public health challenge, DCMS shares this target with the Department of Health and with the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/2">The three Departments are working together, through joint cross-departmental programme management arrangements, on six fronts: to change population attitudes towards eating and activity; helping children to be active and eat healthily; supporting targeted local-level obesity interventions in children; raising awareness of the importance of healthy weight to children and parents; working with local partners on delivery; and developing the knowledge base.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/3">My Department's contribution to this programme of work is chiefly through making children and families more physically active via children's play, school sport and community sport; improving children's diet via our work with Ofcom on restricting promotion and advertising to children of foods high in fat, salt and sugar; and our work with the hospitality sector to promote healthier food choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/4">Through the Big Lottery Fund &pound;155 million Play initiative local authorities are able to develop free open access play provision in areas of greatest need in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/5">And on broadcast food promotion we have worked with Ofcom to produce new rules that ban the advertising of high fat, salt and sugar foods in and around all children's programming; on dedicated children's channels; and in programmes of particular appeal to children under the age of 16. Ofcom have also introduced new rules on the content of advertisements targeted at primary school children. These rules ban the use of celebrities and characters licensed from third-parties (such as cartoons), promotional claims (such as free gifts) and health or nutrition claims. Ofcom announced the new rules in February 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/6">The National School Sport Strategy, jointly implemented by DCMS and DCSF, is a key component of a &quot;whole school&quot; programme of addressing obesity. The 2005-06 school sport survey found that overall, 80 per cent. of pupils participate in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. This exceeded the target of 75 per cent. for 2006 and demonstrates a considerable increase from the estimated 25 per cent. in 2002. This target will rise to 85 per cent. by 2008. By 2010 the ambition is to offer all children at least four hours of sport a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.9/7">We are also working with school sports partnerships to increase participation in physical activity by overweight and obese children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1522W.0/2">Where an individual's original asylum claim has been refused, and they provide the Secretary of State with further submissions on that claim, there are four possible outcomes. The Border and Immigration Agency may:</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.0/3" class="indent">grant asylum;</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.0/4" class="indent">recognise there is a fresh claim, against which refusal there is a right of appeal;</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.0/5" class="indent">recognise there is a fresh claim, but certify that claim, the result of which is no right of appeal; or</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.0/6" class="indent">refuse to accept the submissions as a fresh claim and reject as further representations, against which there is no right of appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1522W.0/7">Nobody will be removed before their further submissions have been categorised into one of the above outcomes. To this extent, their case is still 'active'. A failed asylum seeker does not, however, regain asylum seeker 'status' (e.g. for the purposes of support) just because they have put in further submissions. They remain a failed asylum seeker until such time as the Border and Immigration Agency, or the courts, find their further submissions to be significant.</p>

However where travel is necessary such as for commuting staff are encouraged to take up interest-free loans for season tickets. The use of public transport for duty travel is encouraged by restricting on site car parking, and making use of travel websites for information services and to simplify ticketing arrangements. Staff are also informed about local transport initiatives and promotions. Where the location or nature of the work makes the use of public transport impractical for staff, car sharing is encouraged.</p>

	<p pid="b.1528W.6/1">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) collate photo rejections under 47 different headings. The possible reasons for rejection reflect the standards set out in the guidance in the passport application pack. These standards are designed to ensure that when the photograph is scanned onto the passport system a good quality facial biometric is captured.</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.6/2">The most common reasons for rejections are not looking straight at the camera (7.5 per cent. of all rejections), failing to adopt a neutral expression (around 12.5 per cent.), and where the eyes are obscured (17.5 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.6/3">Because of the way in which this data is stored it is not possible to provide a monthly breakdown of all reasons for rejection without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.6/4">Reject rates have settled at around 4-5 per cent. for all applications since the revisions to the standard announced at the end of 2005. The IPS do not keep separate statistics by ethnicity or disability, but are able to waive requirements where a customer is unable to meet them due to disability. There have not been any significant complaints about the current standards impacting unfavourably on disabled or ethnic minority customers, and a wide consultation process was carried out during the formulation of the standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.6/5">Separate statistics are kept for children aged five and under. Photographs for children of this age only need to be a good likeness, with a clear image of the child. Rejection rates for these applications average around 2.5 to 3 per cent. Around 30 per cent. of these are rejected due to the photograph being too light, and the IPS continues to work with the photographic industry to ensure they are able to provide the public with acceptable photographs.</p>

Over the past few years the framework achievement rates have increased dramatically from 24 per cent. in 2001-02 to 59 per cent. so far in 2006-07. Framework completion relates to achievement of elements&mdash;NVQ, technical certificate, key skills and employer rights and responsibilities. Apprentices who do not achieve all elements are not counted as full achievements but may well have completed one or more of the components including a vocational qualification. The LSG does not collect data on all the reasons for non-completion, or circumstances of partial completion, of full apprenticeship frameworks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1532W.2/1">Each year some 18,000 people will leave the armed forces to work in UK civilian companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.2/2">This Department's Skills strategy particularly aims to improve level 2 (equivalent to 5 GCSEs at A*-C) and literacy, language and numeracy skills for all adults. DIUS is working to increase the number of adults succeeding in national qualifications, while reducing barriers to learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.2/3">DIUS works closely with the armed forces on its further education strategy (and also the army basic skills programme). The armed forces provide opportunities for training for all, no matter what was achieved in school or college. The literacy and numeracy standards of all recruits are assessed and those identified with poor skills for life are then given systematic support, so that before they start their vocational training, the minimum standard that all are operating at, is entry level 3 in numeracy and literacy. That support is contextualised, making learning applicable to the workplace, with the target that all have gained at least level 1 qualifications in literacy and numeracy (equivalent to GCSE level at D-G) within four years of joining, with opportunities to then gain vocational qualifications at level 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.2/4">The armed forces train their personnel, with support from DIUS, so that they have transferable skills and nationally recognised vocational qualifications, to enable them to take up a civilian career when they leave service. The armed forces is one of the largest deliverers of apprenticeships in the country, in the past year some 5,500 apprenticeships, nearly 2,500 advanced apprenticeships and over 7,500 stand-alone NVQ or other level 2 qualifications were completed by armed forces personnel. In addition, assistance with resettlement is provided, to ensure personnel are fully prepared for civilian life.</p>

	<p pid="b.1533W.5/1">Employment is known to be a key factor in helping to reduce re-offending. The principal role for my Department is to provide an effective learning and skills service for prisoners, as well as those serving sentences in the community, to improve their skills and employability, and increase their motivation to turn away from crime to become more productive members of society. We will do this by delivering the programme of reform set out in 'Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' (December 2006).</p>
	<p pid="b.1533W.5/2">Seizing new, global opportunities requires a world-class skills base, not only through the expansion of high-end graduate skills but also by raising the skills of the wider adult workforce, including those currently unskilled. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills will lead the work to ensure that the nation has the skilled workforce it needs to compete in the global economy, and that includes developing the skills of those in the prison sector, including the workforce.</p>

	<p pid="b.1535W.6/2">The closest available estimates for bankruptcies among farmers are the numbers of bankruptcy orders made under the category &quot;agriculture and horticulture&quot; according to the Insolvency Trade Classification (ITC). The following table provides the figures for England and Wales, which are available from 1990 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1535W.6/3">Bankruptcies in Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the devolved administrations and, while total bankruptcies could be provided, a breakdown by industry is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1535W.6/4">Bankruptcy statistics are classified regionally according to the locations and areas of responsibility of official receivers' (OR's) offices, each of which covers a number of courts having insolvency jurisdiction, and are not directly comparable with administrative geographies. Statistics broken down by both industry and regionally are not readily available for the period requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1535W.6/5">The Insolvency Trade Classification is not consistent with the Standard Industrial Classification 2003 (SIC2003) which is used to classify businesses, nor is the regional classification in use consistent with standard administrative geographies such as counties and government office regions (GORs). It is not, therefore, possible to provide reliable estimates of the proportions of farmers becoming bankrupt, either at the regional or national level.</p>

Many successor companies to failed companies are formed as a result of legitimate arrangements between the directors and the office holder whereby assets are transferred at proper values. The conduct of the directors is only likely to be called into question where assets have been transferred from the insolvent company to the new company at an undervalue, where the directors have caused the successor company to trade under a name which is for them prohibited by virtue of section 216 Insolvency Act 1986 or where the successor company has failed for the same reasons as its predecessor. Although statistics are not kept to identify the numbers of disqualification orders or disqualification undertakings where the matters of unfitness include one or more of the elements referred to above the Insolvency Service records show that one or more of those matters of unfitness were alleged in seven cases for which disqualification proceedings were authorised in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> and in 18 cases in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>.</p>

It is likely that complaints to the hotline regarding so called &quot;phoenix companies&quot; will be recorded as a complaint under section 216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (reuse of a prohibited name after a certain type of insolvency). It is possible that section 216 may also apply to new businesses run by directors, which are not successor companies to the insolvent company and which cannot therefore be regarded as &quot;phoenix companies&quot;. The number of complaints received by the hotline which specifically relate to section 216 is seven for the period from August 2005 to March 2006, eight for the year to March 2007 and five so far for the current year.

	<p pid="b.1549W.2/1">We are working to ensure that women have access to abortion services as soon as possible as evidence shows that the risk of complications increases the later the gestation. We have invested &pound;8 million to improve early access and set a standard of a maximum waiting time of three weeks. Primary care trusts' performance in this area is being measured as part of the Healthcare Commission's annual healthcheck.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/2">Waiting times for abortion are not available but we consider that gestation at procedure is a good indicator of waiting times. The latest data for 2006 show that progress is being made to increase early access: 65 per cent. of national health service funded abortions took place at under 10 weeks compared with 51 per cent. in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1549W.2/3">Equality of access and more rapid access to abortion services has improved since the introduction of the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy. In 2006, 87 per cent. of abortions were NHS funded, compared with 78 per cent. in 2002. In addition, since 2002 we have collected patients self-reported ethnicity data to monitor access to services by all groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1550W.2/2">The guideline states that professionals involved in abortion services should be equipped to provide women with the information they need, including accurate knowledge about possible complications and sequelae of abortion, in order to give genuinely informed consent. Clinicians caring for women requesting abortion should try to identify those patients who require more support in decision making than can be provided in the routine clinic setting. Facilities for additional support, including access to social services, should be available. Appropriate information and support should be available for those who consider, but do not proceed to, abortion. The guideline also recommends that referral for further counselling should be available for the small minority of women who experience long-term post abortion distress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1562W.8/1">The primary care trust (PCT) sector reported a &pound;633 million gross deficit at the end of 2006-07, which is a &pound;17 million deterioration from the position reported at the end of 2005-06. However, the proportion of PCTs reporting a deficit has reduced from 36 per cent. in 2005-06 to 27 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.8/2">From 2006-07, we have stopped the movement of money round the national health service through brokerage or planned support. As we anticipated, this reform of the NHS financial regime has exposed deficits which might otherwise have remained hidden. As part of the strategy to manage the financial position in their overall economy in 2006-07, strategic health authorities (SHAs) were able to top-slice PCT allocations to create SHA reserves. Although this top-slice may have contributed to the less than 3 per cent. increase in the overall PCT gross deficit, this money is not lost, but held by the SHAs on behalf of the NHS. PCTs are entitled to repayment of their contribution over a reasonable period which should not normally exceed the three-year allocation cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562W.8/3">A clearer measure of PCT financial performance is shown by considering the in-year financial position, as this excludes both the Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) adjustments in respect of prior year performance and the impact of the top-slice of PCT allocations. The in-year deficit of the 55 PCTs that recorded a deficit in 2005-06 was &pound;326 million. This underlying position improved significantly to a &pound;348 million in-year surplus by the end of 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1567W.9/1">Curfew, which is normally monitored electronically, may be imposed as a condition of bail; as a sentence of the court or as a condition of release from prison. Studies suggest that curfew can be more cost effective than custody and may also help in the rehabilitation of offenders. It can also introduce regularity into what are often chaotic lifestyles and can disrupt the pattern of offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.9/2">The Government believe that serious and dangerous offenders should be sent to prison. But where prison is not the right response to offending, a range of tough and demanding community punishments are available to the courts, which can include curfew.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.9/3">The Home Detention Curfew scheme enables short term prisoners to be released up to 135 days before the automatic/conditional release date. The scheme is highly successful: 85 per cent. of those released on the scheme have completed it successfully with only 4 per cent. having re-offended while on HDC.</p>

Public bodies such as the Parole Board have the power under common law to divulge information for the purpose of public protection in certain circumstances. Therefore, no specific statutory power is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/2">Once is it established that such a power exists, those involved in disclosure must ensure that the exercise of the power to disclose is consistent with the legal framework established by the Data Protection Act 1998 (&quot;the DPA&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/3">The DPA does not automatically preclude the Parole Board sharing information on individual offenders with the police and probation services if that is necessary to enable those services to carry out their statutory responsibilities to protect the public. Whether disclosure for these purposes is consistent with the DPA will always depend on the individual circumstances of each case and whether the disclosure is truly necessary by reference to those facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/4">Where sharing of data of the type mentioned above takes place, the police and probation services may, in turn, disclose the information to individuals under their own powers, if it is necessary for them to do so in order to manage the risks posed by offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1568W.2/5">Taking all of the above into account, there are no proposals to amend legislation in respect of the disclosure of personal data as the current state of the law is sufficient to meet the requirements of public protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1574W.5/6">All prisoners undergo health reception screenings on entry into prison. This is a detailed questionnaire completed by health care staff interviewing the prisoner. It is designed to identify any long-term medical conditions, any use of prescribed medication, any history of alcohol or substance dependence, any mental health problems and any symptoms requiring urgent medical attention or indicating a need for review by a medical doctor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.5/7">Health reception screenings do not include a screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or a blood test for HIV infection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.5/8">Tests for STIs or HIV can be offered to prisoners following a risk assessment by a doctor, or other appropriately trained member of the health care team, if a prisoner presents with signs or symptoms of such infections or describes risk behaviour which may have exposed him or her to such infections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.5/9">Prisoners are also able to request a screen for STIs or HIV if they believe that they may have been exposed to infection.</p>
