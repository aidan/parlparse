	<p pid="a.1052W.8/1">Robust data about the library sector are only published annually by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the initial release of provisional data for 2010-11 is to be published later this month. The Department supplements it by monitoring proposals about changes to library services across England through information gathered via correspondence, media coverage and from relevant bodies such as Arts Council England. Many local authorities are still developing and consulting on proposals and consequently the overall picture is always changing. It is therefore not practical to attempt to provide definitive numbers for libraries that have closed or have reduced their opening hours.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053W.7/1">I have not met with either the Charity Commission or the Independent Schools Council since May 2010. However, as Attorney-General I have a number of important public interest functions in respect of charity, some of which overlap with the regulatory powers of the Charity Commission. In consequence, officials from my office are in regular contact with officials from the Charity Commission. This is also true of those officials in the Treasury Solicitor's Department that provide my office with legal advice on policy and litigation support in charity matters. Those officials have not met with the Independent Schools Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.7/2">I am not aware of any meetings between the Charity Commission or the Independent Schools Council and officials of the Crown Prosecution Service, Serious Fraud Office or HM Crown Prosecution Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.7/3">A number of lawyers from the Treasury Solicitor's Department are permanently attached to other Government Departments including the Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Cabinet Office and the Department for Education. These Departments have dealings with the Charity Commission in its role as principal regulator of charities. The Department for Education also has dealings with the Independent Schools Council. I have not considered lawyers attached to these or other Departments as officials of the Law Officer Departments for the purposes of this answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055W.0/1">Earlier this year we consulted on our proposals for the new local audit framework which included a number of proposals that will increase transparency, for example, increasing transparency in the way that auditors are appointed. We proposed that local public bodies would appoint their own auditors from a published register of eligible auditors, taking advice from an independent audit committee. The advice of that independent audit committee would be published (giving regard to commercially confidential material). If the local public body did not follow the independent audit committee's advice as to the auditor that should be appointed, it would be required to publish the reasons why it had departed from that advice. The consultation also included proposals around the transparency of the audit itself, for example continuing the requirements to publish accounts and auditors' reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.1055W.6/1">DCLG's estates' strategy has seen a significant reduction in the size and cost of the DCLG estate. To build on our achievements over the last year the Department plans to consolidate its operations in Eland House. The project will further improve the Department's space efficiency and will &#8216;free-up&#8217; further space that can be sub-let, generating income from additional tenancy receipts. The first phase of this project has commenced and will deliver DCLG further tenancy receipts of &#163;1 million per annum from the end of financial year 2012-13. This part of the project is anticipated to cost &#163;75,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/2">Over the first half of financial year 2011-12 DCLG was responsible for a series of projects relating to the closure of the Government office for the regions and the regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/3">All but one of these were purely staff moves into:</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/4"><i>(a)</i> existing DCLG accommodation making use of existing surplus space from the abolition of the Government office for the regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/5"><i>(b)</i> more efficient and right-sized civil-estate accommodation for smaller teams in existing DCLG locations where lease-break opportunities enabled the surrender of larger, less flexible and more expensive ex-Government office for the regions estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/6"><i>(c)</i> new DCLG occupations in Sheffield, Truro and Exeter to meet the specific business-needs of the European Regional Development Fund teams in these locations. All three are existing buildings on the civil estate and Sheffield and Exeter were purely staff-moves into 'as is' accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/7">The new DCLG office at Lysnoweth House, Truro was the only one of these relocations that required &#8216;fit-out&#8217; work which was done in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs at a cost of &#163;47,000 with all furniture reused from elsewhere in the DCLG estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/8">No other building and refurbishment projects are currently planned in this or financial-year 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/9" class="italic">Note</p>
	<p pid="a.1055W.6/10">Achieving these relocations in Manchester in April 2011, Nottingham July 2011 and Liverpool September 2011 cost DCLG circa &#163;120,000 to complete, but will realise savings of circa &#163;3 million per annum from the start of financial year 2012-13.</p>

The Government have sought views on its proposals and, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-19">19 August</phrase>, published eight technical papers which provide further details on the proposals, together with an interactive calculator. The calculator enables users to explore the possible effects of certain scheme design options based upon their own assumptions about local circumstances.</p>

It is recognised that subsequent inquires could lead to the reporting officer changing his/her opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.6/5">It is important to note that it may be difficult for a police officer, attending the scene after an accident has occurred, to identify certain contributory factors.</p>

Also, our assessments of the number and value of contracts with SMEs are carried out annually and relate to periods running to the end of March. Monthly analysis separately distinguishing the three categories could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

We estimate that, in the same period, approximately 3,550 direct contracts were awarded to large businesses, with a total value of approximately &#163;6,280 million&#8212;values are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.5/1">&#8220;Educating Health Visitors for a Transformed Service&#8221;<sup>(1)</sup> provides guidance for education commissioners and higher education institutions (HEIs), to assist with alignment of health visiting courses with the new service vision for health visiting as set out in the &#8220;Health Visitor Implementation Plan 2011-15: A Call to Action&#8221;. Copies of both documents have already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.5/2">The guidance was produced by the Department, in collaboration with partners, including the Council of Deans, the United Kingdom Standing Conference, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association, and higher education commissioners and institutions. It supports the NMC standards, and serves as a useful framework for education providers seeking to reflect the new vision in their courses.</p>

In order to prevent double provision, these benefits are not provided where the child is formally looked after by the local authority and their accommodation or maintenance is provided from public funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090W.2/3">In addition, statutory .guidance for local authorities on family and friends care was issued in March 2011. In particular, it sets out a requirement on local authorities to develop equitable and transparent policies for delivering effective services to kinship carers across the range of legal arrangements which underpin family and friends care.</p>

These robust &#8220;ranges of true take-up&#8221; account for possible biases that arise in estimating take-up from the available data sources. These ranges also account for the effects of sampling variation (otherwise known as sampling error). Care should be taken when interpreting take-up statistics. For instance, if the upper limit of a caseload take-up range is 90%, this does not necessarily mean that at least 10% never take up their entitlement.

Instead, DFID identifies and scrutinises from the bottom-up the results that UK assistance can achieve against its development objectives in each country and makes allocation decisions accordingly. DFID will continually centrally monitor its performance against its published targets and country operational plans as part of its annual budget cycle and this will drive resource allocation decisions going forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.3/1">Electoral registration is the responsibility of individual Electoral Registration Officers (EROs). Local authorities have a duty to encourage participation in the electoral process and the Electoral Commission promotes public awareness of registration and produces research and reports on electoral registration issues.

	<p pid="a.1099W.3/3">The Government have allocated a total of &#163;108 million to meet the cost of implementing Individual Electoral Registration. This will fund EROs to make contact with each potential elector individually and invite them to register in 2014. It will also fund research to understand the current state of the electoral register and currently under-registered groups in order to ensure that as many people as possible are registered to vote. This year the Government are funding the piloting of 'data matching' of electoral registers against other data sources, such as the National Pupil Database and the Department for Work and Pensions database, to identify possible eligible electors, as well as looking at the ways in which we can make it as easy and secure as possible for citizens to register to vote, such as online registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.0/3">The Government will do everything they can to maintain the completeness of the electoral register during the transition to Individual Registration in Great Britain. This includes learning from the experience in Northern Ireland in formulating our plans for the transition, such as phasing the transition in over two years, allowing electors who do not apply under the new system in 2014 to be carried forward so they retain their vote at the 2015 general election. Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, inquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face to face doorstep canvassers. There will be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission. We are also testing data matching to identify people missing from the register and looking at how we can increase the choices people have over how to register&#8212;including greater use of online registration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.0/4">The Government are also funding research to understand the current state of the electoral register. This will help us to better understand the way in which the move to Individual Electoral Registration will have an impact. Further research will be conducted with currently under-registered groups in order to ensure that as many people as possible are registered to vote, and to assist the transition to Individual Electoral Registration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1104W.2/2">In the US retention of the death penalty is decided at state level and we are therefore working to achieve abolition on a state by state basis.

In the majority of cases we do this in concert with the EU in order to have greater impact.</p>

We have also raised the death penalty through the UN Universal Periodic Review process.

	<p pid="a.1107W.9/2">The UK takes every appropriate opportunity to raise our opposition to Iceland's commercial whaling and its international trade in whale meat, most recently at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.9/3">The UK Government will continue to argue that trade in fin whale meat undermines the credibility of the IWC as an effective organisation for the conservation of whale populations worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.9/4">We have also made clear that for Iceland to join the EU, the UK believes it must accept that its whaling operations are incompatible with membership. All cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are fully protected in European Union waters and we would expect any country applying to join the EU to abide by its laws. We will continue to work with other member states to ensure the effective protection and conservation of whales.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.2/1">The Government are fully committed to promoting and protecting human rights for all individuals, including indigenous people, without discrimination on any grounds. We continue to work overseas and through the UN to improve the situation of indigenous people around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/2">ILO Convention 169 sets out a framework for how governments should act with regard to indigenous and tribal people within their own territories. To date the UK has not ratified the convention as we do not consider that the UK or its overseas territories have any indigenous people to whom it would apply. We are also of the view that the convention does not apply extra-territorially. For these reasons, we would not be able to give effect to the convention. However, following discussions with Survival International, a non-government organisation working to raise the profile of the situation facing many indigenous communities around the world, I have asked officials to look again in detail at our position to reassure ourselves that it is the right one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.2/3">In September 2007 the UN General Assembly adopted the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The declaration outlaws discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them. It also ensures their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own priorities in economic, social and cultural development. The declaration is not legally binding and cannot therefore be ratified by Governments. The UK supported its adoption in 2007 and welcomes the growing support for the declaration, including from countries with significant indigenous populations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1114W.0/1">The overall spending target for the Warm Home Discount Scheme is set out in Schedule 1 of the Warm Home Discount Regulations 2011 (2011/1033) and is &#163;1.1 billion over the four years of the scheme (2011-12 to 2014-15). This represents a significant increase in activity and funding on the 2008-10 voluntary agreement between the six major energy supply companies and Government which was worth &#163;375 million over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/2">2011-12 is the first year of the Warm Home Discount Scheme. Government are working with the energy suppliers to implement the scheme, and expects that around 2 million households will receive direct help this year. Over 600,000 of these will be pensioners in receipt of pension credit guarantee credit only, who will receive an automatic rebate on their electricity bill of &#163;120 this winter. In addition, a 'Broader Group' such as low income families and those with long term illnesses and disabilities may also receive this discount, with &#163;3 million available for Broader Group expenditure in 2011-12. To ensure a smooth transition from the previous Voluntary Agreement, &#163;140 million has been allocated for Legacy Spending in 2011-12, for suppliers to continue to provide discounted and social tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/3">The level of expenditure will increase with each scheme year. The Broader Group expenditure will rise to &#163;47 million in 2012-13, as spending on legacy tariffs decreases, and &#163;90 million in 2014-15. The numbers assisted automatically through the Core Group will also increase in future years as eligibility expands to include those on the savings element of pension credit. Expenditure increases from &#163;97 million in 2011-12 to &#163;l90 million in 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.0/4">Electricity suppliers may provide other rebates or assistance to their customers, but any such expenditure cannot be counted as part of their funding for the Scheme.</p>

DECC's records of procurement card transactions prior to December 2009 were held on a mix of paper and electronic files. It would incur disproportionate cost to search these records.

However, it has some concerns over consumer protection issues and is engaging with suppliers to seek improvement in the clarity of contract terms and protection of consumers' cancellation and switching rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.1116W.5/1">A British Geological Survey study in 2010 estimated that if UK shales were similar to those in the USA they could yield some 150 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to roughly two years' of UK demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.5/2">The BGS is currently undertaking more detailed work which will also take into account the recent drilling results of Cuadrilla in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116W.5/3">However, little drilling has taken place and commercial production of shale gas has not been proven, so it is not yet possible to make a reliable estimate of recoverable reserves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1119W.2/1">The Generic Design Assessment (GDA) is an independent review by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (the Regulators) to ensure that the proposed new nuclear reactor designs for the UK are safe, secure and protect the environment. The regulators publish quarterly progress reports that summarise the progress made to assess and evaluate a comprehensive range of technical areas, including control of reactivity, post trip cooling, containment, severe accident management, and spent fuel storage. The latest quarterly report was published on the ONR website on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase> and mentions, for the first time, the outstanding GDA issues, based on the completion of ONR's planned assessment. All the issues must be cleared to both regulators' satisfaction before ONR grants consent to start construction of reactor buildings at a nuclear licensed site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.2/2">The regulators' assessment, described in the July progress report, excludes any findings from the review conducted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations into the nuclear incident that took place in March 2011 at Fukushima, Japan. This is because the regulators' assessment was completed before this incident. The consequences of the Fukushima incident will be addressed through a separate GDA issue, to which the industry has yet to respond. It will also need clearing to the regulators' satisfaction as one of the suite of identified GDA issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1119W.5/1">The probability of coincident damage to both a nuclear facility and off-site technical support centre is considered remote, given that there is considerable distance between the locations of the reactor sites and the support centres. However, the UK's nuclear emergency response arrangements, which consider the implications for public safety, are kept under review by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with support from the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the multi agency Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.5/2">The on site nuclear emergency response at civil nuclear reactor sites (operational and being decommissioned) is supported by an off-site technical Central Emergency Support Centre. This is many miles away from the nearest sites it supports. In the very unlikely event of coincident damage, the site operators can call upon technical expertise from other locations including their unaffected nuclear sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.5/3">The on-site nuclear emergency response at Sellafield is also supported by an off-site technical centre and a number of remote alternative facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.5/4">However, in the light of the lessons learned from the Fukushima incident, a programme to strengthen the current arrangements is being developed by DECC which will deliver tangible improvements over several years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1120W.2/1">Under the nuclear site licensing regime, licensed operators are legally required to have adequate arrangements in place to deal with a range of on-site accidents or emergencies. This includes the provision of appropriate and adequate training for site personnel. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), which enforces the licensing regime, has produced guidance to assist in ensuring the adequacy of levels of competence and training provision among site staff to respond to a nuclear emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.2/2">Emergency preparedness at nuclear licensed sites is regularly tested through a series of emergency exercises, which are assessed by ONR inspectors, with any lessons learnt communicated to the site operators so that they may be acted upon.

The amount a supplier pays for a ROC is dependent on bilateral negotiations between supplier and generator. Ofgem publish details of the nominal value of a ROC each year.

	<p pid="a.1121W.11/20">The RO does not set funding targets for specific technologies. The number of ROCs onshore wind generators will receive over the next three years will depend on the number of MWh onshore wind stations generate which is dependent, among others, on station's load factors (which vary across the country). Support levels under the RO during the next banding period (2013-17) are currently under review and proposals have been published for consultation on the DECC website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1121W.11/22">The Electricity-Market Reform (EMR) White Paper set out a new support scheme, Feed-in Tariffs with Contracts for Difference (FIT CfD), for all low carbon generation including renewable technologies. The Government intend to legislate for the key elements of the EMR package, including the FIT CfD, through primary legislation in the second session of this Parliament. We intend that this legislation will reach statute books by spring 2013 so that the first low-carbon projects can be supported under its provisions in 2014. These dates are subject to parliamentary time being available and the will of Parliament. Once the FIT CfD is in place new onshore wind generation (which is not eligible for the small scale feed-in tariff) will have a one-off choice between receiving support either under the FIT CfD or under the RO for projects accredited before April 2017</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.11/23">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, feed-in tariffs (FITs) for small scale low carbon electricity generation have been available for onshore wind up to 5 MW. Details on expenditure for the first financial year of the scheme will be available later in the year. A comprehensive review of FITs is currently under way and will be published shortly for consultation.</p>

From the available records on procurement exercises I can say that, since the Cabinet Office announcement in February 2011, no procurement under &#163;100,000 has used a pre-qualification questionnaire. We do not, however, maintain a central record of all contracting activity and cannot, therefore, confirm that PQQs have been eliminated for all contracts with a value below &#163;100,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1127W.0/2">The Government do not hold information on the breakdown of community investment tax relief (CITR) accredited community development finance institutions' (CDFI) wider portfolios and therefore cannot provide the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.0/3">However, no investments can be raised under CITR by CDFIs undertaking solely personal lending (investments attracting CITR must be onward lent to businesses, including social enterprises). CDFIs have reported raising around &#163;83 million under CITR since the scheme began. We believe that approximately &#163;13 million of this has been raised by CDFIs who lend to a wide range of businesses and &#163;69 million by CDFIs specialising in lending to social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.0/4">The Government announced in Budget 2011 their intention to continue the scheme and to this end that they would renotify CITR to the European Commission and consult in advance of renotification on how the scheme can be made more effective.</p>

Additional compliance costs may arise if the Scottish Government seek processes that differ from the SVR, for example introducing a higher degree of transparency in payslips and end of year forms (e.g. P60).

The petition debt level has not been increased since the Insolvency Act first came into force in 1986 and so remains at &#163;750. To be able to threaten someone with bankruptcy for such a small amount is, we believe, disproportionate. The consultation will cover increasing the petition debt level in both personal and corporate cases, which would affect the terms for SMEs.</p>

They will welcome the work undertaken by the European Commission that has been done in identifying areas within the current Recreational Craft Directive that could be improved to provide greater clarity of the obligations imposed by the directive. This will help to reduce undue burdens placed on business (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises), and facilitate cross-border trade. The UK will address those features of the proposal itself that risk being unruly burdensome on the sector and UK operators.

We do not have data to answer how many business mentors were available to provide guidance to businesses prior to the launch of the mentoring portal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146W.0/3">At launch, the portal included approximately 40 mentoring organisations, providing access to around 10,000 mentors and this number continues to grow. Applications from other mentoring organisations who wish to be listed on the portal are currently being screened and more organisations will be added in the coming months as they register interest, providing they meet certain minimum standards. I am determined to maintain the quality of the mentors available through this network and am not willing to compromise this in order to increase the numbers more quickly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.5/1">We do not directly record what type of benefits people are receiving when they take up training. We do, however, collect information on why a learner has received fee remission for a particular learning aim they undertake. From these data we can provide some information on claimants, but this should be used with caution given it does not provide an accurate picture of the full range of entitlements that a person has.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/2">In Coventry local education authority there were 3,240 English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) adult (19+) aims in 2009/10, the latest academic year for which final year data are available. (As learners can enrol on more than one aim, 2,310 learners participated in these aims.)</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/3">Based on the &#8220;fees waived&#8221; field in the Individualised Learner Record, 2,850 aims were in receipt of fee remission. Of these, 1,700 (59%, based on unrounded figures) received fee remission as the learner was in receipt of an income-related benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/4">The Government currently provide 50% fee remission for all learners in England participating on ESOL courses who are eligible for public funded skills provision. Those on income based-benefits are eligible for full fee remission. Further education colleges and training organisations also have local discretion to provide fully subsidised courses for people on a wider range of benefits where the training is to help them enter employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/5">From August 2011, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment, full Government funding will be provided for ESOL to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group. We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/6">Further education (FE) colleges and training providers are responsible for meeting the needs of their local community, and increased freedoms and flexibilities that we have introduced will help them respond and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152W.14/1">Working with business, this Government are taking action to strengthen and grow modern manufacturing in the UK by encouraging higher levels of innovation, exports, business investment and technical skills as well as cutting excessive red tape. The Plan for Growth announced as part of Budget 2011, included a package of measures to stimulate the growth of engineering and advanced manufacturing, including changes to capital allowances, the launch of a High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre as well as nine new university-based research centres, funding for 10,000 additional Higher Apprenticeships, and action to promote the image of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152W.14/2">In addition to these national actions, there are six local enterprise partnerships covering the West Midlands (including one covering the four Black Country local authorities). These business public sector partnerships are focussed on supporting their local businesses through a range of measures which will encourage investment in manufacturing. These include Enterprise Zones (eg i54), local enterprise areas, and business support measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1153W.6/1">University accommodation is provided at the discretion of higher education institutions themselves, and is not funded by Government. The majority of institutions provide student accommodation either directly or through relationships with housing providers. Higher education institutions have duties under the Equality Act 2010 to support disabled students in higher education when applying to higher education and when studying. The legal duties apply to both educational and non-educational services, facilities and benefits including residential accommodation, where it is provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.6/2">The law establishes a framework of responsibility which higher education institutions must comply with and also promotes an anticipatory and proactive approach to supporting disabled students. Universities are required to make reasonable .adjustments for disabled students to ensure that they can fully participate in the education and enjoy the other benefits, facilities and services which are provided for students. Making reasonable adjustments applies to the provision of university accommodation (where that service is offered) and ensuring it is accessible. Universities are required to plan to meet the needs of disabled students, make the adjustments that may be required, and periodically review their policies and provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.6/3">The Equality Challenge Unit (ECU), the independent sector body which supports higher education institutions on equality matters, has developed two guidance documents with the Association for Student Residential Accommodation (ASRA) and other relevant higher education organisations to assist universities in establishing inclusive campuses. These include good practice on student accommodation and disabled students and are available on the ECU'S website:</p>
