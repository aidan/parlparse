I am sure that NERC Council will consider all evidence and views on the potential impact of the proposals, including any impact on wildlife research. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology will continue to deliver its contractual commitments to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs arid other Government Department and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.629W.11/1">Defra plays a leading role in taking forward the Government's commitment to tackle fuel poverty. This is reflected in our PSA target, wording of which is shared with DTI, which endorses the commitment to eradicate fuel poverty, as far as reasonably practicable, in vulnerable households in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.11/2">Defra is responsible for the Warm Front Scheme, which is the key tool for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England. Since its launch in June 2000 it has assisted more than 1 million households with a range of insulation and heating measures and energy efficiency advice. The new phase of the scheme, launched in June 2005, is better equipped to target and assist those most in need in a sustainable way.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.11/3">Funding for Warm Front was enhanced by the announcement in the pre-Budget report 2005 of an additional &pound;250 million for Warm Front in the period 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.629W.11/4">The Department works closely with colleagues across Government who have an interest in this area including the Departments of Trade and Industry, Work and Pensions and Health, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasury as well as the Devolved Administrations. This ensures that all areas which impact on our ability to tackle fuel poverty&mdash;energy efficiency, income and fuel cost&mdash;can be fully considered and appropriate action taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.631W.11/1">Our statement of policy for England's ancient and native woodlands &quot;Keepers of Time&quot; which we published last year sets out a number of strategic objectives which include the creation of new native woodland to extend, link arid complement existing woodland and other habitats. It also sets the objective of increasing the recognition and use of 'environmental services' which native woodland can provide, for example flood alleviation and pollution mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.631W.11/2">The England forestry strategy review and the review of the UK climate change programme are looking at how existing policies are performing and the range of polices that might be put in place in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.638W.2/2">If it becomes clear that alcohol is becoming a problem in either existing casinos or those new casinos permitted by the 2005 Act, there are powers under the Licensing Act 2003 and the Gambling Act 2005 to stop it being served.</p>

However, public libraries are valuable community assets and local decision makers should think carefully about what might be lost through closures.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.9/1">There is no humanitarian emergency in China. The country has made dramatic progress in reducing absolute poverty over the last 25 years, with over 450 million people lifted out of poverty. There are, however, still 135 million people below the poverty line and progress towards some of the Millennium Development Goals is slower than expected.

The Government of Ethiopia and UN agencies issued an appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase>, with particular emphasis on non-food needs such as health, nutrition, water, sanitation and livestock. We are considering our response. We will also continue to support the Government of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Nets Programme which provides assistance to those communities and households most vulnerable to crop failure by enabling them to invest in assets like clothes and livestock, or to build roads or protect water supplies.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.9/3">Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia. It is not on track to achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals. There is little reliable data but we know that many of Burma's 50 million people face poverty and vulnerability.

	<p pid="b.642W.5/1">Vulnerability is a factor which DFID takes into account in allocating aid to particular countries. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), approximately half of the world's least developed countries face high levels of natural disaster risk and the impact on poor people is increasing. It is important that developing countries ensure that their planning includes efforts to minimise the impact of risk and respond more effectively when disasters occur. DFID has produced a new policy outlining our approach to disaster risk reduction which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/2">DFID is funding significant disaster risk reduction programmes in countries susceptible to disasters. For example, we are providing over &pound;60 million to support disaster preparedness in Orissa, India. In Bangladesh, with the UNDP, we are supporting the development of the government's Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme which is helping to improve legislation, programming and co-ordination across government ministries on disaster risk reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/3">DFID is also providing support for the international disaster risk reduction system. We are one of the leading donors to the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, contributing around &pound;1 million per year and we are providing &pound;3.75 million to support the Pan American Health Organisations' work in the Caribbean to reduce the vulnerability of the health sector to disasters. Our support to the disaster risk reduction work of the Red Cross and international non-governmental organisations totals over &pound;16 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.0/1">In 2000 the Department of Trade and Industry transferred ownership of its core IT infrastructure as part of a long-term private finance initiative (PFI) agreement to a consortium led by Fujitsu. The use of IT equipment such as PCs, laptops, servers, scanners and printers is now, in the main, provided as a service through the PFI partner, Fujitsu. The use of photocopiers is also provided mainly through supplier leasing arrangements. Details of fax machines owned by the Department are shown in the following table. The chief executives of the Department's Agencies have been asked to write to the hon. Member in respect of their equipment holdings.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.3/1">The Department has not issued any such guidance to the British Transport Police (BTP). Railway enthusiasts are frequently present on the rail infrastructure, are knowledgeable about railway operations and know what is or is not usual. They are in a good position to report any suspicious activity to the police and BTP actively encourage them, like any other user of rail services and stations, to do so.</p>

In this context, rail enthusiasts are not treated any differently from any other individual.</p>

	<p pid="b.656W.0/1">Most spending on cycle safety in England is undertaken by local highway authorities. This includes capital spending on infrastructure schemes such as cycle lanes, which may have traffic management as well as safety benefits. It also includes revenue spending on cycle training, other educational initiatives and local cycle safety publicity. Since 2001&ndash;02, capital spending by English authorities outside London has been recorded through the local transport plan system, but this was not recorded centrally for earlier years. Revenue spending on road safety comes from local authorities' own resources and is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.0/2">The Department for Transport also produces cycle safety publicity and resources at national level. Figures for annual spending are only available as far back as 2002&ndash;03. Our road safety challenge grant scheme, which has been running since 2002&ndash;03, has funded a number of projects that are wholly or partly to improve cycle safety. Figures for spending on cycle safety projects under previous grant schemes are not available. The Department also includes projects on cycle safety in its road safety research programme, though figures are available only from 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.0/3">The Department has also from time to time funded various schemes to promote cycling, including infrastructure, facilities and training, which will have included safety benefits. From 2005&ndash;06, this role has been taken on by Cycling England, which now receives &pound;5 million per year from the Department, to spend on a range of infrastructure, training and publicity measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.0/4">Available figures are shown in the following table. These may include amounts sent on cycling infrastructure and facilities that was not entirely safety-related and amounts spent on road safety publicity and education that was not entirely cycling related. These figures do not include spending on infrastructure, facilities, education and publicity that had wider road safety benefits for all road users, including cyclists. No figures are available for earlier years.</p>

	<p pid="b.657W.2/1">The UK Government have played a key role, internationally, regionally and nationally, in developing many measures to prevent, or mitigate the consequences of, oil spills from ships during the 10 years since the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996. The most significant measures are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/2" class="indent">In 1994, recognising the value of tugs in preventing groundings and other incidents, the UK introduced Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs) on a trial basis. Initially ETVs were stationed at Dover and Stornoway for the winter months only. After further review, the number of ETVs was increased to four&mdash;stationed at Dover, Stornoway, the Fair Isle Channel, and in the South West approaches&mdash;and since October 2001 all four ETVs have been on station all year round.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/3" class="indent">The UK participated fully in the adoption in 1996 of the Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention which will provide compensation cover similar to the international oil pollution compensation regime but for other oils and chemicals, and also for explosion, death or injury from such products.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/4" class="indent">In 1997 the UK co-ordinated an EU member states' initiative at the IMO to have the whole of the North Sea, and all waters around the UK and Ireland, declared a special area for the purposes of protecting those waters from operational discharges of oil from shipping.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/5" class="indent">The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency has a dedicated Enforcement Unit. In 1997, legislation was passed to enable magistrates to impose a fine of up to &pound;250,000 on either the master or the ship-owner for an oil pollution offence; this is the highest fine for any offence in a magistrates court.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/6" class="indent">In 2000, following a wide-ranging review, the UK published a revised &quot;National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations&quot;, setting out how the relevant agencies and authorities in the UK will respond to such incidents. The UK has also created the role of the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP). On behalf of the Secretary of State, SOSREP has the power to oversee, control and&mdash;if necessary&mdash;intervene in salvage operations within UK waters involving vessels or fixed platforms where there is a significant risk of pollution. To reduce the risk of pollution of our seas and coasts, SOSREP can direct vessels which are in difficulties to a suitable place of refuge. The powers of direction invested in SOSREP are extensive, and are called into play when he believes that the public interest is not being adequately protected. The SOSREP role has proved very successful, as well as being an international first for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/7" class="indent">In 2000 the UK initiated action at the IMO to increase the limit of compensation under the 1992 CLC/Fund regime by a further 50 per cent. to &pound;177 million, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-01">1 November 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/8" class="indent">In 2001, along with six other states, the UK pressed for a world-wide initiative to create a Supplementary Fund to the 1992 CLC/Fund to provide further substantial compensation for the most serious oil spills.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/9" class="indent">The UK was one of the countries, which developed the Bunkers Convention 2001, which establishes a liability regime for pollution from ships' fuel oils.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/10" class="indent">The UK played a leading role in the EU and the IMO to secure international agreement to accelerate the phasing out of single hull oil tankers. Double hulls can provide additional protection against spillage in the event of collisions and groundings.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/11" class="indent">The UK played an active part in the work leading to the development of the EC Vessel traffic monitoring and information system Directive, which covers reporting requirements on ships with dangerous cargoes, the installation of Voyage Data Recorders on ships, the installation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on ships and the establishment of shore-based stations to receive AIS5 information; exchange of vessel traffic information; places of refuge; and measures for shore authorities to take in bad weather conditions. The UK implemented the Directive in national law in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/12" class="indent">The UK played a leading role in the IMO in achieving the designation of the Western European Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA), which includes a substantial proportion of the UK's seas and coasts. The PSSA came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>. The protective measure for the PSSA is a mandatory reporting system. The reporting system applies to all tankers of more than 600 deadweight tonnes (dwt) carrying heavy grades of oil.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/13">As regards further steps:</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/14" class="indent">The Merchant Shipping (Pollution) Bill is currently going through Parliament which will enable the UK to ratify and implement the Supplementary Fund Protocol to the Fund Convention, thereby increasing the amount of compensation available for any one incident to some &pound;621 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.2/15" class="indent">In addition, work on vessel routeing and traffic management measures has progressed to take account of wider developments in UK policy on the sustainable use of the marine environment, such as the growth in offshore renewable energy, the Government's commitment to introducing a Marine Bill, developments in thinking on marine spatial planning and advances in e-navigation technology. As part of this process, considerable work has gone into the identification of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas and an announcement will be made shortly.</p>

Schools in Gravesham already work closely together, and local authority officers are due to meet secondary heads and primary representatives in February 2006 to discuss further development of the partnership.</p>

	<p pid="b.676W.5/4" class="indent">During the academic year 2004/05, 1,821 young people in Barnsley Local Education Authority and 2,707 young people in Doncaster Local Education Authority received one or more EMA payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/5" class="indent">During the academic year 2004/05, EMA was available to all 16 years olds nationally and to 17 and 18 years olds in former pilot areas (young people who are 19 are entitled to receive EMA in certain circumstances). Both Barnsley and Doncaster Local Education Authorities were former pilot areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.676W.5/6" class="indent">In preparation for the roll-out, projections of the number of young people eligible for EMA were only made for 16 years olds. The projections are formed by applying income distributions (derived from the Family Resources Survey) and expected numbers in full-time further education to the estimated population of 16 years olds. When applied to individual localities the figures may be subject to some variation but they provide a useful estimate. The following table displays the data for Barnsley and Doncaster.</p>

Forms of intervention and engagement are decided in the light of independent evidence and tailored to the specific needs of the local authority. The authority will receive co-ordinated support and advice from officials in the Government Office, DfES advisers and from senior officers of the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. Action taken to improve local authority services following an Ofsted unsatisfactory rating has included establishing partnership arrangements with a high performing local authority and directing the outsourcing of the strategic management of services. Similar action will be taken in future in the light of evidence from the new Joint Area Review undertaken by Ofsted and other inspectorates. From this April, Directors for Children and Learners (DCLs), based in the Government Offices, will provide tailored support and challenge for every local authority in their region. This will be based around annual priorities meetings, at which DCLs, local authorities and their partners discuss local priorities in the context of national priorities and the action being taken to address areas of weakness and concern.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.0/1">By 2007&ndash;08, total revenue funding per pupil will have increased nationally by over &pound;1,400 in real terms since 1997&ndash;98, an increase of some 50 per cent. Information is not available prior to 1997&ndash;98 on the same basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.0/2" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.0/3">1. Funding consistent with Education Standard Spending/Education Formula Spending plus all schools-related revenue grants in DfES's departmental expenditure limit which are relevant to pupils aged 3&ndash;19. Funding excludes child care and Surestart. 2. Calculations are based on full-time equivalent pupils aged 3&ndash;19 in maintained schools in England. This includes estimated numbers of three-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational establishments. 3. Includes funding for academies and specialist schools but excludes CTCs. 4. Pensions transfers to Education Formula Spending have been deducted from 2003&ndash;04 onwards, with notional transfers for the final two years. 5. Real terms figures have been calculated using the September 2005 gross domestic product deflators with 2004&ndash;05 as the base year.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.6/1">Children of servicemen and women can face extra challenges in education, mainly because their parents' redeployment leads to frequent changes of schools. A working group comprising head teachers from schools with significant numbers of children of service personnel, officials from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education and Skills, and the Children's Education Advisory Service (an MOD agency that supports service families) meets regularly to examine the needs of these children and identify possible solutions. Funding arrangements are in place to help schools manage high pupil mobility and local authorities are encouraged to use their funding flexibly to help service schools. DfES officials also work closely with Service Children's Education, an MOD agency responsible for forces schools abroad, to ensure that service children get the same education abroad that they would receive in this country. The school admissions code of practice advises admission authorities to take account of the needs of service families. Admission authorities can accept applications from parents returning to the area some months in advance and allocate a school place for when the family returns. In areas with a significant standing presence of service personnel, service representatives should be invited to join the admissions forum.</p>

Accordingly we estimate the cost of implementing PPA time from September 2005 will add an additional 0.7 per cent. to the cost pressures on primary schools for 2006&ndash;07&mdash;and that has been added to the universal cost pressures on schools for 2006&ndash;07 to give a Minimum Funding Guarantee (MFG) for nursery and primary schools of 4 per cent. for that year. The MFG figure for secondary and special schools will be set at 3.4 per cent. for 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.689W.3/3">The overall increase in the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocation for 2006&ndash;07 is 6.4 per cent., within which there is an indicative allocation of &pound;70 million for implementing the final phase of workforce reform in primary schools. This funding will be consolidated into the DSG baseline for 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.691W.2/1">The 14-to-9 Education and Skills White Paper and the Implementation Plan (published December 2005) lay out detailed proposals for changes to the 14-to-19 curriculum. Key to these changes is the introduction of specialised diplomas, which will be available to young people from age 14, in 14 sector-related lines of learning. Specialised diplomas will provide young people with the skills and knowledge they need to progress into skilled employment, training and further or higher education; the diplomas will have a significant focus on applied learning. Employers are leading on the content development of the specialised diplomas, to ensure that these qualifications teach young people skills that have real currency in the labour market. The first five diplomas will be piloted from 2008; all 14 lines will be available from 2010, and there will be a national entitlement to a diploma course from 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/2">The 14-to-19 Education and Skills White Paper also proposed a work-focused programme to motivate 14-to-16 year-olds with relatively low attainment, who are at serious risk of disaffection, building on the lessons of the Entry to Employment programme for 16-to-19 year-olds. Pilots are to start from 2006&ndash;7, and the White Paper suggested a figure of up to 10,000 young people on the programme from 2007&ndash;8.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/3">The Young Apprentices programme, which provides an opportunity for 14-to-16 year olds to gain a taste of 'real work' through two days a week (or equivalent) work experience, and to pursue qualifications that relate to particular occupational sectors, as well as following core national curriculum subjects, will continue to run. So too will the Increased Flexibility Programme, in which 14-to-16 year olds have the opportunity to study off-site at a college or training provider for one or two days a week throughout Key Stage 4. The pupils may work towards vocational and work related qualifications, and so develop their knowledge and understanding in a work context. GCSEs in vocational subjects will also continue to be offered: there are currently eight titles available, each of which is a double award. A further six titles are being developed; in some cases, these will be single, rather than double, awards.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.2/4">In addition to these specific learning programmes, from September 2004 there has also been a statutory requirement for all pupils to undertake some work-related learning at Key Stage 4, through planned activity that uses the context of work to develop knowledge, skills and understanding useful for work.</p>

	<p pid="b.694W.2/1">The previous means testing system was abolished because it was inefficient and costly to administer. In 1997&ndash;98, criminal legal aid contributions totalled &pound;6.2 million, but the direct cost of administering the system was &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.2/2">The purpose of re-introducing means testing through the Criminal Defence Service Bill is to ensure that the significant number of defendants who can afford to pay for their defence costs are now made to do so. The new means testing model will avoid the bureaucracy and delay associated with the ineffective contributory system of the past. Its implementation in the magistrates courts alone will deliver estimated annual savings of at least &pound;35 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.5/1">There are two elements to the Northern Ireland Office's public service agreement target number 1. The first relates to increasing confidence in the police and policing arrangements and the second to increasing Catholic representation in the police service.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.5/2">The composite baseline measure for confidence in the police and policing arrangement element of PSA target number 1 was calculated using a weighted average of three indicators from the April 2004 Northern Ireland omnibus survey (NIOS) and four indicators from the 2003&ndash;04 Northern Ireland crime survey (NICS). The now continuous NICS will be used to measure progress towards achieving this part of the target.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.5/3">Both surveys are conducted by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency in accordance with national statistics principles. Their samples are drawn from a common sampling frame and are representative of the adult population of Northern Ireland. The NIOS, used to monitor performance during SR 2002, is conducted several times a year and has a smaller sample size than the NICS. From 2005, the NICS has moved from a biennial to a continuous basis, facilitating the production of more robust and more frequent performance measurement data than that previously available.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.5/4">Data in relation to Catholic representation in the police has consistently been provided by the PSNI. The source of this data is the notification by existing officers of their primary school attendance. The religious affiliation of new recruits will be determined from their own declarations based on guidance issued by the Equality Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.697W.8/1">Almost half of United Kingdom pensioners pay no income tax. For those who do, the age-related personal allowances in 2006&ndash;07 for people aged between 65 and 74 will rise from &pound;7,090 to &pound;7,280, and for people aged 75 and over from &pound;7,220 to &pound;7,420.

	<p pid="b.697W.8/2">This Government has introduced a number of measures since 1997 to help pensioners enjoy a better standard of living, including higher state pensions, pension credit, winter fuel payments and age-related payments. In addition to helping the poorest pensioners, pension credit specifically targets extra money on those with modest savings or income, for example, from a private pension. As a result of these measures across the United Kingdom over &pound;10 billion more will be spent on pensioners in 2006&ndash;07 than in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.6/2">Portsmouth was selected in 2002 as the base-port for the future aircraft carriers (CVF). The approach channel will be realigned and widened to permit safe access for the carriers, and some dredging work within the harbour will be also required. CVF will be too large to enter Devonport Naval Base.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.9/1">Research provided to the Government on possible associations between ill health among veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict and exposures, including nerve agent pre-treatment set tablets, is generally in the form of published peer-reviewed medical/scientific papers and academic systematic reviews of such papers. Two reviews are considered of particular significance and authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.9/2">The active ingredient in NAPS tablets is the compound Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB). In 2000, the US Institute of Medicine's review &quot;Gulf War and Health: Volume 1. Depleted Uranium, Pyridostigmine Bromide, Sarin, and Vaccines&quot;, concluded that there was inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association does or does not exist between PB and long-term adverse health effects. In 2003, the UK Medical Research Council's review of research into UK Gulf veterans' illnesses noted that for many years PB has been used routinely to treat neuromuscular disease. This had involved much higher doses administered over long periods of time. No serious side effects have been observed as a result of the use of PB in this latter context.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.2/1">Since the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment programme was established in 1993, it has medically assessed 3,278 1990&ndash;91 Gulf veterans. Of those seen, 2,521 were Army, 299 Navy and 458 RAF, of whom 117,17 and 27 respectively had neurological disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/2">No unusual diseases or pattern of diseases were found. Of 161 cases of neurological disorder, the most common was migraine (43), followed by epilepsy (28) (22 idiopathic, 6 post traumatic) and multiple sclerosis (19). Of the 161 only one was medically assessed as a result of service in the Gulf. The remaining 71 veterans suffered a miscellaneous group of disorders, some of a genetic nature, others extant before deployment to the Gulf and others developing many years after return from the Gulf, none of which were assessed by Medical Assessment programme physicians to be caused by either deployment to the Gulf or medical countermeasures used during that campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/3">In relation to auto-immune illnesses, there have been three cases of systemic lupus erythematosus autoimmune disease, and three cases of common variable immunodeficiency. Two of the latter were asymptomatic and discovered by chance. None of these six cases was assessed as being due to service in the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. However, since 2002, routine investigations for immune diseases have not been routinely undertaken unless clinically indicated.</p>

	<p pid="b.706W.8/2">The flotation of Qinetiq is the logical next step in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) for Defence Research announced in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The aims of the PPP were to strengthen the linkages between defence and civil technologies, encourage the commercial exploitation of the taxpayers' investment in science and technology, and create a sustainable future for DERA and its staff whilst retaining within Government (the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) those functions not appropriate to the private sector. The Government, informed by the advice of its professional advisers, believes that an Initial Public Offering (IPO) now provides the best route for Qinetiq further to develop its excellence as a supplier of advanced technology in a global market. Following the IPO, the MOD will continue to retain a significant stake in the company, and a Special Share to protect the United Kingdom's defence and security interests in Qinetiq.</p>

	<p pid="b.710W.2/1">In August 2001 the Army Policy and Resources Committee authorised a review of the soldiers' career structures. The review, known as the Non Commissioned Engagement and Career Study, reported its findings in November 2002 and recommended the introduction of a more flexible and efficient career structure for soldiers, that would meet the operational and administrative needs of the Army and the individual in the 21st century while enabling better use of those soldiers who wish to serve beyond a 22-year engagement. As a first step in November 2004 the longer career model (LCM) was introduced for the staff and personnel support branch of the Adjutant General's Corps offering the possibility of three-five years extension of service beyond the 22-year point. The LCM is also available to other cap badges and several are now actively investigating the feasibility of longer service for their soldiers. Plans to offer even greater flexibility in length of service for soldiers are also under consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.719W.2/3">1. The percentages of the population registered with a dentist (or registration rate) have been estimated by including patient registrations in the area of the dentist, that is, according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient's address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. 2. Estimates have been calculated using population estimates for the nearest year for which data are available. Percentages for 2005 have been calculated using 2004 mid year population estimates. 3. Information on children registered with a dentist at constituency level is not available as a percentage of the total number of children in the constituency. This is due to population data not being available at constituency level.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.6/1">While all restraint positions are potentially harmful, there is no empirical evidence which indicates that the prone position carries a greater risk of harm to patients than other restraint positions.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.6/2">Individual authorities are required by the Code of Practice of the Mental Health Act 1983 to have clear policies on the use of prone restraint and other forms of physical restraint. Physical restraint should take place only as a last resort, not routinely. Any restraint used should also be reasonable in the circumstance, apply the minimum force necessary to prevent harm to the patient or others, for only as long as is necessary and be sensitive to gender and race issues. This advice applies in all healthcare settings and to all age ranges. Trusts should regularly audit their physical restraint procedures to ensure these are consistent with the framework of clinical governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.6/3">The Department emphasises the recognition and prevention of aggression and violence wherever possible and published guidance in 2004, &quot;Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide: Developing Positive Practice to Support the Safe and Therapeutic Management of Aggression and Violence in Mental Health Inpatient Settings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.6/4">We also commissioned guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which looked at the management of aggression and violence, including restraint. NICE published &quot;Disturbed (violent) behaviour: the short-term management of disturbed (violent) behaviour in in-patient psychiatric settings&quot; in February 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.6/5">In September 2005, the National Health Service Security Management Service formally launched its training programme, &quot;Promoting safer and therapeutic services&quot;, following the successful piloting of this in a number of national health service trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.6/6">The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) is also reviewing positive practice standards in relation to the safe and therapeutic management of aggression and violence. NIMHE, together with the National Patient Safety Agency, who are undertaking a project on preventing and managing violence, will publish guidance and a checklist early in 2006 to ensure that all restraint procedures meet rigorous standards. The project team is also developing proposals for the accreditation and regulation of physical intervention trainers.</p>

	<p pid="b.724W.3/1">The consultant contract was costed on a methodology agreed with the British Medical Association and on that basis the estimated cost of the contract, and the funding, was &pound;133 million in 2003&ndash;04 rising to &pound;250 million in 2005&ndash;06. In late 2004, we adjusted the tariff for 2005&ndash;06 by &pound;150 million in response to suggestions from the service that this was the further cost pressure. However, our national survey, published in February 2005, indicated that the actual additional cost to the service was around &pound;90 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.724W.3/2">Agenda for change costs were estimated from experience in a number of early implementer sites to be consistent with the agreed funding envelope of &pound;480 million in 2004&ndash;05 rising to &pound;950 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.724W.3/3">There are concerns based on monitoring in a number of sample sites that initial costs may have been higher than expected, and follow-up work is currently being carried out on the costs of implementation within each strategic health authority to test this. The agenda for change funding envelope is due to increase in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 and it is too soon to conclude whether or not the overall envelope will be exceeded.</p>

Government office for the regions boundaries have been chosen because they help maximise benefits and simplify issues such as funding, ownership and accountability. A further benefit is that the regional resilience teams, with whom the control centres will work, follow the same boundaries.</p>

	<p pid="b.741W.5/4" class="indent">Household projections are the responsibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The 2002-based interim household projections are the latest available set and these are being updated to take into account more recent information on household formation and the 2003 based subnational population projections. Table 1 shows average annual household growth for the Government Office Regions in England between 2001 and 2021.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.5/5" class="indent">Table 2 shows the projected net population change for the Government Office Regions in England.</p>

They take no account of future development which may affect trends.</p>
	<p pid="b.741W.5/7" class="indent">Like subnational population projections, household projections are trend based and illustrate what would happen if past trends in household formation were to continue into the future. The projections are heavily dependent on demographic assumptions used. These projections are not policy based forecasts of what the government expects or intends to happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.2/2">Information from the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) indicates that an immigration appeal, comprising both in-country and entry clearance cases, lodged between April 2004 and the end of March 2005 took an average of 54 weeks to be decided by an immigration adjudicator following the appeal being lodged with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the Home Office, either directly by the appellant or having being forwarded to IND from the entry clearance post.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.2/3">Provisional information for entry clearance appeals lodged after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>, up to September 2005 only currently covers a low volume of appeals. It is therefore difficult to provide an accurately indicative figure for the average waiting times from appeal lodgement to a decision by an immigration judge for appeals lodged in this period. Accounting for the times allowed for the respondent to prepare the appeal bundle in entry clearance cases, it is expected that appeals are decided by an immigration judge approximately 27 or 35 weeks from the date of lodgement, dependent on the type of case. This includes time allowed for international transit of documents to and from the tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.2/4">The entry clearance appeals decided prior to the commencement of the AIT were lodged with the original decision maker in accordance with the procedure rules of the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA), the appellate body subsequently replaced by the AIT. Once lodged the appeals were transferred to the IND for preparation before being forwarded to the IAA to be decided by an immigration adjudicator.</p>
	<p pid="b.751W.2/5">With the commencement of the AIT entry clearance appeals can be lodged either directly to the AIT or with the relevant entry clearance post. Where an appeal is lodged with the relevant entry clearance post it must be endorsed and forwarded to the AIT as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 10 days.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.6/1">The Home Office does, via the British Crime Survey (BCS), measure levels of violence against adults (ages 16 and over) in private households. The risks of being a victim of violence are published annually by age group for men and women. The most recent figures, based on the 2004&ndash;05 BCS, showed that the overall risk of being a victim of violence was less than one per cent for both men and women aged 65 or over.</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/2">The risk of becoming a victim of violent crime was 0.4 per cent. for men aged 65&ndash;74, 0.2 per cent. for men aged 75 or over, 0.5 per cent. for women aged 65&ndash;74, and 0.5 per cent. for women aged 75 or over. In terms of domestic violence, the 2004&ndash;05 BCS indicates that the risk among men and women in these ages groups is low (0 per cent. and 0.1 per cent. among men and women aged 65&ndash;74, respectively, and 0 per cent. for both men and women aged 75 and over).</p>
	<p pid="b.753W.6/3">However, it is recognised that the core BCS measure of domestic violence may be an underestimate as some victims may be unwilling to report experience of domestic violence to an interviewer, and it does not cover adults living in institutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply. </p>
	<p pid="b.754W.11/2">Entry to the United Kingdom that results in the formation of a polygamous household is not permitted under the immigration rules. Therefore, no men have been given entry clearance to settle in the UK, or for other long-term purposes (.g students, work permit holders), with more than one wife.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.11/3">However, the immigration rules do not prevent polygamous households from entering the UK for the purpose of a visit. If an entry clearance officer overseas is satisfied that each applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs 40 and 41 of the immigration rules relating to visitors, they may grant a man and more than one of his wives entry clearance as visitors at the same time. UKvisas does not have a separate record of how many such visit visas are issued.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.0/1">We will consider how best the probation service, as well as the wider criminal justice system, can take into account changes to police structures once final decisions on future police boundaries have been taken. Co-terminosity in the criminal justice system remains an important principle.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.3/1">All police use of firearms is subject to the usual law on the use of force. In particular, the Criminal Law Act 1967 provides that the police may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to effect an arrest or to prevent crime. The law applies to the operational tactics developed by police to deal with suspected suicide bombers as it does in any other case.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.6/1">Information on the total revenue from speed camera convictions is not collected centrally. The information collected by RDS-OCJR identifies the number of fixed penalties ordered to be paid and the number and amounts of court fines issued for such offences within each police force area. Not all fines and fixed penalties will have been paid.</p>
