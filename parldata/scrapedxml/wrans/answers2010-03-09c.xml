The UK share of the ESA contribution is &#8364;168.05 million, of which &#8364;161.1 million has been paid and the UK is committed to pay the remainder during 2010.

	<p pid="c.164W.2/1">We are aware that there is considerable concern in the industry about the practicality of complying with the requirement of EU rules for organic production that after <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase> organic pigs and poultry must be fed entirely on organically produced feed. We understand that providing a diet with a properly balanced protein content using wholly organically produced ingredients is a particular concern because of the difficulties with sourcing the correct protein ingredients for feed for organic pigs and poultry. DEFRA's Advisory Committee on Organic Standards is investigating how this issue might be dealt with, including how the use of fishmeal might contribute to a solution to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="c.164W.5/1">Figures are not available in relation to actual emissions from UK fishing vessels. However, an assessment of the total emissions from the fisheries sector for 2006 has been provided in DEFRA's Food 2030 strategy. This states that, as a total of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the UK food chain by sector, fisheries accounted for 1mt of the 160mt CO2e produced.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.5/2">Available data over the period of 2000-08 indicates that for the UK fishing fleet there has been a reduction in engine capacity and fishing effort, as well as a move toward less fuel intensive fishing methods. This information is in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="c.172W.2/2">The Gurkha Settlement Office was not set up to process visa application forms. It offers ex-Gurkhas and their dependants, free of charge, information about life in the UK, so that they can reach an informed decision about whether they want to apply for settlement in this country. If they decide that they do wish to apply, then the Gurkha Settlement Office provides support by helping with the completion of visa application forms and through liaison with the Gurkha Records Office to supply some of the documentation needed to support a visa application. he Gurkha Settlement Office has received nearly 4,000 visits and around 2,000 ex-Gurkhas and/or their dependants have registered on the settlement office database for help with their visa application. Visa applications are processed by the UK Border Agency, in their regional centre in New Delhi. Under the new immigration rules over 6,600 visa applications have been received from ex-Gurkhas and their dependants and over 3,650 visas have been authorised or issued. It is not known how many of these applicants may have sought help from the Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organisation (GAESO) when preparing their application forms.</p>

	<p pid="c.181W.5/2">Responsibility for tourism in the English regions was given to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in 2003. The RDAs have developed regional tourism strategies, taking into account the needs of, and opportunities for, localities and destinations within their regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.181W.5/3">The RDAs have invested substantially in tourism development and promotion investing some &#163;60 million in 2008-09. Local authorities are also important partners in supporting the visitor economy. The Local Government Association is represented on the Minister's Tourism Advisory Council and the DCMS engages regularly with local bodies such as the British Resorts and Destinations Association and Destination Performance UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.181W.5/4">Alongside the marketing campaigns conducted by VisitBritain and VisitEngland, a number of DCMS programmes encourage and enable local authorities to develop and promote their tourism offer. DCMS sponsors &quot;Sea Change&quot;, which has allocated &#163;38 million to 32 seaside resorts, to support projects for cultural regeneration and the visitor economy. The &quot;Renaissance in the Regions&quot; programme is a ground-breaking initiative to transform England's regional museums. Renaissance has seen an investment of &#163;242.8 million from 2002-09 and it is anticipated that nearly &#163;300 million will have been invested by March 2011. We have seen recently, in the long queues at Bristol for the Banksy temporary exhibition and at Birmingham for the display of the Staffordshire Hoard of Anglo Saxon Gold, how these revitalized museums can encourage tourism.</p>
	<p pid="c.181W.5/5">Most recently, following on the success of Liverpool European Capital of Culture, the DCMS launched the &quot;UK City of Culture&quot; competition, challenging bidding cities to develop a substantial programme of cultural activity which leads to a demonstrable step-change in their area, and a lasting legacy. Fourteen cities submitted initial bids, with Birmingham, Derry/Londonderry, Norwich and Sheffield succeeding in being shortlisted. The winning city will be announced in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.181W.5/6">In addition, whilst funding decisions are for local authorities themselves, to make, DCMS supports the Charter for Placemaking and Destination Management, developed through the &quot;Partners for England&quot; initiative, which provides guidance to local authorities on promoting, developing and measuring tourism, and on working with the industry and public sector partners. Local authority support and engagement will also be addressed in the England tourism strategy, currently being developed by VisitEngland.</p>

	<p pid="c.186W.5/3">The use of medication such as anti-psychotic drugs for behaviour problems is an issue that will most likely be addressed in the clinical guidelines for autistic spectrum disorders in adults and children currently being developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE have not yet indicated when it expects this guidance to be issued to be available to the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="c.190W.5/6">It is not easy to ascertain where an infection has been acquired and these datasets include both infections acquired in hospital and in other settings.

	<p pid="c.201W.6/1">In relation to their pupils, faith schools are not covered by clause 29 of the Equality Bill as a result of clause 28(2). They are instead covered by Part 6 of the Bill and the exceptions they need to operate are provided in that Part and in Schedule 11. In relation to other services and public functions provided by faith schools, the exceptions contained in Clause 29 will apply to all public bodies, including maintained faith schools. The exceptions in Part 2 of Schedule 3 apply mainly to local authorities in relation to their education functions. Where they need to apply more widely, including to maintained faith schools, they do. An example of this is paragraph 11 of the Schedule. There is no need for additional legislation.</p>

The latest figures, for the 12 months ending September 2009, shows that there has been a reduction in the proportion of people with a high level of perceived antisocial behaviour in their local area (down from 17 per cent. to 15 per cent. year on year) and a reduction from 26 per cent. to 25 per cent. of those who perceive problems with drunk and rowdy behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.219W.5/2">In addition, we have made it increasingly difficult for people to live and work here who have no right to do so through toughening the illegal working legislation.

	<p pid="c.220W.8/15">The IS151A does not necessarily signify that the UK Border Agency is making immediate efforts to remove that person at that time, as there may be numerous barriers to removal (such as an outstanding asylum claim or appeal right) which must first be considered; should the person subsequently be granted leave then the IS151A is no longer valid. Therefore, the issue of such a form does not correlate with the numbers of people actually removed from the UK. Removal directions are set at the end of the process when any barriers to removal are resolved.</p>

	<p pid="c.225W.8/1">The requirement for individuals and companies to supply information on the movement of freight is included in Section 33 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. These powers can only be used once the Secretary of State has made an order subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House. Such an order has not yet been made and thus the powers have not so far been introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/2">In autumn 2009, in light of the economic climate, the Home Office concluded that it would not be appropriate to introduce such an order at this time, due to the potential and uncertain impact on industry. The Home Office is working with partners and industry representatives to identify ways that the objectives can be achieved while minimising industry impact.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/3">Since the Act was passed it has become increasingly evident that industry concerns in relations to the costs and other burdens of facilitating this power should be considered fully before secondary legislation was laid before Parliament. Representations have been made from a range of industry representatives and Home Office officials have met a range of these representatives and discussed many of their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/4">Representations have dealt broadly with the costs of introducing systems which would be able to provide information to the police; the type of information that would be required; the breadth of the information required in relation to the periods covered, and the detail of the information and the operating models for any systems which may be introduced. Representations have also been made in relation to the inclusion of these powers in the Draft Immigration (Simplification) Bill, which would replace the 2006 Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/5">The incorporation of s.33 in the new bill does not represent any change in policy and we remain committed to consult formally with industry before introducing secondary legislation before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/6">We are confident that the measures in place for countering the threats to the UK in relation to the movements of goods match the current level of threat and remain mindful of the need to balance the need to facilitate trade while ensuring that our capability to counter this threat remains effective.</p>

	<p pid="c.232W.5/2">Estimates of the total number of redundancies are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). However there is no available disaggregation between voluntary and involuntary redundancies or a regional breakdown.</p>
	<p pid="c.232W.5/3">The LFS provides information for whether employees work in the public or private sectors. However individuals recently made redundant are instead classified according to the industrial group of their previous job. The industrial group 'public administration, education and health' may act as a very broad approximation of the public sector. Although a large fraction of employees in and redundancies from the this industrial group are likely to be in the public sector, private sector firms also operate within this industry whilst there are also public sector employees in other sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.232W.5/4">BIS estimates of redundancies from public administration, education and health and all other industries are provided in the third and fourth columns of Table 1 for the first quarter of each year since 1999, the earliest date available. These figures should only be treated as indicative as the LFS is a self classification survey completed by individuals. Some individuals are unlikely to identify exactly the industry in which they work.</p>
	<p pid="c.232W.5/5">The second column of Table 1 reports Office for National Statistics published figures for total economy-wide redundancy rates. These do not exactly match the other columns due to missing values in the industrial classification of redundancies.</p>

Therefore, the medical condition recorded on the claim form does not in itself confer entitlement to benefit. This means that the decision for a customer who has claimed incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance would be based on their ability to carry out a range of activities in the personal capability assessment. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. Data by medical conditions is not yet available for employment and support allowance. The available information is in the table.</p>

	<p pid="c.235W.0/1">The European Court of Justice (ECJ) decided in October 2007 that the disability benefits (disability living allowance care component, attendance allowance and carer's allowance) are sickness benefits and may be paid to people who leave the UK to live elsewhere in the European Economic Area or Switzerland providing certain conditions are met.

	<p pid="c.235W.0/4">We do not have the information in the form requested. We currently hold data on 4,000 to 5,000 people who have moved to another EEA member state since 2002 and lost entitlement to a disability benefit. We estimate that the total monetary value of payments to these cases, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase> to the end of March 2010, could be between &#163;30 million and &#163;40 million.

This is why the Chancellor announced in the December 2009 pre-Budget report that attendance allowance would be increased by 1.5 per cent.-bringing forward help when it is most needed. Without this commitment, the recent negative growth in the retail prices index would have meant that this benefit would not have increased in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.236W.2/1">Attendance allowance provides an important non-contributory, non-income-related and tax free cash contribution towards the extra costs of severely disabled people. The Government are committed to providing real help to disabled people, particularly through the early stages of economic recovery. This is why the Chancellor announced in the December 2009 pre-Budget report that attendance allowance would be increased by 1.5 per cent.-bringing forward help when it is most needed. Without this commitment, the recent negative growth in the retail prices index would have meant that this benefit would not have increased in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.246W.2/1">In 2005 the Government gave a commitment to review specific aspects of the Advocate's Graduated Fee Scheme (AGFS), including payments for 'cracked' trials and guilty pleas. However, this commitment was overtaken by Lord Carter's Review of Legal Aid Procurement, published in 2006. This led to a wide ranging revision of the existing AGFS framework, implemented in April 2007. In light of these recent changes, the Government do not currently intend to conduct any further review of the structure of the AGFS, although they have recently consulted on changes to the rates payable under the AGFS.</p>

Where someone is subject to restraint procedures a living allowance is usually made available, and this is taken into account in assessing their financial eligibility. The LSC's management information systems do not hold information on the numbers of people subject to restraint proceedings, or on the living allowances each individual has been allowed by the court, so figures for the number of people who are in principle eligible for legal aid as a result of restraint proceedings are not available. Some information may be held on individuals who have actually applied for legal aid, but this is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.248W.5/1">The Government are committed to reducing the number of mobile phones in prisons. We have already strengthened the law through the Offender Management Act 2007, which made it an offence with a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment to bring a mobile phone or component into a prison. We are also taking forward legislation through the Crime and Security Bill to criminalise the possession of devices, including mobile telephones within a prison without authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.248W.5/2">Prisons in England and Wales are instructed to send mobile phones and SIM cards found to a central unit and it is from this unit's records that this answer is based.

	<p pid="c.248W.5/4">The figures understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes and phones not submitted for other reasons. It is not always appropriate to send phones to the central unit and some phones sent are not interrogated. These have not been included in these figures. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to improve the accuracy of these statistics.</p>

The information refers to staff directly employed by the National Offender Management Service and staff at Ashfield and Parc young offender institutions (YOI), which are operated by private contractors. Where a YOI is not entirely dedicated to holding young people (15 to 17-year-olds) it is not possible to disaggregate the staffing and the entire staffing of the YOI has been included in the answer.

	<p pid="c.252W.5/1">The Kazakhs have made some progress in the field of human rights, but further improvements are needed, as they themselves have recognised. Recent positive reforms include December 2009 legislation on domestic violence and gender equality and a reduction in the number of crimes carrying the death penalty. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are active and played a key role in developing Kazakhstan's National Human Rights Action Plan last year (the formation of which was supported by the UK). This Action Plan includes a comprehensive set of recommendations across the human rights spectrum, many with specific deadlines. But concerns remain, including in respect of arbitrary arrest and detention, the right to a fair trial and freedoms of expression, assembly and of the media, and in specific cases such as Evgeny Zhovtis and Ramazan Yesergepov. There is also scope for improvements in the legislation on elections, political parties and local government enacted in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.5/2">February 2009 legislation introduced some improvements with regard to the media situation in Kazakhstan, including abolition of the registration requirement for television and radio outlets. However, libel remains a criminal offence in Kazakhstan and related laws are used against opposition media. In December 2009, a new privacy law was passed, which media NGOs state will place further constraints on investigative journalism.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.5/3">We are pleased that a restrictive law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations was rejected by Kazakhstan's Constitutional Council last year. We are concerned however that non-traditional religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, evangelical Christians and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness have experienced difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.5/4">The internet law, introduced in July 2009, has been strongly criticised both by the EU and by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Representative for Freedom of the Media, Miklos Haraszti, as not being in line with international standards or OSCE commitments. We most recently encouraged the Kazakhs to bring this law into line with international standards during a meeting in London with Kazakhstan's Deputy Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-29">29 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.252W.5/5">Kazakhstan continues to participate in the human rights dialogues established under the EU's Central Asia Strategy, which supports good governance, the rule of law and human rights and to which the UK contributes views. We encouraged Kazakhstan to co-operate closely with the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review earlier this year and will continue to emphasise the importance of a thorough response to the recommendations raised.

It and its predecessor schemes have delivered some 7.5 million key insulation measures to homes in Great Britain since 2002. Energy suppliers are not currently required to report at local authority level where they have installed measures. The Department is currently finalising agreements with the suppliers and the Energy Saving Trust which will enable the reporting of the number of CERT measures professionally installed to a local authority level. It will also allow local authorities to sign agreements with the Energy Saving Trust to see energy efficiency delivery in their local areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.265W.2/2">The Government are working closely with the construction industry to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn. Skill levels and training capability in the industry are protected through the continuing levy arrangements directed by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).</p>
	<p pid="c.265W.2/3">Levy income in 2008 amounted to &#163;181.8 million. Training grant expenditure by the Board amounted to &#163;176.1 million, with a further &#163;23.2 million of support for employers, for instance for subsidised training courses and apprenticeship allowances. In 2008 CITB returned more money in direct financial assistance to employers than they received in levy (&#163;1.10 returned to every &#163;1 of levy received). This high ratio of support has been made possible because CITB has acted on behalf of the Industry to generate income from sources other than the levy.</p>
	<p pid="c.265W.2/4">CITB have been working with Government and partners to address skills issues caused by the recession, for instance by introducing an Apprenticeship Matching Scheme to help redundant trainees in the industry complete their apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="c.265W.2/5">Over the next three years the levy is anticipated to raise between &#163;465 million to &#163;475 million for training in the Construction Sector. Future levy income will enable the CITB to meet the changing skills needs of the sector as it moves out of recession and to meet the challenge of the Government's low-carbon agenda.</p>

	<p pid="c.287W.8/1">The Government are keen for the Post Office to expand its Government services work. One of the major new opportunities in this area is for post offices to act as centres for the capture of biometric data for passports, driving licences, and potentially ID cards. This issue has been actively considered within Government and the Post Office is expected to bid to be a service provider. The Post Office agreed a deal last year with the DVLA to provide a &quot;one-stop&quot; biometric data capture facility at 750 branches around the country and is therefore well placed to provide similar services.</p>

	<p pid="c.294W.2/1">The following tables give the number (table 1) and proportion (table 2) of people aged 16 to 24<sup>(1)</sup> not in education, employment or training (NEET) for each region in England for every quarter for the last five years. These estimates are from the Labour Force Survey, which has been recently reweighted to revised population estimates and therefore may be marginally different from regional NEET estimates provided previously.</p>
	<p pid="c.294W.2/2">As with any sample survey, the LFS is subject to sampling variability and therefore should be viewed in conjunction with their Confidence Intervals (CI). CIs indicate how accurate an estimate is, and for regional estimates they range from +/- 1.5 to +/- 3.9 percentage points (pp), with an average of+/- 2.2pp. CIs for Q4 2009 have been provided below and a 95 per cent. CI of+A-2.2 percentage points (pp) means that the true value is between 2.2pp above the estimate and 2.2pp below the estimate, for 95 per cent. of estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.294W.2/3">The Labour Force Survey sample is not large enough to provide quarterly estimates for small geographies such as local authority areas. We are able to give annual estimates for local authorities from the Annual Population Survey, which has a larger sample. The most recent estimate available is for 2008 and I refer the hon.

	<p pid="c.300W.0/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what methodology the ONS uses to calculate its Mid-Year Population Estimates (320726).</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.0/4" class="indent">The ONS produces annual estimates of the resident population of England and Wales as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June</phrase> each year. ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates are calculated using the cohort component method. This is an established demographic method which is internationally recognised. The method takes the previous year's population estimate, ages the population by one year, adds in the births and takes away the deaths that have taken place during the year and accounts for both international and internal long-term migration. Adjustments are also made for changes to the numbers of armed forces, prisoners and pupils in boarding schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.0/5" class="indent">The annotated flow-chart 'Mid-year Population Estimates: England &amp; Wales' provides a detailed summary of the cohort component method as used by ONS. A copy has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.0/6" class="indent">The Government, and ONS in particular, have invested heavily in improving the sources and methods used to produce the population estimates. The Migration Statistics Improvement Programme has already delivered substantial benefits, including improved methods for population estimates that will be published in May 2010. These are a result of extensive research by ONS and a large scale engagement programme with users.</p>
