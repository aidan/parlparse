	<p pid="a.4W.5/1">Harmony guidelines are measured by average Tour Intervals for units and personnel. Breaches are managed in a number of ways, including through tailoring of force packages to achieve objectives in the most efficient way possible, and sensitive posting and deployment of personnel. Pressure is further alleviated through contributions made by other Allies, which we continue to encourage through the NATO force generation process, and through eventual reductions in UK force commitments elsewhere. Over the longer-term, programmes such as the Future Army Structure will help to bring Tour Intervals in line with Harmony guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.5W.8/1">Personnel known to be suffering from an existing mental health condition are assessed on a case-by-case basis and medically downgraded if necessary. This assessment is made with input from appropriate health professionals, including a Consultant Psychiatrist where necessary. Even those personnel who have been medically downgraded may be fit for deployment on some operations. An assessment of such personnel will be undertaken prior to any decision to deploy them. In making a decision as to the deployability of Service personnel already known to be suffering from a mental health condition, all relevant factors will be taken into account including the severity of the symptoms, the location and duration of the deployment and the nature of the duties to be carried out. Personnel who have not been medically downgraded are, by definition, fit for operational deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.5W.8/2">No specific, formal mental health assessment of personnel is undertaken prior to deployment. However, line managers and commanding officers will routinely monitor their Servicemen and women looking for indications of a mental health condition and whether they would therefore need to be referred for medical opinion.</p>

Complimentary soft drinks should also be made available throughout the flight.

	<p pid="a.10W.3/1">Some cluster munitions remain unexploded through malfunction and leave Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). United Kingdom played an active role at the United Nations in creating a new legally binding protocol on ERW that will offer significant humanitarian benefit to those areas affected. Cluster munitions differ from anti-personnel landmines in a number of ways and the UK has not supported steps to broaden the scope of the Ottawa Convention to include them.</p>

The final decision that the Qinetiq IPO should not include a retail offer was taken in consultation with other Government Departments. It remains the Government's view that a retail offer for Qinetiq would not have offered value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.5/1">It is not possible to provide specific details of the development costs of the Type 45 destroyer as the contracts placed for both the warship and its main weapon system (the Principal Anti-Air Missiles System) cover both development and production phases. As reported in Major Projects Report 2005, we expect the initial acquisition costs of the first six Type 45 destroyers to be &pound;5,896 million as opposed to a figure of &pound;5,475 million when the project was approved originally in 2000. The reasons for cost growth are detailed in successive editions of the Major Projects Report.</p>

Commanders in the field draw upon training guidance relating to precautions to be taken in relation to our own forces when considering safe distances between deployed white phosphorus and non-combatants.

	<p pid="a.41W.8/1">Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff below the senior civil service subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.41W.8/2">Against this background, over 80 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.41W.8/3">The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.41W.8/4">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will result in the normal retirement age in the United Kingdom being 65. As a result employers will not have to justify the decision to retire an employee after that age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of all its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.3/2">There was no system in place to identify poppy fields for destruction between 2001 and late 2003. Since late 2003, however, the UK has supported the Afghans in identifying 35&ndash;50,000 hectares of poppy cultivation annually. Areas identified for possible eradication are determined by a number of factors, including the security situation and the availability of alternative livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.3/3">On the destruction, or eradication, of poppy fields, the UK has provided and continues to provide financial and logistical support to a number of Afghan law enforcement forces. Afghanistan's first comprehensive eradication programme was initiated during the 2004&ndash;05 growing season. Final eradication figures in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) survey for 2005 can be found on the UNODC website at <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html">http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.3/4">UK military forces deployed under International Security Assistance Force can contribute to the broader counter-narcotics effort by providing the secure environment in which the rule of law can be applied; reconstruction can take place; and legal rural livelihoods can be developed. They are not there to take direct action against the drugs trade, including the eradication of poppy fields.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.6/1">DFID's only current bilateral support for alternative livelihoods (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production) is in Afghanistan. Here, DFID's alternative livelihoods programme was developed substantially after full-blown conflict ended in 2001, although terrorist violence continues in parts of the country where we are supporting the Government to promote alternatives to poppy production. DFID also supports a UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project in Myanmar, which aims to support the local population in meeting their food security needs following the banning of opium production.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.6/2">DFID is currently considering assistance to help improve social services and provide livelihoods opportunities for poor people in the southern poor districts of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab in Pakistan. These areas either experience low intensity terrorist violence or share a boundary with conflict areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.6/3">In past years (projects starting in the 1990s), DFID supported alternative livelihoods programmes in Pakistan (&pound;4.4 million) that aimed to reduce poppy cultivation, and in Bolivia (&pound;720,000) and Peru (&pound;3.2 million) that aimed to reduce coca production, including projects led by UN drugs control agencies. A further &pound;16 million was provided in the 1980s and 90s to broader agricultural research projects in non coca-growing areas of Bolivia of which some 10&ndash;20 per cent. may have had an impact on coca-growing households in adjacent areas. Some of these programmes coincided with periods of conflict and terrorist violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.2/1">Afghanistan is the only country where DFID has a bilateral alternative livelihoods programme (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production). The Afghan Government launched its updated National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference in January which sets out the Afghan Governments policies and plans for tackling Afghanistan's narcotics trade for the coming three years and highlights four key priorities. These are (i) targeting the trafficker and trade, (ii) strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods, (iii) developing effective counter-narcotics institutions and (iv) demand reduction. The UK has a three year plan to support this and DFID leads on UK support for alternative livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/2">Between 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 DFID's spending on alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan has increased ten fold. The forecast spend for this year is in the region of &pound;45 million and we hope to maintain similar levels of funding in future years. The DFID livelihoods programme will support the Afghan Government's efforts to mitigate the impact of those who have lost their livelihoods, through the expansion of key Afghan Government National Programmes into priority poppy growing provinces; support programmes to improve farm and off-farm opportunities for poor Afghan farmers and labourers to access legal income from sustainable legal employment, credit productive assets such as infrastructure and social assets such as education and health services, and markets for legal goods; help generate an improved policy and planning environment for alternative livelihood programmes; and support greater financial and technical support from other donors, delivered in a more coherent manner in line with the Afghan Government's policies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/3">The success criterion for alternative livelihoods is a 10 per cent. year-on-year increase in uptake of legal livelihood opportunities. However success is highly dependant on progress with other strands of the National Drug Control Strategy, in particular improving the capacity of counter-narcotics institutions, law enforcement capacity and success in targeting the trafficker and trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/4">The experience from other countries shows that achieving sustainable reductions in drug cultivation takes a long-time. There are no quick solutions. We will continue to support the development of alternative livelihoods as long as there is a need to do so to help the Afghan Government achieve its counter-narcotics objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.2/1">The African Union Mission in Sudan covers the three states of Darfur (Western, Northern and Southern). Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.2/2">Darfur remains highly dependent on food aid. Although this year there is expected to be above average food production, the ability of Darfuris to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas. Even with a good harvest, an estimated 3 million people in Darfur will still require food aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.2/3">The massive scale of the humanitarian relief effort in Darfur has, however, had a major impact on malnutrition rates, dropping to almost half what they were in the previous year. Likewise the recent WHO Darfur survey showed mortality rates have, in cases, reduced by two-thirds since August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.2/4">The UK is the 2nd largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.2/5">However, the situation still remains extremely fragile. I am particularly concerned about the impact that the deteriorating security situation is having on humanitarian operations, especially in South and West Darfur. If aid were reduced because of conflict, insecurity or funding shortages, humanitarian indicators would deteriorate very quickly. That is why improved security and a negotiated political agreement in Abuja are urgently needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.5/1">The UK has been a strong supporter of the African Union (AU) mission in Darfur, providing almost &pound;32 million to date. During my trip to Sudan last week, I announced an additional &pound;20 million in support of the AU mission. The AU has performed well in very challenging circumstances but the deterioration in security in Darfur since the end of 2005 has been marked by an increase in violence and banditry. This change has underlined that a peace support mission will be required for quite some time. This is why the UK supports the proposed transition from an AU force to a UN operation that will be able to provide the long-term stability required. While the final decision on transfer needs to come from the AU, I welcome their agreement in principle on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> and the UN's planning for such a contingency. Any timetable for this transition will depend on negotiations at the AU and UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/2">During my visit to both Darfur (El Fasher) and Khartoum last week, I discussed these issues with both the AU (including the new Force Commander) and the UN. I stressed the importance of the AU force continuing to be fully supported and strengthened right up until any transition date. The role the AU plays in providing support to the humanitarian agencies and protecting civilians is critical to the people of Darfur and there cannot be any winding down of effectiveness in anticipation of the UN arriving. The UK, therefore, in addition to providing substantial funding, is encouraging our international partners to maintain and increase their levels of support to the AU. This includes taking forward the recommendations of the December 2005 Joint Assessment Mission which will assist in strengthening the AU's capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/3">For the future, we support the need for a strong mandate to enable any UN force to protect the people of Darfur and to assist in the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. We are in regular discussions with our donor partners, the UN and the AU on how any transition would be managed and how international partners could assist, including planning and logistical support. We will continue to encourage the UN and the AU force to co-ordinate their work, wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/4">To support the UN in their delivery of humanitarian assistance, in Sudan last week I also announced a &pound;40 million UK contribution to the new Common Humanitarian Fund. This fund will allow the UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator to fund the most important priorities and help to ensure there is greater co-ordination of the humanitarian effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.56W.2/1">There is considerable suffering in Tanzania owing to the present food insecurity. The Government of Tanzania has made effective use of its Strategic Grain Reserve to deliver grain to vulnerable households, although the continuing drought means this is now under pressure. A Rapid Vulnerability Assessment (RVA), conducted by the Government in response to the food and water situation was circulated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>. The RVA found that 3.8 million Tanzanians need food assistance to the tune of 100,000 metric tonnes up to the next expected harvest in May. Of those, around 565,000 are considered destitute and need immediate food aid. DFID stands ready to help the Government respond to this situation. We are consulting with other agencies, notably the World Food Programme, to determine the robustness of the RVA and inform decisions on assistance. DFID's response will be based on a proposal received from the Government of Tanzania, outlining what additional resources it needs from donors, and how it would like them delivered. Other donors are also likely to respond to the Government's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.56W.2/2">In addition, should the EC's Humanitarian Organisation (ECHO) decide to provide assistance to the Government in response to the crisis. DFID would contribute as a member state.</p>
	<p pid="a.56W.2/3">In the longer term, we will be seeking solutions to help reduce vulnerability, through a mix of social protection, such as cash transfer schemes or food for work, and economic opportunities for poorer households to withstand shocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.56W.2/4">Power generation in Tanzania is likely to be based on hydro and thermal sources, both of which are subject to external influences. DFID provides technical support to a Government power sector reform programme through our support to the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission. DFID also funds technical assistance to the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority to encourage private sector investment in power generation and distribution. In the interim, our support to the Government's budget indirectly supports the national electricity utility TANESCO.</p>
