	<p pid="c.978W.5/1">As set out in the document &quot;Decent Homes to Sustainable Communities&quot; there are a range of costs for introducing a &quot;fourth option&quot; depending on how many councils took it up as the approach would have to be fair for all councils. The factors taken into account when estimating the &pound;12 billion were: the extra average investment per dwelling required to give local authorities the same level of investment per dwelling as under stock transfer, and the number of local authority dwellings in 2004-05 that would need this extra investment (number of dwellings sourced from the Business Plan Statistical Appendix 2005).</p>
	<p pid="c.978W.5/2">The estimated increase in investment needed to maintain Housing Associations for local authorities retaining ownership and management, and for those planning transfer but yet to achieve this, was &pound;10,000 per dwelling and for authorities pursuing an Arm's Length Management Organisation (ALMO) the increased cost of investment was &pound;1,500 per dwelling.</p>

Owners' rights in respect of their properties are not affected by the BID legislation.</p>

	<p pid="c.991W.6/1">In the preparation of the interim Thames Gateway Strategic Framework, officials did discuss with stakeholders whether the framework should express a preference for one of the five bids in the Thames Gateway if two or more candidates were shortlisted. No firm conclusion was reached and there was no discussion about supporting a particular bid. After consulting DCMS officials, DCLG officials decided not to take any action to accord priority to the Thames Gateway or a location within it. DCLG Ministers were not involved in any of this process. Greenwich was subsequently selected as the only shortlisted candidate for a regional casino in the Thames Gateway by the Independent Advisory Panel.</p>

	<p pid="c.995W.2/1">Digital Challenge bids were shortlisted according to a number of criteria, including a focus on &quot;socially excluded&quot; groups. In evaluating bids, a focus on ethnic minority groups was not included as a specific criterion, as the effective use of ICT and benefits of digital inclusion cut across the sub-divisions of socially excluded populations including ethnic minority groups. Further information on the 79 proposals received and an analysis is available on the Digital Challenge website:</p>

	<p pid="c.995W.2/3">The Digital Challenge Outline Prospectus made it clear to all bidders submitting proposals that bids should be inclusive and representative of their local communities. We have created an opportunity for organisations, including those representing ethnic minorities, to become engaged in the Digital Challenge process through the Digital Challenge Community Network (DCCN), an interdependent network for public, private, voluntary and academe to rise to the challenge of using ICT and innovation as enablers of digital and social inclusion. Further information on the network and the original prospectus are published on the Digital Challenge website.</p>
	<p pid="c.995W.2/4">It is not possible to definitively state the number of ethnic minority organisations involved in the Digital Challenge process. However, each of the remaining 10 bidders are actively engaging and working with ethnic minority organisations.</p>

This covers all decisions made in respect of homelessness applications to the authority and includes those which were found to be eligible, unintentionally homeless, but not in priority need. These households are not owed a main homelessness duty by the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.1003W.9/18">The 1992 Pension Scheme was further amended in July 2006 to introduce two tier ill-health retirement arrangements. A person is entitled to an upper tier award if incapable of undertaking regular work. Regular employment is defined as meaning employment for 30 hours a week on average over a period of not less than 12 consecutive months. The accrued pension is enhanced. The pension of a person with a lower tier award is not enhanced.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.9/19">Similar provisions will apply in the New Firefighters Pension Scheme 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.9/20">In the period 1994-99, the incidence of ill-health retirements as a percentage of all retirements was 68 per cent. From 1999-2000 to 2004-05 the figures were as shown as follows. Figures for 2005-06 are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1003W.9/21">It is expected that due to the scheme amendments outlined above, figures for 2005-06 and 2006-07 will show a continuing substantial decline.</p>

They report many examples of well managed and maintained sites where the residents live alongside the settled community with no reported tensions. There are numerous examples of site residents becoming involved in local events and, for example, participating in neighbourhood watch schemes. Where tensions with the settled community do occur in particular cases, the Government have provided strong powers for local authorities to address unauthorised camping and antisocial behaviour. It would be wrong to allow a few high-profile cases to distort the overall picture.</p>

	<p pid="c.1018W.0/14">The Government do not produce a forecast for average earnings growth to 2012-13, so for this analysis we have assumed earnings growth in line with the estimated trend growth in labour productivity. See &quot;Budget 2006&quot;, Table B2. We have further assumed growth of retail prices in line with the projections published in &quot;Budget 2006&quot;, Table C3.</p>
	<p pid="c.1018W.0/15">Uprating child benefit by earnings for a period of six years would amount to a cumulative increase of around 12 per cent. compared with uprating by prices. Based on a 60 per cent. contemporary median income threshold, it is estimated that a similar real terms increase implemented today could lower child poverty by between 130,000 and 160,000, depending on the choice of equivalisation scale for household incomes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1019W.8/1">The Chancellor is keen to ensure the Comprehensive Spending Review is fully informed by widespread public engagement on the long-term challenges facing the UK. To analyse these challenges, the Government have undertaken extensive consultation with third sector organizations, services users, frontline professionals, businesses, think-tanks and academics among others. We will be publishing our analysis of the long-term challenges facing the UK later this year, and this will provide the basis for further debate.</p>

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.5/16">These estimates are based on the number of people facing tax liabilities. The 1996-97 to 2003-04 above estimates of taxpayers are based upon the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) and the 2004-05 figures are based upon the 2003-04 SPI projected forward to 2004-05 in line with Budget 2006 assumptions. Estimates of half of mean and median income are at individual level and have been derived from the Family Resource Survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.5/17">Some families have their tax liabilities offset by tax credits. Estimates based on the 2003-04 Family Resource Survey (FRS) show that there were:</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.5/18" class="indent">around 3.8 million taxpaying families with income at or below half the mean. Of these, around 0.4 million families were entitled to more tax credits than their income tax liabilities;</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.5/19" class="indent">and around 1.4 million taxpaying families with income at or below half the median. Of these, around 0.2 million families were entitled to more tax credits than their income tax liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.5/20">Caution should be exercised in drawing trends from these figures because sample estimates can demonstrate a large variability from year to year and the definitions of income from the two surveys are not necessarily the same.</p>

	<p pid="c.1043W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/2">The increase in the tax credits income disregard is part of a package of measures announced in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report. The Government have always been more confident about the overall cost of the PBR package which is based on the total level of overpayments. The estimates were based on data from the first year of the system and provisional information from the second year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/3">The Exchequer effect of the changes to the tax credit system depends crucially on the source of overpayments. At that stage there was only limited information available on the sources of overpayments as HMRC only had complete data on 2003-04 overpayments, which were not representative of the system in steady state. This difficulty in accessing good quality data in the past made costing the individual elements of the package difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/4">However following publication of the 2004-05 overpayment statistics in May 2006, HMRC now has two years of overpayment statistics to inform this costing. And crucially, unlike in 2003-04, awards in 2004-05 were based on the previous year's income making them much more representative of future years awards. In addition the first stage of the finalisation process for 2005-06 was completed in August 2006, adding to this body of knowledge. This additional information has not led the Government to change the costing of the disregard&mdash;or the package as a whole&mdash;however it has allowed it to feel more confident in the costing of the individual elements of the package.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/5">There are still some uncertainties surrounding the costing. In particular it remains the case that while the overall cost of the package is not affected by the order with which the changes are modelled, these interactions mean that the costs of the individual elements of the package are affected by the assumed order.</p>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/6">Subject to these uncertainties, the costing of the &pound;25,000 disregard over the period 2006-07 to 2010-11 is provided as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/9"> <td colspan="2"><i> Exchequer effect (&pound; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/10"> <td></td> <td><i> Income disregard of &pound;25,000</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/11"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>-50</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/12"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>-100</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/13"> <td>2008-09</td> <td>-150</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/14"> <td>2009-10</td> <td>-250</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1043W.6/15"> <td>2000-11</td> <td>-300</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1043W.6/18">One needs to carefully distinguish between the change in claimants' entitlement from the change in the disregard and the cost to the Exchequer. The cost of the disregard is not the change in entitlement, but the forgone recovery of overpayments. The basic principle is that when money is paid out to tax credit claimants, it scores as a cost to the Exchequer. On the other hand, when any overpaid tax credits are recovered, there is a yield. The higher disregard does not necessarily affect the amount of money paid out to claimants in any one year. But by reducing the amount of overpayments, the higher disregard will mean there is less money to be recovered in future years. Hence the profile of costs shown above.</p>

	<p pid="c.1062W.2/1">The Education Act 1996 places a duty on local education authorities (LEAs) to make arrangements for transport where it is necessary to ensure a child's attendance at school. LEAs have wide discretion in deciding whether transport is necessary, but case law requires them to provide free home to school transport for pupils of compulsory school age who are attending their nearest suitable school, provided that the school is beyond 'statutory walking distance'. In addition, many LEAs use their discretionary powers to provide transport to school in circumstances where they are under no legal obligation to do so. The law requires LEAs to publish their transport policies covering support provided under their statutory duties and discretionary powers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1062W.2/2">Where LEAs make arrangements using their discretionary powers, they are free to consult on and change those policies. While there is no legislation governing the conduct of such consultations, good practice suggests that consultations should involve all interested parties, with consultations taking place during term time. Guidance issued by the Department for Education and Skills states that good practice suggests that any changes should be brought in at the end of the school year, and that they should be phased in as pupils change or leave schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.1062W.2/3">The position is however different if a school bus service is a local service receiving a subsidy from the local transport authority. The Transport Act 1985 requires local transport authorities, when considering policies on subsidised bus services, to consult other authorities who may be affected by those policies and bus operators in their area. There are no specific requirements as to how they should do this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1062W.2/4">In developing their bus strategies and accessibility strategies, local authorities also need to consider the passenger transport needs in their areas, and consultation with various stakeholders can play a part in this.</p>

	<p pid="c.1067W.0/1">The Government have consulted closely with the Chairman and chief executive of British Waterways (BW) on the financial pressures facing the Department and what these mean for its sponsored bodies. The Secretary of State and I met recently with the chief executive of BW to listen to his concerns. A further meeting between the Chairman, chief executive and myself is planned for later this month. This will look further at the implications for the adjustments in subsidy and how BW can continue to contribute towards Government and DEFRA priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1067W.0/2">In order to accommodate budgetary pressures, all areas of the Department's spend have been subject to rigorous scrutiny as part of a budget review. The review was comprehensive in nature and has ensured that DEFRA's funding for the current year is placed where it can have the greatest impact. As a matter of good financial management, DEFRA keeps its budgets and spending under regular review and challenge and adjusts them as new pressures and demands arise. The overall budget for the Department remains unchanged and will be subject to the normal Parliamentary approval and scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="c.1067W.0/3">Grant allocation for 2006-07 for BW was originally confirmed as &pound;59.429 million and they were notified of this in April 2006. However, the July in-year review of budgets brought a further cut of approximately 7 per cent. Final grant allocation for 2006/07 will therefore be &pound;55.497 million. Allocations for 2007-08 will be issued shortly, following further engagement between the Secretary of State and the Chairs of our key delivery partners, including BW.</p>
	<p pid="c.1067W.0/4">The taxpayer would not expect DEFRA to consult Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) every time there were financial pressures. We seek to manage the pressures that inevitably arise from time to time from within the annual budget voted by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1067W.0/5">Allocations beyond 2008 to 2011 are dependent on the outcome of the current comprehensive spending review (CSR) which is scheduled to conclude by summer of 2007. Consultation will take place with HMT as dictated by the CSR timetable. However, officials are in discussion with BW about the potential for a long-term contract within the context of the CSR period.</p>

	<p pid="c.1069W.0/1">The Government are fully committed to raising product standards and encouraging consumers to use the most energy efficient domestic appliances. Progress is being made by a combination of policy measures including product information (energy labels), minimum standards, and the promotion of best practice. The Market Transformation Programme (MTP), which supports the development and implementation of UK Government policy on sustainable products, is in the process of applying detailed policy action plans for each sector. They will set out an innovation roadmap by which the Government and industry can work together to deliver more sustainable products. Further information on the MTP's work on domestic appliances is available at: <a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/2">In June, Defra hosted the 2006 Energy Efficiency in Domestic Appliances and Lighting Conference (EEDAL 06) to advance international co-operation and new initiatives on energy efficient domestic appliances. Further details on the EEDAL 06 can be found at: <a href="http://www.livegroup.co.uk/EEDAL">http://www.livegroup.co.uk/EEDAL</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/3">A major revision of the Building Regulations in April 2006 raised overall energy efficiency standards and changed the method of showing compliance to align with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This new approach and associated calculation tools encourage the use of low carbon technologies such as solar panels and wind generators. However, because Building Regulations are written in terms of functional requirements, individual technologies are not specified.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/4">The Building Regulations set minimum standards for new construction but the Government are encouraging builders to do more. The Code for Sustainable Homes will set standards for new developments above those currently prescribed by the Building Regulations. The code will not be mandatory across all housing sectors, although all new publicly-funded development will need to meet code level 3. In order to further promote on-site energy generation, new homes that use renewable technology will gain extra points in the code.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/5">We are also reviewing the planning rules with a view to reducing the restrictions for small scale renewable systems. The Government also fund a grant scheme, run by the Energy Savings Trust, to encourage the voluntary take-up of renewable energy. This will provide industry with manufacturing, supply and installation experience, increase public awareness and drive down the market cost of renewables.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/6">Since 2001, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has funded a number of research projects under both its former Partners in Innovation Construction Research Programme, and more latterly under the DTI Technology Programme, aiming to assist the construction sector in its transition to the use of technologies to minimise the impact of climate change on buildings.</p>

	<p pid="c.1070W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.9/2">I have assumed that the references to regulations relate to the food hygiene legislation applicable to milk and dairy products establishments. Beyond hygiene, milk and dairy products are, as with other foods, required to be compliant with general food law and legislation including labelling, contaminants, additives and composition. Information relating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for the devolved administrations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.9/3">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that between 1997 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> the hygiene legislation under which milk and dairy products establishments were regulated in England was the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 (as amended) and the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations 1959 (as amended). On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, new and directly applicable EC food hygiene legislation came into effect which superseded this legislation (Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 and Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004).</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.9/4">The Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate (DHI) is part of the State Veterinary Service (an executive agency of DEFRA) and acts on behalf of the agency in administering and enforcing the hygiene legislation at registered milk production holdings prior to processing such as pasteurisation, bottling or the manufacture of dairy products. Local authorities enforce the regulations in establishments undertaking activities in relation to milk beyond the remit of the DHI and the remainder of the dairy industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.9/5">The Agency has obtained information from the DHI relating to inspections of registered milk production holdings carried out in England during the period requested, which is set out in the table. I am advised that information is not collected in such a way that allows it to be presented by region.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.8/1">The main threats facing rhinoceroses are loss of habitat and illegal poaching for their horn which is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. To address the threat to the species from international, commercial trade, the black rhino has been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1977. The UK has consequently banned all trade in rhinoceros products.</p>

We have also funded recent research into plant alternatives to traditional Chinese medicine ingredients like rhinoceros horn and tiger bone (&pound;67,500).

	<p pid="c.1073W.6/1">Following completion of the Spending Review in 2004, the Environment Agency (EA) was given a provisional budget for DEFRA funding of &pound;575 million for 2006-07 (including Flood Defence, Fisheries and Environment Protection). After the budget setting exercise the total 2006-07 DEFRA funding to the EA was confirmed, at the beginning of the financial year, as &pound;571 million. A budget reduction of &pound;23.7 million has been applied in-year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.6/2">Managing the budget changes to minimise their impacts is a matter for the EA Board. After consideration, the EA has decided to reduce and delay a range of projects across its business areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1074W.2/1">The Environment Agency (EA) first produced an indicative floodplain map for the whole of England and Wales in 1999. This indicated that about 1.8 million properties were at risk from flooding from rivers and the sea. The EA has continued to improve its maps, and in October 2004 published a new Flood Map on the internet, which included the flood zones defined in the Department for Communities and Local Government's land use planning policy. Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 defines the &quot;high risk&quot; flood zone as having an annual probability of flooding of 1.0 per cent. (or 1 in 100 in any one year) or greater for river flooding, and 0.5 per cent. (or 1 in 200 for any one year) or greater for tidal and coastal flooding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/2">There are estimated to be about 1.83 million properties across England and Wales within this definition of a &quot;high risk&quot; flood zone, which equates to approximately 3.5 million people. This figure has not changed significantly over the last 10 years; changes in the figure arise from improvements in the EA's flood mapping and changes in the land use in these areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1074W.8/2">Work undertaken by the Building Research Establishment for the Department indicates that putting clocks in the UK back one hour (to match Central European time) would lead to a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions from lighting, space heating and cooling energy consumption in UK buildings corresponding to around 1 per cent. of total UK emissions of carbon dioxide. The study also shows that a switch to British summertime all the year round would increase emissions by just under 0.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1076W.8/1">Licensing decisions on the commercial use of genetically modified (GM) products are taken at EU level. A type of GM oilseed rape known as GT73 received a favourable authorisation decision in August 2005 for import and processing within the EU, although not cultivation. This was under the procedures covered by Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.</p>

	<p pid="c.1077W.2/1">No specific assessment has been made. However, a report from the DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme states that recycling in the UK saves 10 to 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gases a year. This is equivalent to taking 3.5 million cars off the road.</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/2">In July 2005, DEFRA published the document, 'Changes to Waste Management Decision Making Principles in Waste Strategy 2000', which put forward a number of principles on which waste decision making should be based:</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Individuals communities and organisations should take responsibility for their waste;</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) In taking decisions there should be consideration of alternative options in a systematic way;</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Effective community engagement should be an important and integral part of the decision making process;</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) The environmental impacts for possible options should be assessed looking at both the long and short term.</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/7">These considerations are reflected in Planning Policy Statement 10 (PPS 10), published by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Guidance on PPS10 was published in June this year following a series of seminars with interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.2/8">The Government also encourage all local authorities to have in place a fit-for-purpose and up-to-date municipal waste management strategy to assist their waste management planning. DEFRA has produced guidance on how to prepare a waste management strategy, which is available from the DEFRA website:</p>

	<p pid="c.1084W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.5/2">I understand from the Food Standards Agency that operators of abattoirs pay charges for meat hygiene official controls either on the basis of standard European Community fees for animal throughput, or on the basis of the cost of the controls if this would provide a lower charge. In 2005-06, about 95 per cent. of operators of abattoirs paid charges for hygiene controls based on European Community fees for animal throughput. These fees have not been increased since they were introduced in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.5/3">The other 5 per cent. of abattoir operators, mainly of the largest abattoirs, pay charges based on the cost of the meat hygiene official controls that are carried out. These charges include an element for veterinary costs in addition to the costs of other classes of official control staff and overheads. The veterinary cost element of the charge in Great Britain comprises the cost of veterinarians employed by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) or the cost of veterinary services provided under contracts that are let competitively by the MHS and are individual to each abattoir. The veterinary cost element of meat hygiene charges for services provided by veterinarians employed by the MHS increased by approximately 24 per cent. from 2002-03 to 2006-07. The change in the average cost of contract veterinarians in the last five years could not be obtained without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1085W.0/2">The first sentence contained the words 'per annum'. This was incorrect and the correct answer should read as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/3">The target of the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) Real Nappy programme target was to convert an additional 155,000 households to real nappy use by April 2006, and in the process divert 35,000 tonnes per annum of disposable nappy waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/4">The rest of the answer remains correct and is detailed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1085W.0/5">WRAP reports annually on its overall progress in meeting targets, including work under the Real Nappy Programme. It is scheduled to report on its achievements for the business plan period up to 2006 soon. At the outset of the programme, 91 per cent. of expectant parents said they intended to use disposable nappies. Work done for the Environment Agency suggested the figure may be higher at 94 per cent. WRAP intends to survey parents again at the end of the programme and to establish the change in intended behaviour. An estimate of the diversion will be made and published by WRAP at that time taking account of the survey and other quantitative evidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.5/1">As the previous answer indicated, central Government will not be providing on-going support to Citizens Advice Bureaux in the UK and has therefore not carried out an assessment of support options for the bureaux. Approximately half the current support comes from local authorities that offer time-limited support agreements with possibility of renewal (but no guarantees).</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.5/2">A recent review of the Department's funding of Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland concluded that there were advantages in having a mix of core funding and short-term project support. This can provide stability with the ability to be innovative and flexible to meet changing needs. I will be considering the report's recommendations as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review planning process.

The Law Society have advised that, unless full information was given to the miner at the start of the case that most firms of solicitors did not make additional charges in these cases, any charges the solicitor makes to the claimant is likely to give rise to a finding of inadequate professional service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.8/2">Claimants are also advised that the Law Society has a Helpline (0845 608 6565) which claimants may contact with any complaints about individual firms of solicitors.

	<p pid="c.1094W.2/1">Currently sections 137 and 138 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 regulate extortionate credit bargains. These ensure that where bargains are extortionate, the courts may reopen the credit agreement and set aside the whole or part of any obligation on the debtor, require the creditor to repay the whole or part of the sums paid, return surety or alter the terms of the agreement. These provisions will be replaced by a test of whether a credit relationship is unfair when the Consumer Credit Act 2006 comes into force. This will enable the courts to take into account all the circumstances of the relationship between the borrower and lender, not just the terms of the agreement when it was made. The new Act will also strengthen the test of fitness to hold a consumer credit licence and provide the Office of Fair Trading with greater powers to take action against lenders who do not behave in a fit and proper manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.2/2">In addition, we have already introduced new legislation to ensure that consumers are more aware of the terms and conditions associated with any credit agreement before they sign. This increase in transparency will enable consumers to shop around with confidence, choosing the right product to suit their needs.</p>

The ODA has appointed consultants who, in consultation with Olympic stakeholders, sporting bodies and the local community, are scoping the different possible legacy uses for the stadium with a view to drawing up a business plan for future use of the stadium.

Examples of this can be seen across the country, such as the Lowry in Salford, the Sage in Newcastle-Gateshead and the Bellenden Renewal area in Peckham, South London. My Department's publication &quot;Culture at the Heart of Regeneration&quot; highlighted how culture can drive regeneration by reviving town centres, drawing communities together and promoting economic development. The role of culture in regeneration has been strengthened by a Joint Agreement on Sustainable Communities, signed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, my Department and a number of its key non-departmental public bodies in July this year.</p>

Our support to the education sector has been channelled through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). This plays a big part in meeting the recurrent costs such as wages and salaries of teachers and school materials. ARTF resources cover over 90 per cent. of the Ministry of Education's wage bill and teachers' salaries represent almost 40 per cent. of ARTF recurrent expenditures.

	<p pid="c.1117W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, in what proportion of Child Support Agency cases non-resident parents who owe maintenance have (a) made no payments in the last six months, and (b) never made any payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.5/5" class="indent">In the six months to June 2006, 69% of cases where maintenance was due had either received a payment via the collection service or had a Maintenance Direct arrangement in place. 31% of cases had received no payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.5/6" class="indent">Unfortunately it is not possible to provide information for part (b) for the Old Scheme as the data only goes back to August 1995 and is therefore incomplete. However, in the month ending June 2006, the Agency had received payments from 74 per cent of cases on the new scheme where maintenance payments were due, via the collection service, or cases had Maintenance Direct arrangement in place. 26 per cent of current new scheme cases have never received any payments.</p>

To ensure that optimum use is made of the specialist services offered by smaller providers we facilitate the interface between contractors and sub-contractors through a variety of means, including discussions with trade associations, and notices placed on the Jobcentre Plus website <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a> (Partners page).</p>
	<p pid="c.1121W.6/20" class="indent">As part of the tender evaluation process, we ask bidders to tell us how they will fully meet the varied needs of all customers; it is generally unlikely that any one provider could adequately demonstrate their ability to meet all of these needs without some specialist support. We also ask providers to give details of all their sub-contractors in their tenders and we take into account the skills and experience of the sub-contractors during the tender assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1122W.2/1">Specific information regarding low income for Great Britain is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95-2004-05&quot;. The survey from which estimates are provided started in 1994-95. There are no suitable data source for years prior to 1994-95.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/2">Deciles are income values which divide households, when ranked by income, into ten equal-sized groups. No matter what the shape of the income distribution, or how well off or poor people are, there will always be 10 per cent. of the whole population in the bottom decile, just as there will always be 10 per cent. of the whole population in the top decile; and this will be the case in every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/3">The low income threshold is 60 per cent. of median income (Before Housing Costs). This particular threshold is an internationally accepted measure and in Great Britain is almost always in the 2nd decile. Therefore children can be moved above the low income threshold, but still remain in the 2nd decile, and so there will be no change in the figures showing decile distributions from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.2/4">Estimates of the proportion of children living in families in each income decile in each year 1994-95 to 2004-05, are in the following tables. Figures are shown Before and After Housing Costs.</p>

The lowest decile group is the 10 per cent. of the population with the lowest household incomes. The second decile group contains children whose household incomes are above the lowest decile point but below the second decile point. Successive deciles follow similarly.  2. The percentages by decile are based on the equivalised incomes of households with children.

The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out are currently hard to predict and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets and different sizes of property.</p>

	<p pid="c.1127W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Gentleman with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/3" class="indent">You recently tabled the following Parliamentary Question:</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/4" class="indent">To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, when his Department will process the mortgage interest relief benefit claim which Mr Thompson of Great Headline Crescent Paignton submitted in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/5" class="indent">The Secretary of State asked me to reply to your question and, in that reply, I promised to write to you directly concerning your constituent Mr Thompson of Headline Crescent, Paignton.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/6" class="indent">I should begin by explaining that mortgage interest relief benefit is not a stand-alone benefit, but forms part of a customer's entitlement to Income Support (IS). In cases where a customer's mortgage was taken out after October 1995, they would not ordinarily qualify for assistance with their mortgage interest payments for the first 39 weeks of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/7" class="indent">Mr Thompson claimed IS on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>. When his claim was assessed we decided that he was not entitled to IS at this time as without his mortgage interest payments being taken into account his household income exceeded his IS entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/8" class="indent">Following your enquiry we reviewed Mr Thompson's claim and found that we had overlooked the fact that he had a current claim for Incapacity Benefit dating from <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-08">8 May 2005</phrase> for which he was receiving National Insurance credits. The effect of this claim was that his mortgage interest payments should have been taken into account from the start of the claim to IS he made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>. I have asked for Mr Thompson's entitlement to be reviewed to establish if he now qualifies for IS or mortgage interest relief from this date, and I am sorry for any inconvenience or distress Mr Thompson has been caused.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.5/9" class="indent">When Mr Thompson submitted his claim for IS on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase> he requested that we consider backdating this to <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May 2005</phrase>. We wrote to Mr Thompson on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-27">27 July 2006</phrase> requesting further information to enable us to consider this request.

This includes securing the gains we have made against pensioner poverty into the future, through our commitment to continue uprating the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit with earnings into the long term.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.2/1">The Government have introduced a suite of measures since 1997 to help older people enjoy a better standard of living, most notably the introduction of the minimum income guarantee and then pension credit; the creation of a dedicated Pension Service to improve service delivery and actively promote take-up of entitlements; above-inflation increases in the basic state pension; winter fuel payments for people over 60; and free television licences for people over 75. The value of the safetynet we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by a third in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.2/2">Between 1996-97 and 2004-05 the number of pensioners in Great Britain in relative low income, after housing costs, has fallen by over a third, from 2.8 million to 1.8 million. Once housing costs are accounted for, a pensioner today is now less likely to be in low income than any one else in society.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.2/3">The White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; (Cm 6841) announced our commitment to secure these gains into the future by uprating both the basic state pension and the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit in line with earnings over the long term.</p>

	<p pid="c.1137W.2/2">Assumptions on earnings growth used in the White Paper are in line with economic assumptions described in the Budget 2006 Financial Statement and Budget Report, where earnings are assumed to increase in real terms at a rate of two per cent. per year in the longer term. The Government currently use the calculation of average earnings indices from the Office for National Statistics to uprate social security benefits such as the pension credit standard minimum guarantee. We expect to use average earnings as the index for uprating the basic state pension but will keep the exact measure to be used under review. We will set out our proposals on personal accounts later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1137W.5/1">Under our reforms, more people will be receiving state pensions based on their national insurance records, and there will be a more generous basic state pension due to the restoration of the earnings link. This will provide a solid foundation for private saving. The guarantee credit will continue to provide a safety net and reforms to the savings credit will reduce the spread of means testing and support the savings incentives, which are integral to the reform package.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/2">For the median earner illustrated in figure 8, and in today's earnings terms:</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> Under current policies, total contributory state pension (basic state pension and state second pension) would be around &pound;100 a week at state pension age, before any deductions for tax. Under a system with an earnings uprated guarantee credit from 2008, a non-saver would also be entitled to claim pension credit worth about &pound;49 a week, while a saver would be entitled to claim pension credit worth about &pound;36 a week, on top of their &pound;34 a week private pension savings. A saver would have a total state and private income, net of pension credit, of around &pound;170 a week at state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Under White Paper reforms, total contributory state pension (basic state pension and state second pension) would be around &pound;139 a week at state pension age (before any deductions for tax). Whether they were a non-saver or a saver their income would be above the qualifying threshold for pension credit, so they would not see any reduction in the net value of state payments if they chose to make private pension savings. Under current assumptions, their private pension savings would be worth &pound;80 a week, giving a saver total state and private income, net of pension credit, of around &pound;219 a week at state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/5" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/6" class="indent">1. Values are forecasts only. They are dependent upon future assumptions of price and earnings growth, and consequently are subject to revision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/7" class="indent">2. Numbers are shown in 2005-06 earnings terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/8" class="indent">3. Private pension outcomes are forecast using the assumption that under current policy, individuals save using a stakeholder pension at the rate of 3.9 per cent. (the average amount saved currently) and the annual management charge is 1.5 per cent. Under White Paper reforms savings rates are 7 per cent. with a management charge of just 0.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/9" class="indent">4. Projections under current policies assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold; and continued price uprating of the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.1137W.5/10" class="indent">5. The White Paper reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper and measures to simplify state second pension from 2012.</p>

	<p pid="c.1141W.6/2">There are approximately 430 coroners' officers in England and Wales. Around 90 per cent. are employed by police forces with the remaining 10 per cent. employed by local authorities. I am not aware of any officers employed directly by the coroner, although some coroners directly employ other support staff. The draft Bill should not directly impact on the number of coroners' officers. Providing the coroner service is currently being resourced locally, there should be no requirement arising from the draft Bill to increase the number of coroners' officers in a particular area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1141W.9/2">The draft Coroner Bill regulatory impact assessment (RIA) published in June this year assessed the costs and benefits of a unified national coroner service consisting of coroners, coroners' officers and other support staff. The RIA estimated the total cost of the unified national service as requiring an additional &pound;17 million per year in annual costs and &pound;31 million in set-up costs. Having assessed the costs and benefits carefully, the Government take the view that the benefits of a unified national coroner service do not justify the costs, and the proposals outlined in the current draft Bill provide better value for money.</p>

The safeguards are provided by the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act 1998, which balance individuals' privacy rights with the need for organisations to use personal data for legitimate purposes. However, we wish to ensure that, as more data are shared, the level of protection reflects the potential risks. We have been consulting on a possible amendment to the Data Protection Act to strengthen the penalties for those who deliberately or recklessly obtain or disclose personal data.

'The Good Practice Guidance on ASDs', which my Department and the Department of Health published in 2002, includes pointers to good practice on addressing these children's behavioural needs.

	<p pid="c.1159W.2/1">The Department does not have a specific policy on the display or wearing of religious artefacts, nor has there been a single disciplinary case related to this issue. There is a comprehensive dispute resolution process which is used for matters of misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="c.1159W.2/2">The Department's policy is to raise awareness of equality and diversity through its diversity delivery plan and also through a number of other measures. We have had in place since 1999 prayer rooms for Muslim staff and with the introduction of the 'Religion and Belief' legislation in 2003; we have arranged for the provision of quiet rooms for prayer and contemplation across all our sites. In addition, to support managers in the Department, we published guidance on major festivals for example, Ramandan, Yom Kippur and Diwali&mdash;which supports one of our objectives of raising awareness amongst all staff and ensuring that we create an inclusive culture.</p>

However, since 2004, the Department for Education and Skills have collected data on pupils by type of SEN as part of the annual school census. Dyslexia is included within specific learning difficulties (SpLD) - which also covers dyscalculia and dyspraxia. We have data on pupils with SEN at School Action Plus and with a statement of SEN where SpLD is recorded as their primary need. The number of pupils with specific learning difficulties at West Somerset county college in 2006 is in the table below. We do not have data on pupils whose needs are met at 'School Action'.</p>

	<p pid="c.1165W.2/1">Each year the Department publishes statistics by local authority in England covering matters like the numbers of children with special educational needs (SEN) and placements for those with SEN statements. The SEN and disability tribunal publishes data annually on appeals registered with the tribunal and break these down by local authority. In addition, the Department collects information on planned expenditure by local authorities on SEN.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.2/2">Ofsted's 2004 report on inclusive schools found &quot;a picture of continuing variability&quot; in how well mainstream schools are enabling pupils with SEN to be included effectively in the full range of educational opportunity. Ofsted's more recent report Inclusion: &quot;does it matter where pupils are taught?&quot; (July 2006) found that: &quot;there was little difference in the quality of provision and outcomes for pupils across primary, secondary and special schools. However, mainstream schools with additionally resourced provision were particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils academically, socially and personally. [Pupil Referral Units] were the least successful.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.2/3">The Department's team of SEN advisers visits each local authority. The team's latest overview report (October 2006) says that &quot;significant progress has been made in implementing &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement [the Government's SEN strategy] by the majority of local authorities in England&quot;. The Government's response to the Education and Skills Committee's report on SEN announced that Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools has been asked to review progress in implementing the SEN strategy in 2009/10 and that the Government would consider whether any changes were needed to the SEN framework in the light of the chief inspector's findings.</p>

	<p pid="c.1168W.3/1">The collection of data on the users of tribunals is a matter for the Tribunals Service. The Department will discuss with the Department for Constitutional Affairs issues concerning the background of those who use the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.3/2">Although there are no data on the socio-economic backgrounds of parents appealing to SENDIST, its annual report includes a breakdown of appeals by local authority. There does not appear to be any clear link to economic circumstance between the local authorities with relatively high and relatively low levels of appeals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.3/3">Parents and guardians of children with special educational needs have equal access to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal (SENDIST). There are no direct costs in appealing to the Tribunal. The service is free and the Tribunal reimburses parents and their witnesses for travel expenses. Witnesses can also receive a standard allowance towards loss of earnings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.3/4">SENDIST aims to provide an accessible, supportive and helpful service to parents of children with special educational needs and to avoid formality in its proceedings as much as possible. Many parents do need help making and pursuing an appeal to SENDIST and the Tribunal provides details of some organisations that can help parents in their appeal booklet. It also provides information in a range of accessible formats, including Braille and large print, tape and video.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.3/5">Foster carers can appeal to SENDIST on behalf of children in their care and they would be expected to do so where this is appropriate. The local authority, as the corporate parent for these children, has a duty to promote their educational achievement and should always ensure that children in its care receive excellent support to meet their needs, including any special educational needs. The recent Green Paper &quot;Care Matters&quot; sets out proposals for a new independent advocate role to support children in care, alongside a national framework of skills and qualifications for carers. The present consultation will explore how these and other proposals in the Green Paper might be used to ensure children in care with special educational needs receive the right support for them.</p>

	<p pid="c.1169W.2/2">The Child Protection Database, maintained by the Commission for Social Care Inspection, provides the following data on the numbers of confirmed Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), following the death of a child, in each local authority since 2000. Accurate data prior to 2000 are not available. We do not hold information on dates of publication. The following table includes only those authorities where a child death has led to a confirmed SCR and provides an overall total for between 2000-05. SCRs were commissioned by Area Child Protection Committees (ACPCs) throughout the period covered by the table. ACPCs were nearly all based on local authority boundaries but there were a few areas in England where an ACPC covered two or more local authorities with social services functions. In order to maintain the confidentiality of individual children who were the subject of a SCR, x denotes fewer than three SCRs. The data for 2006 is not yet complete.</p>

	<p pid="c.1171W.2/1">There are no resources specifically targeted at implementing the single equality scheme as it does not make any additional requirements on institutions. Higher education institutions are individually subject to the requirements of equality legislation and the single equality scheme is designed to complement the work that is taking place and to offer support and guidance where needed. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) also funds the Equality Challenge Unit to support the HE sector in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1171W.2/2">In allocating &pound;6.5 billion to HEFCE this year to distribute between higher education providers, we drew particular attention to the responsibilities institutions have in relation to equal opportunities and said we expected to see them continuing to contribute fully in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.1176W.9/12">The increase in expenditure in 2004-05 was due to essential redecoration which is part of an ongoing programme of works required to maintain the fabric of a Grade 1 listed building.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.9/13">The increase in expenditure in 2005-06 was partly due to the fitting of disabled toilets on the ground floor and the redecoration of the basement areas. These toilets were built in order to comply with accessibility requirements under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Also included in this figure is the cost of redecoration works to the basement of the building and essential works to remove asbestos from the site. These measures are also part of an on-going programme of works.</p>

	<p pid="c.1177W.2/18">The rise in expenditure on training since 1997-98 can be explained by the increase in the number of staff working in the Department.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-11-07c.96020.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-11-07c.1180W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" speakername="Patrick McFadden" colnum="1180W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/text/61107w0043.htm#06110919000240">
	<p pid="c.1180W.8/1">The Cabinet Office participated in the inter-departmental review of ill-health retirement in the public sector, the report of which was published by Her Majesty's Treasury in May 2000. The civil service's approach to the recommendations of this report was set out in an action plan which included the setting of ill-health retirement targets for participating Departments. These targets required Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) employers to reduce ill-health retirement rates, by 2005, to no more than 3.72 per 1,000 staff; a higher rate of 4.84 per 1,000 staff was set for the Prison Services. Active management by employers resulted in the target being met and, for the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">Friday 31 March 2006</phrase>, the overall ill-health retirement rate for employers generally was 1.76 per 1,000 staff and the rate for the Prison Services was 3.40 per 1,000 staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.8/2">The PCSPS provides ill-health pensions to members who are assessed by the scheme's independent medical adviser as being permanently incapable, by reason of ill-health, from carrying out their job. Qualifying members receive their accrued pension benefits paid immediately on an unreduced basis. Additionally, depending on the section of the scheme the member belongs to, the individual's length of service and the severity of their incapacity, reckonable service may be enhanced. The introduction of new pension terms for new entrants from October 2000 provided an opportunity to differentiate between those whose breakdown in health renders them incapable of any gainful employment and those who are incapable of carrying out their own job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.8/3">Most civil servants joining the civil service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase> can, as an alternative to joining the PCSPS, opt for a partnership pension account which is a stakeholder arrangement with an employer contribution. The conditions for ill-health retirement are as for members of the PCSPS but the member receives a lump sum of 20 per cent. of pay per year of service rather than an ongoing annual pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.8/4">Information about the number of members who retire early on the grounds of ill health as a percentage of all retirements for the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme for the period from October 2002 onwards is shown in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1180W.8/7"> <td><i> Period</i></td> <td><i> Ill health retirements as a percentage of total retirements</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1180W.8/8"> <td>October 2002-March 2003</td> <td>12.6</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1184W.13/1">This year's increase in cultivation detailed in the UN Office on Drugs and Crime survey is very disappointing. The increase is due to a substantial increase in planting in Helmand and other Southern Provinces. 70 per cent. of the 61,000 hectare increase is in Helmand Province and 92 per cent. in the Southern Provinces of Helmand, Uruzgan, Dai Kundi and Zabul. This is worrying, but reflects the very difficult security situation and limited law enforcement capability in these provinces. Elsewhere, where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases fallen. This year has also seen the adoption of vital counter narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 280 traffickers, an increase in drugs related seizures and the completion this autumn of a high security prison for serious drug offenders. This is encouraging and shows that the Afghans' National Drug Control Strategy is starting to have an impact. We must continue to help the Afghans sharpen delivery on the ground in order to bring about a sustainable reduction in cultivation and trafficking across the country as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="c.1186W.2/1">Elections in Bangladesh are scheduled for January 2007. It is vital for the future of Bangladesh that these elections are seen to be free, fair and peaceful, and that the result reflects the will of the Bangladeshi people. International observers will have an important role to play in validating the outcome of the elections&mdash;the UK expects to participate in an EU observation mission. We shall continue to take a close interest in preparations for elections and stand ready to help where we can. But ultimately it is for the parties and the people of Bangladesh to make their elections a success. We look to the new caretaker government to carry out its functions in an impartial manner, in line with Bangladesh's constitution and in the best interests of the Bangladeshi people. We look to the Election Commission to act in a competent and independent manner. We call on the political parties to demonstrate leadership by publicly calling for peace and restraint. We expect the security forces to perform their duties with respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="c.1188W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-08">8 August 2006</phrase>, the UN Secretary-General published a report (no. A/61/132) relating to the draft UN Resolution on the &quot;Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba&quot;. This report contains entries from certain Governments and UN agencies who believe that the Cuban economy has been damaged by the US embargo. We agree that, alongside Cuban domestic policies, the US embargo has hampered the economic development of Cuba. We have made this clear through our vote every year against the US embargo on Cuba at the UN General Assembly. In particular, the UK/EU opposes the extraterritorial extension of the US embargo.</p>

	<p pid="c.1189W.2/2">The US has recently announced its intention to more rigorously enforce its trade embargo against Cuba, primarily by setting up a task force to penalise those who engage in US prohibited activities (e.g. travel, trade) with Cuba.</p>

	<p pid="c.1193W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.3/2">The &quot;EU Global Approach to migration&quot; strategy was agreed under the UK presidency of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.3/3">As one part of the operational response to this strategy, Frontex (the EU Borders Agency) has contributed to operations to reduce illegal immigration to the EU. This has clear benefits to reducing flows to the UK via the Mediterranean and from the west coast of Africa. Frontex has facilitated the sharing of analysis and immigration intelligence on illegal immigration routes into the EU so helping the UK and others to work on dismantling the criminal networks behind those routes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.3/4">The &quot;Global Approach&quot; strategy also encourages dialogue between the EU and Africa on migration and development with a view to joint working and improved co-operation, including building capacity to prevent illegal immigration. The July Euro-Africa regional ministerial conference on migration and development in Rabat brought EU and west African states together for the first time on a common agenda for action. The upcoming EU-pan Africa ministerial meeting will provide a further opportunity to form a joint approach, with states, this time throughout Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.3/5">Many of the actions in the &quot;Global Approach&quot; will be implemented over the longer term. In particular, development aid and assistance that helps to eradicate the root causes of illegal immigration will continue to form part of individual member states' and the EC's collective response to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1193W.3/6">The European Council in December will receive a report from the European Commission noting progress so far on the &quot;Global Approach&quot; strategy as well as indicating areas in which the Commission considers future action will be needed. On the basis of this report, the European Council will determine the EU's next steps.</p>

Iran has not met the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors and the UN Security Council, including the requirement that it should suspend all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities. This is essential to build confidence that the intentions of Iran's nuclear programme are exclusively peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.2/3">We remain committed to a negotiated solution, and regret that Iran has not taken the steps that would enable negotiations to begin on the basis of the proposals presented in June by Javier Solana on behalf of the E3+3 (UK, France, Germany + US, Russia, China). These proposals would form the basis of a long term agreement: they offer Iran everything it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry in return for restoring international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.2/4">We are determined that Iran should comply fully with its obligations. E3+3 Foreign Ministers met in London on <phrase class="date" code="">6 October</phrase> and agreed that Iran's failure to comply with Security Council Resolution 1696, and take the steps that would enable a return to negotiations, leaves no option but to seek a new Security Council Resolution adopting measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter.

	<p pid="c.1196W.3/1">The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) ambition and efforts to acquire nuclear weapons date from at least the 1980s. Since 2002, the United States has given the DPRK repeated assurances that it has no intention to attack or invade, and that it backs a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue through the Six Party Talks. Although some official statements from the DPRK have referred to US military action in Iraq as justifying their recent actions, we do not believe the DPRK would have adopted a different course if we had not taken action in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="c.1196W.3/2">Many elements in the Iranian regime believe Saddam Hussein's fall removed a significant threat to Iran's security. Since 2003, Iran has sought to improve ties with the Iraqi authorities, including through high-level contacts and the development of economic and religious links. Iran has said that it wants multi-national forces to leave Iraq as soon as possible and we remain deeply concerned at Iran's links to Shia extremists who have carried out attacks on them. Our concerns about other Iranian policies&mdash;for example, in areas such as its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, support for terrorism, attitude towards Israel and lack of respect for human rights&mdash;predate 2003 and have continued since then.</p>

These include a Strategy Planning and Review Group, a Research and Information Group, a Parents' Advisory Group and a Practitioners' Group. It is intended to have all groups set up by January 2007.</p>

The Forum, containing representatives from individuals and organisations with an interest in cycling, published a report on progress against the various actions in the NI Cycling Strategy in 2002.

	<p pid="c.1210W.6/6" class="indent">From a Roads Service perspective, we have been actively monitoring progress against the headline targets in the strategy (doubling cycle trips by 2005, quadrupling trips by 2015) in our annual Cycle Usage Survey.

A regional eating disorders service, based at South and East Belfast health and social services trust, deals with the management of complex cases and specialised medical and dietetics support for all four health boards.

As part of the local process for reviewing NICE guidance for implementation in the HPSS a direction on its use will be issued shortly after the final guidance becomes available in England. The institute's final appraisal document, issued in June 2006, recommended that Pemetrexed should not be used for the treatment of this disease except within a clinical trial. While this recommendation is subject to an appeal, the Department would not expect Pemetrexed to be widely available for patients with mesothelioma in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.1250W.9/8" class="indent">Additionally Roads Service will not generally spread salt on dry roads, as moisture is required for ice to form, or during periods of rain due to the probability of wash-off.</p>

	<p pid="c.1253W.2/2">The unit was originally situated in one of the oldest parts of the RBHSC building. That ward has been temporarily closed, and patients have been relocated within other wards in the hospital. As part of a refurbishment within RBHSC, the infant surgical unit will reopen in new facilities adjacent to an existing children's surgical ward. This will provide improved accommodation that can more appropriately meet the needs of ill babies and their families. It is expected that this new unit be ready for use in March 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1254W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about how many bio-disc septic tanks are in use at properties in Northern Ireland; and what steps he is taking to include the emptying of bio-disc septic tanks in the duties of the Department for Regional Development Water Service.

	<p pid="c.1254W.5/4" class="indent">The Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service, which is responsible for approving the use of septic tanks has advised that discharge consents have been granted for approximately 95,000 single domestic dwellings served by some form of septic tank. This Agency however, does not hold records to indicate how many of these septic tank systems would incorporate a bio-disc in the treatment process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1254W.5/7" class="indent">Water Service is aware that there are increasing numbers of these treatment plants being installed, generating requests to Water Service for an emptying service. As part of the ongoing wider review of our septic tank policy, consideration has been given to the feasibility and cost of including the desludging of bio-disc type tanks within the existing service. I am pleased to advise that following negotiation with our contractors, the desludging of bio-disc type septic tanks has now been included in the contract with the necessary practical arrangements concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1254W.5/8" class="indent">However, it should be noted that the new arrangements will only be short-term, as the free septic tank emptying service will be terminated in April 2007 following the introduction of the new domestic charging scheme for all services provided by the Government-owned Company.</p>

	<p pid="c.1260W.6/1">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme. Approximately 20,000 reports of ADRs are reported to the MHRA/CHM through this scheme each year. It is not possible to estimate from the yellow card scheme the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs since the scheme is associated with an unknown level of under-reporting.</p>
	<p pid="c.1260W.6/2">While under-reporting of ADRs is a known feature of spontaneous reporting schemes, it is thought to occur less frequently with newly identified, serious and unlabelled reactions (those reactions which are not yet included in the product information). It has been estimated from various sources that 10 per cent. of serious ADRs and between 2 and 4 per cent. of non-serious ADRs are reported and that serious reactions are five times more likely to be reported than non-serious reactions. Under-reporting does not necessarily detract from the ability of drug safety monitoring systems to identify new and important drug safety hazards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1260W.6/3">The MHRA and CHM are continually working to increase the quality and quantity of reports received via the yellow card scheme in order to increase the potential for rapid identification of new drug safety hazards.</p>

	<p pid="c.1264W.3/3">So, to improve access and cut waiting times, the genetics White Paper &quot;Our Inheritance, Our Future&mdash;realising the potential of genetics in the NHS&quot;, published in June 2003, committed up to &pound;18 million for NHS genetics laboratories in England. This major investment is boosting capacity and supporting modernisation in genetics laboratories, thus helping them meet the rising demand for genetic tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/4">To ensure that this investment resulted in real patient benefit, the White Paper set out new standards for genetic test turn around times, to be achieved by the end of 2006. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/5" class="indent">within three days where the result is needed urgently, for example, for prenatal diagnosis</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/6" class="indent">within two weeks where the potential genetic mutation is already known, for example, because another family member has already been tested; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/7" class="indent">within eight weeks for unknown mutations in a large gene.</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/8">This money was allocated during the last two financial years (2004-06), and laboratories are working hard to get their new facilities up to speed to meet these standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/9">We are monitoring molecular genetics laboratories' progress through the commissioners of genetic services. The laboratories in two of the eight specialised commissioning group areas are already meeting these standards for genetic tests for breast cancer. Five of the rest are on track to achieve them by the end of 2006 and the remaining one by early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1264W.3/10">We are currently reviewing progress since the publication of the genetics White Paper to see what more needs to be done to equip the NHS to deal with future demand for genetics services.

	<p pid="c.1265W.2/1">The Department does not collect data centrally on waiting times for genetic tests for inherited forms of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/2">However, the Government recognise that some patients have experienced long waits for genetic tests in the past and this will have caused stress and anxiety. This is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/3">To improve access and cut waiting times, the genetics White Paper &quot;Our Inheritance, Our Future&mdash;realising the potential of genetics in the national health service&quot;, published in June 2003, committed up to &pound;18 million for NHS genetics laboratories in England. This major investment is boosting capacity and supporting modernisation in genetics laboratories, thus helping them meet the rising demand for genetic tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/4">To ensure that this investment resulted in real patient benefit, the White Paper set out new standards for genetic test turn around times, to be achieved by the end of 2006. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/5" class="indent">Within three days where the result is needed urgently, for example, for prenatal diagnosis;</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/6" class="indent">within two weeks where the potential genetic mutation is already known, for example, because another family member has already been tested; and within eight weeks for unknown mutations in a large gene.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/7">This money was allocated during the last two financial years (2004-06), and laboratories are working hard to get their new facilities up to speed to meet these standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/8">We are monitoring molecular genetics laboratories' progress through the commissioners of genetic services. The laboratories in two of the eight specialised commissioning group areas are already meeting these standards for new referrals of genetic tests for breast cancer. Five of the rest are on track to achieve them by the end of 2006 and the remaining one by early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/9">Genetic services have drawn up plans locally to deal with backlogs, which for a number of reasons vary in size and nature between centres. Their rate of progress has also depended on the timescale for getting new equipment and processes operational. All areas are working to clear backlogs as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1265W.2/10">The plans to clear backlogs for the laboratory providing the service for Northumberland include samples referred for testing in 2005, and in 2006 prior to the additional capacity becoming available. The laboratory originally anticipated clearing all backlogs by February 2007. However current staff shortages and a greater than anticipated rise in demand for genetic testing services mean that the date for clearing all of the backlog is likely to slip to later in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1268W.6/1">The South London scheme is part of the second phase of procurement of health services from the independent sector. The procurement is being conducted in compliance with European Union procurement law.</p>
	<p pid="c.1268W.6/2">Interested parties responded to an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Union and were sent a memorandum of information (MOI) and a pre-qualifying questionnaire (PQQ). From the response to the MOI and PQQ, four bidders were invited to negotiate and meet specific criteria including clinical services, workforce, information management and technology, contract management and finance. One of the four invitations to negotiate was issued to a national health service body/private sector joint venture and their bid was evaluated together with the other bids received. The same process of evaluation was undertaken for each bid. The difference in costs between the bids are commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1268W.6/3">Clinicenta were appointed preferred bidder as they were considered able to provide high quality medical services for NHS patients and provide best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.1268W.6/4">Negotiations are ongoing and no contract has been signed. Information on the value of the contract is commercially sensitive and its disclosure would undermine the Department's ability to obtain best value for money in negotiating this and other schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1270W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for dealing with counterfeit medicines in the United Kingdom (UK). Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is responsible for specifically tackling the importation of counterfeit medicines into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1270W.5/3">The MHRA operates a comprehensive anti-counterfeiting strategy which focuses on domestic and international collaboration with partners and relevant stakeholders to ensure that current safeguards work effectively and that vigilance against counterfeit medicines entering the legitimate UK supply chain is maintained. In the UK, the key stakeholders with whom regular meetings are held to identify ways to collectively deal with counterfeit medicines are HMRC, the police, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB), the pharmaceutical industry and pharmaceutical trade associations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1270W.5/4">HMRC tackles the importation of counterfeit medicines by using its powers to take enforcement action against goods that breach the import and export prohibitions on counterfeit, pirated or patent infringing intellectual property rights as set out in EC Council Regulation 1383/2003. HMRC has publicised these procedures in Public Notice No 34 &quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot;, which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/Forms">www.hmrc.gov.uk/Forms</a> leaflets and booklets.</p>
	<p pid="c.1270W.5/5">HMRC targets counterfeit goods at import and export using profiles set on its central systems in response to information received from intellectual property right holders who have submitted an application to have their rights protected. HMRC detains any suspect consignments and provides the right holder with information that has been declared to HMRC, including details of the goods, importer/exporter and manufacturer. HMRC will seize any goods where the right holder confirms in a witness statement that the goods are counterfeit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1270W.5/6">Where HMRC detects a consignment of medicines that it suspects is counterfeit, and there is no application from a right holder in place, HMRC will detain the goods and invite the right holder to lodge an application. If the right holder does so within three working days and subsequently confirms in a witness statement that the goods are counterfeit, HMRC will seize the goods.</p>

	<p pid="c.1271W.2/3">The Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate (DHI) is part of the State Veterinary Service (an executive agency of DEFRA) and acts on behalf of the agency in administering and enforcing the hygiene legislation at registered milk production holdings prior to processing such as pasteurisation, bottling or the manufacture of dairy products. Local authorities enforce the regulations in establishments undertaking activities in relation to milk beyond the remit of the DHI and the remainder of the dairy industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.1271W.2/4">The Agency has obtained information from the DHI relating to inspections of registered milk production holdings carried out in England during the period requested which is set out in the table.

	<p pid="c.1277W.3/1">Venlafaxine (brand names Efexor, Efexor XL) is a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant. The Efexor brand is authorised for the treatment of major depressive disorder at a recommended dose of75 milligrams (mg) daily and a maximum dose of375 mg daily. The Efexor XL brand is a modified release product additionally authorised for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) at a recommended dose of 75 mg daily.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/2">Since venlafaxine was first authorised in 1994 its safety has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Up to <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October 2006</phrase>, a total of 4,739 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been received through the yellow card scheme in association with the use of venlafaxine. The most commonly reported suspected ADRs include withdrawal reactions on stopping treatment, nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, increased sweating and tremor. All of these are recognised side effects and are listed in the product information provided for prescribers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/3">In May 2003, an expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) was set up to consider further the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related antidepressants such as venlafaxine, with a particular focus on withdrawal reactions and a possible link with suicidal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/4">The conclusions and key findings of the expert group were communicated to health professionals on<phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase> to coincide with the publication of guidelines on the treatment of depression by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The CSM and its expert working group concluded that SSRIs and venlafaxine are effective medicines in the treatment of depression and anxiety conditions, and that the balance of risks and benefits of all SSRIs and venlafaxine in adults remains positive in their licensed indications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/5">During the expert group's review, concerns were raised about the potential for cardiotoxicity and toxicity in overdose associated with venlafaxine. A review of the available data led to restrictions of venlafaxine to specialist, for example hospital consultant, initiation and addition of contra-indications in patients with heart disease. A comprehensive report of the expert group's findings and the evidence base for these conclusions has been published and is available on the MHRA's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/6">The safety of venlafaxine remains under close constant scrutiny by the MHRA. As new data emerges this is carefully evaluated and if necessary new prescribing advice to maximise its safe use is issued. In May 2006, health care professionals and patients were informed of updated prescribing advice for venlafaxine following further MHRA review of these restrictions and evaluation of new evidence, in particular relating to toxicity in overdose.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/7">The new prescribing advice is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/8" class="indent">the need for specialist, for example hospital consultant, supervision in those severely depressed or hospitalised patients who need doses of 300 mg daily or more;</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/9" class="indent">cardiac contra-indications are more targeted towards high risk groups;</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/10" class="indent">a reminder that patients with uncontrolled hypertension should not take venlafaxine and that for all patients blood pressure should be monitored; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/11" class="indent">updated advice on possible drug interactions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1277W.3/12">In December 2004, NICE issued two separate guidelines for the management of depression and anxiety disorders both of which include recommendations relating to the use of venlafaxine. An independent working group of representatives from the anxiety and depression guideline development groups have been asked to determine what changes need to be made to recommendations about venlafaxine in light of the data underpinning the changes in the venlafaxine product information for prescribers. It is expected that NICE will publish the updated recommendations early in 2007.</p>

In the cases where re-packaging occurs, the primary packaging which is in contact with the drug product and which is primarily responsible for maintaining the quality and integrity of the drug product, is not modified in any way, thus the original quality and integrity of the product are maintained. Any re-packaging and re-labelling proposed by a parallel importer must be assessed as satisfactory by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for a parallel import licence to be granted. Each batch of product must be released by a qualified person. The MHRA has systems in place to receive and investigate reports of packaging and labelling problems with medicines, including parallel traded products.</p>

	<p pid="c.1289W.5/1">The Moving On Arts project is being undertaken by the Avon and Wiltshire mental health partnership national health service trust as part of the modernisation of mental health services. &pound;629,200 has been committed from a variety of sources, including private finance initiative site partners and charitable funds, to create the best possible healthcare environment as well as providing opportunities for services users to take part in creative activity as part of their therapy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1289W.5/2">There is a wealth of research evidence to show the positive impact that the environment can have on health and healing. Taking part in the creative process itself is therapeutic in itself, particularly for patients with mental health needs, as it provides a non-verbal means of expressing feelings, aiding relaxation and building self-confidence. Schools, artists and other members of the local community have designed and created some of the artwork and this has fostered a better understanding and knowledge of mental health issues. The resulting artwork plays an important part in creating a healing and comforting environment, which will help mental health users.</p>
	<p pid="c.1289W.5/3">Evaluation is a key part in determining the effectiveness and value for money of any good project and a research project is therefore being undertaken to evaluate the impact of arts on the health, well-being and the morale of mental health service users and staff and provide examples of good practice to the remainder of the NHS. This evaluation project is being funded by the former NHS Estates Agency, which is now part of the Department, with the University of the West of England over two years at a cost of &pound;107,709.</p>

	<p pid="c.1293W.2/1">The provisional number of training places in England projected by the postgraduate deans to be available next year is slightly in excess of 30,000. This includes about 11,500 places in foundation programmes, 15,500 places in specialty training programmes and a further 3,300 places in fixed-term specialty training appointments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.2/2">These figures are indicative and are still subject to further discussions with postgraduate deans, medical Royal colleges and the national health service and will be refined later in the year. Work on the distribution across individual specialties is now under way and the outcome will be published when the figures are confirmed. Foundation programmes are not specialty specific.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.2/3">The number of training places in each training programme is planned over time to provide the number of specialists and general practitioners necessary to deliver patient care. Entry to training programmes will be by competition. Each applicant will be able to make up to four applications and can therefore choose to compete for both specialties and locations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1293W.2/4">Selection and recruitment will be managed by postgraduate deans according to person specifications developed for each specialty. Short-listed candidates will be interviewed by expert panels comprising specialists in the field and service representatives. This process will be supported by the medical training appointment service, a United Kingdom wide web-based system designed to support the efficienthandling of applications. This new system goes live on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase> this year for the handling of foundation programme applications and January 2007 for the start of specialty recruitment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1302W.8/3">The objective of the review will be to agree a new pattern of hospital services for the region that will meet the demands of 21st century healthcare and be financially sustainable. The initial phase of the review is a technical analysis of how these issues are affecting hospitals in the region.</p>
	<p pid="c.1302W.8/4">Hertfordshire PCT is leading the review of the strategy for &quot;Investing In Your Health&quot; for Hertfordshire looking at operational and affordability assumptions to ensure these are clinically and financially sustainable. This will be completed over the next month and once this is done a structured process will be established, including discussion with our many stakeholders, to prepare detailed service proposals for consultation. This next phase should be completed early in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1309W.3/1">Revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) are made on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each PCT's share of available funding so they can commission similar levels of health services for populations with similar need.</p>
	<p pid="c.1309W.3/2">Independent Government auditors agree with the Department's assessment that there is no single, simple cause of deficits, just as there are no single, simple solutions for eradicating them. More specifically, our analysis of the provisional outturn figures for 2005-06 shows that there is very little correlation between the size of deficits and any of the factors relating to funding, including allocations per head and allocation growth.</p>

			<tr pid="c.1318W.9/14"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes</i><br/> We cannot provide information on the waiting times for cancer operations as it is too difficult to specify which operations are specifically for treating cancer. For example, some procedures may be used to treat cancer but may also be used to treat other conditions.<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Data quality:</i><br/> Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data:</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Main operation</i><br/> The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for 'all operations count of episodes' give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. OPCS CODES OPCS CODES K01-K71 Used for heart operations.<br/> <i> Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality:</i><br/> PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Time waited (days):</i><br/> Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital episode statistics (HES), The Information Centre for Health and Social Care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1329W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1329W.9/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, her ministerial team, and her officials have met with various community stakeholders to discuss a broad range of issues. Anti-Semitism may well have been raised as one such issue during these often wide-ranging discussions. Similarly the Secretary of State also receives many representations, and correspondence, from a broad cross-section of society on many wide- ranging issues, in which anti-Semitism may well have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.1329W.9/3">For example, the Secretary of State, recently met with the Chief Rabbi where general issues concerning the Jewish community were discussed, and more recently received a representation from the Labour Friends of Israel which includes Members from both the House of Commons and House of Lords. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Community Cohesion recently met with the Board of Deputies of British Jews to discuss issues affecting the Jewish community, and with the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust to discuss its future work plans. He more recently met with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> the co-chair of the all party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism to discuss the Inquiry's report. I have also helped chair one of the two meetings of the Faith Communities Consultative Council this year, which Jewish representatives are part of, to discuss faith related issues. Officials from the Cohesion and Faiths Unit have also recently met with my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw and officials supporting the All Party Committee into Anti-Semitism to discuss progress towards production of the Government's response to the inquiry's report. Few records were kept of these discussions however, where they exist arrangements will be made to place copies in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1329W.9/4">The Government have said that their response to the report of the all party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism will be provided by the middle of November 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1338W.17/1">Although Dudley is not a Trailblazer area, it, along with all other local authorities, has been able to benefit from the Together Campaign. Central to that campaign has been ensuring that everyone involved&mdash;the public, police officers, housing officers, wardens, community workers, court staff and environmental health officers&mdash;have the knowledge and support to enable them to deal with antisocial behaviour and bring respite to those affected by it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1338W.17/2">The Respect Action Plan, published earlier this year, detailed the Government's drive to build on the success of the Together Campaign and go further in tackling the symptoms and causes of antisocial behaviour wherever they are encountered. As part of this, the Respect Task Force will be working closely with a larger number of areas who can demonstrate their commitment to delivering upon the Respect programme and act as exemplars for the approaches outlined in the Respect Action Plan. We are looking to ensure regional and national coverage and will be contacting prospective areas over the coming months.</p>

This issue has been highlighted in the National CCTV Strategy which is currently under development.</p>

	<p pid="c.1347W.3/2">Monitoring and enforcement of control orders, and investigation of alleged breaches, are operational matters for the police. A breach of a control order, without reasonable excuse, is a criminal offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment. The Government do not give a running commentary on individual breaches of control orders, which can range from the relatively minor to more serious incidents resulting in charges being brought. This is an operational matter for the police and prosecution authorities. However, I can confirm that there have been no convictions for a breach of a control order.</p>
	<p pid="c.1347W.3/3">In the two cases referred to in the recent media coverage, my officials and I were informed without delay about the breaches, and all those who needed to know for operational reasons were informed as quickly as possible. Both individuals are subject to anonymity orders, which are a standard part of the operation of the control order regime. Anonymity orders protect the privacy of the individual and can help the police in the enforcement and monitoring of the control order. In these two cases, the police believe that there would be a substantial operational disadvantage in lifting the anonymity orders at the present time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1347W.3/4">Lord Carlisle, as the Independent Reviewer, produces an annual report on the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. This includes reporting on breaches of control orders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1347W.3/5">The Government keep all counter terrorism legislation under review to ensure that it continues to meet the threat from terrorism that we face. As I announced on <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase>, I am currently undertaking a wide ranging review of the UK's counter terrorism strategy and this will include looking at existing legislation. In particular, I am reviewing what more might be necessary to improve the effectiveness of the control order regime, as well as seeking to appeal to the House of Lords to overturn the Court of Appeal's judgement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> which forced me to weaken the obligations in some control order cases. I will update the House on the outcome of the review in due course.</p>

I will meet ACPO representatives to discuss our response to e-crime, as soon as the initial findings of this work are ready.

	<p pid="c.1368W.2/1">Article seven of the European Convention on Extradition (ECE) allows for refusal of extradition where some or all of the conduct was committed in the requested state. The UK chose not to incorporate this safeguard into its legislation when it became a party to the ECE in 1991, a policy which was unchanged in the Extradition Act 2003. Article seven provides only a discretionary ground for refusal, but it carries the danger that a person wanted for possibly serious cross-border offences could escape justice altogether. The UK operates a slightly different safeguard, which is to require that dual criminality is satisfied where a request is considered for conduct committed outside the requesting state. Section 137(3) of the 2003 Extradition Act provides:</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The conduct also constitutes an extradition offence in relation to the category two territory if these conditions are satisfied:</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> the conduct occurs outside the category two territory;</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.2/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> the conduct is punishable under the law of the category two territory with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment (however it is described in that law);</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> in corresponding circumstances equivalent conduct would constitute an extra-territorial offence under the law of the relevant part of the United Kingdom punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.2/6">Both the 1989 and 2003 Acts however provide that, were a UK authority to mount a prosecution in relation to the conduct for which extradition was sought, the extradition process would be halted, pending the outcome of the domestic proceedings. Where the rules on double jeopardy applied extradition would not take place.</p>

	<p pid="c.1369W.3/2">It is not that the food processing and agricultural sectors will not have been exempted from the work permit restrictions applying to Romanian and Bulgarian workers Romania and Bulgaria on those countries' accession to the EU. Bulgarian and Romanian workers' access to low skilled employment in those sectors will continue to be regulated through Rather, the existing, quota-based Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) and the Sectors Based Scheme (SBS). are pre-existing schemes that will continue beyond <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. The 'standstill clause' of the Accession agreement with Romania and Bulgaria means that we may not make access to our labour market more restrictive than it was when the Accession Treaty was signed, on the <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-16">16 April 2003</phrase>. Therefore, we must continue make these schemes available to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. The principle of 'Community Preference' means that when a job is offered to an overseas national, citizens of member states must be given priority over people from non-EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1369W.3/3">Current Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme Operators and the National Farmers Union were consulted to discuss the impacts of Romania and Bulgaria's accession and to explain how this will affect the existing schemes.

	<p pid="c.1371W.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">The answer to the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase> stated that a total of 1,244 offenders released on home detention curfew between <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase> did not have an electronic tag fitted on the day of release. We have now established that the number of offenders was over-stated and should have been given as 1,119. The previous, incorrect, figure arose because of errors in recording and reporting statistics by one of the electronic monitoring companies, G4S.</p>
	<p pid="c.1371W.2/2">As a result, the figure of 1,039 cases given in that answer where the tag was not fitted because the offender was not present or the monitoring company was refused access is also incorrect. We have re-calculated this figure using the latest figures from both monitoring companies. These take account of earlier recording and reporting errors, and also a re-classification by G4S of the reasons for not fitting the tag in each case. The figure should have been reduced to 708.</p>
	<p pid="c.1371W.2/3">The Under-Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">my hon.

	<p pid="c.1371W.2/4">Of the corrected figure of 1,119 offenders, the monitoring companies' records show that a total of 141 did not have the tag fitted on the second attempt.</p>
	<p pid="c.1371W.2/5">We do not collate and record centrally the particular reason for a recall at the level of detail which allows identification of those recalled just for two unsuccessful attempts at fitting the tag. To track these cases through the system, and state definitively how many were recalled to prison for that reason, and how many of that specific sub-set remain unlawfully at large would require a manual check of each case file. This could not be done without disproportionate cost, and would necessitate removing caseworkers from the business of recalling offenders to carry out the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1371W.2/6">The police are routinely notified of all offenders who are subject to recall, and are unlawfully at large.</p>

	<p pid="c.1372W.2/1">The Home Office reported to Parliament about the likely future costs of the ID cards scheme on <phrase class="date" code="">9 October</phrase>. The cost of issuing passports and ID cards, including set up costs, is estimated to be &pound;5.4 billion in the 10 years from October 2006. This does not include costs falling to other organisations using ID cards to verify identities. The decision to use ID cards is for each organisation, based on its assessment of the benefits and costs for its particular business. Costs will depend on the types of identity check that each organisation wishes to make and the infrastructure it already has in place or plans to put in place to use identity verification services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1372W.2/2">The total quantifiable financial benefits of the scheme once it is fully rolled out that can currently be estimated range from &pound;1 billion to &pound;1.7 billion per annum. The benefits arising from reduced fraud are estimated to be in the range of &pound;550 million to &pound;980 million per annum, of which benefits to private sector organisations are estimated to be in the range of &pound;321 million to &pound;518 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="c.1373W.8/1">The first cost estimates report for the Identity Cards scheme, which was laid before Parliament on nine October, published for the first time resource set-up cost estimates for providing passports and ID cards to British and Irish citizens resident in the UK from October 2006 to October 2016. Capital set up cost estimates were not shown explicitly as they are the most commercially sensitive part of the estimates. These estimates were accounted for in the total costs over 10 years by including in the operating cost estimate the annual depreciation charges for capital investment. Clause 37 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 allows the Secretary of State to exclude any matter from the report to Parliament which appears to him would be prejudicial to securing best value from the use of public money.</p>

	<p pid="c.1373W.11/1">The Identity Cards scheme is being designed to build on the existing infrastructure and processes for issuing passports in the Identity and Passport Service. In order to reduce risk and avoid a &quot;big-bang&quot; implementation, the scheme will be delivered incrementally. This means that the costs of issuing and upgrading passports are very closely interlinked to those of introducing identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1373W.11/2">Splitting the annual maintenance and operational costs of the passport programme and identity cards scheme would be a largely theoretical exercise as current plans are for an integrated infrastructure. However we do estimate that around 70 per cent. of the &pound;5.1 billion operating costs over the 10 years from October 2006 to October 2016 would be incurred in the issuing of new generation biometric passports. The remaining 30 per cent. represents the incremental costs of operating and maintaining the Identity Cards scheme though it relies on using the same technical and office infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="c.1374W.2/1">Within the Identity and Passport Service (IPS), all Passport Officers, both administrative and front office, receive passport fraud awareness training as part of their initial induction. The training includes identifying attempts to obtain a passport where the applicant is not entitled to one, by reviewing documentation, photographs and the application forms. The focus is placed upon identifying key indicators of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/2">Passport officers are assessed on their competence and are required to achieve a minimum standard of knowledge. The induction training is supported by desk training provided by line managers who guide passport officers through practical examples of fraud cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/3">IPS also has a team of accredited fraud investigation staff working in its fraud and intelligence units (FIDs) within each IPS regional office.These investigators have specialist training in identifying and investigation of fraud. Instances of suspected passport fraud identified by passport officers are referred to FIU teams to determine whether or not fraud has taken place. The IPS central fraud intelligence unit also has a role in detecting and dealing with any cases of suspected or actual internal fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/4">IPS human resources and security staff are also trained in and are responsible for increasingly rigorous processes to establish the identity of new staff and for managing the security vetting process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/5">IPS is introducing specialist interviewing staff as part of the authentication by interview (Abl) initiative. These interview staff will receive training on processes established to authenticate the identity of passport applicants. In some instances this may lead to identifying suspected fraudulent applications. The Abl process will include training to develop skills in establishing a biographical footprint, questioning and assessing the answers provided by passport applicants.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/6">Within IND, in terms of identification of travel document abuse, the national document fraud unit (NDFU) has responsibility for training in identity fraud. Basic level training is provided to all new immigration officers by the IND college. Once at border control offices local training, concentrating on the documents most abused at the individual locations, is conducted by port forgery teams. This can include training on imposters (or look-alikes) who attempt to pose as the genuine document holder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/7">More specialist training at intermediate and advanced level training is delivered by the NDFU. At intermediate level the NDFU offers two-day courses to border control, enforcement and managed migration staff who have worked in those directorates for several years and who therefore have experience of handling travel documents on a regular basis. The unit offers advanced level attachments of ten weeks duration to experienced staff from the same directorates who have an interest in developing their document fraud knowledge still further. Those officers can then return to their own offices with a significant level of forgery knowledge and expertise. For those very experienced staff who wish to update themselves on new trends the NDFU offers a two-day advanced course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1374W.2/8">The NDFU also provides basic awareness training to all new foreign office entry clearance officers and has recently commenced a focused programme of training on travel document abuse at high risk posts in entry clearance sections worldwide.</p>

	<p pid="c.1375W.2/1">Within the Identity and Passport Service (IPS), all passport officers have access to personal information supplied by members of the public. All officers receive passport fraud awareness training as part of their initial induction. The training includes identifying attempts to obtain a passport where the applicant is not entitled to one, by reviewing documentation, photographs and the application forms. The focus is placed upon identifying key indicators of fraud. Passport officers are assessed on their competence and are required to achieve a minimum standard of knowledge. The induction training is supported by desk training provided by line managers who guide passport officers through practical examples of fraud cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/2">IPS also has a team of accredited fraud investigation staff working in its Fraud and Intelligence Units (FlUs) within each IPS regional office. These investigators have specialist training in identifying and investigation of passport fraud. All instances of suspected passport fraud identified by passport officers are referred to FIUs to determine whether or not fraud has taken place. The IPS Central Fraud and Security Unit also has a role in detecting and dealing with any cases of suspected or actual internal fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/3">IPS is introducing specialist interviewing staff as part of the Authentication by Interview (AbI) initiative. These interview staff will receive training on processes established to authenticate the identity of passport applicants. In some instances this may lead to identifying suspected fraudulent applications. The AbI process will include training to develop skills in establishing a biographical footprint, questioning and assessing the answers provided by passport applicants.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/4">Basic level training in identification of travel document abuse is provided to all new immigration officers. Port forgery teams then provide local training, concentrating on the documents most abused at the individual locations. This can include training on imposters (or look-alikes) who attempt to pose as the genuine document holder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/5">National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) offers further specialist to experienced border control, enforcement and managed migration staff: two day intermediate level courses and 10 week advanced attachments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/6">NDFU also provides basic awareness training to all new Foreign Office entry clearance officers and has recently commenced a focused programme of training on travel document abuse at high risk posts in entry clearance sections worldwide.</p>

	<p pid="c.1376W.2/1">The Government are continuing to look very closely at the possibility of changing the law to permit the evidential use of intercept material. There is a clear Government commitment to this work but also recognition of the need to protect our intercept capability, particularly in the light of changing technology and to avoid placing disproportionate burdens on intercepting agency resources. The Home Office is leading work on two legal models: a 'PII Plus' model which seeks to protect sensitive material primarily with public interest immunity with the defendant's interests being protected by special advocates; and an 'examining magistrates' model based on the French system. Officials will report in November.</p>

	<p pid="c.1376W.8/1">Education is a major challenge in tackling the growing risk of internet crime. The Get Safe Online campaign, which is now in its second year, is the UK's first national internet security awareness campaign. It is a joint public and private sector initiative to raise awareness of internet security among the general public and micro-businesses. Its website, <a href="http://www.getsafeonline.org">www.getsafeonline.org</a> , provides simple, reliable and practical security advice on a range of topics including: how to install anti-virus software, protect your privacy, how to shop and use online auctions safely. The Government are a sponsor of the campaign along with SOCA, BT, eBay, HSBC, Microsoft, and secure Trading.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/2">The recent Get Safe Online Week, which commenced with an internet safety summit on <phrase class="date" code="">9 October</phrase>, involved a series of events, roadshows and training sessions nationwide. For example, experts were on hand in shopping centres in eight cities to give the public face to face advice and information on how to protect themselves online.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.8/3">We also work closely with a wide range of stakeholders on this issue, for example through the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the internet.</p>

	<p pid="c.1391W.6/1">Exercise Oyster Catcher was a classified government exercise to test the response to a major terrorist incident. It is not normal practice to disclose the level of funding allocated to specific counter-terrorist measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1391W.6/2">The agencies referred to are all category one responders within the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and as such have civil protection duties to produce plans to deal with a wide range of emergencies. Exercises are an important element in ensuring that those plans are fit for purpose and are jointly funded as part of existing major incident planning. The Home Office makes a contribution to the costs incurred by the police force which hosts the exercise. Other costs are met by the individual agencies as part of their duties as category one responders.</p>

	<p pid="c.1394W.6/1">A police authority may medically retire an officer if he or she is assessed by a medical practitioner selected by the authority to be permanently disabled for the ordinary duties of a member of the force. An officer who is a contributing member of either the Police Pension Scheme 1987 or the Police Pension Scheme 2006 and who has two years' qualifying service at the time of retirement will receive an ill-health pension which is index-linked and payable immediately. The ill-health pension under the Police Pension Scheme 1987, to which most officers belong, is based on the pension rights the officer has accrued up to retirement, but where the officer has at least five years' pensionable service the pension will be enhanced to compensate at least in part for the additional service he or she was unable to go on to complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.6/2">The Police Pension Scheme 2006, which applies to those who have joined the police service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year, provides two levels of ill-health pension: a standard ill-health pension which is not enhanced and is payable to those who are permanently disabled for the ordinary duties of a member of the force but who can undertake other regular employment, and an enhanced top-up pension, which is payable in addition to the standard pension where the officer is also assessed as permanently disabled for all regular employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1394W.6/3">Information about the rate of ill-health retirement for police officers is not available in the form requested for all the years that the hon. Member has asked for. A table follows with information from 1990-91 to 2004-05. From 2001-02 the rate of ill-health retirement has not been recorded as a percentage of the number of retirements but as a proportion of the number of officers in service, expressed in terms of ill-health retirements per 1,000 officers. This is a more stable measure since the number of ordinary retirements is liable to change from year to year. The figures show a very clear downward trend which started in the mid 1990s but which has been given added impetus following the Police Negotiating Board Agreement of 2002 which resulted in the issue of joint guidance to forces in 2003 on the better management of ill-health. The effective management of ill-health continues to be a priority for the police service. Improvements in sickness management and rehabilitation and better incentives for making appropriate use of ill health retirement (e.g. by introducing more than one tier of ill-health benefits) have been a key part of public service reform.</p>

Officers with at least 25 years' service may retire with an immediate pension from age 50. Officers may also retire with an immediate pension, irrespective of age, after 30 years' service, when they will have accrued maximum benefits. This means that an officer who joined at age 18&amp;frac12;&mdash;the earliest age at which it is possible to start as a police officer&mdash;is entitled to retire at age 48&amp;frac12; with a full pension.

	<p pid="c.1397W.3/1">The system for funding police pensions changed as of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Under the new system, the cost of pensions in payment has been removed from police authorities' operating accounts. Police authorities now operate a separate pensions account for this purpose, into which are paid officers' contributions and a new employer's contribution. Any deficit is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.3/2">The new employer's contribution, which is common to both old and new police pension schemes, is set at 24.6 per cent. of an officer's pensionable pay. In addition to this the police authority will pay into the pensions account a charge of twice the officer's average pensionable pay for any officer who retires early on ill-health grounds. We estimate the annual cost of employer contributions (not including ill-health retirement charges) at &pound;1,095 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1416W.2/1">Section 33 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 amended section 125(3) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1990. Section 125(3) was subsequently repealed by the Access to Justice Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.1416W.2/2">Section 36 of PACE sets out the requirement for custody officers to be appointed at each designated police station. Section 121 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCAP), which is yet to be brought into force, amends section 36 of PACE to enable police sergeants or staff custody officers to be appointed as custody officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1416W.2/3">The SOCAP amendment was subject to full public consultation in the paper 'Modernising Police Powers to Meet Community Needs'. The consultation paper and the summary of responses are both available on the Home Office website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1424W.3/1">All the recommendations in the Home Affairs Select Committee report, alternatives to prison sentences (July 1998) have been taken forward wholly or in part. The main thrust of the report is that prison should be targeted at dangerous and/or persistent offenders and that effective and credible no-custodial sentences, rigorously enforced, should be available for other offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1424W.3/2">The measures taken by the Government since 1998 include the introduction of a new sentencing framework, contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provides sentencers with a more flexible community order that can be tailored to the individual offender and offence. Drug treatment and electronically monitored curfews are more widely available and enforcement of community orders has improved dramatically; the National Probation Service is meeting the requirement of National Standards that breach action is taken within 10 working days of an unacceptable failure to comply in about 90 per cent. of cases. A Community Payback scheme has been introduced to promote the use of unpaid work by offenders and to give local communities a say in what kinds of work offenders should do in their neighbourhood. A new suspended sentence order has been introduced for a wider number of cases. The 1998 Crime and Disorder Act introduced reforms that provided for reparation and/or restorative justice to be part of all youth justice disposals, including final warnings, referral orders, reparation orders, action plan orders and supervision orders. A National Enforcement Service has been established to improve fine collection and the efficient execution of warrants. Research has been published on the impact of correctional services' interventions on re-offending and more information is available to sentencers about sentencing patterns and outcomes of sentences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.5/1">The models used to calculate the current prison population projections are described in Annexe two of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 11/06, &quot;Prison population projections 2006-2013, England and Wales&quot;, published on the Home Office website in July 2006. There are five elements to the modelling. In the very-short term (the first three months) the X12-ARIMA method developed by the USA Census Bureau is used. This method is publicly available at <a href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/">www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/</a>. In the short-term (between four months and two years) the population is modelled by a stock-and-flow model. This is not publicly available as it links to Prison Service databases that cannot be published. In the longer- term (between two and seven years) the Grove-Macleod model is used. This has been published in OR Insight Vol. 11 Issue one, January-March 1998, pp. 3-9, &quot;Forecasting the prison population&quot;. More detail is also available in Occasional Paper 80, &quot;Modelling crime and offending: recent developments in England and Wales&quot; published on the Home Office website in 2003. The impacts of some changes in legislation and operational procedures are estimated using the Criminal Justice System Model and, if necessary, one-off bespoke calculations. The Criminal Justice System Model is owned by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform and is available to CJS practitioners but is not publicly available. Any one-off calculations are described in the above mentioned Home Office Statistical Bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="c.1428W.8/1">Previous analysis to the implementation of the programme suggested that 5,000 offenders are responsible for 9 per cent. of all crime. More specifically it is estimated that 10 per cent. of all active offenders are responsible for half of all crime (Home Office, 2001. Criminal Justice the way ahead. London: HMSO).</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.8/2">Currently, there are 10,871 identified prolific and other priority offenders (PPOs) in England and Wales. The figure is taken from the quarterly PPO Headline Measures Report for the period April to June 2006, released on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase> and published on the PPO website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1428W.8/4">Research from the national PPO evaluation indicates that on average a PRO has 47 convictions in their criminal career. Furthermore, in the five years prior to entering the PRO programme, the PRO cohort had received on average 24 convictions, compared to 10 convictions for a general offender comparison group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1428W.8/5">The Interim Evaluation, published in October 2005 showed the early success of the programme&mdash;a 10 per cent. reduction in recorded convictions over six months for the first cohort of PPOs. We intend to publish shortly a full evaluation which will show the success of the programme over a longer time period (Home Office, 2005, Early findings from the Prolific and other Priority Offenders evaluation, Development and Practice Report 46: Home Office). We are also planning further work looking at the impact of PRO scheme on crime rates locally.</p>

Robbery is included in 'Violent' crime as it involves force or the threat of force in addition to the property element.

	<p pid="c.1442W.2/1">Compensated eradication was never seen as a long-term solution to drug control and does not form part of the present Afghan government's national drug control strategy. From 2003 to 2006 eradication has not been compensated. In 2002 the Afghan interim administration considered it appropriate to offer farmers one-off payments because the 2002 crop was planted before it came to power. The UK Government provided &pound;21.25 million in support of the Afghan administration's 2002 compensated eradication programme. We provided support because we believed it was important to support a new regime determined to take tough decisions to tackle drugs, but it was nonetheless the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to implement the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1442W.2/2">We understand from the Afghan authorities that a total of 17,000 hectares of poppy was eradicated under the 2002 programme. The number of farmers compensated and the implementation of the programme is a matter for the Afghan government.</p>

A search of the list of material in the contaminated archive has shown that this file is not recorded. The list was compiled under difficult conditions by staff wearing protective clothing, and a mistake may have been made. If the file is among the contaminated material, it will be discovered before the project concludes in early 2008. Officials believe that this file relates to so-called &quot;double cross agents&quot;, and the potential continuing sensitivity of personal data related to this subject means that even if it is found the material may not be releasable.</p>

To reflect the different natures of their employment, service personnel and civilian staff are on different terms and conditions of service. For service personnel, public accommodation is typically provided close to the place of work, though there are travel allowances (including one for use of bicycles) for those who live further away.

	<p pid="c.1465W.0/1">No Royal Marines Bandsmen were flown to Baghdad specifically to play at the dinner held by the Senior British Military Representative&mdash;Iraq (SBMR-I) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.0/2">The Band of HM Royal Marines Britannia Royal Naval College was tasked to perform a number of engagements to Coalition Forces and the Royal Marines in Baghdad in support of Defence Diplomacy and the 'Moral Component'. Thirty Royal Marines musicians were in Baghdad from 2-<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-10">10 July 2006</phrase> and also gave a number of performances for staff and patients at the coalition military hospital in Baghdad.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.0/3">The main focus of the Band's visit was to provide support to ceremonial events for military and civil diplomatic officers and the Iraqi Government and raise the profile of the UK element serving in Baghdad. Whilst in theatre, the band was also able to give an additional performance on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase> at an event hosted by the SBMR-I, which allowed key coalition military officers to meet and interact with their Iraqi counterparts in a more informal setting. This event was announced in the Court Circular column of the <i> Daily Telegraph</i> by the Royal Marines Corps Secretary with approval of the then SBMR-I, LT General Fry. The cost of the announcement was borne entirely from the non-public, Royal Marines Corps funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.0/4">As the band was already in Baghdad for the primary purpose stated above, there were no extra costs associated with flying the band from the UK for the dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>. During its time in Baghdad, the band was escorted by the Protection Force Company (1 Grenadier Guards) whose role is to provide escorts to all visitors and senior military officers working in the Baghdad area. For reasons of operational security I can not reveal how many soldiers and vehicles were involved in the escort. Although I can say that no members of the escort were killed or injured while escorting the band and in fact at no time during their visit did the band or their escort come into any contact with enemy groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.0/5">The cost of the dinner, including alcohol, was &pound;190.68. In general the British military policy is that the consumption of alcohol is at the discretion of individual commanders and will vary with the operational circumstances. When alcohol is permitted, the normal limit is two cans of beer per person per day. The bandsmen at the event would have been operating within these policy guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="c.1468W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is committed to making available information on the use of depleted uranium (DU) munitions both in the UK and abroad. I am not aware of any enquiries from the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the location of DU munitions in Iraq. However, information is available in the public domain and has been provided to other agencies of the United Nations (UN), such as the UN Environment Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1468W.2/2">The UN has been given information on the weight of DU expended by UK forces in 2003 and on the geographical locations of the firings. They have also been given a report of the findings of an environmental monitoring survey undertaken by my Officials in Iraq in June 2003. This survey found only very low levels of DU contamination close to the points where DU munitions had impacted. No contamination was detectable in the wider environment even when the most sensitive analytical techniques were used; the contamination was not considered to present a health risk. This information was presented to a group of Iraqi and UN scientists at a meeting in June 2005. A representative from the WHO was present at this meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.1468W.2/3">In addition, the Ministry of Defence has published information on the very limited use of 120 mm DU munitions by UK units during the 1990/1991 Gulf conflict.</p>

The reductions are due to further analysis of the cases and the consequent elimination of some double counting and incorrect categorisation of errors. The numbers for July increased subsequent to the original early report on the July position. The high numbers in August were due primarily to two JPA system errors (incorrect tax calculation on recoveries and incorrect Get You Home Mileage payments) which were all small in value and corrected in the payroll for August and September respectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1472W.2/1">Light bulbs purchased directly by the MOD are for military application and are generally required to meet higher shock and vibration standards than normal commercial equivalents. In the year to October 2006, 4 per cent. by volume of light bulbs purchased by the MOD were of the compact fluorescent type.</p>
	<p pid="c.1472W.2/2">Light bulbs for general use on the Defence estate are procured by contractors on MOD's behalf. Information is not held centrally on the proportion of the various types purchased.

However, civil servants and military personnel have wholly separate arrangements for remuneration, whether in the UK or overseas including on operations. Over the past three years, considerable work has gone into establishing an appropriate support package for civilians who deploy. A special civilian operational allowance has been created in order to attract and compensate and is paid in addition to normal salary while in theatre.</p>

	<p pid="c.1485W.11/1">The normal retirement age for members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 05 (AFPS 05) and the Reserve Forces Pension Scheme (RFPS) is 55. Those who leave with a preserved pension are entitled to benefits payable at age 65. Regular members of AFPS 75 can retire with a full career pension at 55. Those who complete 16 years as an officer (from age 21) or 22 years in the ranks (from age 18) are entitled to an immediately payable pension. The payment of preserved pensions for AFPS 75 regulars and those on Full-Time Reserve Service Commitments (FTRS) has recently moved from age 60 to 65 for all service from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> to cover the cost of people living longer in retirement. Benefits will continue to be paid at age 60 for all service before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>. The normal retirement age for those on an FTRS AFPS 75 Full Commitment is 55 and for those on Home and Local Commitments, age 60. Members of the Non Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme (NRPSPS) have a normal retirement age of 60.</p>
	<p pid="c.1485W.11/2">Under the Royal Gibraltar Regiment Pension Scheme (RGRPS), members are entitled to an immediately payable pension after 16 years' service as an officer or 22 years' service in the ranks, with preserved awards payable at 60. At present, under the Gurkha Pension Scheme (GPS), the normal retirement age for the majority of Gurkhas is once they have completed 15 years' service, when they are awarded an index linked pension based on Indian army pay under the Tripartite Agreement, which is reviewed and increased annually in line with the rate of inflation in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1485W.11/3">There are no plans to change the AFPS arrangements but the GPS is presently under review as part of the wider review of Gurkha Terms and Conditions of Service, which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January 2005</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 10WS and is due to be completed later this year. The scope of the review covers current members of the Brigade of Gurkhas and those who retired on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>. The NRPS and the RGRPS schemes will be reviewed, in the light of the recent changes in other pension schemes.</p>

The new pension scheme, AFPS 05 has one accrual rate of 1/70 (or 1.43 per cent.) for all members. The Non Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme (NRPSPS), which covers non regular personnel in support of the TA, has one accrual rate of 1/80 (1.25 per cent.). The Royal Gibraltar Regiment Pension Scheme has accrual rates in line with the AFPS 75 scheme.

	<p pid="c.1493W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence's main scramjet research programme was Hyshot III which received approximately &pound;1.5 million. Two other programmes, each funded to the order of &pound;100,000 have received MOD funding. The first was concerned with analysing scramjets from a systems perspective as part of the High-Speed Weapons programme and the second is a Joint Grants scheme funded research programme at Oxford university into scramjet intakes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.5/3">Hyshot III was the culmination of the UK Scramjet experiment programme. There are no funds allocated for the further development of scramjet technologies. This was addressed in the Defence Technology Strategy (DTS) (Section B7.20), a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1493W.5/4">The DTS also outlines (Section B7.21) a new collaborative programme in the field of hypersonics, the sustained hypersonics experiment (SHyFE). This involves research into novel aerosystem propulsion and has been allocated approximately &pound;3 million worth of funds. The SHyFE concept incorporates a low risk ramjet design. However, it does not include any further scramjet research.</p>

Directors of Defence Estates are continuously monitoring the plan, to ensure that service delivery meets the standard we require. Although service performance has been poor, it is not universally so across England and Wales. All involved are working extremely hard to address these initial problems and indeed, improvements are already visible in emergency, urgent and routine responses, and the helpdesk has shown significant improvements in call handling capacity. I am confident that we will see real improvement very soon in the overall quality of service delivery as a result of the corrective action taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1495W.5/1">Service personnel receive basic pay in accordance with their rank, length of service and, in the case of other ranks, trade, irrespective of where they are serving. Basic pay includes an additional element, the &quot;X Factor&quot;, to reflect the difference between conditions of service experienced by members of the UK Armed Forces over a full career and conditions in UK civilian life. This includes the need to serve on occasions in difficult and dangerous circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1495W.5/2">Basic pay is part of a wider remuneration package payable to Service personnel which includes specialist pay e.g. flying pay or parachute pay, to recruit and retain personnel in specific branches or arms within the Services. Various allowances are also payable, such as a separation allowance, to compensate personnel for time away from their permanent base and separation from their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1495W.5/3">Following the announcement by the Secretary of State for Defence, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, Service personnel in specified operational locations, of which Iraq is one, will receive a tax free bonus, to be called &quot;operational allowance&quot;, of around &pound;2,240 for a six month tour. The allowance will be paid on a proportional basis for periods of duty which are shorter or longer than six months. Furthermore, as an adjustment to pay arrangements in the current financial year, the allowance is payable to all personnel who have served in Iraq since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>

UHBFT Security Officers provide an immediate response to any security incidents within the hospital boundaries.
