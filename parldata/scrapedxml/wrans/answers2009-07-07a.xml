	<p pid="a.623W.4/1">We, along with other international partners, made our concerns about the Shia Personal Status Law clear to the Afghan Government at a senior level. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister raised the issue with President Karzai. We welcomed President Karzai's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase> that the law would be changed to bring it in line with the Afghan Constitution, which guarantees equal rights for women, and the international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.4/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-20">20 June 2009</phrase>, the Minister of Justice met with female representatives of the Afghan Parliament and civil society and told them that his Ministry has now amended the Law. The amendments were made following written recommendations by Afghan civil society (the Afghan Women's Network), Katib university and moderate Ulema (religious scholars).</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.4/3">We understand the amendments made by the Afghan Ministry of Justice have added around 60 articles and removed around 10 from the Law. Language was also added to clarify the meaning of certain articles. The amended draft was viewed by the above female representatives as broadly 'pro women', and contentious articles, including the provision appearing to legalise rape, had been removed. The Law is also being reviewed by the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.4/4">President Karzai has indicated that the Law will next be sent back to the Afghan Parliament for approval (in time for the new session of Parliament, beginning <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-20">20 July 2009</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.4/5">The Law continues to cause controversy on both sides&mdash;some religiously conservative Ulema are still lobbying the President to pass the original draft, parts of which the international community and many Afghans deemed unacceptable. The outcome is still uncertain, therefore we, along with our international partners and Afghan civil society, will continue to follow the passage of the Law closely. We will lobby the Afghan Government whenever appropriate, to help ensure the final Law respects women's rights and does not undo progress made since 2001.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.5/1">Since 1999, we have actively supported the development of East Timor and played a part in ensuring that appropriate assistance was provided by the UN. The UN Mission in East Timor continues to provide peacekeeping support and capacity building to the East Timorese Government and Administration. The UK helps to fund this through our assessed contributions to the UN, and we will continue to offer strong support for multilateral efforts in East Timor. Additionally, the EU is assisting East Timor in promoting its justice sector and reinforcing the rule of law. The UK contributes both technical and financial assistance to the EU programmes in East Timor, currently worth around 18 million euros.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/2">We believe it is for the governments of Indonesia and East Timor to consider how best to deal with their past history, reflecting the concerns of their citizens. We have raised the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) and the Commission on Truth and Friendship (CTF) with East Timor and expressed the UK's view that it was important for the East Timorese parliament to debate the reports of the CTF and the CAVR as part of the process of establishing accountability. We hope that the adoption of the CTF report by President Yudhoyono of Indonesia and President Ramos Horta of East Timor will be a step forward in cementing the relationship between the two governments and enabling them to move forward in peaceful co-operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.2/2">From consular records we are aware of one case since 2000 of a British national who has been detained by the Egyptian authorities in which suspicion of terrorist activities has been given as the reason. We are aware of no cases in this period of British nationals having been charged in Egypt with terrorist activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/3">We are also aware of a case of a British national who was detained on suspicion of involvement in extremist-related activity. There were three cases of British nationals who were detained and found guilty of their involvement with an organisation which is illegal in Egypt. A fourth British national was briefly held and released on the same grounds. Additionally, there were a small number of British nationals during this period who were detained on arrival at Cairo airport and returned to the UK, with no formal reason given.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/4">Consular officials find out about the detention of British nationals overseas in various ways. The local authorities should inform us when they detain a British national. However, this does not always happen, particularly in the case of dual nationals in their country of other nationality. In many cases, consular officials will find out about a detention from the family, friends or the media. For these reasons, our records of detentions may not be definitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/5">We do not provide consular assistance to non-national UK residents, and would not expect to be notified by the Egyptian authorities of their arrest. We cannot therefore give a figure for the number of British residents arrested on suspicion or charge of terrorist activities during this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.631W.3/1">The Government take the human rights situation in North Korea extremely seriously. We are deeply concerned by continuing reports of serious, widespread and systematic human rights abuses there. We raise this issue with the North Korean Government at every appropriate opportunity. Our ambassador in Pyongyang raised our concerns most recently in February 2009 during the visit to North Korea by Lord Alton and Baroness Cox with the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs and Speaker of the North Korean Parliament. He emphasised the importance of dialogue on human rights and urged North Korea to accept a visit by the UN Special Rapporteur. However the North Korean Government refuse to engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.3/2">With EU Partners we sponsored annual resolutions on North Korea human rights at the UN General Assembly (in December 2008), and at the UN Human Rights Council (in March 2009). The latter includes the mandate for the UN Special Rapporteur on North Korea Human Rights, whose work in evidence gathering we strongly support.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.3/3">We have worked closely with a number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) over the past year. We sponsored an NGO report on children's rights in North Korea ahead of the February 2009 periodic report by the UN Committee on the Rights of Child on North Korea. We also supported the participation of a leading UK NGO at an international conference on North Korean Human Rights in Canberra in March. We are now working with NGOs and international partners to prepare for the Universal Periodic Review of North Korea's human rights record which is scheduled to take place at the UN Human Rights Council session in December 2009. Locally, our embassy in Pyongyang has given support to the project work of Handicap International in the DPRK which is designed to help improve the rights of the disabled there, and is looking at ways to increase that activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.648W.7/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not keep records of how many people have been trained in Afghan languages since 2001. Such training is frequently informal or organised privately by the individuals concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.7/2">DFID currently has seven UK-based staff members working in Kabul currently learning Dari, the official language of Afghanistan alongside Pashtu. In addition, we employ 16 locally engaged staff who are native Dari/Pashtu speakers in Kabul and one in Lashkar Gah. We also have access to Afghan translators for both languages in both Kabul and Lashkar Gah.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.7/3">DFID provides over 95 per cent. of the funding for the cross-departmental Stabilisation Unit. It has 18 Pashtu and 21 Dari speakers on its database of deployable civilian experts. Two Pashtu speakers are currently deployed in Helmand.</p>

In Northern Ireland, a joint contract has been established between relevant criminal justice organisations and the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (for face-to-face interpretation) and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (for sign language). This aims to enhance consistency in how interpretation is used across the criminal justice system by setting out the specific requirements of each partner organisation which is underpinned by individual organisational guidance. The contract provides flexibility for the use of interpreters registered with the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (England and Wales), where particular requirements cannot be met locally.</p>

Many generations of Gurkhas have served with great distinction in the UK armed forces, since they were first permitted to volunteer for British military service in the 1815 peace treaty that ended the Anglo-Nepalese war of 1814-15. Between 1948, when the Brigade of Gurkhas was formed as part of the British Army and <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, when the Brigade became UK based, it is estimated that some 37,100 Gurkhas served in and were discharged from the Brigade.

	<p pid="a.659W.9/1">It has been the policy of successive governments not to implement changes to pensions and similar benefits retrospectively. This policy has been applied across the public sector in the United Kingdom, not just to Gurkha veterans. To do so now would not only be counter to this policy but would also lead to potential claims from other groups in public sector schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.9/2">The Gurkha pension scheme pays pensions earlier than the armed forces pension scheme. This is because Gurkhas are unlikely to work again in Nepal unlike their British counterparts, in the UK. For example, a Gurkha Rifleman or Corporal with 15 years service (approximately 85 per cent. of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60. Like any pension scheme, the earlier the benefits are paid the lower the annual payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.9/3">It has been estimated that the cost of increasing the annual pension payments for Gurkhas who served prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> to the amount received by their UK equivalents would be &pound;1.5 billion over 20 years.</p>

Additionally, subsequent changes to the flying hours reporting system have resulted in data not being held centrally for 2007/08; figures for that year could only be retrieved at disproportionate cost.

	<p pid="a.665W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>, the Access to Justice Act 1999 came into force and established the community legal service (CLS) in place of the previous civil legal aid scheme. The financial eligibility criteria for legal help and for legal representation through the CLS were set out in the Community Legal Service (Financial) Regulations 2000, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>. The financial criteria were substantially amended by the Community Legal Service (Financial) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 2001, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-03">3 December 2001</phrase>. This brought about the simplification of the means test, with the introduction of a gross income limit and disposable income calculation based on a small number of targeted allowances. The financial eligibility limits are increased from time to time in line with inflation. From April 2005, the income limits for legal help and legal representation were aligned. At the same time the disposable capital limit for legal help was increased from &pound;3,000 to &pound;8,000, and we allowed the disposable income limit to be waived for victims of domestic violence seeking protection from harm. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-09">9 April 2007</phrase> we extended this so that both income and capital limits could be waived for these domestic violence victims. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> we increased the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid by 5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the Commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated July 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on requests for communications data made by the Charity Commission to communication service providers under the Charities Act 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/4" class="indent">Section 9 of the Charities Act (1993) provides the Charity Commission with the power to require anyone who has information which is relevant to the discharge of any of the Commission's functions to provide us with that information. This power extends to relevant documents. The Charity Commission also has a specific power, when we are conducting an inquiry, to require the production of accounts, statements in writing, written answers to questions, and copy documents from anyone who is able to provide them (section 8 of the Charities Act).</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/5" class="indent">To date the Commission has not kept statistics on the use of these powers to obtain communications data from communication service providers. However, since the enactment of the Regulation of Investigative Powers Act (RIPA) in 2000, it has been the general practice for regulators, such as the Charity Commission, and communications service providers to exchange information under RIPA requirements. Since 2000, the Charity Commission has used the RIPA to obtain communications data eight times:</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.2/14" class="indent">(i) 2008 nil</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/15" class="indent">On all of these occasions the requests for communications data was acceded to by the service provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/16" class="indent">In all cases the information obtained was used to progress our statutory investigations. We only use these powers when absolutely necessary and in the most serious of cases. Their use is always authorised at a senior level within the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.2/17" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. A senior member of the Commission's Compliance team would be very happy to discuss this aspect of our work with you if that would be useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.5/1">All nuclear installations in the UK have detailed emergency plans in order to respond to an accident or emergency that could occur on the site. The on and off-site plans are tested on a regular basis. Testing of the emergency plans is assessed by teams of inspectors from HSE's nuclear installations inspectorate. Annually, one of the nuclear licensed site off-site emergency plans is chosen to test not only the regional response to an emergency but also test the wider arrangements to involve central Government, including the exercising of the various Government Departments and agencies.</p>

Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) 2008, table 7.6 &quot;renewable sources used to generate electricity and heat and for transport fuels&quot;) but these figures are not broken down across industrial sectors. This table shows that the total amount of renewable heat generated across the UK economy was 8.48 TWh in 2007 (most recent year available), 7.51 TWh in 2006 and 6.97 TWh in 2005.</p>

This shows that in 2007 out of a total of 53,050 GWh of heat generated by CHP plants in the UK 992 GWh came from those using renewable fuels i.e. almost 2 per cent.

The information received by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) from the licensee is distributed according to the significance of the event. In this instance relevant Government Departments were alerted through the normal reporting arrangements. NII had no formal discussions with DTI or BERR about the event, but maintained regular contact at official level. Throughout its investigations NII kept the Environment Agency informed of progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.2/2">In 2001 guidance was issued to councils regarding the recording of deafblind registration. Where a person had a number of additional disabilities including deaf or hard of hearing, councils were advised to count these under the category of deaf and hard of hearing. Therefore in 1997, there may have been some people with multiple disabilities who may have been categorised as having a mental illness, learning or physical disabilities rather than in the categories &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;hard of hearing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.2/3">Registration of blindness is voluntary and so the registers cannot be thought of as providing a definitive number of blind and partially sighted people. In addition, issuing of guidance such as that mentioned above may impact on the numbers and therefore, figures for 2003 (first collection after the guidance was issued) have also been provided in the following tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.690W.11/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidance on the use of erlotinib for the treatment of lung cancer. NICE is also currently preparing guidance on the use of pemetrexed, topotecan and vandetanib for the treatment of lung cancer as well as further guidance on the use of erlotinib.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.11/2">In 2005, NICE issued clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, which addressed supportive and palliative care for lung cancer patients. An updated version of the guidelines is due to be published in 2011. These guidelines complement the guidance on Improving Outcomes in Lung Cancer, published in 1998, which has since been fully implemented across the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.11/3">Alongside NICE'S work programme on lung cancer, the Department will shortly be reconvening the Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma Advisory Group (LCAMAG) to further advise the National Cancer Director, Professor Mike Richards, and the department on the development and delivery of high quality services for lung cancer patients in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.11/4">In addition, the National Lung Cancer Audit, part of the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcome Programme, helps clinicians improve the quality and outcomes of lung cancer services. It provides comparative data about the incidence, nature and treatment of lung cancer, with the aim of improving patient care and outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.691W.5/1">The radioisotope supply shortage is a worldwide problem. There are only five reactors worldwide, none of which are located within the United Kingdom, that produce molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99 is the base material used by UK sites to produce technetium-99m which in turn is used for most nuclear medicine imaging procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.5/2">The Department is working with key stakeholders such as the Health Protection Agency (HPA), British Nuclear Medicine Society and national health service hospitals to find short and long-term solutions to the shortage. The NHS is embracing the adaptations needed to continue to provide patient care including, maximising activity to fit in with the supply of radioisotopes and undertaking alternative procedures where possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.5/3">In addition, the Department is taking a number of proactive steps in securing adequate supply of medical isotopes both in the short and long-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.5/4">The Department is communicating with the three suppliers of molybdenum-99 and technetium-99m to the UK market to ensure that we maximise patient access during this time of limited supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.691W.5/5">Through its work with the HPA, the Department has asked the Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee to provide the Department with advice on sustainable service delivery models for nuclear medicine examinations using different isotopes and scanning systems and provide advice on the future requirements for technetium-99m imaging to inform discussions on the longer term supply options.</p>

			<tr pid="a.696W.2/11"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. The high proportion of deliveries with an unknown length of gestation recorded needs to be taken into account when interpreting the rates of deliveries for each gestation group.<br/> 2. <i> Length of gestation:</i> This field shows the number of completed weeks of gestation according to the World Health Organisation definition, which specifies time from the first day of the last menstrual period. If this date is not reliable, an estimate is provided. This item appears for each baby on multiple birth delivery records; 0-36 weeks premature birth; 37+ weeks (includes post term births); and unknown.<br/> 3. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE):</i> An FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. However, the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. Maternity events taking place in either NHS hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary 'delivery' or 'birth' episodes. 'Other delivery events' are delivery events other than those resulting in delivery or birth episodes under NHS funding or in any other facility supplied under a service agreement with the NHS.<br/> 4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 5. <i> Data quality:</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. <i> Hospital providers: </i>A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). TCs (also known as diagnostic centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some TCs are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per trust, 'T1', 'T2', 'T3' etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an 'X'. <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.709W.2/2">Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) are the principal mechanism for the coordination of multi-agency planning at local level. Membership includes all Category 1 responders (such as emergency services, local authorities and health bodies) which are subject to a range of civil protection duties under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. As such, LRFs are responsible for planning for the multi-agency management of an influenza pandemic at local level, working closely with primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.2/3">Regional Resilience Forums (RRFs) allow key responders to plan together and improve the coordination and flow of information across and between regions and the centre. In preparation for wide-scale civil emergencies such as an influenza pandemic, RRFs would work closely with strategic health authorities to provide an information channel between central Government planning and local tiers, identify issues that cannot be resolved locally and provide appropriate feedback.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.5/2">The Audit Commission is responsible for monitoring the performance of local authorities. This includes ensuring that they meet their statutory requirements of which preparing for emergencies are one. (The Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004, requires local authorities to assess the risk of emergencies occurring and to maintain plans for managing these risks.)</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.5/3">The Audit Commission works with partner inspectorates (i.e. HM Inspectorate for Constabularies, the Care Quality Inspectorate, HM Inspectorate of Prisons; HM Inspectorate of Probation and Ofsted) to assess the performance of local services in England through the Comprehensive Area Assessment. For those organisations that are inspected both sector specific and multi-agency performance is assessed. This includes assessment against National Indicator 37, which assesses how aware the general public are of what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.5/4">The CCA Implementation team, within the Civil Contingencies Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, is responsible for running a CCA performance development and compliance work stream. An 'Expectation and Indicators of Good Practice Set for Category 1 and 2 Responders' has been published which sets out what is expected of those responsible for preparing for emergencies (including local authorities) and outlines mandatory requirements.

	<p pid="a.710W.5/1">In October 2008 the Prime Minister announced that central Government Departments will pay their suppliers as soon as possible and within 10 days. This commitment has also attracted support from the wider public sector. The Government are now working with the Regional Economic Fora (which provide a strategic approach to coordinating economic policies across Government in the regions, are made up of key regional bodies and are all either chaired or co-chaired by regional Ministers) to identify payment best practice across local authorities and the NHS and encourage these areas to commit to the prompt payment code.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.5/2">Local government has a strong track record of paying suppliers on time, with Best Value Performance Indicator (BVPI) data from 2007-08 showing that 95 per cent. of undisputed invoices were paid on time by local authorities. A Local Government Association survey in January 2009 showed that 32 per cent. of local authorities were making payments in 10 days or less, and a further 20 per cent. within 20 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.5/3">BVPI's have now been replaced by the single national indicator set which are outcome-based measurements of performance. The Government have committed to only performance managing local authorities within these agreed indicators and targets and as the 10-day payment policy for local authorities is not in the national indicator set, we will not be asking local authorities to report their performance. Instead, the focus on businesses in the national indicator set is on business growth and sustainability. In that context we know anecdotally, and through other surveys, that local authorities are targeting those businesses in most in need of prompt payment and are working on a range of wider measures to increase cash flow, simplify and increase the transparency and take up of public procurement opportunities particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.2/1">The Home Office allocated &pound;25,000 a year from 2003-04 to each crime disorder and reduction partnership (CDRP) in West Midlands which includes Tamworth and Staffordshire, as a contribution towards funding ASB co-ordinator posts. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supported the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs). As of 2008-09, Home Office funding for local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour now form part of the general area-based grant (ABG) paid by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This funding has been renewed for the period 2008-11 and it is for local partnerships to agree how the grants received should be allocated against locally determined priorities, including tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/2">Respect Programmes in the West Midlands have also had an impact on antisocial behaviour. These programmes, now the responsibility of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, were designed to kick-start a change in the way the area worked to tackle antisocial behaviour. Other Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example, the introduction of community support officers in the West Midlands, including Staffordshire but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/3">Similarly, other programmes and services contribute, sometimes indirectly, to tackling antisocial behaviour, including diversionary activities for young people, neighbourhood wardens, as well as neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood management.</p>

	<p pid="a.731W.8/1">The Forensic Science Service (FSS) has embarked on a consultation on its plans to transform, to move to a new national delivery model based around four primary sites, instead of the current seven main locations. It is not a consultation to cut staff numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/2">The company's preferred model does not envisage the long-term continued use of Chorley as a main laboratory. No final decision has been taken ahead of completion of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/3">In selecting those sites proposed as suitable for inclusion, a number of factors were carefully considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/4">A main building block of the proposed operational delivery model is the co-location of body fluid search examination with DNA analytical facilities to meet the challenging customer timeliness requirements and improvements in success rates (i.e. providing a useful DNA profile from a body fluid stain). This is significantly different to how the current services operate and a key enabler to any estate footprint.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/5">Current DNA analytical facilities are located at Huntingdon, London, Trident Court and Wetherby. The start up cost and time lag of introducing DNA facilities into sites where DNA is not currently delivered has had a significant impact on the choice of proposed retained locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/6">Among other key factors considered were:</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/7" class="indent">Available laboratory space, as well as type of space;</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/8" class="indent">Lowest risk on customer disengagement;</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/9" class="indent">Maintaining geographical spread across England &amp; Wales;</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/10" class="indent">Overall execution risk and cost/benefit analysis;</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/11" class="indent">Response to scenes;</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.8/12" class="indent">Current mix of skills at each site and their alignment, as far as possible, to the proposed national business streams.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated July 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question asking what estimate has been made of the Muslim population of Britain in each year since 1979. (284443)</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/5" class="indent">The Census is the most commonly used source for statistics on religion by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with more recent information on religious affiliation (that is the identification with a religion irrespective of actual practice or belief) from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The way people respond to questions on religion is sensitive to what question is asked and how it is asked. Therefore because of differences between the Census and LFS in terms of question design and also coverage of the type of establishments in which people reside, data from these two sources cannot be compared.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/6" class="indent">The 2001 Census was the first time that a religion question had been asked in the England and Wales (and Scotland) census, and revealed that 1,589,000 people in Great Britain identified as Muslim in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/7" class="indent">A question on religious affiliation was introduced into the LFS in Great Britain in Spring 2002 using an extended version of the wording used in the England and Wales Census, but was not asked of people aged 16 and under until 2004. Consequently the earliest suitable estimates are from 2004 which cover people of all ages, and are shown in Table 1 attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/8" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is included at Table 1.</p>

Arrangements are in place from <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August 2009</phrase> onwards to record the number of apprentices who are made redundant. Working with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) we have established a matching service to help apprentices at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. More generally, providers and the LSC have procedures to advise and relocate apprentices, in cases where providers or employers fail, to help ensure that they are able to continue in work and complete their apprenticeship. The &pound;140 million package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship places will help fund new provision in both the public sector and private sector, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.0/1">We intend to tackle the issues raised in the question as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/2"><i> </i><i> (a)</i> Section 15 of the Children and Young Persons Act places a duty on local authorities to arrange for all looked after children to be visited by a representative of theirs and for all looked-after-children to have available to them advice, support and assistance when they seek it. We shall be issuing regulations about how local authorities should discharge its duties under this section. We intend to impose a general minimum requirement setting the frequency of social work visits to looked-after-children and we will specify in addition that visits should also take place at the request of the child or their carer. We will be consulting on draft regulations and guidance including the frequency of visits in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/3"><i> (b)</i> We will also be using new regulations to broaden the categories of children who could be provided with an independent visitor. Care experienced adults might well make very suitable independent visitors for looked-after-children and we will consider them alongside other options.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/4"><i> </i><i> (c)</i> Section 8 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 sets out the considerations that local authorities must have regard to when they are considering making a placement for a looked-after-child. We will be strengthening regulations and guidance so that all placement decisions must be based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the individual child concerned which, for some children is likely to result in a placement away from their home community and out of their local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/5"><i> </i><i> (d)</i> Our strengthened regulations and guidance will say that every looked-after-child must have a care plan based on thorough detailed assessment setting out how the local authority intends to respond to their needs. All care plans must take into account the child's wishes and feelings. Plans to re-unify looked-after-children with their families must take account of children's safety and include an assessment of how the child and their family's circumstances have changed so that their parents are able to resume the child's care.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/6"><i> </i><i> (e)</i> Section 10 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 specifically strengthens the role of the independent reviewing officer (IRO) by:</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/7" class="indent">Making it clear that one of the IRO's core responsibilities is to ensure that children and young people are able to contribute meaningfully to their care plan and its reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/8" class="indent">Imposing a new legal duty on IROs to ensure that due consideration is given by the local authority to the child's wishes and feelings.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/9" class="indent">Ensure that each child will have a named IRO, so that a child can be confident that one person will offer continuity and have oversight of their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.754W.0/10">Through new regulations and guidance, we intend to specify that every child must have their own named IRO and that IROs must meet with the young person in advance of the review meeting. This is to ensure that they understand the purpose of the review and are given the opportunity to fully contribute to the discussion about the plan for their future care. Every review should provide a real opportunity to scrutinise the child's care plan to ensure that it continues to offer an appropriate response to the full range of their needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.756W.5/5">The detailed local consequences of these changes will depend upon the decisions of individual local authorities. It is a matter for the authorities to determine how to invest their budgets in the maintenance and upgrading of their IT systems,, and information on this expenditure is not collected centrally. The Department has indicated that it will support this expenditure with a capital grant for ICS of &pound;6.4 million in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.756W.8/1">Enfield are one of 30 play pathfinder authorities across England and began receiving play funding from April 2008, as part of the first wave of the children's plan play capital investment programme. The authority has already received &pound;594,107 capital funding and &pound;138,510 revenue funding during 2008-09 which was used to successfully deliver 12 new/improved public play areas in the borough.

	<p pid="a.756W.8/3">We are encouraging all Members of Parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local Members of Parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

Over the current spending review period (2008-11) Coventry has been allocated approximately &pound;21 million in capital and revenue funding to support the development of children's centres, early years and child care provision in the area, including outreach work for the most disadvantaged.

	<p pid="a.758W.5/2">The Quality Protects Management Information project was the responsibility of the then Secretary of State for Health when the original Integrated Children's System (ICS) requirements were developed between 2001 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/3">10 consultation events were held in 2000 with over 500 representatives from organisations responsible for child welfare in England and Wales, including local authority social services departments, private and voluntary agencies, the then Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, pilot post-qualifying child care courses, software houses, and a number of other interested individuals. Two additional events in Wales drew together an inter-agency audience in the context of the Children First programme. As part of the consultation exercise, specific groups consulted included foster carers, children, young people, families with disabled children and families from ethnic minority groups. Information on exactly how many meetings were held with either local authorities or frontline social workers or on how many local authority officers and frontline social workers were consulted at each stage of development is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/4">Following this exercise, the Department of Health (DH) published the conceptual framework for ICS as a consultation document (&quot;Integrated Children's System: Working with Children in Need and Their Families&quot;) addressed to Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CSSRs) in December 2002. DH and the Welsh Assembly Government addressed a further consultation document (&quot;Information Outputs for Children's Social Services A Conceptual Framework&quot;) to CSSRs in March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/5">The commercial systems suppliers consulted by DH were OLM, Anite, Careworks, and TCO. Anite's ICS interests were purchased in 2008 by Northgate; TCO was acquired in 2005 by CACI.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/6">Following machinery of Government changes in 2003, the Department for Children, Schools and Families took responsibility for ICS. Capgemini consultants were contracted by DCSF to conduct a readiness review of local authorities' ICS preparedness in 2006. These consultants were then retained to prepare industry-standard requirements documentation, in response to feedback from local authorities during the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.5/7">Correspondence with IT suppliers contracting for ICS systems is the responsibility of those individual local authorities which either are, or might wish to become, their customers. The Department's direct relations with these suppliers concern product assessment activities undertaken to assist local authorities in light of the readiness review. The results of these assessments have all been published on the Department's website at</p>

	<p pid="a.760W.2/1">We do not hold a definitive list of field forces focused on school standards. One of the principal field forces in this area is the national strategies, which has a wide remit for raising standards of achievement and rates of progression for children and young people in all phases of schools and early years settings. Its principal remit is to support both schools and local authorities to improve teaching and learning, and to develop strategies for whole school improvement. The cost of this field force is given within our answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-24">24 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.2/2">In our answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April</phrase> we estimated a figure of around &pound;90 milliom in 2008-09 to cover all field force advisers that work directly with LAs and Children's Trust partners. It is difficult to provide a precise breakdown of expenditure on each of these, since they are delivered through a range of mechanisms&mdash;some are directly contracted (so the cost of advisors is incorporated within a larger contract), some are located in Government Offices as secondees, and some are employed directly by DCSF or its NDPBs. However, based on the information available, our estimate of the largest (in terms of 2008-09 expenditure) 10 field forces working directly with LAs and Children's Trust partners are listed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.2/3" class="indent">National Strategies Regional and Local Advisers, &pound;30 million</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.2/4" class="indent">Partnership for Schools Employed and Contracted Advisers c&pound;10 million</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.5/2">Before 1997 there were no figures collected about the loss of school playing fields but there was widespread public concern over the increasing loss of such facilities. Schools and local authorities could sell off playing fields without any restriction and use the sale proceeds however they wished.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.5/3">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 stopped the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Schools and local authorities must obtain the Secretary of State's approval before they can dispose of their land. The legislation sets out clear criteria for obtaining consent which includes ensuring that the land is genuinely surplus to schools and community groups. Also, any sale proceeds must be used to improve sports or educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.5/4">Since 1997 the Secretary of State has approved 203 applications that involve the sale of an area of land capable of forming a sports pitch of at least 0.2 hectares at schools in England. Of these 99 were at schools that had closed and the land was not needed by any other local school. Of the 104 applications at operating schools, the proceeds of sale will be used to improve the on-site sports facilities in 86 cases. In the other 18 applications the schools will benefit from improved educational facilities. A list of the schools concerned will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.763W.2/1">We have not made any estimate of the number of teachers who may not have had a Criminal Records Bureau check. All teachers currently working in the school workforce will have had either an enhanced CRB disclosure or a check against the old police records system if they were in post prior to the introduction of the CRB, and all teachers will also have been checked against the list of those barred from working in educational establishments (List 99). All new appointments, both teaching and support staff, in the school workforce now require an enhanced CRB disclosure under the terms of the School Staffing (England) (No2) Regulations 2006, and those regulations also require schools to maintain a record of the vetting checks they have carried out on their staff. From November 2010 all new appointments to the school sector will have to register with the new vetting and barring scheme, and all existing staff in school will have to register by 2015. The ISA registration process incorporates a CRB check. The CRB collect some statistics on the volume of checks being made in the education sector on a monthly basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.763W.2/2">However, this is for all school staff not just teachers, and some teachers will have had more than one check if they are involved in supply work or work for more than one employer so we would be unable to make an estimate of the number of teachers who have not had a CRB check.</p>

This includes young people who are responsible for the care of a family member (which is how young carers are usually defined) plus others who may provide more occasional support such as child care for their parents or care for neighbours and friends.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.0/4">Aiming High, the Department's 10 Year Youth Strategy, set out our commitment to engaging young people in decision making at a local level by empowering them to have greater influence over the services that are provided for young people in their area. Over one and a half million young people have benefited from initiatives such as Youth Opportunity and Youth Capital Funds which require not only that funding applications are made by young people, but that young people are part of the panel that decides which applications are successful. An independent evaluation carried out last year showed that the empowerment of young people through these funds is not only leading to increased participation in higher quality things to do and places to go, but challenging stereotypes and perceptions of young people in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.0/5">We have also issued &quot;Working Together: Listening to the voices of children and young people&quot; which promotes the participation of children and young people in decision-making in school, local authority and related settings. 99 per cent. of schools have pupil voice activity and 95 per cent. have a student council, (Institute of Education, September 2007).</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.0/1">The UK has a robust anti-money laundering regime. When last evaluated by the Financial Action Task Force, the international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standard-setting body, the UK achieved one of the highest overall compliance ratings of any country.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.0/2">Since then we have continued to improve the effectiveness of the UK's regime; in particular, through the introduction in December 2007 of new money laundering regulations. These regulations require banks, and other regulated businesses, to undertake comprehensive customer due diligence checks, including identifying any beneficial owners involved. Enhanced due diligence procedures are required in higher-risk situations, including where the client is a politically exposed person.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.0/3">HM Treasury has regular discussions on the effectiveness of the money laundering regulations with business stakeholders and public partners, such as the FSA, and in the specific case of politically exposed persons (PEP's), also with the Department for International Development. Discussions on PEPs are held both bilaterally and in several fora, including the Money Laundering Advisory Committee, that bring together cross-sector and cross-Whitehall participants.</p>

	<p pid="a.782W.9/1">The Government have set a deliberately stretching target that all new homes must be zero carbon by 2016. The stamp duty land tax relief (SDLT) for zero carbon homes was introduced to help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of micro-generation, and sets a gold standard for green homes. Few currently exist, but the purpose of the relief is to act as signal. We have always made it clear that the SDLT relief for zero carbon homes would evolve and we expect to see more of these homes built in the future. 21 homes have qualified for the zero carbon homes relief since October 2007.</p>
