This is in part due to changes in the way the data is collected and coded. For example, health visitors, district nurses, general practitioners and other professionals, who are not formally coded as public health staff, perform public health tasks. There has been growth in many of these groups. There is also variation from trust to trust in which exact roles are classed as public health. In addition, the definition of the public health specialty has been more closely defined in recent years resulting in the exclusion of groups of staff such as health visitors and school nurses who some trusts and PCTs previously included as public health staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.613W.3/2">This year, the Ministry of Justice has committed &pound;3 million to fund independent domestic violence advisers: trained specialists whose goal is to ensure the safety and recovery of victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.3/3">The Home Office has allocated &pound;2 million to fund the local delivery of support services for victims of domestic violence and their children, and just under &pound;2 million has been made available to local areas for the development of multi-agency risk assessment conferences, which aim to ensure the safety of identified high risk victims, and help them recover from their experiences without fear of repeat victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.3/4">Safe housing is integral to victims' recovery, and Support People funding is available to provide housing-related support for victims of domestic violence. In 2005-06, over &pound;59 million was made available through this funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.3/5">The Government also part funds a matrix of helplines which provide support and information to victims of domestic violence, to enable them to access assistance and support to help them recover from domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.3/6">In addition to this, health services have been making significant progress in the early identification of, and intervention with, victims of domestic violence victims&mdash;for example, rolling out making routine inquiries of all pregnant women, and taking forward work on collecting violent crime data (including domestic violence data) through electronic patient records.</p>

This policy will reflect local health needs and priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.616W.9/1">Regulations came into force in April 2005 which prevented national health service dentists, NHS opticians, general practitioner practices and out of hours providers from establishing new premium rate telephone numbers for patients seeking to contact services. Existing numbers were not affected. Ministers decided not to issue directions to enforce a migration of existing numbers to low-cost alternatives such as 0844 or 0845 in the light of Ofcom's decision to review its numbering system. Ofcom has now created a new country-wide number range 03 for public and not for profit bodies, which are charged to the consumer at the local rate, and has now started allocating numbers using the 03 prefix.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/2">The Department expects decisions on telephone numbers in primary care to be based on what is in the best interests of patients taking account of the Central Office of Information guidance on cost to the citizen.</p>
	<p pid="a.616W.9/3">NHS trusts and foundation trusts are not affected by the aforementioned regulations.</p>
