However, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) recognised that having 38 multi-purpose test centres (MPTCs) operational at the launch of the new test would mean candidates in significant parts of Great Britain would not have the expected access to a MPTC. 58 per cent. of the population would have been able to reach a MPTC within 45 minutes travelling time. Following consideration of representations from motorcycle interest groups, DSA decided to defer implementation for six months to allow consideration of delivery options which might help with the number of locations to offer the test when it was launched.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.8/2">Since then we have been consulting on a modular approach to practical motorcycle testing. If adopted, DSA will split the off-road from the on-road part of the test.</p>
	<p pid="b.6W.8/3">By <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March</phrase>, DSA will have in place up to 67 operational sites including part-time and temporary sites for the off-road elements. In addition, there are outstanding planning approvals or legal negotiations on a further five sites that the Agency hopes to have ready in time. Not all of these sites are MPTCs. We will have operational sites in 94 per cent. of the original 66 search areas. This means that 89 per cent. of the population could reach a motorcycle testing site within 45 minutes travelling time.

As a first stage, the Government believe that there is a strong case for a new line between London and the West Midlands serving a Heathrow international interchange station. Direct high-speed services could make use of the new line and the conventional rail network to serve destinations in the north of England and Scotland, cutting journey times and increasing capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.5/2">There are no parliamentary trains within the meaning of the Railways Act 1844.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.5/3">Mindful of the requirements of relevant legislation, the Department for Transport is currently funding a rail replacement bus service between Ealing Broadway station and Wandsworth Road station. This service, which is a temporary measure until the Department can arrange a replacement rail service in this area, has been operating since <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.10W.5/4">Other than the aforementioned service, no rail replacement bus services are directly funded by the Department. London Midland provide rail replacement bus services in place of all trains to Barlaston, Norton Bridge and Wedgewood. The costs for these are part of the overall subsidy payment for the London Midland franchise.</p>

	<p pid="b.15W.8/4">For speed restrictions more generally, the Transport Research Laboratory published a review of non-UK studies in 1994 which established a link between vehicle speed and the risk of accidents.

	<p pid="b.16W.2/4">The appraisal framework builds on a broad base of evidence and research, including work produced for the Eddington Study. It builds in evidence on the value of time saved and reliability gains to businesses, which are important for economic efficiency. Recent evidence on the contribution of transport to national productivity, such as through transport's impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the labour market is also being incorporated into the assessment framework for schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.16W.2/5">The Department is currently undertaking research to develop an approach for evaluating the productivity effects of transport schemes, ex post (i.e. after they have been delivered).

They are isolated within the wider community and I have every confidence in the PSNI's ability to deal with the threat they pose. The extension of the decommissioning scheme provides loyalists with a final opportunity to signal their commitment to move forward and give up their weapons. This scheme does not cut across continuing PSNI efforts to find and remove illegal weapons.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.0/2">Maintaining Harmony helps to relieve the stress and burden on our armed forces and their families. Consequently, the Service Chiefs expend considerable effort in increasing intervals between operational tours intervals and maintaining the Harmony Guidelines. As I stated in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January 2009</phrase>, breaches of the Harmony Guidelines have decreased, albeit not as quickly as I would have hoped for but, I am confident that the trend is heading in the right direction and that the Service Chiefs have measures in place to monitor and address the breaches while maintaining operational capability. The first table following gives an indication of mean unit tour intervals, which shows that the Royal Artillery, Royal Signals and the Royal Logistic Corps units are suffering greater commitment than most.

	<p pid="b.26W.0/16">The second table identifies the level of separation (Harmony), which incorporates all activities, such as training, support to operations and courses that take service personnel away from their family and friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.0/17">The current levels of Individual Harmony show that:</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.0/18" class="indent">Less than 1 per cent. of Royal Navy/Royal Marines personnel were in breach of the single service guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.0/19">Owing to the introduction of the Joint Personnel Administration system, it is not possible at present to identify the exact level of breach of the Harmony Guidelines in the Army. Validated data will not be available until January 2010 but, for administrative purposes, the percentage is currently being held at 10.3 per cent. the last figure in which we can have confidence before the introduction of the new system. However, every effort is being made by all levels of the chain of command to ensure that soldiers are not overly committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.0/20">The level of RAF breaches shows a significant drop from 9.4 per cent. to 6.1 per cent. The degree of change has been brought about by an amendment to the reporting criteria. The RAF Harmony Guideline has changed from 140 days separation in a 12 month period to 280 days in a 24 month period. Without increasing the level of separation commanders now have greater flexibility to deploy personnel on career courses, education and adventure training without breaking the Harmony Guideline.</p>

	<p pid="b.29W.2/1">The basis for demonstrating the safe operation of nuclear facilities is that the requirements of good practice in engineering, operation and safety management are met. Risks from activities in the gravel gerties have to meet the legal requirement to be As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). There are also in place numerical risk targets defined by the independent nuclear safety regulator, the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII).</p>
	<p pid="b.29W.2/2">When compared to these numerical targets, risks for building workers lie between the Basic Safety Objective and the Basic Safety Level and have been assessed to be ALARP. The risks for other on-site workers and the public are below the Basic Safety Objective. An ongoing programme of work in the gravel gerties, agreed with the NII, continues to drive risks down further. The NII is satisfied with this strategy and that operations continue to be completed safely.</p>

While I have considered the points made, the Ministry of Defence has seen no general evidence of damage to nuclear test veterans' health, and therefore in my view the atomic veterans litigation must proceed at the High Court.

	<p pid="b.38W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence has not settled any common law claims for compensation relating to participation in the British nuclear testing programme of the 1950s and 1960s. The MOD does, however, have a long established war pension scheme which pays no-fault compensation in the form of tax-free pensions and allowances for ex-service personnel injured or made ill as a result of their service before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. There are no time limits for making a claim under the war pension scheme. The scheme is administered by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA). Information on awards under the scheme is published quarterly by the Department's Defence Analytical and Services Agency (DASA) derived from data from the war pension computer system. That data does not enable injuries or illnesses to be linked to service at a particular location. It is not, therefore, possible to identify payments made to British nuclear test veterans under the war pension scheme. Nor is it possible to say how much has been spent on war pensions to nuclear tests veterans.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.8/2">The Department is committed to compensation policy and individual decisions reflecting case facts and the relevant law, which are evidence based and in line with contemporary medical and scientific understanding. To meet this commitment there is routine scrutiny of the published peer reviewed literature and any other evidence of suitable quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.8/3">When considering a claim for a war pension the facts of each case are considered on their individual merits. The test of proof is unique to the war pension scheme and is preferential to the claimant. It is more advantageous than the normal civil test of proof. In a war pension claim made more than seven years after leaving service there has to be no more than reliable evidence to raise a reasonable doubt that there is a connection between service and the claimed condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.8/4">For nuclear test veterans, entitlement may be given under the war pension scheme for leukaemia, other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia, and polycythaemia rubra vera, in both cases where the condition arose within 25 years of presence at a nuclear test. This is based on the findings of the three National Radiological Protection Board epidemiological studies on mortality and cancer incidence of nuclear test participants 1952 to 1998 (published in 1988, 1993 and 2003). For these conditions, entitlement relates to presence at the sites and not exposure to ionising radiation. Otherwise the studies concluded that levels of mortality and cancer incidence in participants and controls were similar, with overall mortality less than expected from national rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.8/5">A war pension, however, may be awarded in any individual case where the evidence shows that the individual is suffering from a recognised radiogenic disease and was exposed to a significant level of ionising radiation. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of British nuclear test veterans received a &quot;zero&quot; dose of ionising radiation.</p>

We believe the new welfare offence, tightening up the law relating to animal fighting and ending the loopholes that allowed miscreants to circumvent disqualification orders introduced in the Act will help reduce the number of animals being abused. We are also currently in the process of producing new codes of practice for keeping dogs, cats and horses. These will help educate the public as to how to better keep their animals. We are also working on new secondary legislation under the Animal Welfare Act to help protect the welfare of racing greyhounds, and new codes of practice on the keeping of primates by private collectors and the rearing of gamebirds.</p>

	<p pid="b.49W.2/1">The objective of the New Technologies Demonstrator programme (NTDP) is to provide impartial information and impart industry experience to waste stakeholders on new innovative technologies not yet established in England. The intention is to overcome the real and perceived risks and barriers of introducing such technologies in England. This is being achieved through the provision of impartial technical, environmental and economic information and performance data for the project facilities. This includes real experiences of planning and permitting, reaching financial closure and on wider issues such as informing policy development, for example the renewables obligation.</p>

	<p pid="b.50W.5/1">The UK has tripled the amount of household waste it recycles in the last 10 years, and on the back of this there is a growing recycling and reprocessing industry in the UK, particularly for materials such as glass, newsprint and plastic bottles. Not all of the materials collected for recycling are re-processed into products in the UK: some are re-processed abroad, reflecting trends in the global economy. As with all commodities, the prices for recyclable materials rise and fall according to supply and demand. In the current economic downturn, demand for raw materials&mdash;including recyclable waste&mdash;has declined, leading to a fall in prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.50W.5/2">The Government are monitoring the situation closely, working with the Waste and Resources Action Programme, the Local Government Association, the Environment Agency, the waste management industry and others. According to the best available information, markets for recycled materials have stabilised, though at lower prices. Recycling continues to be an economically viable and environmentally beneficial part of the UK's waste strategy, and we are encouraging householders to continue to put out waste for recycling.</p>

Indeed, we were keen that the programme should encourage local authorities to put in additional funding and to stimulate partnership at local level.</p>

	<p pid="b.66W.2/1">Progress on halting and reversing the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa has not been sufficient and there is a high risk that the target under Millennium Development Goal 6 will be missed. However, there has been some significant progress in some African countries. In Eritrea, Rwanda and Sao Tome and Principe, deaths from malaria have been halved by following the recommended measures, including providing bednets. Of the 647 million people at risk in Africa, the percentage protected by bednets rose from 3 per cent. in 2001 to 26 per cent. in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.2/2">Between 2000 and 2007 the Department for International Development (DFID) funded approximately 40 million bednets worldwide (mostly for sub-Saharan Africa) and we estimate that these will have saved 660,000 lives. Over the course of 2008-11 we will provide at least 20 million bednets in sub-Saharan Africa and it is estimated that these should save 330,000 lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.2/3">Our support towards the provision of bednets is usually part of a larger package of measures to improve health and to combat malaria, through a number of programmes and health sector approaches which include the purchase and distribution of bednets. It is therefore difficult to disaggregate the costs of the bednets alone. For example, we contribute to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) who estimate that they financed 120 million bednets between 2001 and 2006, during which period we provided approximately 8.7 per cent. of GFATM financing.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question in reference to his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-25">25 November 2008</phrase>, Official Report, column 619W, on employment, how many staff he estimates will be recruited to (a) full-time and (b) part-time (i) temporary and (ii) permanent positions in Jobcentre Plus and how many of these appointments will be made from staff originally recruited to support the introduction of Employment Support Allowance. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.0/4" class="indent">We are still planning for the impact of the Pre-Budget Report announcements at the moment. In practice, we try to accommodate applicants' preferences for working patterns, subject to business needs. Currently, around 35 per cent of the staff in Jobcentre Plus work part time and we anticipate a similar proportion of part time staff amongst our new recruits.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.0/5" class="indent">We plan to recruit the majority of people to fixed term appointment contracts, normally for 1-2 years, although there will be local variations and this will include some permanent appointments. There will be periods of the year, at the start and during the summer months, where we recruit temporary staff to cover known peaks of work or scheduled leave. Currently, we do not plan to recruit significant numbers of temporary staff outside these periods.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.0/6" class="indent">We are unable to identify through our Resource Management reporting system whether someone has been recruited specifically for Employment and Support Allowance backfill. However, in the first quarter of 2009, we anticipate converting up to 300 staff from temporary to permanent contracts, and although it is not possible to say how many may apply for permanent appointments, we encourage people to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.0/7" class="indent">Current Civil Service Commission rules mean that someone on a temporary contract can only secure a permanent appointment by applying through fair and open competition via one of our recruitment exercises. The Civil Service Bill allows for some recruitment flexibilities. One of these is the capacity to convert temporary employees to permanent status by a fair and objective process approved by the Civil Service Commissioners. This applies to employees at Administrative level at or after 12 months employment. DWP is currently writing a submission to the Commissioners on the process it proposes to use for the conversion of up to 300 temporary staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.84W.2/1">We have made substantial progress in tackling child poverty. 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1998-99. As a result of the support we have introduced, families and children in the poorest fifth of the population are, on average, &pound;4,100 a year better off than in 1997. The measures we announced in the pre-Budget report 2008 will increase this to &pound;4,400 from April 2009. These measures will continue to benefit children in Hemel Hempstead and Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.2/2">In addition, Government measures over the past two years will result in lifting around a further 500,000 children from relative poverty. Our plans for reducing levels of child poverty in England were set out in &quot;Ending child poverty: everybody's business&quot;, which is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.87W.5/1">The vast majority, over 95 per cent., of winter fuel payments are made automatically, based on information already held in DWP records. In these cases there is no need for an individual to provide further information or to make a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.5/2">However there are a small group of people who may qualify for winter fuel payments but cannot be identified by DWP records. This is usually because they are not in receipt of a state pension or other benefit administered by the DWP. These people need to complete a claim form so that their eligibility can be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.5/3">Information required by the winter fuel payment claim form includes: name, address, date of birth, national insurance number and bank/building society details so that we may make a payment direct into a person's bank account. People are also asked to declare, for example, whether there is anyone else aged 60 or over in their household and whether they are in hospital or a care home. The claim form is available from the Pension Service website.</p>

	<p pid="b.89W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/2">The 10-year Drug Strategy &quot;Protecting families and communities&quot;, published in February 2008, set out a series of steps to address the problems associated with young people's misuse of drugs, alcohol and volatile substances.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/3">The strategy committed Government to conduct a review of drug and alcohol education. This has taken place and Ministers announced their intention to make PSHE statutory in October 2008, in recognition of the key role it plays in equipping children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to lead healthy and successful lives. At the same time, Ministers launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, head teacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report to Ministers in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE will be the subject of a full public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/4">Frank, the joint DCSF, Department of Health and Home Office drugs advice and information campaign for young people, continues to play a key role in helping to prevent drug use among young people (11-18) by changing their attitudes and perceptions towards drugs and drug users. A new Frank Cocaine campaign was launched in December 2008. Awareness of Frank remains very high: in the latest tracking study (report July 2008) 83 per cent. of young people were aware of the campaign. This figure is unchanged from 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/5">The Drug Strategy also committed to publish guidance to help the commissioning and delivery of treatment services with a greater focus on the needs of parents and families, and to that effect the National Treatment Agency (NTA) published carers' guidance in October 2008. The NTA will also shortly be publishing commissioning guidance for local drug and alcohol commissioners and partnerships which will have a greater focus on the needs of families.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/6">To meet our commitment to provide intensive support to substance misusing parents through a range of recently established family interventions, targeting families at risk, the substance misuse agenda has been included in remit letter for local parenting support advisers and in the broad remit for Parenting and Early Intervention projects. Furthermore, Family Intervention Pilots have been extended to 500 further families affected by substance misuse. The NTA is working with DCSF in the development of the Child Poverty Family Intervention Projects in 10 pilot areas during 2008-09. This will be rolled out to further areas in the next two years.</p>

MOJ has absorbed the drug offender series into its overall offender statistics outputs, such as the Criminal Statistics command paper. My statisticians conducted an extensive consultation exercise, both internally and externally, which revealed dwindling demand for a separate drug offenders bulletin.

	<p pid="b.98W.8/2">The Policing Green Paper&mdash;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing Our Communities Together&mdash;stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;with one exception the Home Office will neither set nor maintain top-down numerical targets for individual police forces&mdash;a significant gesture of trust and reduction of bureaucracy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.8/4">The Government have already removed the targets for the police that concerned frontline officers the most, such as the target to bring more offences to justice. Following the Green Paper announcement, the Government have removed centrally set, top down targets for police forces relating to efficiency, and the 10-year race employment targets come to an end at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, when a final report against a centrally set progression target will also be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.8/5">Going forward, we will expect police authorities to set their own local targets on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.8/6">The Government have also set multi-agency targets for Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJBs) for 2008-09 on enforcement (including fail to appear (FTA) warrant enforcement, community penalty breach enforcement and licence recall), asset recovery and the Persistent Young Offender pledge. LCJBs are multi-agency partnerships which include the police, and LCJBs' targets measure jointly the performance of the police and their partner agencies. In response to the Policing Green Paper, there will be no top-down numerical targets for LCJBs for 2009-10. Instead, LCJBs have been asked to set their own local targets according to local priorities and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.8/7">The one remaining target the Government will set for police forces will be on confidence that they and their partners are tackling the crime and antisocial behaviour issues that matter most locally.</p>

Overall Government grant to local authorities will next year be &pound;73.1 billion which provides an increase of 4.2 per cent. on a like for like basis. This is the second year of a three year settlement which provides councils with an additional &pound;8.9 billion up to 2010-11 and gives them the certainty and flexibility they need to plan ahead and manage their budgets.

	<p pid="b.125W.3/2">Some central Government Departments operating 084x and 087x telephone numbers apply additional charges on top of the costs of the call. However the extent of these practices has not been systematically assessed. Therefore the cross-government Contact Council has commissioned research requesting that central Government Departments provide details of how many 084x and 087x telephone numbers they operate, and whether these numbers partake in revenue sharing activities, as part of a comprehensive survey of number usage in the public sector. Once this research has been carried out the Contact Council will issue guidelines on numbering in general, including the use of 084x and 087x numbers. This guidance will be published later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.128W.0/1">&quot;Laptop diplomat&quot; is a phrase we have coined to describe a member of staff equipped, with mobile communications and a laptop computer, to work away from the embassy. He or she could be based in London or at a Post overseas, working in a single country or on a regional basis, but will have the capability to travel outside the capital city to often remote locations (for example Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, or Juba in southern Sudan) in response to a specific need.</p>
	<p pid="b.128W.0/2">We are already doing a lot of &quot;laptop diplomacy&quot;. We have laptop diplomats operating in a range of roles and environments across the network, including as conflict advisors and analysts in Africa, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, or as roving envoys in the Pacific and Central Asia. Each scenario is different. But in each case, laptop diplomats give the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) a better understanding of events and a greater ability to influence those events by working more closely with the people who matter, whether they are UN agencies, non governmental organisations or local political figures. We are developing IT solutions that will enable us to do more of it and do it better.</p>
	<p pid="b.128W.0/3">Those solutions include the &quot;Virtual Embassy&quot;&mdash;an interactive website which will build on many of the features of our current embassy websites. They will consist of an external, public-facing web page that provides basic information for visitors (UK or local); some of the services a real embassy provides (for example a click through to real (call centre) or virtual (self help) consular and visa services); and allows some engagement on political issues, through the creative use of tailored, local content and interactive features (such as blogs; videoconferences; discussion forums, and personalisation). In addition, they will include a set of internet-based tools that enable a laptop diplomat to carry out all the functions they could do at their desk in the embassy, anywhere where they have an internet connection. So virtual embassies will provide us with a means to engage with stakeholders and advance policy campaigns in countries where we have no physical presence.</p>
	<p pid="b.128W.0/4">Laptop diplomats and virtual embassies are examples of the way the FCO is modernising, helping us to build a flexible, agile overseas network that adapts quickly to new challenges and delivers for the whole of Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.2/4">Ukraine has made some encouraging recent progress on democratisation, with three consecutive elections recognised as largely free and fair. But Ukraine must address a number of key issues if it is to consolidate on these recent democratic gains, strengthen its democratic institutions and achieve greater domestic political stability. Key areas of concern are high levels of corruption, weak rule of law and ambiguities in the constitution. We are working closely with Ukraine on all of these issues, in particular through the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.140W.6/1">The Government are aiming to bring forward some of schools capital expenditure due in 2010-11 into financial year 2009-10, to stimulate the economy during the current economic downturn. However, because of the strategic planning that underpins Building Schools for the Future, it would be unsuitable for bringing forward in this way. BSF typically involves the design and build of entire new schools which are simply less suitable for bringing forward quickly for construction in a 12 month period.</p>

	<p pid="b.150W.2/1">No recent assessment has been made. The framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) introduced in September 2008 requires staff to have the right language skills to support children from birth to five to develop communication skills in English and to help ensure that their welfare needs are protected. The requirements for providers working with older children set proportions for the number of staff required to hold level 2 and 3 qualifications in an area of work relevant to child care (and the Common Core Skills for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register). As part of the requirements candidates need to demonstrate competence in English. Ofsted inspects providers against these requirements. The requirements on settings are designed to help ensure effective standards of communication in settings and to enable parents to choose providers who also speak their home language.</p>

	<p pid="b.150W.11/1">The main functions of the Observatory are to: provide an authoritative source of data and evidence on obesity, overweight and their determinants; co-ordinate surveillance on obesity and overweight, including working towards the commitment to monitoring made in the World Health Organisation (WHO) European Charter on Counteracting Obesity; analyse surveillance and indicator data, and report on progress against the new ambition to reduce the proportion of overweight and obese children to 2000 levels by 2020 in the context of tackling obesity across the population; provide guidance on assessing and evaluating pilots and demonstration sites in England; gather information on international best practice and developing links to the International Obesity Task Force, WHO, and other supranational bodies; and provide technical support to the Government's expert panel on obesity.</p>
	<p pid="b.150W.11/2">In its first nine months of operation the Observatory has reviewed options for calculating child obesity prevalence in England; produced detailed analysis, commentary, guidance and data tools relating to the National Child Measurement Programme; and is developing a framework with supporting guidance and tools for use by primary care trusts and others in evaluating weight management interventions to enhance the evidence base. Reports published by the Observatory can be found on their website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.150W.11/4">Future plans include: making reports on obesity data sources and the availability of evidence; recommendations for improving data and evidence; wider evaluation support to practitioners; and further development of approaches to mapping obesity and its determinants building on work already undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.150W.11/5">The Observatory works with a range of organisations to support policy makers and practitioners involved in tackling obesity and related issues and will continue to consult and communicate with key audiences to shape objectives, deliverables and future work areas.</p>

If parents have concerns about the leadership and management of their child's school, they may complain to Ofsted, which has powers to investigate. Such an investigation could lead to a school being inspected. The Chief Inspector has powers to inspect a school at any time and the Secretary of State has powers to require Ofsted to inspect a school.</p>

It will include a section on ContactPoint, eCAF and ICS to be completed as appropriate by practitioners. Views will be sought from practitioners that use the system, based on their experiences of working with children, young people and families. The survey will be carried out annually and used with management information from the system to identify trends and track progress towards realising the benefits of each of the systems. The results of the survey will be collated at both national and local authority level.</p>

This work is due to take place during 2009-10. We will also take account of any recommendations relevant to the operation of ICS that may arise from Lord Laming's report.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.5/4">The effectiveness of the Client Caseload Information System (CCIS) was assessed by the National Audit Office in its study of the Connexions Service in 2004. The tracking capability of the CCIS system and its capability to generate robust management information was explored and subsequently commended as a key lever in the national strategy to tackle the issue of 16 to 18-year-olds in England not in education, employment or training.</p>

	<p pid="b.161W.6/1">There is strong evidence to show significant wage and employment benefits for young people achieving well at school, compared to young people who do not attain. These benefits persist throughout peoples' lifetimes. There are also clear benefits of higher skill levels to the economy and to society. There are a number of studies looking at wage and employment benefits of qualifications. For example, research by the Centre for the Economics of Education found that people with five or more GCSEs at A*-C earn on average around 9-11 per cent. more than those without and are around 3 percentage points more likely to be employed. People achieving one to four GCSEs at A*-C earn a positive wage return of around 5 per cent. and are around 1-2 percentage points more likely to be employed than those without.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/2">The Department is committed to enabling as many young people as possible to achieve their potential. Raising the participation age (RPA) from 2013 will be a key lever to improve the attainment of young people as they enter the labour market. Independently verified research estimates the economic benefits of raising the participation age to be around &pound;2.4 billion per year group over the course of their lifetime. This research was published alongside the introduction of the Education and Skills Bill to the House in November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/3">For further details of the methodology and data sources used to estimate the economic benefits of RPA (and the magnitude of the benefits under alternative scenarios), the full report is accessible at:</p>

	<p pid="b.162W.5/1">The Department has commissioned and reviewed a wide range of evidence on the factors contributing to disparities in achievement and attainment at primary school. The main factors identified by research can be summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/2" class="indent">Family circumstances: Low family income has been shown to have an impact on children's outcomes at school, even when controlling for the effect of other factors associated with deprivation<sup>(1)</sup>. Similarly, family socioeconomic status is known to have a significant impact on cognitive outcomes<sup>(2)</sup>. The level of education achieved by parents is also strongly associated with their children's outcomes<sup>(3)</sup>, as is parental involvement in education: in particular, the quality of the &quot;home learning environment&quot; varies between families<sup>(4)</sup> and has persistent effects during primary school<sup>(5)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/3" class="indent">The school effect: There is strong and robust evidence to suggest that regardless of the influence of family circumstances outlined above, schools are independently important for children's outcomes. However, some schools are more effective than others, or effective in different ways<sup>(6)</sup>. Analysis suggests that 17 per cent. of the unexplained variation in pupil value added scores between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 can be explained by differences between schools<sup>(7)</sup>. The school effect is multifaceted and complex, but we know that both teaching quality and leadership are two key components<sup>(8)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/4" class="indent">Long-term impact of early learning experiences: children who attend higher quality pre-school settings perform better at primary school than similar pupils who attend a lower quality pre-school or no pre-school<sup>(9)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/5" class="indent">Health: low birth weight and early health or developmental problems can be a significant influence on cognitive outcomes<sup>(10)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/6" class="indent">English as an additional language: performance at primary school has been shown to vary according to whether children are eligible for support with English as an additional language<sup>(11)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/7" class="indent">Special educational needs: children identified as having special educational needs (SEN) or who are registered as School Action Plus during Key Stage 2 demonstrate lower Key Stage 2 performance compared to similar pupils with no identified SEN, even when prior attainment and other characteristics are taken into account<sup>(12)</sup>. Raw figures show that they are 52 percentage points behind children with no identified SEN on the national indicator of achieving Level 4 in both English and maths at Key Stage 2<sup>(13)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.162W.5/8" class="indent">Mobility: on average, children who change school during Year 6 demonstrate lower Key Stage 2 performance compared to similar pupils who remain at the same school<sup>(14)</sup>, even when accounting for prior attainment.</p>

It is not the proper role of the Department to assess inspections. The December 2008 report of the joint area review of Haringey services, led by OFSTED, clearly identified a number of serious concerns and made recommendations to address them. In light of the report, the Secretary of State has taken urgent action to secure improvements in Haringey's safeguarding services.</p>

	<p pid="b.187W.2/4" class="indent">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) carried out an analysis of their current non IT contracts following receipt of the data security directive. 519 contracts required inclusion of the additional clauses and letters were sent to all suppliers concerned requesting the integration of these new terms and conditions. To date, 66 contractors (13 per cent.) have responded and confirmed that the additional clauses have been integrated into their contracts. The work stream is being monitored on a monthly basis at senior management team level.</p>

IT suppliers to MOJ (excluding NOMS) have been written to, reminding them of their obligations under the Data Protection Act and specifically drawing their attention to the two issues that arose in the data handling review: one, the encryption of laptops, and two. restrictions on the use of removable media for transporting personal data. 31 suppliers were contacted and 59 per cent. of those suppliers have confirmed that they are compliant. This includes the two major IT providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.2/9">NOMS ICT supplier contracts have been reviewed, and appropriate standard wording identified to address data security issues. Work is in hand to negotiate these changes with suppliers.</p>

The revised terms will be introduced shortly across the MOJ. In the meantime, standard wording addressing the data security provisions has been issued for inclusion in new contracts awarded prior to the adoption of the new standard terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.8/1">Offender managers (OMs) are responsible for supervising offenders subject to a drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR) of a community order. While there are no nationally prescribed forms which they are required to complete, where orders include a DRR, OMs are required:</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.8/2" class="indent">in accordance with national guidance and locally agreed protocols, to provide the contracted treatment provider, the prison Counselling, Advice, Referral, Assessment and Throughcare (CARATs) team, the local Criminal Justice Integrated Team (CJIT) and any other relevant authority, e.g. police with such information as is necessary to support the administration of justice, manage risk and ensure that the offender's needs are met; and</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.8/4">More generally, for the effective management of offenders under their supervision and in accordance with the requirements of Probation National Standards, OMs must:</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.8/5" class="indent">keep an accurate and up to date record of the case, including a contact log, in their local case management system e.g. CRAMS, ICMS;</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.8/6" class="indent">undertake an Offender Assessment System (OASys) assessment and conduct periodic OASys reviews to assess and manage risk of re-offending and harm and inform sentence planning and risk management;</p>

	<p pid="b.188W.8/8" class="indent">provide written information to the court, where an offender is deemed to be in breach of the order or the OM believes that, in view of circumstances which have arisen since it was made, the order should be revoked; and</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.8/9" class="indent">where appropriate and in accordance with the case transfer instructions (Probation Circular 25/2007), provide specific information, including a full transfer review of OASys, to the receiving probation area to facilitate transfer of the case and apply to the court for amendment of the order.</p>
	<p pid="b.188W.8/10">Medical practitioners providing treatment to or directing the treatment of an individual on a DRR are not required to complete any nationally prescribed forms. However, legislation requires that they provide the supervising officer with their views as to the treatment and testing of the offender and the results of all drug tests for inclusion in the supervising officer's written report on the offender's progress submitted to the court prior to each review of the requirement. Information which probation areas require from treatment providers, including on the offender's attendance, participation and motivation, should be specified in locally agreed protocols.</p>

	<p pid="b.193W.6/1">The Government fund the Poppy project to provide specialist support to adult victims of human trafficking. Victims are provided with unconditional intensive support for an initial four-week period, with longer-term term services provided in return for co-operation with a criminal investigation. Victims are offered support with resettlement and have access to compensation through the courts and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. It is also open to victims to apply for protection through existing humanitarian and immigration routes. Eligibility for non-third sector public services is inline with existing immigration policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.6/2">The Government have ratified the Council of Europe Convention Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. This will enhance our existing measures by extending the reflection-period to a minimum of 45 days and introducing new renewable one-year residence permits for those co-operating with the authorities. The temporary residence permits will allow recourse to public funds. It will also remain open to victims to apply to stay using the existing human rights and immigration protection routes.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.2/1">Information on the number of former probation and prison staff that are now employed by each directorate, headquarters group and the National Offender Management Service Headquarters broken down by grade, is contained in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.194W.2/2">The information includes a number of staff (792) who are employed in the units specified who were neither former Prison Service or Probation Service staff. These staff were previously employed in the former NOMS HQ.</p>
	<p pid="b.194W.2/3">The new NOMS HQ was formed from all staff from the National Probation Directorate and Prison Service Headquarters, as well as staff from the former NOMS HQ. Inevitably the majority were former Prison Service staff. This is because the Probation Service headquarters was significantly smaller as many staff are employed in probation boards and trusts. What matters is that all employees in NOMS HQ recognise that they are now working for a new agency and whatever their past employment history they are focused on public protection and reducing re-offending through integrated offender management.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.5/1">Reoffending is measured as a rate rather than in terms of numbers of offences or offenders. Frequency of reoffending per 100 offenders is now the main measure of reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> There are positive indications that offender behaviour programmes may be effective in reducing reoffending for offenders in the community. For example, Offender Management and Sentencing Analytical Services (OMSAS) conducted an analysis on accredited programmes in the community (Hollis, 2007). It compared actual reoffending rates in 2006 with rates predicted on the basis of 2004 data. The reoffending rate for all offenders who had undertaken interventions was 55 per cent., based on a two-year reconviction rate. Programme completers did statistically significantly better than those who did not start or who dropped-out of programmes. The rates were 38 per cent., 61 per cent. and 64 per cent. respectively. This analysis of management information, however, cannot determine whether these differences result from programme impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.5/3"><i> (b)</i> There is considerable international evidence (Wilson et al. 2005; Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2006) to support the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural programmes in reducing reoffending. However, UK research examining the effectiveness of programmes in prisons has produced mixed results (Friendship et al. 2002; Falshaw et al. 2003; Cann et al. 2003).</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.5/4" class="indent">A recent prison-based study showed that the one-year reconviction rate for both adult men and young offenders who had completed enhanced thinking skills (ETS) and reasoning and rehabilitation (R+R) interventions in prison represented a positive 2.5 percentage points difference in reconviction for adult male completers (17.0 per cent. vs. 19.5 per cent.) and a 4.1 percentage point difference for young offender completers (31.4 per cent. vs. 35.5 per cent.) compared to matched comparison groups. There was no difference in reconviction rates between programme starters and comparison groups. See tables 3 and 4:</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.5/6" class="indent">A study of female participants of ETS and R&amp;R (Cann, 2006) found no statistically significant differences in one and two-year rates between offenders and a matched comparison group. See:</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.5/8" class="indent">The most robust evaluation of the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) in England and Wales (Friendship et al, 2003) examined the impact of the prison-based programme. This compared two-year reconviction rates for prisoners who participated in the programme with those who did not. Findings indicated that the SOTP had an impact on reconvictions for sexual and/or violent offences (as a combined measure).</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.5/9">OMS Analytical Services and NOMS are working closely with the Correctional Services Accreditation Panel (CSAP) to develop further outcome evaluation study proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.212W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.5/2">The area of vines planted in England is increasing in response to market demand. However, this increase is not yet being reflected in a substantial increase in English wine production due to the time lag for newly planted vines to become productive, and also because the wet weather of the past two summers has resulted in a lower production from existing vines.</p>
	<p pid="b.212W.5/3">In the recent reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) regime for wine, the UK successfully negotiated a derogation that will allow the English wine sector to continue to expand without the threat of our plantings being capped by the controls that exist in the main EU wine production countries. This outcome was warmly welcomed by the English wine industry. The reform also provides for the UK to establish a national programme to assist the development of our domestic wine industry. After consulting with the industry, further funding is being provided through the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) to establish training programmes to help upskill this rapidly developing sector. The English wine industry is also able to access funds from the RDPE for a range of other activities and a number of applications have already been approved.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.0/2">Warm Front is the Government's main scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. It is administered and managed by Eaga plc. on behalf of the Government. The scheme provides grants for specified heating and insulation measures up to &pound;2,700 in value (&pound;4,000 where the work includes installation of an oil fired central heating system). Pensioners in receipt of qualifying benefits (such as pension credit) are eligible to full assistance under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.0/3">Under the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT), energy suppliers are required to offer substantial discounts for key insulation measures, such as loft insulation and cavity wall insulation. Subject to survey of a property, suppliers are currently offering all households without insulation at least 50 per cent. discount from the Energy Saving Trust guide price for insulation measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.0/4">For reasons of equity, we oblige suppliers to meet 40 per cent. of their CERT in a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households. This means anyone over 70 years, or those in receipt of qualifying benefits (e.g. income, pension benefit) including those over 60 years. To meet their targets, suppliers currently offer priority groups such measures at little or no cost, subject to survey. People over 70 years are statistically shown to be increasingly at risk of falling into fuel poverty, and are therefore included in the priority group definition.</p>

However, I am advised by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that there are improving prospects of running the nuclear power station beyond its scheduled closure date. The NDA's current planning assumption is that the plant will be able to generate until December 2010 and they expect shortly to seek the appropriate regulatory approval to extend generation to this date. I am further advised that there may be opportunities to extend generation beyond this date and that the options are being studied closely to ensure that this opportunity is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="b.220W.3/1">The national communications campaign to improve the public's understanding of units of alcohol, launched in May 2008, featured two phases. The campaign messages were delivered across television, press, outdoor, radio and online channels. Phase 1 focused on improving people's knowledge of how many units of alcohol are in the alcoholic drinks they consume, while phase 2 focused on improving people's understanding of the link between their alcohol consumption and their health.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.3/2">Initial assessment of the campaign shows that there is an increased agreement, from 77-82 per cent. that we tend to drink more than is good for us. This has clearly been influenced by the campaign as for those aware of the campaign, this figure rises to 85 per cent., while for those not aware of the campaign, this figure is 72 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.3/3">The second wave of campaign tracking will be available shortly and may provide more information on how the campaign has improved the public's understanding of alcohol-related health risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.3/4">We intend that this campaign should be sustained over a number of years. The units campaign will continue in 2009-10, with the key tasks to optimise the units messaging and to communicate the health harms associated with drinking to higher risk groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.231W.8/2">The figures for the estimated number of adult service users receiving home help or home care have decreased. This is because councils are prioritising those with the highest levels of need who otherwise may have had to enter residential care and thereby lose their independence. Consequently a more intensive service is being delivered to fewer people. In addition, some home care is now purchased through direct payments and such services are not included in the figures. Direct payments were introduced for adults of working age in April 1997, through the Community Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996. Direct payments were extended to older people in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.231W.8/3">Gross expenditure for home care is increasing year on year, because the proportion of those supported intensively to live at home independently has continued to increase.</p>

	<p pid="b.240W.12/1">Since 2001-02, real terms investment in adult mental health services increased by 44 per cent. (or &pound;1.7 billion) putting in place the services and staff needed to transform mental health services. The national health service spent &pound;5.53 billion on these services in 2007-08 alone. This is why we now have over 740 new community mental health teams offering home treatment, early intervention, or intensive support for people who might otherwise have been admitted to hospital, and now have 64 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 71 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 21 per cent. more mental health nurses than in 1997. In addition we are rolling out a programme to give more access to psychological therapies to people with depression and anxiety. The provision of all NHS services, including mental health treatments, ultimately rests with commissioning trusts and it is for primary care trusts, in conjunction with their strategic health authorities, to plan and develop services according to the needs of their local communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.245W.2/1">The information requested has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.245W.2/2">Public capital expenditure in the national health service has risen every year since 1999-2000 and will rise from &pound;4.7 billion in 2008-09 to a record peak of &pound;5.6 billion in 2009-10; at the same time 76 hospital schemes funded under the Private Finance Initiative have opened worth &pound;5.3 billion. These record levels of capital investment in the national health service estate have resulted in a quarter of the estate occupied by NHS trusts being replaced since 1997, and the proportion of the estate that predates the establishment of the NHS itself has fallen from 50 per cent. in 1997-98 to less than 20 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.245W.2/3">NHS organisations are responsible for the provision and maintenance of facilities to support the delivery of high quality clinical services. Therefore, the NHS will locally prioritise investment to reduce backlog maintenance based on risk assessment, reconfiguration planning and available resources. The majority of backlog maintenance relates to low priority work, which trusts will undertake through maintenance programmes. Where higher risks are present, work will be undertaken as a priority. While levels of backlog maintenance vary across the NHS, it is estimated that around 75 per cent. of the total costs to eradicate backlog maintenance is concentrated in 20 per cent. of organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.245W.2/4">The Department collects data on backlog maintenance and risk adjusted backlog maintenance annually from NHS trusts through its Estates Returns Information Collection (ERIC). The data provided is not amended centrally and the responsibility for its accuracy lies with the contributing NHS organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.3/1">The Department has made no such estimate. It is the responsibility of primary care trusts to decide which services and treatments it will provide to meet the needs of its population.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.3/2">The Department does recognise that the effects of chronic pain on quality of life can be considerable, and that the treatment of pain is less successful when psychological components of pain are not addressed through an integrated pain management programme. The Department has published an 18 week patient pathway for chronic pain which provides commissioners with the support they need to commission services appropriately. A copy has been placed in the Library. NHS Choices has also provided information that will raise the awareness of chronic pain and treatments, including psychological components.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.3/3">In addition, the Department has established an Expert Patients programme (EPP) to help patients manage their long-term conditions through programmes that address issues such as healthy eating, dealing with pain and extreme tiredness, relaxation techniques and coping with feelings of depression, including a &quot;Persistent Pain programme&quot;. The EPP has helped more than 30,000 patients since it was established in April 2002.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.2/17">The available information on Foundation Degree (FD) qualifiers from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) who went on to study a first degree in the following academic year only is shown in table 2. The figures were derived from the destinations surveys, which collect information about the destinations of qualifiers six months after qualification. Figures for 2007/08 will be available in July 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.2/18">The available information is limited to qualifiers who went on to study for a first degree in the year immediately following qualification: it does not cover those who chose to progress to a first degree at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.2/19">For a number of reasons, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the trends in the numbers of FD qualifiers who went on to study for a first degree in the following academic year. FDs were only introduced in 2001/02 and until 2004/05 there were relatively low numbers of qualifiers, which makes the figures inherently more volatile. It is also important to note that FD qualifiers tend to be older than qualifiers from other levels of study. Older qualifiers are less likely to go on to study for a first degree in the year immediately following qualification, because they are often already employed and tend to have other financial and domestic commitments. They may therefore be more likely to proceed to further study at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="b.261W.3/1">Transnational education&mdash;the delivery of the courses and qualifications of one country in another one&mdash;brings great benefit to the individual higher education institutions (HEIs) involved as well as to the country as a whole. It makes a major contribution to the high reputation enjoyed by UK higher education in other parts of the world. The overall value of transnational higher education to the UK is estimated to be some &pound;200 million per annum. A recent study commissioned by the Department and published by Sheffield Hallam University in May 2008 found that our institutions are well-engaged in making their high quality programmes and expertise available in other countries. The report, entitled &quot;Transnational education and higher education institutions: exploring patterns of HE institutional activity&quot;, is available on the research and analysis pages of the Department's website. As part of the second phase of the Prime Minister's Initiative for international education (PMI2), &pound;4 million has been allocated in 2007-08 to supporting HEIs in developing international partnerships and expanding their successful transnational education strategies to further improve the visibility of UK higher education on the international stage. Some 189 projects are being supported which involve UK HE institutions collaborating with institutions overseas.</p>

But the total level of annual income from all such investments is about 2 per cent. of the total income institutions now generate each year. The Higher Education Funding Council for England will keep the situation under review but has concluded that no institution is at risk as a result of any investment decisions it has taken.

	<p pid="b.265W.5/1">The Secretary of State established when he finalised this policy in January 2008 that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) should conduct an annual review on its impact. I wrote to HEFCE earlier this month setting out the terms of reference for the review. A copy of this letter has been placed in the House of Commons Library. HEFCE has started work on the review and plan to report later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from David Lammy to Tim Melville-Ross (HEFCE), dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-07">7 January 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/3" class="indentitalic"> Redistributing funding for equivalent and lower level qualifications</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/4" class="indent">1. In January 2008 the Secretary of State, John Denham, wrote to you about the Government's policy on the redistribution of institutional funding for students doing equivalent and lower level qualifications (ELQs). Your redistribution of ELQ funding began at the start of the 2008/09 academic year, and is then set to scale up over time. In his letter John said that the impact of the policy should be reviewed annually by the Council, and the Council should be prepared to act on the findings of these reviews to improve the implementation of the policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/5" class="indent">2. We have always been aware that the scope of this first annual review, scheduled for December 2008, would inevitably be limited. We are only in the first year of the new arrangements, only a minority of the overall redeployment of funds have taken place and limited data regarding 2008-09 entry will be available at this point in time. One role of this initial investigation is therefore to provide a baseline for future reviews, but this should not rule out appropriate changes, if they are justified by the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/6" class="indent">3. I am, however, also conscious that the economic climate has changed since John announced the Government's new policy on ELQ funding in September 2007. In an economic downturn it is more important than ever that individuals and businesses have access to high quality, affordable educational provision to improve competitiveness and to enable workers to enter growth areas in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/7" class="indent">4. As you review the implementation of ELQs, I would like the Council to consider whether there is evidence that any modification to the approach decided on earlier this year will help universities respond more effectively to the challenges of the economic downturn. The review should not, however, lead to a significant net increase in the overall number of ELQ students studying exempt or protected subjects because we will continue to give priority for public funding to those who have not yet obtained a first higher education qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/8" class="indent">5. As part of the review, I would like the Council to investigate whether there is any evidence available of changes in the flow of students as a result of ELQ policy. If there is concrete evidence of a large fall in demand at national level for a subject of national strategic importance, I would like the Council to advise us on:</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/9" class="indent">a. the scope to increase demand for that subject from those without an equivalent or higher level qualification</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/10" class="indent">b. whether there is adequate provision of Foundation Degrees&mdash;as the hallmark vocational qualification&mdash;in that subject</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/11" class="indent">c. the scope for labour market demand for graduates in that discipline to translate into increased employer funding to support students in that discipline; and only then</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/12" class="indent">d. whether there is a case for exempting entrants to the subject who have an ELQ from the general ELQ funding rule or protecting it in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/13" class="indent">6. In any such cases, the Council should also advise on the scope for removing exempted or protected subjects from the list. We will then work with you to agree any changes to the subjects that are exempted or protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/14" class="indent">7. It is, of course, for the Council to decide on the best way of conducting this review but I would like it to take an evidence-based approach. I imagine the review will exclude Strategically Important and Vulnerable Subjects because the health of these disciplines rightly falls under the remit of your new Strategically Important Subjects advisory group, chaired by Peter Saraga. And, given your additional support for SIVS, it would be difficult (if not impossible) to establish a baseline for the review that would be comparable with other subjects. You will, no doubt, work with Peter's group as and when it is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.265W.5/15" class="indent">8. I am very grateful to the HEFCE Board and its officers for their work on the implementation of the policy and I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Council on this and other issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.266W.2/26">The steady rise in the amount of public loan debt written off each year also reflects the growing maturity of the student loan book. In other words, there has been a year-on-year increase in the total number of loans which have been issued since the schemes began.</p>

	<p pid="b.268W.3/2">In the last three months, Members have tabled five questions on this subject. The Department has also received representations from members of the public and the press.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.3/3">The legislative provisions for income contingent repayment student loans require that the rate of interest must: (i) be no higher than is necessary to maintain the value of the loan in real terms; and (ii) not exceed 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates of a specified group of banks<sup>(1)</sup> (the 'low interest cap').</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.3/4">The interest rate is normally set every September to equal the retail prices index for the previous March&mdash;currently 3.8 per cent. Following the reduction in the Bank of England base rate by the Monetary Policy Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December 2008</phrase>, all the specified banks reduced their base rates to 2 per cent. and the low interest cap came into play. The Student Loans Company (SLC) therefore reduced the interest rate for income contingent loans from 3.8 per cent. to 3 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-05">5 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.3/5">Following the latest reduction in the Bank of England base rate on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-08">8 January 2009</phrase>, all the specified banks have now reduced their base rates to 1.5 per cent. The SLC therefore reduced the interest rate for income contingent loans from 3 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-09">9 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.3/6">The SLC published this information on their website and in national newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.3/7">The interest rate for loans taken out before 1998 (known as 'mortgage style loans') is not affected as these loans are governed by different legislation.</p>
