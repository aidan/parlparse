	<p pid=".987W.8/1">Customs will maintain the current intelligence resource levels, but will deploy them differently to combat the changing nature of criminality in Wales. They will work more closely with partner law enforcement agencies to focus on the threats posed whether they are drugs, other illegal goods or terrorism. In particular, they are joining with South Wales, Gwent and Dyfed Powys police forces to form a new Joint Intelligence Cell in Bridgend. They will make use of constant quality intelligence sources, from all over the world, and be able to determine the necessary Customs response to call upon mobile teams whether the threat is inland or at ports or airports.</p>
	<p pid=".987W.8/2">Moreover, under Customs' plans there will be an overall increase in the deployment of mobile teams to Wales, from a contingent of 100 officers based in Wales and the West Midlands, supported by the National Strike Force. This capability to deploy larger numbers of officers on unpredictable targeted operations will provide a real deterrence to professional smugglers and bootleggers.</p>

Postal services provided by the universal service provider, Royal Mail, are currently exempt from VAT, and the Government believe that the vital social role played by the universal postal service should continue to be reflected in the tax system.

	<p pid=".989W.3/1">In our 2000 White Paper&mdash;&quot;Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot;&mdash;the Government made a commitment to strengthen the voice of developing countries in the international system. We are actively pursuing this agenda in three broad ways both at the IMF and World Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.3/2">Firstly, strengthening developing country offices in the IMF and World Bank. Many of these offices suffer from a lack of capacity, combined with a heavy workload. That is why, earlier this year, we pushed for the provision of extra staff to the Sub-Saharan African offices. This was subsequently agreed at both the Fund and Bank. We also support the provision of more training opportunities, improved links between Washington-based delegations and their Capitals and the creation of a Fund that these offices can draw on to finance analysis.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.3/3">Secondly, we actively encourage the two institutions to recognise their own role in strengthening the representation of developing countries, for example through increased staff diversity.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.3/4">Thirdly, increasing developing country representation and voting rights on the Executive Board. The UK believes that the issues of developing country representation on the Executive Board&mdash;particularly for Africa&mdash;and increasing the basic vote, both merit serious consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.3/5">All of these issues are being discussed at both the IMF and World Bank and the UK will continue to push for early and substantive progress.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.6/1">The Department for International Development and the Treasury continually assess the effectiveness of the IMF and World Bank. And a central pillar of our efforts to increase their effectiveness has been to encourage greater developing country ownership of policy reforms and decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.6/2">Experience suggests that when countries 'own' their policies, they are more likely to implement them. That is why both IMF and World Bank resources are increasingly being used in support of country-led strategies, such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.6/3">This ownership agenda also extends to the institutions themselves. In our 2000 White Paper&mdash;&quot;Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot;&mdash;the Government made a commitment to strengthen the voice of developing countries in the international system. The need to address this problem was subsequently endorsed by all UN member states at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.6/4">Since then the IMF and World Bank have been actively progressing this agenda, most recently at their spring meetings in April. The UK has strongly supported this work and will continue to push for early and substantive progress.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.6/1">The UK was influential in getting agreement, at the 1999 Annual Meetings of the World bank and IMF, to the consultation process on the design of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative being widened to include developing countries. In order to ensure developing country involvement in discussions about the delivery of debt relief, we and other donor countries are co-financing the HIPC Ministerial Network, as part of the HIPC Capacity Building Project. This network, which held its first meeting in Copenhagen in November 1999, brings together, once or twice a year, Finance Ministers and senior officials from all of the HIPC countries to discuss issues relating to the design and implementation of the HIPC Initiative. These meetings help to inform our own views on debt issues. The Commonwealth HIPC Forum also provides an important platform for Ministers from HIPC countries to discuss matters of mutual interest, and has stimulated wider debate within the Commonwealth, as well as within the International Financial Institutions themselves. The UK also contributed to the recent review of the HIPC Initiative by the Operations Evaluations Department (OED) of the World Bank, and funded two meetings between the evaluators and HIPC representatives, to allow HIPC countries to feed in their views. The OED report has now been published.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.2/1">The objectives of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) are to assist the UN by providing a short-term interim force to enable the reinforcement of the UN MONUC forces in Bunia in the Ituri province. The IEMF aims to contribute to the security of Bunia in order to allow the Ituri Interim Administration to function and improve the humanitarian situation. It also aims to protect the airport and the internally displaced persons in the camps in Bunia and, if the situation requires it, contribute to the safety of the population and of UN personnel in the town. The disarming of militia groups, most of which are outside Bunia, will not be part of the IEMF's mandate.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.5/1">The EU is committed to giving developing countries better trading opportunities through greater access to both its agricultural and non-agricultural markets by reducing tariff barriers, tackling all forms of export subsidies and substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support. The Government are working with its partners, both in the EU and internationally, to ensure that developing countries gain real benefits from the Doha round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations. Critical to this effort will be securing a successful outcome at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September. This will require real progress on the issues that matter most developing countries such as agriculture, TRIPS and public health, and special and differential treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".994W.5/2">In addition, the Government are funding a variety of initiatives to help developing countries to set their own trade policies to reduce poverty. This includes improving developing countries' ability to negotiate favourable deals in trade negotiations, helping them interpret trade agreements, and supporting them in taking advantage of new international trading opportunities. To this end, the government have committed &pound;45 million to trade-related capacity building since 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.3/1">Mislabelling can already be prosecuted: it is an offence under the Trade Descriptions Act of 1968 to apply, by any means, false or misleading statements to goods including about their composition. However, the Trade Descriptions Act is difficult to enforce in the case of made-up goods containing fur until we can ensure a robust testing method for such products.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.3/2">We are working with other governments and scientific advisers to develop such an enforcement mechanism as soon as possible. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC Ltd.) have provided advice detailing why DNA testing of these products is both difficult and, as yet, unreliable (copies of this advice are available in the Libraries of the House). However, we have identified an alternative testing method (based on mass spectrometry) that may be more reliable and are working to determine whether this is the case.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.3/3">The cost of mass spectrometry testing is currently &euro;200 per sample. However, the overall cost of any scheme to test labelling of products containing furs cannot easily be estimated. The cost would be dependent on the level of testing of products that the authorities responsible for enforcing the Trade Descriptions Act considered to be necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".1008W.6/1">Coffee is traded on a free market. Any attempt to intervene in the international coffee market to manage supply is unlikely to work.

	<p pid=".1009W.5/1">The department does not provide financial support to animal sanctuaries. However, a considerable number of animal sanctuaries are registered charities. The Government have policies in place to increase the value of these charitable gifts by generous tax concessions, thereby supporting the work of all charities without compromising their independence.</p>
	<p pid=".1009W.5/2">As part of the Government's policy to encourage more people to give to charity, the tax incentives for charitable giving were improved in Budget 2000, and further built upon in Budget 2002. There are now no limits on the amounts that individuals can give through the Gift Aid and Payroll Giving Schemes. In addition, tax relief is available on gifts to charity of listed shares and securities, land and buildings. Businesses can also get tax relief when they donate money, stock or equipment to charities in general.</p>

Another problem has been the strength of sterling against the euro. However the possibility that the DBES can be modified or dismantled altogether is becoming a very real prospect as the number of BSE cases continues to decline and this, combined with a strengthening of the euro is likely to improve prospects for exports of British origin beef towards the end of next year.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.8/1">The European Commission has been investigating the schemes in the Orkney and Shetland islands since 1999. The Commission's doubts about the compatibility of the schemes with the Treaty were made clear when it opened a formal investigation into the schemes in November 2001. In its two letters of <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-28">28 November 2001</phrase>, one on each of the schemes, the Commission observed that there existed:</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;serious doubts on the compatibility of this aid scheme with the Guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture and, therefore, with the EC Treaty.&quot; (Official Journal C 38 of 12.02.2002 p.6 and p.11)</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/3">These letters were passed to the relevant local authority in each case soon after receipt and published in the Official Journal on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-12">12 February 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/4">The Commission Decisions of <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-03">3 June 2003</phrase> constitute the formal view of the Commission on the non-compatibility of these schemes with the Treaty. They were received at the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-04">4 June</phrase> and sent that day to my Department and to the Scottish Executive who sent them the next day to the local authorities concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/5">The Decisions require the schemes to be either ended or brought into compliance with the Treaty within two months. If this corrective action is not taken, the provisions of Article 88(2) of the Treaty and Council Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999 allow the Commission to refer the United Kingdom's non-compliance to the European Court of Justice direct. In this case it would fall to the Government, not the administrators of the scheme, to defend or bring the case.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/6">There is no specific appeal mechanism against Commission State aid Decisions. However, a member state or any natural or legal person may apply to bring an action before the European Court of Justice for annulment of a Decision on certain grounds listed in Article 230 of the Treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/7">In addition, the provisions of Article 88(2) of the Treaty permit a member state to apply in exceptional circumstances for approval of a State aid by the Council acting unanimously.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.8/8">The Commission Decisions are still being considered. We will continue to work closely with the Scottish Executive and the local authorities involved.</p>

	<p pid=".1014W.2/1">The policy was, as usual, to invoke Hague Preference on stocks where the UK's quota allocation would otherwise fall below the trigger level. This involves, in particular, invoking to counteract the effect of Irish invocations of Hague Preference on the UK's allocation. However, we do refrain from invoking in some cases where stocks are seriously depleted, as in these cases the operation of Hague Preference would transfer a very high proportion of other member states' allocations to the UK. This is the approach that we judge to be, overall, to the benefit of UK fishermen. For 2003 we did not invoke Hague Preference for any of the depleted North Sea stocks or for saithe in Area VI (where there was no Irish invocation).</p>

	<p pid=".1016W.11/1">The Department has undertaken a number of research projects looking into the impact of the use of pesticides on weeds in, or around, agricultural and horticultural crops. The Environment Agency's leaflet on control of invasive non-native plants gives guidance on use of chemical control. Only one research project has specifically focussed on invasive non-native plants and this is investigating alternatives to chemicals. The Department is contributing with Cornwall county council, the Environment Agency and others, to research into biological control of one of the problem species&mdash;Japanese knotweed. The study will undertake the necessary research to establish whether biological control is a feasible method for the long-term, sustainable management of Japanese knotweed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1016W.11/2">The Department is not undertaking any research into the effectiveness of withdrawn weedkillers to control invasive non-native plants. The UK's pesticide regulatory system allows for the granting of 'emergency' approvals whereby the marketing and use of plant protection products may be permitted, subject to an environmental risk assessment, for a limited period to control invasive non-native weeds if the threat they pose cannot be controlled by other means.</p>

	<p pid=".1017W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1017W.8/2"><i>(a)</i> There are reasons of both principle and of practical effect which argue against this recommendation. Non-domestic rates are designed to raise revenue for the Exchequer. Ratepayers pay rates that reflect the rental value of the property regardless of the activity that takes place within that property. Rates are not there to encourage or discourage particular types of behaviour or investment. There are innumerable worthy causes that the rates system could support by granting relief and this would introduce complexity to a system that aims to be fair and equitable. There are, however, other options, which may be more effective. The Local Government Bill will introduce a new scheme of rate relief for small businesses. Many small retailers supplying local produce could benefit under this scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1017W.8/3"><i>(b)</i> There is growing consumer interest in local food. Many retailers have responded to this and have adopted local sourcing policies. We welcome this and want to encourage more local sourcing. We have recently financed a series of workshops organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution, designed to bring together supermarkets and small local producers to explore how barriers to local sourcing may be overcome. In addition to this, we have just announced an extra &pound;3 million over the next three years for Food from Britain to undertake a series of measures encouraging retailers to source more quality regional food and consumers to buy it.</p>

We anticipate that the vast majority will either sell their quota or resume production. Where quota is confiscated, under the current UK legislation the quota holder has six years in which to resume production (and thus have the quota restored to him or her) before the quota is definitively taken into the national reserve of quota, and therefore potentially available for redistribution. Under the current CAP reform proposals, this period would be reduced to two years. We would propose to consult relevant trade organisations on the basis for redistributing quota confiscated as a result of the Thomsen ECJ case, if significant amounts of quota were confiscated, and thus potentially available for redistribution.</p>

	<p pid=".1019W.5/1">In 1998, OSPAR agreed strategies on hazardous substances, eutrophication, radioactive substances, biodiversity, and assessment and monitoring. A strategy for offshore oil and gas was agreed the following year. These strategies set long term goals&mdash;in some cases, looking a generation ahead (i.e. 2020).</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/2">The strategy with regard to hazardous substances sets the objective of preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances. The UK has worked with other OSPAR contracting parties, including the European Commission, to update and prioritise a list of substances that cause concern for the marine environment and to identify the most appropriate additional action to achieve the objective.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/3">The objective of the strategy to combat eutrophication is to seek to achieve and maintain a healthy marine environment where eutrophication does not occur by the year 2010. A key milestone to this is the assessment of the current eutrophication status of the various parts of the OSPAR maritime area. In this assessment the UK identified 16 marine areas of concern. These are being addressed by action under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the Nitrates Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/4">The strategy with regard to radioactive substances requires the OSPAR Commission, by the year 2020, to ensure that discharges of radioactive substances are reduced to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels, resulting from such discharges, are close to zero. In July 2002, the Government published a strategy showing how the United Kingdom will contribute to the achievement of the 2020 target.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/5">OSPAR's biodiversity strategy aims to protect and conserve ecosystems and marine biological diversity. Annex V was brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-08-30">30 August 2000</phrase>. Since then, the UK has prepared for the forthcoming meeting in Bremen by helping to develop a criteria for identifying threatened and declining species, developing guidelines on the identification and management of marine protected areas, developing guidance on the construction and operation of offshore wind farms, developing an agreement on sand and gravel extraction, and the development of proposed ecological quality objectives which will be piloted in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/6">The strategy for oil and gas addresses the effects of offshore activity through the setting of environmental goals and the establishment of management mechanisms to achieve them. Good progress has been made, in particular with controls on chemicals being agreed and an ambitious goal being set to reduce discharges of produced water. A goal of all operators having internationally recognised environmental management systems in place by the end of 2005 has also been developed and is expected to be adopted at the meeting later this month.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/7">In respect of assessment and monitoring, the forthcoming meeting will invite Ministers to endorse a new OSPAR strategy known as the Joint Assessment and Monitoring Programme (JAMP). This provides the framework for OSPAR's work in this area, both in support of other OSPAR strategies and to facilitate the production in 2010 of a Quality Status Report for the OSPAR maritime area.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.5/8">Overall the UK has been implementing the plans and measures set out above in accordance with these strategies, and the milestones contained within them, and has met its commitments to date.</p>

Nevertheless, schools and local education authorities should consider the benefits of carrying out regular evacuation drills in collaboration with bus operators, so that pupils know what to do in an emergency.</p>

	<p pid=".1027W.5/3">The Department's publicity division uses a bespoke financial management system, which records expenditure through their system of framework contracts with a range of suppliers of paid publicity services which is categorised according to media, including design and print.</p>

	<p pid=".1027W.5/5">There has been no change to the way the Department produces or procures its publications in the past five years. We have a duty to consult on and inform our customers, stakeholders and interest groups of policy changes and developments. The volume, and by implication the level of expenditure, is largely dependent on the level of activity on policy initiatives which the Department needs to communicate to these groups.</p>
	<p pid=".1027W.5/6">The Department operates under strict targets to control and reduce the number of paper-based communication to schools and LEAs to help reduce the bureaucratic burden. In the current academic year (September 2002 to July 2003), the volume of printed material sent directly to schools is on course to be reduced by 50 per cent. against the corresponding figure sent to schools in the last academic year.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.5/2">The Government's proposals for a new LEA funding system were first set out in the Local Authority Finance Green Paper of September 2000, and subsequently reconfirmed in last autumn's Schools White Paper and the Local Government White Paper. DfES and ODPM had extensive consultation with external partners throughout all of 2001 and most of 2002, with a three month consultation on a range of options carried out in July 2002. Building on the responses to the consultation, ODPM and DfES explored a large number of options for the distribution of Formula Grant and Education Formula Spending Shares between authorities before determining this year's settlement. In particular, we decided on a minimum like-for-like grant increase of 3.5 per cent. and a minimum like-for-like Education FSS increase of 3.2 per cent. per pupil to ensure that each education authority received a reasonable increase.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.5/3">Our analysis of options included a detailed assessment of the implications for each LEA and therefore it's schools necessary passporting requirements. However, decisions on council tax and disbursement of funding between schools is a matter for individual local authorities, subject to the general constraints contained in the Fair Funding regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.8/1">Schools will face a range of budgetary pressures depending on a number of factors, namely the specific cost pressures which the school faces and the level of funding which it has received from its local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.8/2">Cost pressures vary school by school depending in particular on the staffing profile of the school and changing pupil numbers. Funding depends on decisions by central Government by LEAs.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.8/3">The increase in funding for each school will depend on a number of factors covering both central and local government responsibility. These are the increase in funding given to the school's authority by central Government; the amount which the local authority decides to increase its Schools Budget by; the increase which the local authority decides to give to the Individual Schools Budget, as opposed to the items within the Schools Budget which are held centrally; and the operation of the local authority's formula which gives different increases to different schools.</p>

	<p pid=".1034W.0/2" class="italic">The Crown Prosecution Service</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/3">The Crown Prosecution Service is currently finalising its resource accounts for 2002&ndash;03. The final outturn position will be known with certainty when the accounts have been completed and certified by the National Audit Office. Against the main control total, the departmental expenditure limit, the Crown Prosecution Service anticipates an underspend of &pound;2.5 million, which is half of one per cent. of the gross provision of &pound;484 million and provides evidence of the effective financial budgetary, planning and control systems in place in the Department. Spending plans for CPS Areas and CPS HQ are regularly reviewed during the year and remedial action taken where appropriate to ensure spending targets are met. Such reviews will continue in 2003&ndash;04. On expenditure that is outside the departmental expenditure limit, there will be an underspend of around &pound;13 million in respect of the costs of depreciation of IT assets, which were transferred to the Department's public finance initiative partner, LogicaCMG plc, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. Future estimates of depreciation costs reflect the transfer and such an underspend cannot recur in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/4" class="italic">Serious Fraud Office</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/5">The Serious Fraud Office plans to fully utilise its resources available in 2003&ndash;04. The Serious Fraud Office does not plan to underspend in any financial year but it is subject to short-term volatility in its resource consumption plans. The ability to make use of the End Year Flexibility scheme and carry resources forward to future years ensures that consumption can be managed efficiently and effectively to achieve value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/6" class="italic">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/7">HM Crown Prosecution Service's underspend for 2002&ndash;03 is estimated to be &pound;87k, attributable to managed vacancies while revising inspection methodology. Recruitment is currently under way. The underspend will be reduced in the Financial Year 2003&ndash;04 by recruiting additional staff, although it is still possible that there may be an underspend on the salaries budget because of the time taken to recruit.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/8" class="italic">Treasury Solicitor's Department</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/9">The Treasury Solicitor's Department had two main areas of underspend in 2002&ndash;03, namely staff costs and capital expenditure. In the later months of 2002&ndash;03, the Department was successful in recruiting staff as a result of a programme of continuous recruitment coupled with the overall position in the market for lawyers. This means that the Department is well placed to achieve the budgeted complement for 2003&ndash;04. The Department's major capital projects are on course for completion in accordance with their individual project targets and significant increases in expenditure over the previous year's levels will be achieved in 2003&ndash;04 as several major projects come on stream.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/10" class="italic">Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.0/11">The total budget for the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers for the financial year 2002&ndash;03 was &pound;3.1 million. Although figures have not yet been finalised, it is not expected that there will be any significant underspend for that period.</p>

	<p pid=".1037W.8/1">The statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-15">15 May</phrase> refers to an overall contribution of up to &pound;1.5 billion from the National Lottery to the cost of staging the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.8/2">The National Lottery Commission's prudent assessment is that new Olympic Lottery games could generate &pound;750 million in the period 2005&ndash;2012, however it does not discount the possibility of the initiatives out-performing this estimate. It is currently expected that half of this total will be raised through Olympic Lottery games where the income will be hypothecated for hosting the Olympics. A further &pound;340 million will be derived sought from planned spending/expenditure by the established sports distributors.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.8/3">Were it required, any outstanding balance would/will be met by changing the percentage shares of Lottery income passing to the existing Good Causes after 2009. A review of those shares would have taken place whether or not London was bidding to host the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.8/4">Preliminary estimates provided by Camelot, and assessed by the National Lottery Commission, suggest that any negative impact on income on the existing good causes from Olympic Lottery games would be small&mdash; 4 per cent. for the remainder of the Camelot licence period, until 2009. Until 2009 the impact of Olympic Lottery games on the existing Good Causes is unlikely to be more than 4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.8/5">It is too early to say what the impact on individual distributing bodies will be. As noted in the original statement, the whole Olympic funding package, including the Lottery element, will be reviewed in 2005 when much clearer estimates of the costs involved in the Olympic project will be available.</p>

	<p pid=".1040W.0/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning job losses as the result of Jobcentre Plus roll out. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.0/4" class="indent">The national roll-out of Jobcentre Plus is bringing together Jobcentres and Benefit Offices to form new integrated offices. As part of the last spending review, the Government agreed to a major investment plan for the department including over &pound;2bn for rolling out of Jobcentre Plus. A significant part of this investment will be used for better technology, improved training and modernised business processes. As a result we will, over time, need fewer staff to provide enhanced services to our customers.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.0/5" class="indent">In our early planning for each Jobcentre Plus district we are sharing our proposals for service delivery with a wide variety of people and organisations. While these are determined by local management they will include, for example, local MPs, Local Authorities, service delivery partners, employers' representatives, Citizens Advice Bureaux, welfare rights organisations, other Government Agencies, Health Authorities, Housing Associations, our staff and trade union representatives. After views and comments have been taken on board District Managers then share the finally agreed plans with the people and groups described above.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.0/6" class="indent">For districts introducing the new service in 2002/03 the main communications exercises took place between June and September, and we were pleased to receive comments and views on many aspects of our plans. We have taken account of those views, changed our plans where appropriate and responded to those who contacted us.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.0/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus plans to reduce its staff numbers to 76,600 by March 2006, equivalent to a 3.5 per cent reduction. However, staffing levels are planned to remain relatively stable over the next year. Regional plans have yet to be agreed for Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.0/8" class="indent">While the precise impact will be different in different parts of the country and there may be areas of greater difficulty, the planned reductions in staffing will be carefully managed and are within our overall margins of staff turnover. We expect therefore to manage this reduction by moving staff to other parts of the Department for Work and Pensions or through natural wastage.</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.2/3">My right hon. and noble Friend responded to the inquiry by confirming that the recently published preliminary conclusions encompassed the views of those who formally responded to the original 'Measuring Child Poverty' consultation exercise.

It is an important element in our programme of &quot;asset recycling&quot;, aimed at improving value for money and modernising our estate. After meeting the cost of a new Residence, the sale will yield capital funds that the FCO can re-invest in additional facilities elsewhere.

However, there are communities throughout the island and at all levels of society. Therefore the living conditions vary greatly.

	<p pid=".1048W.12/1">There have been no recent changes to the law in this area. Trespass to land is a civil wrong, the most common form of which is committed when an unlawful visitor directly physically interferes with the owner's land without lawful justification. Once the boundary has been breached the landowner may approach the courts to seek an injunction to restrain the continuation of the trespass. The landowner may also have a legal cause of action for damages suffered because of the trespass. The recovery of damages might be only a small amount for the technical trespass, unless actual damage can be proved such as the cost of repairing a fence or gate broken by the trespasser.</p>

	<p pid=".1050W.2/2">In the years 2001 to 2003, while the promoting independence grant was available, some councils may have chosen to use it to help support the modernisation and integration of community equipment services. However, information on such amounts has not been collected centrally. The Department of Health continues to support the development of these services through additions to baseline national health service and social services allocations. In addition, &pound;7.4 million has been made available to councils for community equipment as part of the access and systems grant in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".1051W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/2">The Government attaches great importance to the development of advocacy services as one of the means that enable the views of patients to be represented.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/3">Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086) published in March 2001. The importance of advocacy is a theme running throughout the White Paper: effective advocacy services can make a real difference to the lives of people with learning disabilities and their families by helping them to put forward their views and play an active part in planning and designing services.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/4">&quot;Valuing People&quot; announced the creation of two new funds, the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund, to provide central support for key aspects of the strategy. Money from the Implementation Support Fund is being used to support and develop self and citizen advocacy projects across the country. Two voluntary organisations, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD) and Values into Action (VIA) are running separate schemes to develop and fund citizen advocacy and self advocacy respectively on the Department of Health's behalf. Both organisations have steering groups to oversee the projects and to ensure fairness in the way the funds are allocated.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/5">&pound;900,000 from the Implementation Support Fund was allocated to advocacy projects in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;1 million in 2002&ndash;03; &pound;1 million is being allocated in 2003&ndash;04. A further &pound;300,000 was allocated in 2001&ndash;02 to administer the funding schemes and support development workers to work with and strengthen existing advocacy schemes and help set up new ones: this amount increased to &pound;400,000 in both 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/6">We announced in our report on learning disability, &quot;Making Change Happen&quot; (HC514&ndash;11), published in April 2003, that the Implementation Support Fund would continue until March 2006. The fund will support the same areas of work as at present. The learning disability task force, which has members drawn from both the self and citizen advocacy movements, will be involved in discussions about the detailed use of the Support Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.3/7">Mental health policies pay equal importance to the use of advocacy. The draft Mental Health Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-25">25 June 2002</phrase>, provides for the first time that specialist mental health advocacy must be available for all patients being treated under compulsory powers and their nominated persons. This new duty ensures that patients can have the help of specialist advocacy when it is most needed. There are also proposals in the draft Bill for safeguards, including access to advocacy, for some adult patients who have a long-term incapacity to consent and who are in a hospital or nursing home receiving treatment for a serious mental disorder.</p>

The level of evidence does not suggest that buprenorphine should replace methadone as a substitution treatment, but rather that buprenorphine should now be considered an evidence-based addition to the range of pharmacological maintenance treatments. Much of the emerging evidence derives from other European countries and the evidence for efficacy of this treatment in Britain is very limited and based on very few studies.</p>

	<p pid=".1058W.5/15">A proportion of passports are reported lost or stolen at British Diplomatic posts abroad. This coupled with the fact that the UK Passport Service does not routinely receive notification of passports recovered by other authorities, makes it extremely difficult to make a reasonable estimate as to the number of such passports in circulation within the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/16">The UKPS is introducing a more comprehensive system for recording and disseminating information on lost, stolen and recovered passports. This system is due to go live in December of this year.

	<p pid=".1060W.0/1">The provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill which reform the sentencing framework will make it possible to ensure that the most serious violent, sexual and persistent offenders spend longer in prison while allowing other offenders to be dealt with by means of tougher and more effective community sentences. In addition, custody plus and custody minus will provide an option for those offenders whose offences are serious enough to justify custody, but where the concentration of rehabilitative work occurs in the community. The projected net effect on the prison population of the implementation of the provisions to reform the sentencing framework, is an increase of about 1,000 in the prison population by 2009. The impact is estimated to be about 500 once all the changes have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.0/2">The firearms offences provisions in the Bill will provide for a mandatory minimum custodial sentence for unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm. The estimated effect on the prison population of the implementation of these provisions, and the implementation of the provision providing for increase in penalties for certain driving-related offences causing death, is an increase of about 500 in the prison population.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.0/3">The effect of life sentence provisions in the Bill will provide for the determination of minimum term in relation to mandatory life sentence. It is assumed that the effect of these provisions on the prison population will not be felt for a decade. In around 20 years time, the projected effect on the prison population is estimated to be an increase of about 1,000 in the prison population. In around 30 to 60 years time, once all the changes have been implemented and when sufficient time has passed for the full effect to be seen, the impact is estimated to be in the order of 1,200.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.0/4">The restriction on bail for drug users provision will be piloted in selected court areas. The provision aims to reduce re-offending by encouraging drug-misusing offenders into effective drug treatment programmes where appropriate. Part of the pilot evaluation will focus on the likely impacts of the provision on prison population if it were to be extended more widely. A study is planned to assess the likely effect on the prison population of the provisions introducing a presumption against the grant of bail to defendants who have failed to surrender. The measure is intended to deter offenders from abusing bail.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.0/5">The Government is providing additional capacity. Spending Review 2000 and the 2003 budget provided funds for 2,820 additional prison places to be built at existing prisons. Two new prisons will also be opened at Ashford and Peterborough. Together with building programmes in progress, these two additional programmes will increase the total useable capacity of the prison service estate from 74,030 to around 78,700 by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.0/6">The prison service continues to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years, as part of the Government's prison modernisation strategy. This is based on a combination of expanding capacity in existing prisons that we want to keep in the long term and a programme to build new large multi-function prisons.</p>

	<p pid=".1061W.8/1">The Government's strategy recognises the importance of intelligence and joint operations in source and transit countries. Through the Reflex multi-agency taskforce on organised immigration crime, detailed intelligence assessments have been drawn up. These are operationally sensitive, but have been used to inform the deployment of a network of immigration liaison officers (ILOs) in order to develop intelligence and operational co-operation in source and transit countries. The ILOs are posted at key nexus points in eastern and south-eastern Europe with plans to increase the number of officers deployed.</p>
	<p pid=".1061W.8/2">In addition, we have been working with key source and transit countries to develop their capability to tackle trafficking. Project Immpact, a UK-led EU initiative in Bosnia, which has led to the identification of trafficked women, is a good example of this. A second phase of Immpact will be commencing shortly in Serbia and Montenegro.

	<p pid=".1062W.2/1">Social services have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive assistance and support based on their particular needs. They may arrive in this country as unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, or accompanied by an adult. In the latter case, if anyone who comes into contact with the child is concerned that the child is the victim of abuse or neglect, they should refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum will also be referred to social services. This care will be determined by a needs assessment according to the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&mdash;in many cases&mdash;protection under the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/2">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example, the police or councils with social services responsibilities, will act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare. This may involve placing the child in a foster placement or it may place the child in a children's home.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/3">There are only very limited circumstances in which it is an option to hold a young person in secure accommodation. The Children Act 1989 permits that children may only be held in secure conditions if they satisfy certain specific grounds such as a likelihood of absconding together with a likelihood that injury would be caused to the young person themselves or others. This requires the approval of the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/4">The Home Office trafficking toolkit has been produced to aid front line agencies such as social services, Immigration Services and police in recognising victims of trafficking and treating them appropriately. The toolkit is available on-line at: <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/toolkits">www.crimereduction.gov.uk/toolkits</a>. An abridged version in hard copy has also been produced for widespread distribution to these workers.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.2/5">There is also work under way involving key agencies at principal entry points to identify children at risk, including pilot projects involving the Immigration Service, Police and Social Services at Heathrow and Dover.</p>

Reflex has overseen the establishment of a network of immigration liaison officers in key source and transit countries whose role is to build up intelligence on routes and methods and support joint working to tackle criminal gangs. Immigration liaison officers are already posted at key nexus points in eastern and south-eastern Europe and the network will be extended shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".1063W.2/3">Reflex has established close operational links with Europol, where a dedicated United Kingdom liaison officer is based, covering organised immigration crime. Europol has developed an action plan on trafficking, which was approved at the recent meeting of the ED Police Chief Task Force held by the Greek Presidency. This will form the basis for co-operation with EU candidate countries for joint operations to tackle trafficking networks.</p>

	<p pid=".1065W.2/1">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in pursuing its vision of &quot;a confident, creative, informed and prosperous society&quot; is committed both to promoting a greater respect and understanding of the richness of our cultural and linguistic diversity and to celebrating this diversity. In progressing this objective the Department supported Diversity 21 as a means of examining cultural diversity with a view to promoting deeper understanding and to represent this diversity as a sign of strength in our society. Diversity 21 provided the means of promoting cultural diversity work already happening; identifying and delivery of new projects aimed at stimulating the imagination and exploring diversity in an open, creative and accessible way; and providing a cultural diversity grant funding scheme. In this way the Department supported a schedule of exhibitions on language, faith and history in Northern Ireland and the wider Commonwealth, to a number of organisations and community groups throughout the Province; a programme of workshops on the different drums of Northern Ireland and various projects aimed at progressing the cultural diversity agenda. In addition the Department under the Diversity 21 funding programme supported a range of community based projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1065W.2/2">Since the suspension of the Assembly the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has fulfilled its commitments within the Diversity 21 programme and funding scheme. In the interests of ensuring the optimum approach to cultural diversity within the DCAL remit, the Department has also evaluated the Diversity 21 Programme and is currently considering a policy framework which will enable it to take forward the cultural diversity agenda in a structured and comprehensive way.</p>

	<p pid=".1069W.0/1">The Government attaches great importance to the development of advocacy services as one of the means that enable the views of patients to be represented.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.0/2">Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086) published in March 2001. The importance of advocacy is a theme running throughout the White Paper: effective advocacy services can make a real difference to the lives of people with learning disabilities and their families by helping them to put forward their views and play an active part in planning and designing services.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.0/3">&quot;Valuing People&quot; announced the creation of two new funds, the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund, to provide central support for key aspects of the strategy. Money from the Implementation Support Fund is being used to support and develop self and citizen advocacy projects across the country. Two voluntary organisations, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD) and Values into Action (VIA) are running separate schemes to develop and fund citizen advocacy and self advocacy respectively on the Department of Health's behalf. Both organisations have steering groups to oversee the projects and to ensure fairness in the way the funds are allocated.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.0/4">&pound;900,000 from the Implementation Support Fund was allocated to advocacy projects in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;1 million in 2002&ndash;03; &pound;1 million is being allocated in 2003&ndash;04. A further &pound;300,000 was allocated in 2001&ndash;02 to administer the funding schemes and support development workers to work with and strengthen existing advocacy schemes and help set up new ones: this amount increased to &pound;400,000 in both 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.0/5">We announced in our report on learning disability, &quot;Making Change Happen&quot; (HC514&ndash;11), published in April 2003, that the Implementation Support Fund would continue until March 2006. The fund will support the same areas of work as at present. The learning disability task force, which has members drawn from both the self and citizen advocacy movements, will be involved in discussions about the detailed use of the Support Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.0/6">Mental health policies pay equal importance to the use of advocacy. The draft Mental Health Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-25">25 June 2002</phrase>, provides for the first time that specialist mental health advocacy must be available for all patients being treated under compulsory powers and their nominated persons. This new duty ensures that patients can have the help of specialist advocacy when it is most needed. There are also proposals in the draft Bill for safeguards, including access to advocacy, for some adult patients who have a long-term incapacity to consent and who are in a hospital or nursing home receiving treatment for a serious mental disorder.</p>

	<p pid=".1070W.2/1">Standard One of the older people's national service framework (NSF) sets out the commitment to address age discrimination in access to health and social care. Since its publication in March 2001 significant progress has been made in starting to tackle age discrimination:</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/2" class="indent">There is a now a wider appreciation and awareness across health and social care of age discrimination as an issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/3" class="indent">National health service organisations have checked their written polices to ensure they have no age bias. Only a very small number have been found that discriminated against older people. In these cases, procedures are being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/4" class="indent">Our monitoring through strategic health authorities at October 2002 indicates that, 91 per cent. of areas had strategic and operational plans to address identified age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/5" class="indent">Councils and care trusts have received guidance to make sure everyone has fair access to services&mdash;regardless of age.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/6" class="indent">In November last year we released a computerised information tool to enable those implementing the NSF at local level to compare their treatment rates in 10 different hospital procedures, in relation to different age groups.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/7" class="indent">We supported the development of a practice guide published in February 2002 by the King's Fund, &quot;Auditing Age Discrimination&mdash;a practical approach to promoting equality in health and social care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/8" class="indent">A reflection of this new attitude, coupled with some of the wider Departmental initiatives, can be seen in hospitals' greater action in providing surgery for older patients:</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/9" class="indent">between 2000 and 2002, for example, breast cancer surgery for patients 85 and over rose by 13 per cent. and while coronary artery bypass grafts increased by 16 per cent. for those 65 or over, while the increase was 32 per cent. among patients 75 or over and 65 per cent. in the 85 plus age group.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/10" class="indent">We have funded Age Concern to run eight events on age discrimination across England during the current year.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.2/11">Detailed, comprehensive information on representations of age discrimination made by organisations and individuals to the NHS are not collated centrally. The Department at a national level and local NHS organisations are continuing to work closely with older people and their representative bodies to identify individual and specific areas of concern and take action to address them.</p>

	<p pid=".1073W.0/2">The Government's Civil Contingencies Capabilities Programme has identified broad areas of activity under which Departments group specific projects, activity and programme expenditure. The purpose is to deliver broad generic capabilities which allow the United Kingdom to respond effectively to a wide range of disruptive challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.0/3">In 2002&ndash;03 the Department of Health allocated some &pound;85 million to strengthen national and regional resilience to ensure that the national health service is prepared and equipped to meet the demands of chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats to the public. This figure is &pound;69 million over and above the &pound;16 million spent in 2001&ndash;02. Through this funding, medical countermeasures, including vaccines, antibiotics, antidotes and respiratory support equipment, and personal protective equipment are now in place in the NHS. Although it is not possible to apportion specific expenditure to each area, this funding has served to strengthen overall capability and resilience to threats to essential services, the treatment of mass casualties and the treatment of infectious disease. For 2003&ndash;04, the Department of Health has allocated &pound;98.5 million to this on-going programme of work, which is &pound;82.5 million over and above the &pound;16 million spent in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.0/4">The capabilities that we are working to deliver have been developed to allow the Government to deal with the fullest range of scenarios. Should a specific additional urgent operational need arise, at any point of the spending cycle, action would be taken to meet it. The public expenditure framework the Government have put in place provides the flexibility to deal with unexpected pressures.</p>

	<p pid=".1074W.3/1">While it is accepted that oral examinations at appropriate intervals are of value in maintaining oral health, there is little direct evidence to support a specific interval or to quantify the benefit. There is, therefore, a requirement for the practitioner to undertake a needs assessment exercise for each individual patient. Individual recall intervals result from a balanced consideration of the risks to maintaining oral health. General dental services remuneration arrangements do not normally permit payment for a recall examination where the same dentist received an examination fee in the previous five complete calendar months.</p>

	<p pid=".1075W.3/1">In 1999, the Department of Health asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multidisciplinary working party to devise new clinical guidelines for the use of domiciliary oxygen. Although the working party's terms of reference precluded making specific recommendations about alterations in service provision, a number of the guidelines had implications for the content of the existing domiciliary oxygen service and for the way in which the service is delivered. It was clear, therefore, that this vital resource&mdash;that has seen only one significant change, the introduction of oxygen concentrators, in the past 50 years&mdash;had become out of date, both in terms of the service offered to patients and its cost effectiveness. It was against this background that the then Under-Secretary of State, my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath directed that a review of the domiciliary oxygen service should take place.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/2">This review is now complete and we are ready to move forward to create a modernised and integrated service for the provision of domiciliary oxygen.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/3">At present, domiciliary oxygen is ordered for patients by general practitioners. The service consists principally of the provision of oxygen either from large cylinders supplied by community pharmacies, or delivered by way of an oxygen concentrator, installed in the patient's home by a contractor.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/4">The modern, integrated service that is proposed represents a considerable advance on this organisational and service model.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/5">The new model will transfer responsibility for ordering oxygen for long-term oxygen therapy from general practitioners to specialist consultants in hospital. This will relieve general practitioners of the bureaucratic burden of writing prescriptions, effectively on doctors. (Patients who need long-term oxygen will invariably have their needs assessed by hospital staff). The hospital consultant will decide, in discussion with the patient, what the patient's needs for oxygen are. For example, many patients would benefit from having oxygen available in a form that allows then greater freedom of movement both in and outside the home than is possible with large cylinders or oxygen concentrators. General practitioners will continue to be able to prescribe oxygen for patients who need small amounts of oxygen.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/6">Once the hospital consultant or general practitioner has discussed and determined the patient's need for oxygen, it will be the responsibility of contractors to work closely with the patient and decide what technology, that is what type and method of oxygen supply, will best suit the patient's therapeutic need, and to provide it. These specialist contractors will be well placed to keep pace with developments in the technical aspects of service delivery, so patients will benefit from advances in technology as they are developed.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/7">Thus, the modernised integrated service represents a sensible division of responsibility in the provision of domiciliary oxygen services. It places clinical responsibility for assessing oxygen need with doctors, and places technical decisions on the best and most up to date method of delivery with service contractors. Over the next few months a specification for the provision of the integrated service will be drawn up. Contractors will be invited to tender against this specification and fully operational early in 2005. The current arrangements for the provision of domiciliary oxygen will continue as at present to cover this transitional period.</p>

	<p pid=".1078W.6/2">Professional indemnity should ensure that patients who have suffered harm receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Indemnity cover should be occurrence based, that is claims are met that arise from events when the clinician was covered but only come to light later, even if this is after the period of cover has ceased. Experience in the United Kingdom is that proper indemnity cover can be provided through membership of a defence society or a suitable insurance policy.</p>

According to Article 4 of the bilateral agreement, United Kingdom residents have received a reduction in conductive education fees on the standard fees for non-Hungarians since <phrase class="date" code="1998-09-14">14 September 1998</phrase>. In addition, some British students receive conductive training, which will enable them to provide conductive education in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.11/2">For the 2000&ndash;01 academic year, 12 UK residents received conductive training and 18 received conductive education. An extra 15 students received conductive education during the 2001 summer camp. For the 2001&ndash;02 academic year, 18 UK residents received conductive education and 18 received conductive training. In addition, reduced rates have been offered to UK residents staying at either the Peto Institute's hostel or hotel.</p>

Under this system, only organised out-of-hours providers which meet and maintain specified quality standards will be accredited by primary care trusts (PCTs) to continue providing services. The quality standards, which include responsiveness, are those recommended by The Carson Review of out-of-hours services, which reported in 2000. Both NHS Direct and Prime Care are expected to meet these standards and their performance is for PCTs to monitor as part of the new accreditation system.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.0/1">All patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of developing atheroma, a pathological process that may lead to an increased incidence of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral blood vessel disease. The exact mechanism of atheroma formation in rheumatoid arthritis is unclear, but may be associated with the vasculitis observed in rheumatoid arthritis. Peripheral gangrene may result from atheroma in peripheral blood vessels, and sometimes from vasculitis itself. On average, life expectancy is reduced in rheumatoid arthritis by about five years and atheroma is a key contributing cause.</p>

Rheumatoid arthritis affects all ages and ethnic groups and up to 1 per cent. of the population may be affected by it. We expect that about 15,000 people will benefit from anti-TNF therapy.</p>
