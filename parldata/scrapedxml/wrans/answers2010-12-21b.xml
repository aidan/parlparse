UK parliamentary ratification is under way, alongside those of other EU member states. The EU General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-22">22 October 2010</phrase> agreed to refer to the Commission, for an Opinion, Serbia's application for EU membership, recalling that full co-operation with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains an essential condition for Serbia's EU membership. The Commission's November 2010 Report on Enlargement welcomed progress made by Serbia in complying with its obligations under the SAA, but called for further effort in a number of key reform areas. The UK supports the Commission assessment.</p>

In November 2010 the Commission issued an Opinion on Montenegro's application for EU membership. The Commission assessed Montenegro's track record in implementing its obligations under the SAA as positive overall. It recommended that the Council grant Montenegro EU Candidate Status, but set out seven key reform priorities which it recommended be addressed before the Council considers opening accession negotiations with Montenegro. The UK supports the Commission's assessment and its recommendation to grant EU Candidate Status to Montenegro, which will be considered by the December European Council.</p>

The Commission's November 2010 Report on Enlargement assessed that BiH had made only limited progress in meeting its obligations under the SAA. BiH remains in breach of its Interim Agreement with the EU and the EU General Affairs Council of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-14">14 December 2010</phrase> concluded that BiH needs urgently to align itself with its SAA obligations and speed up reforms essential for further progress towards EU membership.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124W.2/1">The UK Government are prioritising their engagement with the world's emerging powers, including Brazil. Strengthening ties with Brazil will help to promote a range of UK interests, in particular trade and investment, where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is working with UK Trade and Investment and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to build Britain's prosperity by increasing exports and investment, opening markets, ensuring access to resources, and promoting sustainable global growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.2/2">The last three years have seen a 500% increase in the number of British companies looking for help with the Brazilian market from UKTI. There are particular opportunities in the infrastructure, energy and defence sectors, as well as commercial opportunities linked to Brazil's hosting of the 2014 football World Cup and 2016 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.2/3">The Government are playing a leading role to capitalise on these prospects. The Business Secretary visited Brazil in September 2010. In 2011 the Deputy Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Lord Mayor of London will also visit. This high-level engagement will include business delegations. During 2011, we will develop a UK-Brazil CEOs' Forum and work to deliver concrete outcomes to the annual Ministerial UK-Brazil Joint Economic Trade Committee (JETCO).</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.2/4">The UK Government are also working with Brazil through the EU in support of an ambitious EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement, which will benefit UK companies exporting to the region. In the G20, Brazil is a helpful partner in discussions on global economic governance, by supporting free trade and resisting protectionism.</p>

Their immediate and unconditional release remains one of the international community's long-standing demands. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I raised the plight of Burmese political prisoners at the October Asia Europe summit at which the Burmese Foreign Minister was present. We also raise the issue directly with the Burmese Government through our ambassador in Rangoon, with regional countries with influence and in the UN's human rights bodies. Most recently we secured a strongly-worded human rights resolution on Burma in the UN General Assembly which demanded the release of all political prisoners. We will continue to maintain international pressure for progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1125W.5/1">The UK, as part of its membership of the European Union, is party with all other 27 member states in a customs union with common arrangements for imports from and exports to third counties. These common arrangements are decided, discussed, agreed and administered through the Community's 'Common Commercial Policy' (CCP). The UK is therefore unable to enter into direct regional trade agreements with other members of the Commonwealth in exclusion of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1125W.5/2">The Government are pursuing an ambitious free trade agenda aimed at reducing barriers to trade and is committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development outcome from the Doha Development Agenda.

The EU's trade relations with South Africa are governed by the EU South Africa Trade, Development and Co-operation agreement.</p>

CMAG is formed of nine member states, appointed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) for a two year term. The UK was last a member between 2007 and 2009. We hope that the review of CMAG, agreed to by heads at CHOGM 2009, and the work of the Eminent Persons Group (EPG), will strengthen this important group.

We provide budget support to the Palestinian Authority, via a World Bank Trust Fund, in order to support basic services and pay the salaries of public sector workers in both Gaza and the west bank. From 2006-08, the UK provided funding to pay public sector worker salaries through two European Union programmes known as the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) and PEGASE. As this funding is for the whole of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, it is not possible to disaggregate funding specific to Gaza.

	<p pid="b.1132W.9/1">The Government Equalities Office (GEO) does not make its own assessment of the gender pay gap, but instead uses figures published by The Office for National Statistics (ONS). The most recent assessment by ONS shows that the gap between the median hourly earnings of men and women working full-time is 10.2% in 2010. If men and women working part-time are also included then this figure rises to 19.8%.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.9/2">This Government are committed to tackling the barriers that women face in the workplace and are taking a range of measures including extending the right to request flexible working to all employees, consulting on a new system of parental leave, and promoting gender equality on company boards including responding to any recommendations from the current Lord Davies review that are targeted towards, and accepted by, the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1133W.2/1">The Government Equalities Office (GEO) spent &#163;80,108 on eight regional road shows. Four of the events were about the equality duty and were held in September 2009. The other four events were consultations on the Equality Bill, held towards the end of 2008 and early 2009.

	<p pid="b.1133W.2/2">GEO has not kept a register of who attended these events. Numbers of GEO staff at the events varied but typically GEO sent two policy staff to capture delegate's view and introduce the subject matter and a member of the GEO's communications team. Organisation of these events was undertaken by the GEO communications team which at the time had four members of staff but these staff would have been involved intermittently on work relating to the road shows.</p>

	<p pid="b.1134W.5/2">The Equality Act 2010 includes a range of positive action provisions that allow political parties to take steps to encourage involvement amongst women and other underrepresented groups.

	<p pid="b.1134W.8/1">The Gender Equality Duty, which came into force in England, Scotland and Wales in April 2007, requires public authorities to promote equality of opportunity between men and women and eliminate unlawful harassment and sex discrimination. This could include work to promote the number of female role models in schools and public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.8/2">In regard to role models in schools, this Government are committed to encouraging girls and young women to make broader career choices and to open up opportunities for everyone, regardless of background and gender. It is important to recognise the part role models play in raising aspirations and helping young people to make informed choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.8/3">We will be establishing a new all-age careers service to encourage informed choices, providing clear and transparent information to all learners about the options open to them. Good careers guidance is at the heart of ensuring opportunities are available to all.</p>

Lord Davies will deliver his recommendations for an effective business-led strategy in February 2010 and we will respond to his recommendations in due course. Measures that we are taking on positive action, on flexible working, and on parental leave will also help address some of the barriers to career progression that women face in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.8/6">In regard to role models in public services, the Government have set themselves the aspiration that by the end of the Parliament at least 50% of all appointees being made to the boards of public bodies will be women. We are currently looking at what steps need to be taken to achieve that aim and will be publishing a cross-Government action plan in March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.1137W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is looking at what works in setting up micro-insurance schemes in developing countries. This will address issues such as: how to get insurance companies engaged; how to make insurance affordable for poorer farmers; and, how to maximise value for money from such schemes. We are working with international partners, including the World Bank, the World Food programme and Oxfam, to help find answers to these questions, and to improve climate risk management for the poor. Some of the preliminary results of our analysis will be available in early 2011 and will inform our approach to micro-insurance and climate change, and our &quot;Fast Start&quot; funding decisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1137W.6/1">Improving maternal health and women's rights are major priorities for the UK Government. The Department for International Development (DFID) will shortly be launching a new Framework for Results for Reproductive, Maternal and Newborn Health. This will set out how the UK aims to increase efforts to 2015 to save the lives of at least 50,000 women in pregnancy and childbirth, a quarter of a million newborn babies and enable 10 million couples to access modern methods of family planning. It includes action to remove financial barriers that prevent women accessing services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.6/2">The Government believe that nobody should die or suffer ill health because they are too poor to afford treatment. This is why we support international efforts to achieve universal coverage of basic health services. Evidence shows that removing financial barriers increases poor women's uptake of reproductive, maternal and newborn health services. Where appropriate, DFID will provide technical and financial support to countries that wish to remove fees at the point of use of services and replace them with more equitable health financing systems. This includes making essential health services free at the point of use, and supporting the poorest women to meet the indirect costs of health care by piloting innovative approaches like cash transfer programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1148W.0/1">The Emergency Budget announced a two year pay freeze from 2011-12 for public sector workforces, except for those earning &#163;21,000 or less, who will receive an increase of at least &#163;250 a year. This policy will help protect jobs and the quality of public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/2">The Government have assessed the impact of the pay freeze on men and women using Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/3">The precise impact on individuals earning &#163;21,000 or less will be determined by the relevant employer. However, compared with the previous Government's policy of a 1% pay cap for 2011-12 and 2012-13, it is likely that the emergency Budget policy will represent less income for public sector workers earning over &#163;21,000-but an increase in income for those earning &#163;21,000 or less.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/4">It is estimated that 65% of those employed by the public sector are female. However, 78% of those employed in the public sector earning &#163;21,000 or less are female and will therefore benefit from the Government's policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.0/5">In addition, the &#163;3.3 billion in savings from public sector pay restraint will help protect public sector jobs. Given that 65% of public sector employees are female around two thirds of jobs protected will be those of women. Pay restraint will also protect the provision of public services that are used by both women and men.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160W.2/3">Prior to September 2010 the Unified Contract contained a provision that notice of any further extension of the contract must be given at least three months' notice prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>. Therefore at the time the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-09">9 August</phrase> was written there was no power on the face of the contract allowing for any further extension. Following an application for judicial review of the contract tender for family legal services by the Law Society, the Legal Services Commission agreed to a one month extension to preserve the status quo and ensure continuity of provision pending the outcome of the judicial review. The mechanism to achieve this was to amend the above notice provision in the contract; this amendment was made pursuant to Clause 13.4 (minor amendments). This was not something envisaged at the time of my letter. Thereafter when judgment was given in the judicial review further amendments were made to the extension provisions of the contract to allow for it to be extended for family services only.

	<p pid="b.1161W.5/1">The LSC launched its Employee Charter in conjunction with a new behavioural framework in September 2008. The Charter was developed by employees as an expression of the aspirational values of the organisation. While the Charter is not intended as a performance measurement tool, the behavioural framework describes how the LSC's competencies can be demonstrated through behaviours and is used in performance development review meetings and for recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.5/2">The method of dissemination of the Charter was decided by local senior management teams and varied across the sites of the LSC. All staff had access to it through an intranet article and mention in the 'core brief' (standardised monthly face to face communication from managers). Booklets were available for distribution and each office had a 'champion' who ran information sessions in their regions. It is included in induction packs for new starters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.5/3">The Charter has not been revised since it was first produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.5/4">The Charter is published with the behavioural framework in the booklet titled 'Empowering our Future'. It is also referenced in the Employee Handbook which contains terms and conditions of employment. Employees who demonstrate the values of the Charter have been recognised publicly with intranet stories and posters for notice boards describing how their behaviour makes a positive difference to the LSC.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.0/1">It is not possible to answer the question in the exact format requested. The LSC has undergone significant restructuring since April 2007. Each restructure has aimed to ensure that the LSC is better prepared for the future and that it has the right people with the right skills and experience to deliver legal aid. Various people have moved between departments and the departments themselves have been renamed and restructured. To track the staff and match them to departments is not possible except at disproportionate cost. However, I am able to provide total figures for the whole LSC as set out in the following table. Please note that the figures for the number of employees leaving the LSC include those who have left for reasons other than redundancy and so these figures should not be compared directly with the severance costs reported.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.0/2">The cost of the contract for the proposed prison was &#163;567 million, to be paid over a 261/2 year period. The construction costs, which were included in the total contract cost, were estimated at around &#163;95 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.0/3">A total of &#163;16 million has been spent on the site since it was purchased in 1998. This includes site purchase costs, site security, obtaining planning consent and detailed planning permission, discharging the planning conditions and demolishing the buildings that were on site.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.0/4">Not proceeding with the project will save a total of &#163;567 million in running costs. We are now likely to save around &#163;14 million to &#163;16 million more over the Spending Review Period than if we had decided to continue. This saving would have continued beyond this period at around &#163;7 million to &#163;9 million per year once the proposed prison had become operational.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.0/5">The cost of external professional advice (including legal, financial, insurance and technical advisors, as well as Partnerships UK), for the procurement of prisons at Maghull and Belmarsh West was about &#163;2.4 million. As the tendering process for both prisons was run simultaneously, a breakdown of the cost of external professional advice for Maghull alone is not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1168W.6/1">Tables 1 to 5 show figures for sentences given for indictable offences to offenders with 16 or more previous convictions or cautions, who did not receive an immediate custodial sentence, by category of offence and gender. Tables 6 to 10 show figures for sentences given for indictable offences to offenders with 16 or more previous convictions or cautions, who did not receive an immediate custodial sentence, by category of offence and ethnicity. These figures are derived from table 6.2 of 'Sentencing Statistics: England and Wales 2009' which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-21">21 October 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.6/2">The figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the police national computer (PNC), which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. The figures are provisional and subject to change as more information is recorded by the police. The ethnicity information recorded on the PNC reflects the police officer's view of the offender's ethnicity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1180W.2/1">The postcode to weather station linkages used for the cold weather payment scheme are reviewed after the end of each winter. Expert advice is sought from the Met Office and changes made where appropriate before the start of the next winter period. Representations made during the previous winter about the suitability of the links between postcode districts and individual weather stations are also considered. Using postcodes linked to representative weather stations is a straightforward way to administer the scheme as the benefit computer systems can identify eligible customers and enables payments to be issued quickly and in the main automatically.</p>

	<p pid="b.1181W.5/1">The effect of the measure is that people who live in state funded residential care homes will cease to be paid the mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) after 28 days. While these residents will not be paid DLA, they will retain an underlying entitlement to the benefit and it will be reinstated if they leave the care home providing they continue to satisfy the conditions of entitlement. The planned implementation date is October 2012. The change will not apply to residents who meet the full costs of the care home themselves; they will continue to be paid any care or mobility components of disability living allowance they are entitled to. The change will affect around 80,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181W.5/2">This is a highly complex area in terms of both funding streams and the different responsibilities of all the parties involved and there are a maze of legal duties, contractual obligations and service levels to take into account.

Based on that assessment a decision is made as to which of those assessed needs should be met by specific services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184W.5/1">The effect of the measure is that people who live in state funded residential care homes will cease to be paid the mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) after 28 days. While these residents will not be paid DLA, they will retain an underlying entitlement to the benefit and it will be reinstated if they leave the care home providing they continue to satisfy the conditions of entitlement. The planned implementation date is October 2012. The change will not apply to residents who meet the full costs of the care home themselves; they will continue to be paid any care or mobility components of disability living allowance they are entitled to. The change will affect around 80,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.5/2">This is a highly complex area in terms of both funding streams and the different responsibilities of all the parties involved and there are a maze of legal duties, contractual obligations and service levels to take into account. Local authorities have a duty to carry out an assessment of need for community care services for individuals. Based on that assessment a decision is made as to which of those assessed needs should be met by specific services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.5/3">Care homes are required, where practicable, to promote the independence, participation and community involvement of their residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.5/4">Consideration was given to the equality impacts of the measure when the proposal was being developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.5/5">The equality impact assessment for removing the mobility component of disability living allowance from state funded care home residents after 28 days will be published with the proposed legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1188W.5/1">A claimant who does not qualify for income-related employment and support allowance after they have received 12 months of contributory employment and support allowance in the Work Related Activity Group may be able to claim a number of benefits depending on their circumstances. Depending on their rental circumstances, they may be eligible for housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they are aged 60 or over, they may be eligible for pension credit. If they have a partner who is working 16 hours or more a week, they may be able to claim working tax credit. However, any benefit entitlement will depend on individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.5/2">A claimant will retain any entitlement to disability living allowance, provided they continue to meet the qualifying conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.5/3">In the case of a person with a partner earning &#163;145 or more a week, entitlement to income-related employment and support allowance is retained as long as the partner is not working for more than 24 hours a week on average, and does not have net earnings in excess of &#163;148.69 a week. The customer and partner must also not be in possession of savings in excess of &#163;16,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.5/4">This level ensures that the couple have a weekly income equal to the couples' rate of employment and support allowance of &#163;102.75, the Work Relate Activity component of &#163;25.95, and up to &#163;20 a week in additional income from the partner's work income.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.5/5">A person in the Work Related Activity Group with a partner earning &#163;145 a week would therefore be entitled to &#163;3.70 a week in income-related employment and support allowance. Above the threshold of &#163;148.69 a week, entitlement to income-related employment and support allowance would cease.</p>

Decisions on awards are made at the local authority's discretion within the framework contained in the Discretionary Financial Assistance Regulations 2001. We do not intend to change these arrangements but we are trebling the funding we provide local authorities, to &#163;60 million a year, from April 2012 and increasing their budgets by &#163;10 million in 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192W.5/1">The Government believes that CPI is the appropriate index for measuring changes in the cost of living. It may be helpful if I set out some of the consideration that were factors in our reasoning:</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/2" class="indent">1. The CPI is the headline measure of inflation in Great Britain, forming the target for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee;</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/3" class="indent">2. The CPI excludes mortgage interest payments, which are not relevant to the majority of pensioners and benefit recipients;</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/4" class="indent">3. The methodology used the calculate the CPI takes into account the fact that many people tend to trade down to cheaper goods when prices rise which the RPI does not;</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/5" class="indent">4. In terms of population coverage the Retail Price Index (RPI) excludes a significant group of pensioners (pensioner households who receive 75% or more of their income from the State). The CPI includes those pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/6">The decision to switch to the CPI for price measurement for benefit and pension uprating, and provide the statutory minimum for occupational pension indexation, was taken by DWP Ministers with advice following discussions between DWP, HMT and other Departments, using appropriate evidence including that made available by the Office for National Statistics, over which the UK Statistics Authority has oversight. No discussions have taken place between the Department and the Royal Statistical Society on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is responsible for ensuring customers are compliant with the conditions of entitlement and remain eligible to receive Jobseeker's Allowance. To help ensure the associated sanctions regime is applied efficiently, effectively and consistently across Districts, Jobcentre Plus has established the following internal benchmarks:</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.2/5" class="indent">A minimum of 6% of the JSA live load is referred to Decision Makers to consider areas of doubt arising from entitlement and sanctions, and</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.2/6" class="indent">At least 50% of these referrals result in decisions adverse to the customer</p>
	<p pid="b.1193W.2/7" class="indent">These are benchmarks and not targets. There is no 'right level' of referrals. The intention is that, if District performance is significantly different from this benchmark, either above or below, this is a signal to management to assure themselves that processes are being followed correctly, fairly and consistently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.2/4" class="indent">Secondments, whether inward or outward, are full or part-time development activity, usually involving a private sector organisation or charity.

Inward secondments from the private sector or charities cannot exceed two years in duration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.2/5" class="indent">As at April 2010, there were 40 individuals on inward secondment to the MOD from various organisations in the public and private sector. Ten of these were employees of BAE Systems. In addition, two BAE Systems employees are engaged to provide external assistance with tasks in the Defence Intelligence Staff. Air Command has a number of BAE Systems employees conducting depth servicing at Marham, Cottesmore, and Kinloss. The numbers vary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206W.5/4" class="indent">I note that you have previously asked a number of defence procurement questions about specific equipment platforms, each time requesting the answers to be categorised by Government office region, local authority area and Parliamentary constituency. My concern is that collating this information is incredibly time consuming and expensive for the Department and sometimes, in the case of contracts with foreign companies, close to impossible. Of course I am anxious to help colleagues by being as open as possible and giving thorough answers to PQs, but I just wondered whether there was a wider defence procurement question that you would like us to address more holistically, rather than by this piecemeal and resource intensive approach. Please let me know if this might be the case. Perhaps you would like to come and see me in the New Year so we can discuss this in more details?</p>

Officials continue to work closely with individual member state data protection authorities to secure acknowledgement that law enforcement and the fight against terrorism, smuggling and other offences constitute a public and legitimate interest for the purposes of the data protection directive, so that API data can be transmitted.</p>

We believe that those discussions with the Commission are close to being concluded, and once a final position has been reached we will fully explore any implications with the industry.</p>

We continue to engage with a number of alternative providers to deliver the key benefits that the contract with Raytheon was unable to deliver. No new contracts have yet been agreed. The Programme remains on course to meet the Home Office Business plan target to agree a contract with new suppliers and transition existing services from Raytheon Systems Ltd by April 2011.</p>

We are empowering schools to take a zero tolerance approach to tackling bullying. In our Education Bill next year, we will be giving heads and teachers a range of powers to instil discipline and promote good behaviour in and outside of school. We are also revising our current guidance on bullying to ensure that schools are given the right message about tackling bullying effectively and providing pastoral care for bullied children.</p>

The UKCCIS internet safety campaign &quot;Zip it, Block it, Flag it&quot; makes it clear that children should think about what they say and do online, block nasty messages and tell someone they trust if something online upsets them. We are also working to improve internet safety education in schools, including what children and young people should do if they experience cyber-bullying by helping children make responsible choices when online including avoiding and engaging in such behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235W.2/2">We are determined to create an education system that delivers high standards for all children, and communication skills are an important part of this. All aspects of communication competence are built into the curriculum framework for English in primary schools and are subject to assessment at Key Stages 1 and 2. We have set out our plans for school reform in our Schools White Paper and we will be announcing plans for a review of the National Curriculum shortly.</p>

The department's key performance indicator for the early years is based on a summary of children's development at age five, which includes communication, language and literacy. A review of the Early Years Foundation Stage is currently being conducted by Dame Claire Tickell.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239W.2/1">We do not have information about the number of children who are not in full-time education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/2">Local authorities in England and Wales have had, since February 2007, a statutory duty to make arrangements to identify all children missing from education in their area. The duty applies in relation to children of compulsory school age who are not on a school roll, and who are not receiving a suitable education otherwise than being at school (for example, being educated at home, privately educated or in alternative provision).</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/3">It is important that schools and local authorities implement the systems and regulations and follow the guidance in place around keeping registers, excluding pupils and removing pupils from the school roll. Schools must fulfil their requirement to inform local authorities when pupils are deleted from the school roll or have &quot;disappeared&quot; following 10 days unauthorised absence from the school. Notifying the local authority is important because the local authority can then attempt to trace the children and ensure that any pupils that are removed from the roll of a school are receiving a suitable education.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Education has announced that he will fund secondary schools to release a qualified PE teacher from timetable for one day each week in the school years 2011/12 and 2012/13 so that more pupils can enter competitions run by the national governing bodies of sport. He has also lifted the many requirements of the previous Government's PE and sport strategy which prevented schools from getting on with providing competitive sport for their pupils. Taken together, these measures will give schools the freedom to concentrate on providing a truly rounded education for their pupils, which includes sport. The Government's new school games will provide further incentive to national governing bodies of sport to offer more attractive, deliverable competitions for schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1244W.8/2">There is no average level of funding for school sport partnerships. The level of funding for each partnership is based on the number of staff working within it, which varies significantly from area to area. The standard model for a school sport partnership is: a full-time partnership development manager; a school sport co-ordinator (two days per week) in each secondary school; a primary link teacher (12 days per year) in each primary school; and an FE sport co-ordinator (two days per week) in each FE college.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246W.2/2"><i> </i>The Department for Children, Schools and Families issued question and answer guidance about the co-ordination of in-year school admissions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-07">7 October 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.2/3">Paragraph 3.22 of the School Admissions Code requires that applications made outside the normal admissions round are considered without delay. It is for local authorities to set a time scale within which they will process applications, although to take any longer than a week might be considered unreasonable in light of the requirement in paragraph 3.22.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.2/4">In most cases, a decision will be easy to make. Except in the case of a grammar school, where a parent applies for a place and the school has places available the child should be admitted. There will be no need to refer to the oversubscription criteria. Even where one place is available and two children have applied, deciding which child should have priority will not normally require lengthy consideration. We believe most decisions could be made within five school days, but a small number of cases might be more complex. We think it would be reasonable for a local authority to allow admission authorities five school days to make a decision in the majority of cases, and a maximum of 10 school days in more complex cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246W.5/1">The latest estimate was that around 70% of school buildings contain some asbestos containing materials (ACMs). The estimate was made in 2007 based on a profile of the stock of school buildings which was based on earlier condition surveys of schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/2">Since then a number of schools have been replaced under major capital building programmes. Buildings contain a range of ACMs, for example moulded or preformed asbestos lagging used as thermal insulation on pipes and boilers; asbestos insulating board used for fire protection, thermal insulation, partitioning and ducts; and asbestos- containing floor tiles and textured coatings. The responsibility to assess the condition of ACMs in schools falls to the duty holder, under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006, usually the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/3">We have no plans to carry out a comprehensive programme of removal of asbestos across all schools. Asbestos must be managed in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006. The danger from asbestos arises from the release of asbestos fibres. If schools are properly managed and maintained, there should not be dangerously high levels of asbestos fibres. Where asbestos is in a dangerous condition it must be sealed or removed in accordance with the Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/4">Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is managed properly in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does not recommend the routine removal of asbestos. Its advice remains that, providing that ACMs are maintained in good condition, they can be left where they are and managed until a building reaches the end of its life and asbestos can be removed without risk of exposing building users to risks arising from significant disturbance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/5">Responsibility for prioritisation of specific asbestos removal projects rests with individual schools and local authorities. The Government are committed to ensuring there is a fairer, more effective and more efficient system for allocation of capital money; our priorities for the allocation are to meet the need for additional pupil places.</p>

	<p pid="b.1247W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/4" class="indent">In addition to Her Majesty's Inspectors, Ofsted directly employs regulatory inspectors who inspect social care provision and undertake regulatory activities relating to that provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/5" class="indent">A recruitment campaign in May 2010 for regulatory inspectors set out the following qualifications and experience as essential requirements for applicants:</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/6" class="indent">a recognised social work qualification or a professional qualification relevant to working with children which must be at a minimum level 4 (NVQ level 4 or equivalent);</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/7" class="indent">significant knowledge of social care regulations and standards including a wider knowledge of social care practice and legislation;</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/8" class="indent">a robust knowledge of child protection and safeguarding of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/9" class="indent">In addition to the HMI and social care regulatory inspectors who work directly for Ofsted, the Inspection Service Providers, who are contracted to Ofsted to undertake inspections, employ inspectors as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/10" class="indent">(i) Additional inspectors inspect schools, learning and skills and initial teacher education providers. The contractual obligations on the Inspection Service Providers require them to ensure that all inspectors are fit and proper to inspect on Ofsted's behalf. They must have credibility and up to date professional knowledge and will normally have gained a degree or an equivalent qualification. They are expected to have appropriate experience, usually drawn from a number of years in a senior management position in an education or other relevant setting or service. In addition, they need to have competence in the use of information technology and a clear enhanced criminal records bureau check that is refreshed every three years. Prior to appointment, all inspectors must provide employers' references and participate in a medical assessment to ensure they are fit for the work they are to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.2/11" class="indent">(ii) Early years inspectors carry out inspections of providers of early years and childcare against regulations and quality standards for the Early Years Foundation Stage. Nearly all of the inspectors currently working for the Inspection Service Providers were until <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-01">1 September 2010</phrase> directly employed by Ofsted, They must have a full professional qualification in early education, care or regulatory work, or equivalent knowledge and experience. For those inspectors without a degree, Ofsted established a successful programme to assist in helping them study for one. This programme is being continued by the Inspection Service Providers and it is expected that all early years inspectors will have a degree by 2015.</p>

This is why the Government are investing &#163;530 million to support broadband rollout. The evidence obtained from studies of the economic impact of the rollout of first generation broadband shows that communities with broadband grew faster than those without it.</p>

The Higher Education Academy has developed, and is currently consulting on enhancements to, the UK Professional Standards Framework for Teaching and Supporting Learning in Higher Education.

The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is currently consulting with the sector on proposals for all higher education institutions to publish a standard Key Information Set, on a course by course basis, which will provide students with the information which research shows they want. The consultation document is available here:</p>

	<p pid="b.1262W.8/4">Repayment of student loans is income contingent and graduates. Under the future progressive repayment system, graduates will not need to make any repayments until their income is above &#163;21,000 (compared to &#163;15,000 under the current system). If their loan is not repaid after 30 years, the remaining balance will be written off.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.5/2">It is possible for borrowers to over-repay their student loans because of the loan collection process. After the end of each tax year, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) notifies the Student Loans Company (SLC) of loan deductions made by employers in the previous tax year. Due to this time lag, it is possible for people to over-repay. However, all overpayments are refunded with interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.5/3">Since December 2009, in order to reduce the number of those who over-repay, borrowers nearing the end of their loan repayment term are notified by the SLC that they may opt out of the PAYE system, and complete their loan repayments by direct debit. Additionally, borrowers are advised to monitor their own repayments so they can calculate when they are likely to repay their loan in full.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265W.3/1">Drug misuse and dependence UK guidelines on clinical management produced by the four UK health departments provides guidance on the treatment of withdrawal from Benzodiazepines. These guidelines do not refer to a maximum period for withdrawal. They advise that a reduction in dose (converted to an appropriate dose of diazepam) is tapered over time with regular assessments to determine the most effective rate of this reduction based on the individual clinical needs of the patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.3/2">A list of granted marketing authorisations for generic Lorazepam is provided in the following table. The name of the marketing authorisation holder and the product name are provided in each case. The table also indicates the legislative provision under which each generic licence was authorised where this has been established from available records.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.3/3">At the time these Marketing Authorisations were granted the extant directive on medicinal products was Directive 65/65/EC. Applications for generic products would have been made under Article 4.8a which made provision for an abridged application, that is, an application made without supplying results of toxicological tests and clinical trials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.3/4">An abridged application was permitted if either (i) the holder of an existing authorisation gave consent for his clinical and toxicological data to be cross-referenced or (ii) the product had well established use with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety or (iii) the medicinal product was essentially similar to a product which had been authorized on the basis of full data on safety and efficacy including clinical trials. It was Article 4.8a(iii) that was most commonly used at that time for generic applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.3/5">The MHRA is not legally required to retain any data it receives as part of an application. Under MHRA record management policy all application files (files that are submitted by a manufacturer for the licensing of a product) and data for licences are held for 15 years. Clinical trial files are held for five years. From September 2010, the MHRA has only kept other data subject to ongoing business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265W.3/6">The MHRA continuously monitors the safety of all medicines in the UK using a variety of sources including information from clinical studies, published literature, spontaneous case reports, data from marketing authorisation holders as well as other regulatory authorities. This information is used to ensure that up to date information is provided in the product information. In doing this, the MHRA does not rely on the safety information in the original application file, especially when the application is not recent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.0/1">Ellaone contains ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator. Ellaone was licensed for use as a single dose of 30mg as an emergency contraceptive by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) in May 2009. It is used to prevent pregnancy for up to five days after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure, mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation. Ellaone is contraindicated for use during an existing or suspected pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.0/2">In the United Kingdom, ellaOne is licensed as a prescription only medicine. Full information relating to the safe and appropriate use of a medicine is provided to health care professionals in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and to women in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL). The SmPC and PIL for ellaOne clearly inform women and health care professionals that it should not be taken by a woman who knows she is pregnant and that a pregnancy test should be undertaken if she suspects she is pregnant. The SmPC and PIL also provide information on the known side effects for ellaOne, most common of which are headache, nausea, menstrual disorders, and abdominal pain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.0/3">There is no published experience of pregnancy termination with ellaOne and in clinical studies a 30mg dose of ulipristal acetate did not interrupt existing pregnancies. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that such an effect could not be excluded and that ellaOne could potentially be used &quot;off-label&quot; in an attempt to terminate pregnancy. On this basis, no information on the potential use of ulipristal as an abortifacient has been included in the information provided for doctors and women. However, the publicly available risk management plan for ellaOne includes a number of measures taken to minimise the potential risk of off-label use, including a post marketing study to monitor how Ellaone is being used in real-life.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.0/4">When used in accordance with the product information ellaOne is a safe and effective option for emergency contraception. As with all marketed medicines used in the UK, the safety of ellaOne is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent expert advice from the Commission on Human Medicines. In the event of any important new safety information emerging, the MHRA will take action to ensure that this is accurately reflected in the product information and communicated to health professionals and women.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.8/1">In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, the 2010 spending review settlement announced that all current Department of Health social care revenue grants, including the AIDS support grant, will roll into the revenue support grant issued by Department for Communities and Local Government from 2011-12. The revenue support grant is not ring-fenced and councils can spend it as they choose. As part of rolling the AIDS support grant into revenue support grant, the Department considered responses to its summer consultation on the future distribution of three social care grants including the AIDS support grant. Details of the consultation exercise are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.8/3">The allocation basis for the AIDS support funding within revenue support grant will remain case load based, using 2008 data from the Health Protection Agency, for both 2011-12 and 2012-13 allocations. This option minimises the change in funding for local authorities and ensures that the funding is distributed to those areas with the greatest demand for HIV/AIDS services. Details of the allocation of the revenue support grant, including HIV/AIDS allocations are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1272W.8/5">From 2011-12 the HIV capital grant will no longer be a specific capital grant. In 2010-11 the Department of Health issued seven separate capital grants. The Department of Health is maintaining capital funding at 2010-11 levels but will issue only one capital grant in 2011-12 and 2012-13, the capital investment in community capacity grant. The grant is not ring-fenced but is designed to support the three key areas of personalisation, reform and efficiency. This funding will enable continued capital investment to support delivery of adult social care services, including HIV/AIDS services. The capital investment in community capacity grant is distributed using the total adults social care relative needs formula. Details of the capital grant including local authority allocations of this grant are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.3/5">Earlier this year, the Department for Transport consulted on improving the bus journey experience through changes to the conduct regulations, which set out the duties of bus and coach drivers, inspectors and conductors, and passengers. A Government response to this consultation will be published in due course. The issue of driver training and conduct was discussed with bus operators at the July meeting of the Bus Partnership Forum, which I chair, and is on the agenda for the forum's meeting in January. The forum is made up of representatives of the bus industry, passenger transport executives, transport co-ordinating officers, passengers and disability groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1300W.8/1">The Department for Transport does not hold detailed passenger count information for every station stop on individual services between Stevenage and King's Cross. The limited information that the Department holds for average critical loads on peak services arriving into and departing from King's Cross during spring 2010 indicates that trains on this line that stop at Stevenage have not been operating in excess of capacity. However, the information we have is not comprehensive, so it is possible that individual instances of over-crowding may be occurring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated December 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what steps are being taken to maximise the enumeration rate of new migrants resident in the London borough of Newham. 31589</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/5" class="indent">The 2011 Census is building on the valuable experience gained and lessons learned from the 2001 Census by placing greater emphasis on collaboration with local authorities and with many community organisations. ONS is working in partnership with local authorities in a number of ways to maximise the response to the 2011 Census. These include the development of address lists, identifying hard to count populations through local and community intelligence, and promoting the value of the census and the need for completion to all local residents. We have provided the opportunity for local authorities to comment on address lists of communal establishments in their area and Newham Borough Council has contributed fully to this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/6" class="indent">We have appointed two full-time area managers covering Newham who are working closely with the census liaison manager, and the assistant census liaison manager, appointed by the Newham Borough Council. The area managers are making contact with a number of local community organisations representing Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Kosovan, Portuguese, Indian (including Sinhalese and Tamil speakers), Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, Black African, Latin American, and Filipino communities. We also have a number of part-time community advisors working with Black African, Black Caribbean, Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi communities in the Newham area. Posters and leaflets about the census in a variety of languages are being displayed in a number of venues and plans are being made to set up a number of public events to aid those who will need help in completing their questionnaires for any reason.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/7" class="indent">ONS has put a formal framework in place through which all councils can help to determine local priorities and channels of engagement. Local partnership plans identify important local enumeration challenges and provide the opportunity for the ONS local team and local council officials to discuss and determine these local priorities. Councillors from Newham have also been engaged and are being encouraged to be champions of the census in their wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/8" class="indent">Area managers (and local councils if possible) are being asked to encourage those with additional language skills to apply for the field staff roles currently advertised. As part of the recruitment process candidates are asked to include on their application form any language skills they have. This information will be provided to field managers so that they are fully aware of the linguistic skills that they have within their team.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/9" class="indent">A high proportion of the 35,000 field staff has been allocated to areas where it has been hard to obtain responses, particularly inner city areas, areas of high migration and population change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/10" class="indent">The amount of resource directed towards collecting outstanding questionnaires in London is four times greater than that employed in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.8/11" class="indent">I hope you will be reassured by the steps that ONS is taking to enumerate residents in Newham.</p>

In areas without parishes, community groups can put themselves forward to be designated by the local planning authority as the neighbourhood forum for an area. The community group will propose what the neighbourhood area's boundaries should be, but it will be the local planning authorities who will designate neighbourhood areas ensuring coherence and fairness across their areas and that neighbourhood boundaries make sense in planning terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.2/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to you Parliamentary Questions asking what methodology is used to ensure that population figures are accurately predicted in areas with a high level of mobility (31584).</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/5" class="indent">ONS produces subnational population projections using an internationally recognised demographic method. This method provides projections of the estimated population of a local authority district based on assumptions that recent patterns of births, deaths, and migration continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/6" class="indent">These projections are not forecasts. They do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/7" class="indent">The extent to which the subnational population projections accurately reflect the future population of an area thus depends on:</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/8" class="indent">the accuracy of the population estimate used as the base for the projection; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/9" class="indent">the extent to which recent demographic patterns are repeated in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/10" class="indent">Descriptions of the methodologies used in producing the population estimates and the subnational population projections are published at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.2/12" class="indent">The Quality Reports, which assess the population estimates; the sub national population projections; and the international and within UK migration estimates which feed into these, are published on the ONS website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.2/14" class="indent">The Quality Report for the subnational projections notes that the (2008-based) projected figure for 2009 was within 1% of the population estimate for 327 of the 354 local authorities then current in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/15" class="indent">Methods used by the ONS to quality assure the population estimates and projections include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/16" class="indent">scrutiny of input data to remove abnormal values where appropriate;</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/17" class="indent">checks against other data sources and previous demographic patterns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/18" class="indent">consultation with local authorities over migration assumptions used in the projections;</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/19" class="indent">The subnational population projections are also constrained to the national population projections. The assumptions on which the latter are based are agreed in liaison with the devolved administrations following consultations with key users of projections in each UK country and advice from an expert academic advisory panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.2/20" class="indent">Since migration is the most difficult aspect of population change to measure accurately, it is likely that areas with a highly mobile population have a less accurate population projection than areas with a less mobile population.

It carries out qualitative risk assessments and preliminary outbreak assessments to estimate the likelihood of the disease entering the UK and these are published on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330W.7/3">Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December 2010</phrase>, DEFRA published a preliminary outbreak assessment relating to an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in poultry in Japan. This concluded that while there was no additional risk from this particular outbreak, there is a continual low risk of introduction of avian notifiable disease into the UK and EU poultry population through contact with wild birds where the viruses are circulating. The guidance to the poultry industry remains that it is important to maintain biosecurity on poultry premises and reduce the level of contact with wild birds as far as possible, as well as reporting suspicion of disease promptly to the veterinary authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330W.7/4">In August 2009 industry and Government published a Code of Practice for pig keepers relating to influenza in pigs. The code provides clear guidance to pig keepers on the actions they should take to reduce the risk of introduction of influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1, to pig herds and to prevent disease leaving the premises should this occur.</p>

	<p pid="b.1332W.0/2">The UK carries out annual surveys for avian influenza (A1) in poultry and wild birds. The purpose of the poultry survey is to detect Al of subtypes H5 and H7 in different species of poultry. The purpose of the wild bird survey is to detect highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses through sampling of wild birds found dead and investigation of the cause of death of large numbers of birds (&quot;mass mortality events&quot;). In addition, since H5N1 is a notifiable form of A1, specific investigations are also carried out by Animal Health following reports of illness in birds where suspect disease cannot be initially ruled out. No active infection with H5N1 has been detected in poultry or wild birds so far this year, either from surveillance or routine reports of suspect disease. DEFRA also elicits scientific advice from a panel of expert ornithologists (British Trust for Ornithology, Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, and Scottish Natural Heritage among others) about wild bird movements and has done so recently in relation to recent adverse weather conditions.</p>

There are no reported UK infections with this virus in other domestic livestock populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1333W.6/2">DEFRA does not recommend any treatment for animals suspected of carrying tuberculosis (TB). In fact, anti-TB treatment is specifically prohibited in cattle and deer. There are several sound scientific and public health reasons why treatment should not take place in any TB-susceptible animals, including the fact that treatment can mask the reactions to the TB tests in infected animals, thus causing false negative results and also valid concerns around the possible development of antibiotic drug-resistant strains of the bacterium. Because of this, if an animal has been treated for TB, DEFRA and its agencies will need to amend or suspend normal testing procedures to ensure that any infection does not go undetected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1333W.6/3">There are no veterinary drugs licensed in the UK for the treatment of TB in cattle or other mammals. However, under the veterinary medicines cascade system private veterinary surgeons are not prevented from prescribing human medicines to treat TB, though they would need to consider carefully with a camelid owner the practical, public health and veterinary implications of using an unlicensed, untested human medicine in this way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1333W.6/4">It is for those reasons that DEFRA'S advice has been (and continues to be) that any suspect clinical cases of TB in known infected camelid herds should be immediately notified to Animal Health and culled, rather than subject to treatment regimes of questionable efficacy in animals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336W.6/13">Historically, on entering private office, staff had the option to either claim overtime for extra hours worked in excess of conditioned hours or to receive the Private Secretary Allowance. Staff were not allowed to receive both. In more recent years, however, DEFRA's approach has been for staff to claim the allowance rather than overtime. The allowance is an annual allowance and is currently paid at an annual level of: &#163;6,802 for staff at Grade 7 and above; &#163;4,107 for staff at senior executive officer, higher executive officer and fast stream; and &#163;3,474 for staff at other grades.</p>

This identifies how the downstream oil industry and the Government need to respond in an emergency, using one or more emergency response tools to manage any significant disruption. If there is an actual or threatened oil emergency in the UK affecting fuel supplies, emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976 may be used. The NEP-F includes provisions to enable it to ensure the distribution of available fuel in support of critical areas including food supply.</p>

This includes discharges from sewage treatment works and associated sewer systems. In conjunction with the Agency's monitoring programme this ensures that river water quality is protected. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) allow the controlled discharge of dilute sewage mixed with rainwater when combined sewer systems become overwhelmed during periods of heavy rainfall. This prevents sewer flooding in homes and businesses. While some site specific information on the amounts discharged may be available on public registers it is not collated for all sites. However I strongly encourage water companies to make information on CSO spills available to all, where technically possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1342W.9/1">The UK regularly raises the issue of whaling in the Southern Ocean at ministerial and official level with Japan. Most recently, my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Browne) raised the issue on his visit to Japan in September. The Foreign Secretary also raised the matter during his visit to Japan in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342W.9/2">Through the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the recognised global convention for whaling, the UK regularly raises our opposition to so called 'scientific' whaling in Antarctic waters. We fully support continued collaboration between the IWC and Antarctic treaty agreements, such as the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, in addressing areas of concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342W.9/3">We are disappointed at the recent departure of the Japanese whaling fleet. Japan's action undermines the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and international efforts to conserve and protect whales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342W.9/4">Further, the UK has strongly condemned any dangerous activity in the Southern Ocean, from any party, that risks human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea.</p>

	<p pid="b.1343W.2/1">Tackling illegal logging and deforestation is a priority for the coalition Government, and we are in the process of implementing two EU regulations to tackle the trade in illegal timber. The EU FLEGT (forest law enforcement, governance and trade) regulation, which will apply from early 2011, requires timber from countries which have signed a voluntary partnership agreement with the EU to carry a licence to prove that it has been legally harvested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.2/2">This will complement the recently agreed EU illegal timber (due diligence) regulation, which requires operators first placing timber and timber products on the EU market to exercise due diligence to ensure that this timber has been legally harvested. The regulation also includes a prohibition on the first placing of illegal timber on the EU market. I am confident that these measures will help us to eradicate illegal timber from the UK market, and thus support global efforts to tackle illegal logging and deforestation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1344W.0/1">Quarantine requirements for wood and wood products entering Great Britain are prescribed in the Plant Health (Forestry) Order 2005, which transposes EU-wide requirements set out in Council Directive 2000/29/EC. These, with one exception, apply to wood chips and other wood products for biomass in the same way as they do in the case of, for example, sawn wood and logs. The exception is wood in the form of pellets which, due to the manufacturing process, does not pose a risk of transmitting pests. All other consignments of regulated wood and wood products are required to be notified prior to landing and are subjected to plant health inspection by the Forestry Commission before being released by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
