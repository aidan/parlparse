	<p pid="a.1W.6/1">A scheme acceptable to the Department for Social Development on this site has not yet been arrived at. Consultants, employed by the Department, are currently evaluating and appraising options for the site and consequently it is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the cost of the eventual scheme. Given the size and complexity of the site, indicative estimates at this stage would suggest the total cost could be up to &pound;180 million. The design and build costs for the scheme will be met by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.6/2">So far the Department has committed to spending &pound;175,000 on consultancy in relation to a full retail capacity analysis, a transport analysis, economic appraisal and urban design analyses of the options for the site.

	<p pid="a.1W.9/1">The Department for Social Development (DSD) were approached by North Down borough council, seeking support for a development scheme at Queen's Parade in Bangor town centre. The proposed scheme related to a mixed use development on land assembled by North Down borough council, but which was also likely to require the vesting of some additional land and properties to complete the site assembly. The scheme was designed by Karl Greenfarm Ltd., a consortium appointed by the council as their preferred developer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.9/2">In October 2005, following some due diligence work, DSD announced that it was unable to support the scheme as then constituted, but agreed to work with the developer and the council to explore alternative options and to seek to resolve outstanding issues. Planning permission for this scheme was also subsequently refused by the Planning Service in the Department of the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.9/3">In September 2006, following a public consultation to examine some alternative proposals, DSD agreed to appoint specialist consultants to carry out a full retail capacity analysis, a transport analysis, economic appraisal, legal appraisal and urban design analyses of the options for the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.9/4">It would be premature to pre-empt the outcome of the work currently being undertaken by the Department's consultants but the report will be published later in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.4W.8/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) was asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to these questions. A copy of his reply, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase>, is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/2">This matter is now the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/3" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/4" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland two Parliamentary Questions regarding:</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/5" class="indent">1. which public consultations the Roads Service of Northern Ireland and the Department of the Environment has conducted in the past 12 months on the location of new zebra and pelican crossings; what the time period was of such consultation; what steps were taken to ensure that nearby individuals and businesses were invited to participate in the consultation; and if he will make a statement; and</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/6" class="indent">2. if he will place in the Library a copy of the document setting out the criteria used to determine the location of zebra and pelican crossings in Northern Ireland; what the requirements are for the minimum distance from which such crossings must be visible to oncoming motorists; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/7" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of the Department for Regional Development's Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/8" class="indent">I should explain that Roads Service's policy in relation to pedestrian crossings is to provide such facilities where there is an identifiable need and where the conditions at any potential site make it difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. An integral part of the process is an assessment of the 'demand' and 'difficulty' of crossing the road at the location concerned. The initial part of our assessment process uses the number of pedestrians (the initial demand factor) and the volume of traffic (the initial difficulty factor) to give an indication of the potential 'conflict' at a site. The assessment of the need for a crossing is then supplemented using a scorecard, which assigns scores to various other 'demand' and 'difficulty' factors, including collision history at the site. This policy is designed to assess the need and to prioritise locations &quot;where pedestrians encounter difficulties in crossing the road due to the high volumes of vehicular traffic. This is applied consistently and impartially when assessing all requests in Northern Ireland, so that available funding can be directed at those sites with the greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/9" class="indent">Attached for information is a copy of our public information leaflet on Controlled Pedestrian Crossings (a copy will be placed in the House of Commons Library).</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/10" class="indent">There is no statutory requirement for Roads Service to formerly consult on proposals to construct traffic management features such as pedestrian crossings. However, our policy is to carry out informal consultations with the police and frontages along the length of road affected by any proposal. There is no set period for this consultation. The list at Appendix 1 details the locations of proposed zebra and pelican pedestrian crossings where consultations were carried out in 2006/07 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.4W.8/11" class="indent">The requirements for the minimum distance from which all types of crossings must be visible to oncoming motorists depends on the approach speed of vehicles in the vicinity of a proposed crossings and are detailed below.</p>

	<p pid="a.6W.4/1">DFID is promoting sustainable forestry in Africa, with a commitment of over &pound;70 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.4/2">&pound;50 million was recently committed to initiate a Congo Basin Forest Trust Fund. &pound;11.5 million is being provided by DFID over the next three years to Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). DFID has also committed &pound;12 million over the next four years to support African countries under the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. Ghana, with DFID assistance, is in formal FLEGT negotiations with the EU, the first country in Africa to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.4/3">DFID works closely with the private sector and NGOs. For example, a &quot;Tree Aid&quot; initiative in Burkina Faso will soon be supported by the DFID Civil Society Challenge Fund. DFID is supporting NGOs in Uganda to monitor forest sector governance. NGOs are also participating in the DFID-funded 'Democratic Republic of Congo Roundtable', together with the World Bank. This is generating alternatives to industrial logging, including new forest management and financing systems. DFID funds an NGO piloting participatory forest mapping and zoning work in DRC which will help inform the design of alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.4/4">DFID also supports the Rights and Resource Initiative, an international consortium including NGOs, which facilitates pro-poor forest policy, tenure and market reforms in Africa.</p>

We will then more than double funding again to &pound;200 million a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.7/2">DFID works at various levels. DFID:</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.7/3">helps African governments to implement their own plans to increase access to clean water and sanitation, and provides direct financing to projects and technical know-how. Examples include our partnership with UNICEF in Nigeria, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. In Ghana DFID delivers increased access to water and sanitation through support to German, Danish and Dutch governments' programmes. DFID also provides indirect support to increased water and sanitation through projects such as the Girls Education Programme in Nigeria. DFID is currently developing a &pound;100 million programme of support to water and sanitation In Ethiopia and a &pound;35 million programme in Sierra Leone;</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.7/4">supports African organisations to be more effective, DFID is providing &pound;6 million of technical assistance to support implementation of the African Development Bank's ambitious Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative;</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.7/5">takes action at the international level. DFID's &quot;Call for Global Action&quot; on water and sanitation, with one annual report, one high level global meeting, one national plan, one coordination group and one UN lead body will ultimately lead to more effective and efficient delivery of water and sanitation projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.7/6">Further details of DFID's support for access to water and sanitation can be found in the report &quot;Financial Support to the Water Sector 2004-06&quot;, and in the brochure &quot;Meeting our Promises&quot; and the &quot;Fighting Poverty and Managing Water Goes Hand in Hand&quot; leaflet.

	<p pid="a.8W.5/1">DFID has a long history of working with the UK Transport Research Laboratory on issues relating to global road safety. Early research helped bring the magnitude of the problem to the attention of policy makers. DFID supported research included the publication of the widely used Towards safer roads in developing countries'. This work continues through DFID research department funding of the global Transport Knowledge Partnership to conduct new research and disseminate best practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.5/2">DFID also funds transport and road safety research at the World Bank through the Trisp programme&mdash;Transport and Rural Infrastructure Services Learning and Sharing Partnership, which has included work on road safety.</p>

	<p pid="a.9W.2/1">DFID provides core funds to the World Health Organisation, which holds the international responsibility for health data generally and also coordinates the UN response on road safety. The recent publication from the WHO &quot;Youth and Road Safety&quot; noted that road traffic injuries are the number one cause of death for young people between 10 and 24.</p>
	<p pid="a.9W.2/2">DFID draws on the &quot;World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention&quot;, released in 2004 by the WHO and the World Bank, as the most influential, and still current, assessment of global road safety. The UK Department for Transport helped fund this publication. This highlights the serious development challenge presented by road accidents. The headline conclusion from this report was that annually 1.2 million people die on the world's roads and 90 per cent. of these are in low and middle income countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.10W.0/13">These contributions have all been to global and regional initiatives specifically on road safety, and do not reflect any contributions under transport in country programmes. The specific instruments DFID supports, such as the Global Road Safety Partnership and the sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Programme, seek to provide knowledge on road safety to ministries and agencies in partner countries. Some share of transport sector bilateral expenditure will be allocated to road safety, however this is not coded separately for financial reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.0/14">Additionally, DFID was pleased to provide financial support to the recent Africa Road Safety Conference where ministers of transport and health from across Africa agreed to halve the rate of road traffic accidents by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.10W.3/1">DFID places importance on assisting developing countries and donors collectively, to pay due attention to road safety and promoting best practice, by stressing integration of road safety into countries' own transport policies and planning, including guidelines for road building. To support this, DFID funds catalytic initiatives such as the Global Transport Knowledge Partnership, the Global Road Safety Partnership, and the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy programme which advises countries on transport policy including road safety guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.3/2">The DFID collaborative programme with the World Bank includes promoting transport and social responsibility, including road safety, in the World Bank's transport portfolio. This has been very successful with good recognition of the importance of road safety in a recent World Bank's transport sector review, and attention to road safety in the new World Bank transport sector plan: &quot;Safe, Clean and Affordable Transport&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.10W.6/1">The UK has worked hard to support and improve the design of the ending child hunger and under-nutrition initiative (ECHUI) through its close relationships with UNICEF and the world food programme (WFP).</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.6/2">In particular we have encouraged a stronger emphasis on country ownership, involvement of all key partners and better coordination with existing initiatives in the field of hunger and nutrition. Over time the initiative has rightly strengthened its focus on advocacy&mdash;to encourage efforts by host governments to direct their national policies to target child hunger and under nutrition.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.6/3">The initiative is a global, regional and country level coordination mechanism, so funding will largely come from existing budgets. In 2006, DFID was thesecond largest donor to UNICEF providing &pound;105 million and the fifth largest donor to the WFP providing &pound;56 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.12W.5/13">In addition to this, DFID contributions to multilateral institutions, including the World Bank and the EC, include expenditure in the road sector. Annual UK multilateral contributions for productive infrastructure, which includes transport, amounts to around &pound;140 million (2004 figures). Finally, in countries where DFID provides general budget support, a significant amount of the public spending in those countries will be on the transport sector. For example, the share of DFID budget support attributed to transport sector is 9 per cent. in Tanzania and 16 per cent. in Mozambique.</p>
	<p pid="a.12W.5/14">Although transport projects are predominantly in the road sector they involve activities much broader than road building. For example, DFID funding has strengthened road fund administrations in Ethiopia and Mozambique, to ensure that roads are better maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.17W.8/1">Before scheduling the roadworks between junctions 4 and 5 of the M1, a detailed analysis of the traffic impact of these works was carried out. The analysis predicted minimal queuing and no significant queuing has been noted so far during the works.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.8/2">The analysis took into account the fact that the two sets of works were about 13 kilometres apart: standard roadworks guidance recommends that there is a 10 kilometre gap between different sets of traffic management to minimise delays to road users. In addition, traffic levels between junctions 4 and 5 on the M1 are comparatively low at just over half those experienced on the M1 north of the M25.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.8/3">The works between junctions 4 and 5 aim to rectify a safety issue as a number of fatal and injury accidents have been attributed to standing water at this location. That being so and sine the traffic analysis predicted minimal queuing, the conclusion was to carry out the work now rather than waiting until the end of 2008 when the major widening scheme is expected to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.8/4">A number of steps have been taken to minimise delays to road users on the M1. Work is being carried out 24/7 to complete the scheme quickly and any lane closures required are being carried out when traffic levels are low. In addition the speed limit through the M1 widening scheme between junction 8 and 10 has recently been increased from 40 mph to 50 mph.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.2/1">There are currently no cetaceans being kept in captivity in the UK, and other than for purposes of rehabilitation, there have not been any kept since the early 1990s. While it is not illegal to keep cetaceans in this country, the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 (as amended) aims to ensure that, should cetaceans be kept at an establishment for exhibition to the public, the establishment is licensed and the animals kept in accordance with strict standards relating to their health and welfare requirements. Those standards are set out in the Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice and its supplement on the keeping of cetaceans in captivity. In addition to the requirements of the Zoo Licensing Act, all animals kept in captivity are subject to protection under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.5/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is providing technical and financial support to retailers to help identify ways of reducing the weight of primary packaging, mainly through research and development and innovative packaging design. WRAP is also conducting research to establish public attitudes towards Easter egg, and other confectionary, packaging.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/2">There are already examples of some supermarkets that have successfully minimised the packaging on their own brand Easter eggs while still increasing sales. My Department will continue to engage with retailers and the food industry to reduce the amount of packaging waste generated by the industry itself and by consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/3">The requirements of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2003 (as amended) apply to all packaging and a system already exists to fine businesses for using excess packaging.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/4">The Essential Requirements Regulations require that all packaging placed on the market in the UK should be manufactured so that volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain necessary levels of safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance for the packed product. These regulations are enforced by Trading Standards officers and a number of companies have already been prosecuted for using excess packaging.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/5">The Packaging Regulations have led to decreases in packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging and packaging waste generated. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and recommend ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/6">WRAP is currently working with retailers through the 'Courtauld Commitment', a voluntary agreement which aims to halt packaging growth by 2008 and make absolute reductions in packaging waste by 2010. 13 major retailers, representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector, have already signed the agreement as well as three major brands.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/7">Each retailer signed up to the Commitment has been developing its own programme of work with WRAP to reduce packaging and packaging waste. A number of retailers have now made announcements setting their own specific performance targets on waste and other environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.5/8">Several food and drink brands and manufacturers, including some confectionary manufacturers, have now also signed up to the Courtauld Commitment. WRAP will shortly be announcing further details.</p>

However, in these cases, there is a clear need to balance economic and social imperatives of continued port operations with any environmental impact.</p>

In these cases, British Waterways takes a risk-based approach to prioritising repairs. Other factors may also be taken into account, such as the need for specialist plant and machinery to be brought to a remote site, or permission from third parties for access.</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.5/1">The Government have already introduced two sets of regulations to encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise, recycle and recover packaging and reduce packaging waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.5/2">The packaging regulations have helped to reduce the amount of packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging and packaging waste being generated in the first place. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and recommend ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.5/3">My Department continues to engage with retailers and the food industry to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste generated by the industry itself and by consumers. In particular, DEFRA's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), published in April 2006, challenges the food manufacturing sector to reduce its own waste by 15-20 per cent. by 2010. 13 major grocery retailers (representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector) have also signed up to the 'Courtauld Commitment', agreeing to work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in order to:</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.5/9">WRAP also provides technical and financial support to retailers and suppliers through an Innovation Fund.

	<p pid="a.46W.2/1">In 2004, 2005 and 2006, 6.2, 6.0 and 5.6 million tonnes of paper were produced in the UK respectively. In the same three years, the UK used 4.6, 4.5 and 4.2 million tonnes of recovered paper<sup>(1)</sup>.

	<p pid="a.46W.2/3">WRAP has recently published a report on developing the opportunities for recycling paper mill sludge into new products. &quot;A new approach to paper mill sludge&quot; is available from WRAP's website.

	<p pid="a.52W.0/1">The document &quot;From Here to Sustainability: The Learning and Skills Council's Strategy for Sustainable Development&quot;, requires the LSC, FE colleges and other providers to take action in four key areas: positioning the sector (leadership and management); buildings and estates; curriculum (teaching and learning); and community and business. Progress is monitored by the Sustainable Development Implementation and Delivery Group, which involves college principals, sustainable development specialists, higher education representatives and national and regional bodies including Ofsted, a regional development agency and a sector skills council.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.0/2">Examples of progress to date include: capital proposals from colleges now have to address sustainable development and ensure that they meet the criteria for excellent Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) ratings. An online set of resources designed to support providers on each of the four themes of the strategy will be launched by the LSC in autumn 2007. Research evidence shows that over half the providers responding to an independent study had a policy for sustainable development and many more are carrying out audits of resource use. The same study showed that 70 per cent. of respondents have embedded sustainable development into their teaching and learning programmes. The LSC is working with partners such as sector skills councils to ensure that sustainable development is embedded in the processes that determine the content of the curriculum, and the training and development of college staff. Approximately three-quarters of providers in the independent study had programmes for learner volunteering in place. Respondents had also developed networks to promote sustainable development and were sharing facilities with local groups. The LSC sponsored Green Gown Awards celebrate and share the best examples of leadership and progress in environmental sustainability.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.5/1">The term 'whole-time equivalent' (WTE) refers to the number of full-time staff equating to the amount of 'trust protected time' that the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (DMETA) contracts to provide to an NHS trust. 'Trust protected time', for which the trust is charged, is expressed as a percentage of the annual activity of the individual service personnel who are posted to the trust. The rest of the individual's time is designated as 'military protected time' (for which the trust does not pay) and may be used on operational deployments or training.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.5/2">The WTE numbers given as follows are therefore much lower than the numbers of military medical personnel actually employed by the trusts concerned. The numbers reflect the current contractual position (which in some cases is subject to further consideration and negotiation). For example, over 120 military medical personnel are employed, in a wide range of roles, by the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust which hosts the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. But the total number of WTE provided under contract to that trust is 20, including only one nursing WTE provided for the military managed ward at Selly Oak (although 26 military medical personnel are currently assigned there and the number is being increased).</p>

This includes a number of security sector reform projects which are aimed at supporting and hastening the Iraqi Government's ability to build the capability of the Iraqi security forces. This has involved the gifting of vehicles infrastructure and other equipment. Gifting packages have been awarded in phases through project Osiris, with parliamentary approval being sought via a series of Minutes laid before Parliament. The quantities distributed in the Multi-National Division (South East) before October 2005, are set out as follows.</p>

No decisions have yet been taken on whether the R1 platform will carry the replacement for the current mission system, and whether the R1 fleet will be refurbished. The air-to-air refuelling system on MRA4 is an almost entirely new design and built with only a small number of components retained from MR2 which will be re-furbished. Jacketed fuel pipes will be used selectively where it is judged to be necessary and all its fuel pipes will be newly manufactured.</p>

In December 2006, the Government announced in the White Paper, &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994), that the UK will be reducing further the number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160. This means that, since the end of the Cold War, we will have reduced the explosive power of our nuclear weapon stockpile by over 75 per cent. and we now have less than one per cent. of the total global stockpile. These reductions contribute to meeting our commitment to achieving the general and complete disarmament objectives of Article VI of the Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty.</p>

	<p pid="a.70W.3/1">Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been thoroughly examined on numerous occasions over the past few years, including by the Home Affairs Select Committee in April 2005. The effectiveness of the Government's antisocial behaviour policies has been assessed in two key independent reports published last year, by the National Audit Office and by the Youth Justice Board. Both confirmed that our twin track approach of support and enforcement is effective in protecting communities from antisocial behaviour. This is bringing results&mdash;nationally, the percentage of people who perceive high levels of antisocial behaviour has fallen from 21 per cent. in 2002-03 to 17 per cent. in 2005-06. We are due to commission an evaluation of various interventions (including ASBOs) designed to tackle antisocial behaviour. This proposed research is likely to explore what impact these interventions can have on tackling antisocial behaviour problems.</p>

The Home Office has a continuing programme of research on the impact of neighbourhood policing, and the contribution made by PCSOs.</p>

This is because data on the results of fixed penalty notices are usually published a year behind due to time delays in forces receiving final information on outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.5/3">2004 data will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.5/4">Under the Road Traffic Act 1991, Decriminalised Parking Enforcement (DPE) powers allow local authorities to take over responsibility for enforcing parking contraventions from the police. 2004 data on Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) from individual local authorities operating Decriminalised Parking Enforcement are given in table B.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.5/5">In addition information from the Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform shows that in England and Wales in 2005, of the 146,481 PNDs issued, 62,179 were registered as fines by the courts as a result of non payment of the penalty, within the 21 day suspended enforcement period. This represents 42 per cent. of the total number of PNDs issued during that year; 53 per cent. of the penalties issued were paid and 1 per cent. of recipients elected to have their cases heard in court. Of the 1,721 issued in Gloucestershire police force area 778 were fine registered, representing 45 per cent. of the total number of PNDs issued in that area. 52 per cent. of the penalties issued in Gloucestershire were paid and 2 per cent. of recipients elected to have their cases heard in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.5/6">Information on the outcomes of PNDs issued in 2006 will be available in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.5/7">The information given above is specific to the Home Department and does not cover fixed penalty notices issued by other Government Departments and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.2/1">The Immigration Act 1971 gives Immigration Officers the power to refer people who are subject to immigration control and who are seeking entry to the United Kingdom to a medical inspector for a medical examination. The Immigration Officer may take the findings of the medical examination into account when deciding whether to admit the person to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/2">The long-standing policy of successive Governments is that people who come from countries with a high prevalence of TB (over 40 cases of TB per 100,000 population) and who are seeking to enter the UK for more than six months, or are port asylum claimants, are routinely referred for a medical examination, which includes tuberculosis screening, on arrival at major UK ports. In addition, Immigration Officers are required to refer for medical examination anyone who appears ill, or who mentions health or illness as a reason for coming to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/3">As stated in our recently published strategy to ensure and enforce compliance with our immigration laws, the Government have started requiring residents of some countries to have a certificate proving they are free from infectious tuberculosis before applying for a visa. Those found to have infectious TB are required to complete treatment before entry clearance to the UK is granted. This programme has so far been rolled out to cover residents of 11 countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania and Thailand).</p>

That is why we are taking forward the Women's Offending Reduction programme which focuses on improving community based services and interventions to support greater use of community sentences wherever possible. This includes the &pound;9.15 million we are investing in new initiatives to demonstrate how an integrated multi-agency approach in the community can be more effective at tackling the multiple needs of women offenders and avoid the use of custody. We are also looking carefully at the recommendations made by Baroness Corston in her report on &quot;Women with Particular Vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System&quot;, which suggests further action that could be taken to prevent women with vulnerabilities ending up in prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.93W.5/2">In a full year it is expected that the surcharge on fines will raise &pound;16 million. It is estimated that about 70 per cent. of this will come from fines on motoring offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.5/3">Money from the surcharge will be spent on a range of services for victims of crime and witnesses. These include &pound;3 million for witness care units, &pound;3 million for independent domestic violence advisers, and &pound;8 million for other support services for victims, the details of which will be announced in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.5/4">Another &pound;2 million is being allocated to the Victims Fund. Money from the fund is being allocated in two phases. Under the first phase, &pound;1&amp;frac14; million will be allocated to voluntary organisations helping victims of sexual violence. Applications for funding are currently being considered, and an announcement about which organisations the money has been allocated to will be made as soon as possible. Under the second phase, the other &pound;&amp;frac34; million will be allocated to organisations helping victims of other types of crime. We will make an announcement about eligibility and how to apply in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.5/5">A proportion of this money will be allocated for organisations helping victims of road traffic incidents. We cannot give further details at this time, but will make further information available as soon as we can.</p>

	<p pid="a.109W.3/1">The North West Development Agency (NWDA) has not given any direct funding to the Royal Lancashire Agricultural Society. However, the NWDA made a financial contribution to the Royal Lancashire Show in 2003-04 through the Rural Development Programme of the Lancashire Rural Recovery Partnership. The programme provided a grant of &pound;32,578 towards marketing costs for the Show; the staging of a Lancashire produce event; and supporting elements of additional infrastructure. Since then the NWDA has provided &pound;1,255,000 to the Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board (LBTB) for the year 2006-07. From this, the Tourist Board granted &pound;3,000 towards the staging of the 2006 Royal Lancashire Show, on the grounds that the Show would serve to raise the profile of the LBTB and the Lancashire Rural Tourism Initiative. The NWDA's Strategy for Tourism in England's North West identifies the Show as one of a number of events of national and international significance that take place across the region. The Show has also been identified for support in the Lancashire and Blackpool Visitor Economy Strategy 2006-16, because of its potential for further development of the visitor economy. Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board has delegated authority to invest in those projects which it believes will raise its profile. The Royal Lancashire Agricultural Society agreed to publicise Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board by promoting their logo and mentioning the Tourist Board in press releases. No funding was granted, indirectly or directly, to the Royal Lancashire Society prior to 2003.</p>

We are particularly worried about political prisoners such as Dr. Biscet who are reported to be suffering poor health, yet are not provided with adequate medical treatment. The UK considers Dr. Biscet's imprisonment to be a violation of his civil and political freedoms. At the time of Dr. Biscet's detention, the UK and EU condemned these violations and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.2/2">The UK, along with our EU partners, is committed to seeking improvements in civil and political freedoms in Cuba. We regularly raise the situation of political prisoners in Cuba with the Cuban authorities both in London and Havana and call for their immediate release. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April 2007</phrase>, the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Mr. McCartney) expressed concern about political prisoners and other human rights issues during a meeting with Cuban Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade, Antonio Carricarte.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.2/3">In addition, our embassy in Havana continues to monitor Dr. Biscet's case and maintains contact with his supporters and family. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-10">10 December 2006</phrase>, officials from our embassy met with Dr. Biscet's wife, Elsa Morejon.

	<p pid="a.122W.3/1">I am advised by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February</phrase> a fire broke out at the Sonae factory at around 13.37 hours in the thermal oil room on the ground floor. The two nearest fire appliances were mobilised and were at the scene within six minutes. In the next five minutes, an initial risk assessment was made by the Officer in Charge and a further two fire appliances and a foam unit were requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/2">Prior to the arrival of MFRS, the Works Firefighting Team had set up their own fire appliance and had deployed a line of hose and a number of portable fire extinguishers. After the Works Team and their equipment had been safely removed, the initial attack from MFRS commenced at 13.57 hours. This involved a ground monitor and a line of delivery hose, which combined to cool the surrounding structure and hot gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/3">A further assessment then resulted in a request being made for four more fire appliances (total of eight) and an aerial appliance. The foam unit arrived at the scene around 14.20 hours and the initial foam attack commenced soon after this.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/4">At its peak, the incident required two foam branches, two water branches and a high pressure hose reel jet. A total of 10 fire appliances were in attendance at this peak. The fire had been extinguished and crews were involved in damping down operations by 15.20 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/5">After the operations had been scaled down, two fire appliances remained in attendance until the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/6">The incident is currently the subject of an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.3/7">On the basis of the above information I see no evidence that the response by MFRS was not adequate or competent. The risk assessment which determined that a foam unit was required was made within five minutes of the first appliance's arrival at the incident, which itself was within six minutes of having been mobilised. MFRS has two foam tenders, stationed north and south of the river in accordance with the Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP).</p>

	<p pid="a.123W.2/1">I am advised by Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February</phrase> a fire broke out at the Sonae factory at around 13:37 hours in the thermal oil room on the ground floor. The two nearest fire appliances were mobilised and were at the scene within six minutes. In the next five minutes, an initial risk assessment was made by the Officer in Charge and a further two fire appliances and a foam unit were requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/2">Prior to the arrival of MFRS, the Works Firefighting Team had set up their own fire appliance and had deployed a line of hose and a number of portable fire extinguishers. After the Works Team and their equipment had been safely removed, the initial attack from MFRS commenced at 13:57 hours. This involved a ground monitor and a line of delivery hose, which combined to cool the surrounding structure and hot gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/3">A further assessment then resulted in a request being made for four more fire appliances (total of eight) and an aerial appliance. The foam unit arrived at the scene around 14:20 hours and the initial foam attack commenced soon after this.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/4">At its peak, the incident required two foam branches, two water branches and a high pressure hose reel jet. A total of 10 fire appliances were in attendance at this peak. The fire had been extinguished and crews were involved in damping down operations by 15:20 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/5">After the operations had been scaled down, two fire appliances remained in attendance until the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/6">The incident is currently the subject of an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.3/2">Data are not held centrally for those patients who were not urgently referred by their general practitioner (GP) for suspected cancer. For the most recently available period (October to December 2006) published data show that of all patients treated 39.7 per cent. were referred urgently for suspected cancer by their GP, and 60.3 per cent. were referred from another source, or routinely referred (this will include referrals from NHS screening services).</p>

For breast screening during the year 2004-05 statistics show that 71,363 women were referred for an assessment by a local breast screening service. Of these patients 11,966 were subsequently diagnosed with cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.3/4">For cervical screening, during the year 2005-06 (the most recently available) information held by the Department indicates that 129,207 women were referred for a colposcopy examination by a local cervical screening service.

National health service organisations have been working on planning for this phase of recruitment to specialty training for the past six months and trusts have managed detailed planning at local level to ensure that there is appropriate cover and that patient services are not compromised.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.2/3">We are committed to ensuring NHS trusts have adequate staff cover to enable them to provide high quality services to patients at all times.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.5/1">Ketamine is used in medical and veterinary practice as an anaesthetic. Between 1997 and 2003 there were increasing reports of ketamine misuse, particularly in nightclubs. Consuming ketamine has the effect of detaching users from reality and therefore unable to maintain personal safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) investigated the status of ketamine and produced a report in 2003. This report recommended that ketamine be controlled by Misuse of Drugs Act and was referred to the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs. The MHRA is not aware of any particular incidents involving ketamine in Gloucestershire or the Forest of Dean.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.5/3">Ketamine was classified as a class C controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 from January 2006 and is the responsibility of the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.8/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) and predecessor organisations have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs), including the adequacy of their practice premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.8/2">Since 1997, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in investment in GP premises. Part of this was through the NHS Plan targets to refurbish or replace up to 3,000 GP premises and create 500 primary care centres. These targets were achieved through the replacement or refurbishment of 2,848 GP premises and 510 primary care centres. An extended target of 625 primary care centres by December 2006 was met with 674 created and we expect to have 750 by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.8/3">In addition, there are many examples of new premises provided under the NHS local finance investment trust initiative (NHS LIFT) that fully satisfy minimum standards. The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success. Already a capital investment of over &pound;1.2 billion has resulted in 120 LIFT buildings open to patients with another 73 under construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.8/4">A subjective assessment by PCTs of the proportion of premises meeting the minimum standards as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> has been placed in the Library and is the last year that this data was collected. This 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that some GP premises across the country collectively were judged as being below minimum standards. However, this needs to be set in context.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.8/5">Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous condition. Rather, that the premises may judged by PCTs as not having for example, full and adequate access to and within premises for disabled people. How individual PCTs make this judgment can result in variations in the percentage of premises deemed in not satisfying minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.8/6">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs practices and their PCTs to provide modern facilities but because, for example, the building is too small to incorporate changes with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop new premises. These are historic problems particularly and modernisation of GP premises on this scale required in 1997 inevitably take time to achieve but the good progress made will continue.</p>

	<p pid="a.141W.0/21">Each campaign is only one of a number of interventions in the drive to improve public health. It is not possible to separate the impact of these campaigns from that of other interventions or factors which may have influenced public behaviour over the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/22" class="italic"> Antibiotics</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/23">As a result of an increase in the number of strains of bacteria developing resistance the Department launched a publicity campaign, aimed at health professionals and the general public, in 1999-2000 to encourage sensible prescribing and use of antibiotics.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/24">The ongoing publicity campaigns inform the public not to routinely expect antibiotics for coughs and colds as antibiotics only work on bacterial infections, and not on most coughs and colds or viral infections. As well as posters and leaflets we also provided general practitioners (GPs) with pads of non-prescription forms that could be given to patients explaining why the doctor was not prescribing an antibiotic.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/25">Evaluations have shown that the public has understood the key messages and we believe that they will have contributed to the decrease in antibiotic prescribing in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/26" class="italic"> Calm</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/27">The suicide rate in young men is conning down but we do not have direct evidence of the effect or influence of the Calm campaign on that reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/28">This Departmental campaign came to and end on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> Calm became a charity, not sponsored by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/29" class="italic"> Drugs</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/30">The FRANK drugs information campaign funded jointly by the Department, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills targets young people aged 11 to 21 years, particularly vulnerable young people, and the parents or carers of 11-18 year olds. It provides a gateway for information and advice about the effects and risks of drugs, local treatment services and drugs and the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/31">The campaign contributes towards the Department's public service agreement (PSA) target to increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 100 per cent. by 2008 (from 1998) and increase year-on-year the proportion of users successfully sustaining or completing treatment programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/32">The PSA target was exceeded in 2005-06 with 181,390 users going in to treatment. The FRANK campaign is now placing particular emphasis on meeting the needs of vulnerable young people as well as supporting a wider programme of activity in support of the joint Department for Education and Skills and Home Office target to reduce the numbers of young people using drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/33">In the two years to April 2006 the &quot;talktofrank&quot; campaign website received over 10 million hits with 500,000 hits to its treatment pages. Over the same period the FRANK helpline received 1.6 million calls and answered 107,000 emails. The helpline has directed over 45,000 young people to treatment services.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/34" class="italic"> Flu</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/35">The seasonal influenza campaign in the United Kingdom has made considerable progress in increasing the coverage of the at-risk and target population, set against the WHO 2010 target of 75 per cent. The UK has already achieved this target and among European countries is one of the highest achievers.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/36" class="italic"> Hepatitis C awareness campaign (FaCe It)</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/37">One of the main aims of the hepatitis C awareness campaign (FaCe It) is to increase diagnosis and there are two national outcome indicators, drawn from epidemiological surveillance by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), intended to track this.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/38">The first indicator is the total number of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C infection reports. There has been a significant increase in hepatitis C diagnoses in England reported to the HPA through national surveillance from around 5,600 in 2002 to around 7,600 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/39">The second indicator is the proportion of injecting drug users attending treatment and support agencies who are aware of their hepatitis C infection. The proportion of those who are aware of their hepatitis C infection has increased from 42 per cent. in 2002 to 52 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/40">Research into awareness among general practitioners/practices nurses and the public indicates that awareness of hepatitis C has increased since the campaign began.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/41" class="italic"> Immunisation programme</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/42">The routine immunisation programme in the United Kingdom aims to protect all babies and children from the age of two months onwards. The serious diseases that the programme protects against include&mdash;diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio, meningitis C, pneumococcal infection, measles, mumps, rubella.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/43">The impact of advertising and other communication materials are regularly monitored through public surveys involving around 2,000 parents each year. From this we know that more than 70 per cent. of parents use our printed material and that recall of television advertising is high. Health professionals have a high awareness of, and positive reactions to the Departmental/immunisation information materials available.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/44" class="italic"> Mind Out for mental health</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/45">In March 2001, the Department launched a national campaign, mind out for mental health, aimed at tackling the stigma and discrimination faced by people with mental health problems. The campaign was aimed at key groups such as employers, the media and young people; as well as the public in general, to help raise awareness of mental health issues and put an end to stigma and discrimination. This campaign came to an end on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. We believe the campaign has been a positive presence but do not have direct evidence of any impact on health indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/46" class="italic"> Teenage pregnancy</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/47">Work around reducing teenage pregnancy is based on a number of different strands, one of which is the national campaigning work. It is therefore impossible to separate out these strands when it comes to assessing the overall effectiveness of the work. Teenage pregnancy rates are falling. Between the 1998 baseline year and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate has fallen by 15.2 per cent. Both rates are now at their lowest level for 20 years,.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/48" class="italic"> Sexual Health</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/49">Evaluation of the sex lottery campaign December 2002 to December 2004, focused primarily on campaign recognition, perceptions about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and condom usage.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/50">In terms of awareness of advertising re STIs, non promoted awareness increased from 35 per cent. at the start to 53 per cent. by the end of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/51">In addition there were some significant shifts in attitudes to STIs throughout the life of the campaign in particular in terms of potential risk (The risk of getting an STI has increased by 11 per cent.) and in terms of protection (It doesn't matter how many partners someone has as long as they're careful i.e. use a condom has increased by 9 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/52">These changes in attitude are being built on as part of the new adult sexual health campaign, Condom Essential Wear, which was launched in November 2006. Based on social marketing principles the new campaign aims to bring about positive behavioural change in regards sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/53">Behavioural change takes time and will therefore need to be measured over a number of years. Attitudes and behavioural indicators were benchmarked in November 2006 and the fieldwork for the first phase of campaign evaluation is due to commence in early March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/54" class="italic"> Smoking</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/55">A comprehensive strategy to tackle smoking and to reduce the deaths caused by smoking has been in place since publication of Smoking Kills in 1998. The strategy focuses on action to discourage people from starting to smoke and to provide support for all smokers, of whatever age and sex, who wish to quit. We are aiming to create a climate where non-smoking is the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/56">We have banned almost all tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion; introduced strong tobacco pack health warnings; from December 1999 run highly effective national anti-smoking education campaigns raising awareness of the health damage of smoking and secondhand smoke. People who wish to give up smoking can get help from the national health service stop smoking&mdash;a world leading programme we set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/57">In 2006, Parliament passed the Health Act which includes provision for the prohibition of smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces. This will mean every pub, club, membership club, cafe, restaurant, shopping centre, office and public and work transport will become smoke-free on <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 1 July 2007</phrase>, when the legislation is implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/58">The Government's strategy has helped reduce smoking rates in England from 28 per cent. in 1998 to 24 per cent. in terms of 2005 populations, the latest year for which figures are available, meaning around 1.6 million fewer smokers in England. These are the lowest smoking rates in England on record and indicate that the Government are on track to meet the PSA target of 21 per cent. or lower smoking prevalence in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/59" class="italic"> Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/60">In March 2002, the Department launched a national TB Awareness campaign aimed at tackling the stigma and discrimination faced by people with TB. The campaign was launched by celebrities John Fashanu and Patti Boulaye and was aimed at key groups such as Black and Minority Ethnic groups, health professionals, the media; as well as the public in general, to help raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of TB and put an end to stigma and discrimination. Awareness raising for TB is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/61">We believe the campaign has been a positive presence but do not have direct evidence of any impact on health indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/62" class="italic"> 5 A DAY</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/63">The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs annual Household Expenditure Survey for 2005-06 (published January 2007) recorded the biggest increase in fruit and vegetables purchases (7.7 per cent.) for over 20 years. This was aligned to a 6 per cent. decrease in confectionary sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.141W.0/64">The Food Standards Agency Consumer Attitudes Survey 2005 showed that 67 per cent. of people are now aware that they should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, up from 43 per cent. in 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.3/1">The homeopathic hospitals in the United Kingdom fall under the jurisdiction of the national health service in the area in which they are based. Any decisions on the services any of these hospitals provide are the responsibility of those NHS healthcare organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.3/2">The Government consider that decision-making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary/alternative treatments, have to be a matter for local NHS service providers and practitioners as they are best placed to know their community's needs. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.3/3">The &quot;Our Health, our care, our say&quot; White Paper makes it clear that primary care trusts (PCTs) will be holding practices accountable for the use of public money under practice-based commissioning, and that PCTs will be expected to support practices that are innovative and entrepreneurial. They will be working with them to secure services that are needed locally, for example exploring opportunities to develop complementary or alternative therapies (of which homoeopathy is one example) as a component of patient choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.149W.2/1">None. The level of public funding a hospice receives is a matter for local negotiation between the local primary care trust (PCT), who are responsible for commissioning and funding palliative care services locally, and the hospice. We are currently developing an adult End of Life Care Strategy, which will consider funding for adult hospices and other adult end of life care services.</p>

	<p pid="a.151W.0/1">Improving the skills and competencies of all staff in acute settings but particularly those who care for people with dementia is one of the priorities in the Department's older people's mental health programme. In 2006, Lets Respect, an innovative resource tool, went out to acute general hospitals throughout England. This tool is part of a range of educational training and support tools aimed at helping qualified nurses, teach health care assistants and student nurses to recognise and respond to the needs of older people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.0/2">In addition to this, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Social Care Institute for Excellence recently published clinical guideline for dementia. This gives a comprehensive summary of good practice in dementia care that is applicable in all care settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.0/3">Volunteer schemes in hospital settings are the responsibility of local trusts. This includes local recruitment, screening for suitability and training of volunteers who are an important part of the caring work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.151W.0/4">With regards to training, post-registration training needs for national health service staff are determined against local NHS priorities, through appraisal processes and training needs analyses informed by local delivery plans and the needs of the service. It is the responsibility of NHS trusts to ensure that their employees are suitably qualified and competent.</p>

There will be a further meeting with them before any recommendations are put to Ministers.</p>

It is intended that by March 2008 Crisis loan applications will be dealt with by 20 Benefit Delivery Centres (BDC) delivering Social Fund nationally. To date 12 Social Fund Delivery Centres have rolled out. This is a new service giving our customers the opportunity to make a claim and receive a decision in the course of a 20 minute telephone call.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.2/4" class="indent">Benefit Delivery Centres answer calls Monday to Friday, between 9.00 a.m. and 5 p.m. (10.00 a.m. Wednesday) The amount of lines and the number of staff operating these lines will vary depending on the telephony systems in place at each BDC. The number of staff in BDCs taking calls will fluctuate in response to demands on the service. We do not have statistics on how many calls are aborted.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.2/1">For new disability living allowance claims for the period April 2006 to March 2007, where benefit was awarded, 10.09 per cent. were awarded on self-assessment, 50.35 per cent. were awarded on GP referral, and 10.50 per cent. were awarded following independent medical assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to respond to your question asking what the reasons are for the time taken between the lodging of an Incapacity Benefit appeal with the first tier agency and the referral of the appeal to the Tribunals Service and what measures he is putting in place to improve performance. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.5/4" class="indent">When an appeal is received and before it is submitted to the Tribunal Service, a reconsideration must be carried out. The Decision Maker has to consider all legal issues raised by the claimant or their representative, which may entail obtaining unreported Commissioner's decisions or referral for guidance to the Adjudication and Constitutional Issues Branch. Where additional medical evidence is received in support of the appeal it is sometimes necessary to refer the matter to Medical Services for further medical opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.5/5" class="indent">If the decision cannot be revised in the claimant's favour then the Decision Maker prepares an appeal submission; which requires a full explanation of the decision in relation to the legislation and careful consideration of case law.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.5/6" class="indent">The reconsideration and appeal submission must be accomplished within a Jobcentre Plus benchmark target of 50 days. This year to date we have averaged around 38 days for Incapacity Benefit appeals.</p>

Single people are all those who are not married (including those who may be widowed or divorced). The classification of marital status is based on an indicator on the dataset which has some known reliability issues and so may not be entirely accurate.  7. Expenditure on couples has been allocated to age groups according to the age of the partner actually receiving each payment; except for pension credit, where the expenditure cannot be allocated to individual partners, so the age of the elder partner is used.  8. The expenditure for men aged 60-64 are for pension credit and winter fuel payments only. State pension is paid only to men over state pension age, i.e. aged 65 years and over. Only bereavement benefits paid to those over state pension age are included.  <i> Source:</i><br/>  Departmental Administrative Sources.

	<p pid="a.183W.5/1">It is Government policy to meet demand for UK coinage. This minimises the risk that the public or businesses might find themselves short of coins, which in turn might restrict economic activity. The Treasury pays for the production of UK circulating coins while the Exchequer receives all seignorage. Overall, this generates a net inflow of capital for the public purse. Fluctuations in demand for UK coinage can occur for a variety of reasons and it is not normally possible to quantify the impact of any one specific factor.</p>

	<p pid="a.186W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.6/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has have been asked to reply to your question asking what the estimate is of the <i> (a)</i> gross and <i> (b)</i> net flows of remittances from the UK using IMF Balance of Payments Manual definitions for the most recent period for which figures are available; and what the principal countries are to which those remittances flow. I am replying in her absence. (135728)</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.6/4" class="indent">ONS do not publish separate estimates for flows of workers' remittances, as defined by the IMF Balance of Payments manual. Estimates of remittance flows are included in the UK Balance of Payments &quot;Pink Book&quot;, table 5.1, within the published series for other receipts of and payments by households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH).</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.6/5" class="indent">There are components produced at a lower level than these published data, which are close, in concept, to the IMF definitions of workers' remittances. However these estimates are highly uncertain which is why they are not published separately on a regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.6/6" class="indent">ONS estimate that in recent years on average remittances comprise around 75 per cent. of the series published in the Pink Book for total private transfers by households and NPISH. For 2005, the most recent year for which data are available, the component estimate for gross flows of remittances from the UK is &pound;3.7 billion and the component estimate for net flows of remittances from the UK households, calculated as remittances from the UK less remittances received by the UK, is &pound;1.4 billion. However it should be stressed that these estimates are highly uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="a.186W.6/7" class="indent">The ONS do not produce a full breakdown of remittance flows from the UK based on the country of destination or publish regularly any breakdown of these flows. However ONS estimates of the main countries to which these remittances flow reflect the main diasporas communities in the UK, with the largest estimates of flows being to the Republic of Ireland, India and Pakistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.188W.2/4" class="indent">Special analyses of deaths involving MRSA are undertaken annually by ONS for deaths which occurred in England and Wales. Data are only available from 1993 onwards and the most recent year available is 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/5" class="indent">Death certificates rarely specify the place where an infection was acquired. Numbers of deaths from MRSA contracted in NHS facilities can therefore not be provided. Death certificates do, however, record the place of death. The table below presents the number of deaths mentioning MRSA by place of death from 1993 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/6" class="indent">Most deaths occur in hospital, and the majority of deaths involving MRSA therefore also occur in hospital. Many deaths involving MRSA are to patients who were admitted to hospital because they were already seriously ill with another condition. MRSA only tends to cause problems if a person is already unwell, or if their immune system is suppressed, or if it can get into the bloodstream (through broken skin). People with these characteristics are more likely to be in hospital than elsewhere. People who die in hospital are also more likely to have been tested for MRSA.</p>

The EU is not a full member&mdash;it has observer status&mdash;but may choose to adopt WCO agreements and conventions should it wish to do so (and as it has done, for example, with the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)). Any agreement or convention made by the WCO and not subject to Community competence only takes effect in UK law once it has been ratified and then enacted by Parliament: the UK may choose whether to ratify or not. Where agreements do fall under Community competence, the UK is bound to apply them where they are adopted and contained in Community legal instruments.</p>
