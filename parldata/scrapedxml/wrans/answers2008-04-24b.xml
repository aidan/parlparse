The NSF has a 10-year implementation programme from its publication in March 2005, with flexibility for organisations to set the pace of change locally to take account of differences in local priorities and needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2170W.11/2">We have no plans to appoint a national director for multiple sclerosis. National directors oversee the implementation of specific NSFs or major clinical or service strategies. In line with devolving responsibility to local organisations, we believe that it is more appropriate for local health and social care communities and the third sector to take responsibility for driving forward the service changes and improvements envisaged by the NSF for long- term conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.2171W.2/2">It is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission services to meet the health care needs of their local populations. The Department deliberately does not break down PCT allocations into funding for individual policy programmes, as this would constrain local innovation and decision taking. Instead, the approach the Department takes is to be clear about the priorities for the NHS through the Operating Framework. It is then for the NHS to decide how best to achieve those outcomes in the light of local needs and circumstances, including the level of resources to invest.</p>

These include a potential &pound;2.1 billion boost to the UK's tourism industry and volunteering opportunities which can help drive up skills levels and improve employability. Over 600 top class sporting facilities from across the UK will appear in the London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camps Guide to be launched this summer, with 31 in Wales alone. These have the potential to attract top athletes from around the world bringing a range of sporting and business opportunities, including inward investment. In addition, UK Trade and Investment are developing programmes to use the Games as a springboard for export.</p>

	<p pid="b.2191W.8/1">We are aware of the Colombian Government's statement that they have come into the possession of information suggesting that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have been seeking to obtain uranium. We are also aware of the recent reporting on this matter, including the Colombian military's capture of uranium, in the international press. We would be greatly concerned if the FARC, a terrorist organisation proscribed by the EU, were involved in the procurement of radioactive material. We will monitor this situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.2192W.5/1">The UN maintains a permanent office in Matadi, the provincial capital of Bas Congo, and has a peace keeping presence in the province as part of its mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Additional peace keepers have deployed to Bas Congo following outbreaks of violence in the province in January and February 2007. The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for the DRC called for a peaceful resolution to violence in the province in February 2008. In March 2008 the UN deployed peace keepers and military observers to protect the civilian population in Bas Congo, assess events in the province and support the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2192W.5/2">The UN faces significant challenges in maintaining peace in the Bas Congo province. Violence has occurred in various locations across the province and transporting troops is difficult because of the weak local infrastructure. The UN mission has commitments across the DRC, particularly in the east of the country, which have to be met to prevent a return to conflict.</p>

	<p pid="b.2193W.2/1">The violence which took place in the Bas Congo province in early 2008 is under investigation by the UN. A report is expected in due course. It has not yet been possible to determine reliably the number of casualties either of the violence on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March</phrase> or of the clashes in Bas Congo in 2008 overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.2193W.2/2">I am concerned by the violence seen since January in Bas Congo. The development of democratic governance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) depends on representation of diverse political views, tolerance of opposition, respect for human rights and effective and accountable state institutions. I support the recent EU statement on events in the province, which called for the authority of the state to be upheld and for talks between the DRC Government and the political leaders of the Bundu dia Kongo, whose members have clashed with the Congolese security forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.2195W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, along with other central Government Departments, has agreed with the Cabinet Office targets for the percentage of employees in the senior management structure (SMS), senior civil service equivalent, who have declared a disability. The current SMS target is 3.2 per cent. by April 2008. No targets have currently been set for beyond this period: the employment of people who have declared a disability is one of several diversity issues to be discussed and agreed with the Cabinet Office for action after April 2008.</p>

Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr. Straw) requested a review by officials of the options for the regulation of the overseas operations of private military and security companies, registered in or operating from the UK. This applies to private military and security companies operating both in Afghanistan and elsewhere overseas. This was to follow up on the Green Paper of 2002, 'Private Military Companies: Options for Regulation' and to respond to the increase in activities of private military and security companies in areas of conflict overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.2198W.0/2">The review was completed in mid-2005 and suggested a number of options for ways in which the industry could be better managed. The review highlighted some complex issues, particularly in designating which activities should be regulated and how this could be implemented. This issue, along with the options for more effective supervision, continues to be the subject of Ministerial correspondence and official consultation. The Government have undertaken to keep Parliament fully informed of their proposals in this area. If it is decided that regulation is appropriate, the Government will put the proposals to public consultation.</p>

This conflict is an internal matter, driven by a complicated mix of tribal, religious and economic factors. We acknowledge the need for the Government of Yemen to maintain security within its borders. However, we have called for dialogue between the Government of Yemen and the Houthis to try to achieve a ceasefire. A recent Qatari-led mediation effort has achieved a pause in the fighting. This is fragile, and we continue to receive reports of sporadic violence in isolated areas. But we welcome the Qatari mediation effort and consider it the best route to achieving a lasting peace in Sa'dah.</p>

	<p pid="b.2202W.0/1">The Government of Yemen has been fighting a series of internal conflicts with al-Huthi-led rebels in the Governorate of Sa'dah since 2004. This conflict is an internal matter and we acknowledge the need for the Government of Yemen to maintain security within its borders. We have also called for care to avoid civilian casualties and for dialogue between the Government of Yemen and the Huthis to try to achieve a ceasefire. A recent Qatari-led mediation effort has achieved a pause in the fighting, although we continue to receive reports of sporadic violence in isolated areas. We welcome the Qatari mediation effort and consider it the best route to achieving a lasting peace in Sa'dah.</p>

	<p pid="b.2211W.5/12">Prior to 2001 some manufacturers were providing seat belts in their vehicles on a voluntary basis however we do not have statistics to show the fitting rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.2211W.5/13">A cost and benefit study was conducted as part of the review leading to the mandatory requirement for seat belt installation. This concluded that, assuming 100 per cent. seat belt fitment, three lives and 35 serious injuries could be saved per year. At today's values this represents a benefit of &pound;9.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2211W.5/14">We estimate that in 2006, 266,000 vehicles first registered before October 2001, were still in use. However, a review of the age of the fleet by year shows that, on average, the number of vehicles registered before that date is reducing by approximately 40,000 per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.2218W.2/21">Despite the decline in 2007, the UK remains on target to provide 0.7 per cent. of gross national income (GNI) as ODA by 2013, two years ahead of the EU target.</p>

	<p pid="b.2220W.5/1">Section 175 of the Education Act 2002 imposes a statutory duty on both local authorities and the governing bodies of maintained schools to make arrangements to ensure that their functions are carried out with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State in considering such arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.2220W.5/2">Section 157 of the Education Act 2002 and the Education (Independent Schools Standards) (England) Regulations 2003 impose a duty on independent schools to draw up and implement a policy to safeguard and promote the welfare of pupils at the school.</p>
	<p pid="b.2220W.5/3">These statutory duties are supported by guidance contained within Working Together to Safeguard Children, which was issued in April 2006, and Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education, which was issued in November 2006 and came into force in January 2007. Both documents set out the process for dealing with allegations that might indicate that someone is unsuitable to continue to work with children, because it is alleged that they have behaved, in a way that has harmed a child, or may have harmed a child; possibly committed a criminal offence against or related to a child; or behaved towards a child or children in a way that indicates s/he is unsuitable to work with children. The guidance is clear that any allegations that fell within this definition must be taken seriously and should be examined objectively by someone independent of the school concerned: in the first instance this is typically the local authority designated officer who leads on dealing with allegations in that area. The guidance explains that the police must be consulted about any case in which a criminal offence may have been committed, and that a strategy discussion (which will involve children's social care) should take place when there is cause to suspect a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm. Sometimes allegations will be so serious as to require immediate intervention by children's social care or the police, prior to notifying the local authority designated officer.</p>

	<p pid="b.2222W.3/1">All local authorities and schools must have regard to the special educational needs code of practice which provides advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs. Children with dyslexia should have their needs identified and support put in place in the same way as children with other special educational needs (SEN).</p>
	<p pid="b.2222W.3/2">To identify and promote best practice, we are working with the British Dyslexia Association, Dyslexia Action, Xtraordinary People and the Professional Association of Teachers of Students with Specific Learning Difficulties on the No to Failure project. This project is supporting trailblazer schools in three local authority areas, where children are screened and specialist teaching provided to those identified at risk of dyslexia and other specific learning difficulties. We are supporting this project with just over &pound;1 million funding over three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.2222W.3/3">The recently published report from No to Failure says that a significant proportion of children in the trailblazers not achieving expected levels of attainment are at risk of dyslexia or other specific learning difficulties. However, the report does not indicate how many had already been identified with SEN, nor does it evaluate the impact of specialist teaching on children's progression. We are looking forward to seeing the final report later this year, which we understand will contain such an evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2222W.3/4">Through No to Failure, we have commissioned Dr. Chris Singleton to summarise published research on the impact of specialist dyslexia teaching. We will consider whether and how we should promote specialist dyslexia teaching as best practice in the light of evidence of its impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.2222W.3/5">To help those working in schools with identifying and supporting children with dyslexia, last October we launched the inclusion development programme, which is offering professional development in key areas of SEN starting with training on communication difficulties, including dyslexia. The inclusion development programme materials were developed in close consultation with dyslexia organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.2222W.3/6">We are also providing &pound;150,000 over two years for the British Dyslexia Association to enhance their helpline's service to teachers, and 250,000 over three years for Dyslexia Action to run Partnership for Literacy pilots in a further 10 schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.2225W.0/1">The impact on businesses was considered in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 which was updated June 2006, It found that costs for employers, some of whom already vet staff caring for children, will be offset by savings&mdash;for example on repeat work, since the new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) registration will be portable from job to job&mdash;as well as by reduced risk of unsuitable employees. This should encourage employers to continue part-time opportunities for under-16s, including work experience. In addition, most employees that young people come into contact with during their employment will not be required to register with the ISA. This is because looking after, training, supervising etc. the young person during the course of their employment is not a part of those employees' jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2225W.0/2">It is envisaged that some 11,3 million people will be required to register with the ISA, mostly due to work which under the Act will be &quot;Regulated Activity&quot; with children or vulnerable adults; 525.6 thousand of these are teachers including occasional and supply teachers in England and Wales (January 2007 statistics).</p>
	<p pid="b.2225W.0/3">Earlier this year the Department concluded a consultation on many aspects of the scheme including issues for business and work experience; We have received useful feedback from stakeholders including the British Retail Consortium and work experience providers on how far regulated activity should cover contact with under 16-year-olds in employment and on work experience. Risk can never be eliminated from our lives, but young people must be introduced to it in a measured way. We remain of the view that part-time work is potentially beneficial for under 16s. It introduces them to the world of work and can develop self-confidence, communication and organisational skills, familiarity with money and dealing with other people. We shall publish the outcome of the consultation in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.2225W.0/4">It is not our intention to make any work a regulated activity unnecessarily and we will continue to work with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and with stakeholders to help inform regulations and prepare for implementation of the Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.2243W.2/22">Since March 2001 offenders required to register under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (now replaced by Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003) have been statutorily excluded from HDC. Prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences that are not subject to registration are presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/23">As noted in the footnote to published tables, the reasons for recall from home detention curfew are sometimes presented as the reason for the original imprisonment. Further investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded do not relate to the offence for which they were sentenced and subsequently released on home detention curfew, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/24">HDC allows prisoners serving primarily between three months and less than four years, to be released, depending on their sentence length, up to 135 days earlier than they would be otherwise. Prisoners must serve a minimum of one quarter of their sentence in custody subject to a minimum of 30 days before release on HDC. (Prisoners subject to the release arrangements of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 who are sentenced to four years or more are not statutorily ineligible for release on HDC but are presumed unsuitable unless there are exceptional circumstances.)</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/25">No prisoner can be placed on HDC for longer than 135 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/26">The most serious violent offenders and all sexual offenders are either statutorily excluded or are presumed unsuitable for release on HDC. It should be noted that offenders serving extended sentences for serious violent offences are statutorily ineligible for release on HDC. Since March 2001 offenders required to register under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (now replaced by Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003) have been statutorily excluded from HDC. Prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences that are not subject to registration are presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/27">Eligible prisoners are not granted HDC unless they pass a careful risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.2243W.2/28">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems.

The Government have made clear that assisted dying is a matter of conscience and for Parliament to decide. Parliament has considered this on several recent occasions.

	<p pid="b.2249W.8/1">The calculation of the predicted rate of adult re-offending considers three main offender characteristics: gender, age and criminal history of the offender&mdash;although these characteristics are broken down further in the model by various subcategories.</p>
	<p pid="b.2249W.8/2">The individual effect of each on the predicted rate was not assessed in detail because the main purpose of the predicted rate is to control for offender characteristics across different cohorts.
