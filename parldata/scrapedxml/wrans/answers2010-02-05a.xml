	<p pid="a.536W.2/1">DEFRA has not carried out a full assessment of return on its investment on agricultural R and D. DEFRA R and D has been commissioned to develop evidence to inform policy development or develop solutions which underpin policy objectives.</p>

A review of returns on R and D investment<sup>(1)</sup> was commissioned to inform this assessment, which considered relevant UK studies and their estimates of the rates of return on agricultural R and D. These studies showed a great deal of variance in rates of return, which reflects both the length of time period studied and improvements in the estimation method employed, but the three most recent reported internal rates of return between 22-44 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.541W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) collates dates on consultancy expenditure as part of its Consultancy Value Programme which assists Departments in driving greater value from Government's use of consultants. The Ministry's expenditure on consultancy for 2007-08 is reported as &#163;56 million and can be found in the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk/professional_services_consultancy_value_programme.asp">http://www.ogc.gov.uk/professional_services_consultancy_ value_programme.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/4">Expenditure for 2008-09 is &#163;49.7 million and will be reported soon on the same website.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/5">The OGC definition of consultancy is broad and includes professional services provided by, for example, lawyers, surveyors and architects and the employment of specialists on an interim basis to deliver project solutions, providing expertise for a defined period of time that is not available in-house.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/6">Both the 2007-08 and 2008-09 figures reflect expenditure by the Ministry of Justice headquarters, Her Majesty's Courts Service, the Tribunals Service, and the National Offender Management Service (except for the Probation Service).</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/7">The Ministry was established in May 2007 so data is not available prior to 2007-08 in its current form.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/8" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> Expenses incurred by consultants in the course of Ministry of Justice business are normally included within their overall bills and are therefore included within the figures stated in part <i> (a).</i> The amount attributable to expenses can be disaggregated from the total only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/9">The costs of business related travel and accommodation by consultants may sometimes be met directly by the Ministry through contracted booking agents or by Government Procurement Card. Occasionally consultants may also claim for reimbursement of expenses met, in the first instance, from their own pocket. It is not possible to identify amounts relating specifically to consultants in any of these cases without incurring the disproportionate cost of examining huge numbers of supporting records held locally across the business.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.2/1">Currently, there are 520 employees in the Ministry of Justice (including all agencies) who are in transition after accepting a voluntary early departure on severance or retirement terms. The breakdown of staff across the Ministry is as follows: two from the Office for the Public Guardian, 308 from the Access to Justice group, 199 from the National Offender Management Service and Her Majesty's Prison Service, 11 from the Corporate Performance Group. The majority are due to leave the Ministry within the next two to three months and the terms are governed by the Civil Service Compensation scheme. There are also 185 employees across the Ministry actively seeking permanent re-deployment following organisational change programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/2">For the early departure, the term 'transition time' is defined as the elapsed time from a formal agreement to leave to the actual date of departure. For redeployment, it is the elapsed time from the re-organisation occurring to the individual taking up a new work post. The average transition time is 90 days. There are 10 staff who have remained on the redeployment list, as an exceptional basis, for longer than 6 months. Whilst employees are on the redeployment list, or have accepted voluntary early departure, they continue to undertake meaningful work duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/3">The average transition time in previous years has been 90 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/4">The department is unable to provide the average salary costs for staff in transition in each year. This information is not held centrally and obtaining it would incur a disproportionate cost as the department currently operates several pay and HR structures and would be reliant on a number of different sources to establish the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/2">For all employees, performance management is a continuous process with annual and mid-year formal performance reviews of progress against objectives. The Ministry's performance management system requires poor performance to be addressed when it occurs and not simply at specific points in the reporting year. Where appropriate, additional coaching and support is provided to employees to enable them to reach and maintain the required standards of performance appropriate to their roles. However, when employees are unable to meet and maintain acceptable standards of performance, sanctions up to and including dismissal are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/3" class="italic"> Senior civil servants</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/4">Members of the senior civil service (SCS) are subject to a common performance management system based on relative assessment of achievement. Since 2007, the system has had four performance categories. Performance group four denotes performance not meeting the required standard. Prior to this, the performance management system had three performance categories: top, middle and lower tranche. The number of SCS employees receiving either a lower tranche or performance group four assessment is set out as follows.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/17">Separate performance management arrangements (both in respect to in year and end of year assessment) exist for staff in grades below the SCS. Unlike the SCS, where employees are subject to relative peer group assessment with a guideline distribution between performance groups, below the SCS performance assessment is linked solely to the achievement of an individual's work objectives. Ministry of Justice (excluding the National Offender Management Services) employees receive annual performance appraisals that indicate one of three performance markings-&quot;Outstanding&quot;, &quot;Effective&quot; and &quot;Improvement Required&quot;. The number of employees receiving an &quot;Improvement Required&quot; or equivalent during the past five years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.2/29">As the award of an unsatisfactory performance marking invokes poor performance procedures but does not directly result in dismissal it has not been possible to provide information on the number of staff who have left as a direct result of an &quot;Improvement Required&quot; rating during the past five years without incurring disproportionate costs. However, we can confirm that in 2009, of the 134 staff below the SCS who were judged &quot;Improvement Required&quot;, 22 are no longer employed by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.2/30">Appraisals are held annually for staff in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) in grades below the SCS and there are four possible ratings: &quot;Exceeded&quot;, &quot;Achieved&quot;, &quot;Almost Achieved&quot;, and &quot;Unacceptable&quot;.

	<p pid="a.543W.2/54">NOMS processes mirror those in the rest of the Ministry in that performance management is a continuous process, based upon agreed objectives and in-year reviews. The &quot;Unacceptable&quot; marking does not automatically result in dismissal. However, employment may be terminated where the employee fails to meet the appropriate standard despite appropriate warnings and support. It has not been possible to provide information on the number of NOMS employees who have left the service as a direct result of an &quot;Unacceptable&quot; rating as the information is unavailable.</p>

	<p pid="a.545W.2/1">The majority of permanent recruitment is managed internally by the Ministry's HR function. For specialist or senior vacancies, it is sometimes necessary, however, to use recruitment consultants to access a wider pool of talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.2/2">The Ministry's accounting systems do not separately identify expenditure on recruitment consultants.

To specifically identify expenditure on recruitment consultants would involve the disproportionate cost of examining a large number of invoices held locally across the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.2/3">Additionally, recruitment consultants are usually involved in the continuing supply of temporary and contract staff where the fee paid represents the amount paid directly to the contractor, plus the agency's management fee which includes their charge for recruiting the contractor. The management fee element can vary depending on the terms negotiated for individual contracts. Fees to recruitment consultants for the continuing supply of contract and agency staff can only be distinguished from fees for specific recruitment campaigns at a disproportionate cost.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor's (Mr. Straw) request, senior officials at the Ministry of Justice have met with representatives of the national press to discuss the issues raised by the Trafigura case and the use of so-called super-injunctions generally. The Justice Secretary is considering matters in the light of this, including engaging with the senior judiciary. He will make a statement to the House after that.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.0/1">The average number of days taken as sickness absence at the Legal Services Commission during 2008-09 was 7.98 per employee. This has decreased from 9.17 in 2007-08 and 10.7 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/2">The LSC has been reviewing its absence policy year-on-year in order to reduce absence levels. The target for 2009-10 is 7.66 days (a 4 per cent. reduction on 2008-09). Following the most recent review in 2009, online training has been further developed to support managers and absence trigger points (where the return to work meeting between the manager and employee become a more formal process) have been lowered to seven days. An absence panel has been set up to review any long-term sickness absence and ensure support systems such as occupational health referrals, home visits and the employee assistance programme are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/3">No days are recorded as having been lost as a result of staff being unable to make it to work due to adverse weather conditions or travel disruption as it is the LSC's policy to give line managers the flexibility to authorise home working where appropriate or convert any absences in these circumstances into annual, flexible or special leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/4">In 2008-09, the average number of days taken as sickness absence at the Youth Justice Board was 3.7 days per employee. It has a robust attendance management policy in place outlining clearly line managers' responsibilities to support staff, manage absence and the actions they need to take at different trigger points. This includes interventions at cumulative absence and consecutive absence points, the requirement to conduct documented &quot;return to work&quot; interviews, line manager and/or occupational health and welfare services contact and formalised case conferences.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/5">The YJB's HR team works closely with line managers across the business to monitor instances of sickness absences and provide advice, support and interventions, where necessary, to reduce the level of sickness absence even further. Sickness absence figures are also included in the YJB's &quot;Organisational Health Indicators&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/6">In addition the YJB runs a health and well-being programme to encourage staff to be aware of the health and fitness and take steps to improve their well-being. This includes access to eye tests, cycle to work schemes, discounted gym memberships, advice on tackling stress and access to health screening.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/7">No days are recorded as having been lost as a result of staff being unable to make it to work due to adverse weather conditions or travel disruption as it is the YJB's policy to give line manager's the flexibility to authorise home working where appropriate or convert any absences in these circumstances into annual, flexible or special leave.</p>

	<p pid="a.556W.3/1">During the period in question the Department had a number of discussions with the UN and allies on the No Fly Zones in Iraq. The zones, established in support of UN Security Council Resolution 688, were justified under international law in response to a situation of overwhelming humanitarian necessity due to Saddam Hussein's violent oppression of Iraq's minority communities. Between 1998 and 2002 Saddam Hussein waged a systematic campaign against UK (and US) aircraft carrying out patrols-violating the No Fly Zones-designed to prevent a return to the brutal repression of the Kurdish and other minorities in the north and the Shi'a in the south. Our aircraft were authorised to respond to attacks solely in self-defence. All such defensive action was strictly limited to proportional responses against Iraqi weapons and facilities that posed a direct threat to coalition forces. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Lewis) will write to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley with more detail on the representations made between 1998 and 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.556W.6/1">We have serious concerns about the Israeli restrictions on Gaza and the impact they have on the lives of Gazans. Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the fourth Geneva convention as an occupying power. The fourth Geneva convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.556W.6/2">We have consistently pressed the Israeli Government to comply with their obligations under international law and allow passage of relief supplies. Although aid is entering Gaza, according to the UN this is insufficient to meet the needs of the Gazan people.</p>

Information is available for the number of qualified nursing staff in the school nursing area of work, directly employed by national health service organisations. The two NHS organisations which employ school nurses in the Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency or the London borough of Bexley are Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust and Bexley Care Trust. The NHS Information Centre reports that there was one qualified nursing staff in the school nursing area of work in the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>. At a local level, the staff who carry out school nursing roles carry out a range and variety of other duties in addition to their school nursing role and therefore may have different job titles. Bexley Care Trust did not report any school nursing staff on their 2008 census return. However, recent correspondence with the Trust has revealed that this was due to a local coding issue. We advise contacting Bexley Care Trust directly to obtain their figures.</p>

Having assessed the hazards so identified, HSE formed the judgment that a Detailed Emergency Planning Zone (DEPZ) set at a radius of 1.5 km from the submarines would provide a valid area in which the arrangements of local authorities should be applied to protect the public and society in the event of a reasonably foreseeable radiation emergency involving one of the submarines. The decision to reduce the DEPZ from 2 km to 1.5 km took account of an improved analysis of the potential radiation hazards by MOD.</p>

In some instances, competent authorities may also need to conduct or commission a further interview to gather more evidence. The timing will vary greatly depending on whether the initial 'reasonable grounds' decision is positive, how complex the case is, the ability of the potential victim to provide information and how prompt other parties are in responding to queries for more information or reports. But it would not be unusual for a competent authority to spend two to four days in total on a given case.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.8/1">The UK Border Agency does not keep records of all unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.8/2">Border force officers remain vigilant in identifying any arriving child who may be at risk of harm. When an unaccompanied child arrives, the border force officer must be satisfied that suitable arrangements have been made for the child's reception and welfare in the UK before allowing them entry. The UK Border Agency works closely with the police and children's services and will if appropriate alert them to any concerns.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.11/1">The Government's response to human trafficking is set out in their comprehensive 2007 Action Plan, which was updated in October 2009 and contains a number of specific measures to identify and protect child victims, including training for front line staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.11/2">In December 2007 the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Home Office published practice guidance, &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children Who May Have Been Trafficked&quot; to help practitioners safeguard and promote the welfare of children who may have been trafficked. We also established with the NSPCC, a national Child Trafficking Advice and Information Line in October 2007 to support practitioners with advice on safeguarding vulnerable children believed to have been trafficked.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.11/3">As part of our improved services for trafficked children under the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings, we have introduced a National Referral Mechanism, which provides enhanced procedures for local agencies to identify, refer and support all victims of trafficking early on, including children. Alongside NRM, we are piloting a child trafficking assessment tool in 13 local authority areas, to trial a process for local practitioners to assess cases of separated children who may be trafficking victims and to take initial safeguarding action and make a referral to a Competent Authority under the NRM.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.11/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-02">2 November 2009</phrase>, Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act (2009) placed a new duty on UKBA to safeguard children subject to immigration controls, including trafficked children and those seeking asylum. All UK Border Agency staff at operational and case working grades are required to complete training on how to identify potential victims of trafficking, which contains specific sections on the features of child trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.11/5">Updated multi agency guidance was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July 2009</phrase> on children at risk of sexual exploitation and those who go missing from care both of which highlight how trafficked children may be identified and protected from harm. We have incorporated child trafficking into the cross Government &quot;Staying Safe&quot; Action Plan and established trafficking sub groups at local and regional levels.</p>

The amount spent on first class air travel during the calendar year was &#163;10,936. Figures over a longer period are not available as the UK Border Agency changed the contractor through whom travel is booked in December 2008.

	<p pid="a.587W.6/2">Because the UK Border Agency's work is national and indeed international in scope, it is necessary in some cases for staff to travel in order to facilitate that work.

The figures for each individual constituency in the South West region will be deposited in the Library of the House. Businesses may apply for a loan from any one of the participating lenders who will assess which form of lending, including the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, is most appropriate. We do not hold figures for those businesses which are instead offered a normal commercial loan, or are rejected for failing to meet the lender's commercial criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.5/2">With respect to the Capital for Enterprise Fund equity scheme, CfEF received 77 enquiries from businesses in the South West seeking investment to the value of &#163;84.3 million. Thus far, no businesses have received investment, two businesses have agreed terms on investments with a value &#163;4 million, one business has been offered investment totalling &#163;2 million and one proposition is under active consideration with a value of &#163;1.3 million. The remaining inquiries are either being considered subject to further information to be supplied by the applicant or have been rejected or withdrawn. I am not providing a breakdown by parliamentary constituency or local authority as this could make it possible to identify the individual companies that have received support.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.2/11">We have listened to the continued concerns of owners and are extending the temporary measure for a further 12 months-to cover the whole of 2010-11-and we are uprating the threshold to &#163;18,000 in line with the general movement of property values at revaluation.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.5/21">These data are consistent with the statistical release entitled 'Non-domestic rateable values: 2010 Local Rating Lists-England and Wales', published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-18">18 December 2009</phrase>. A copy of this statistical release is available at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.5/23">The data excludes petrol retail outlets in hypermarkets/superstores.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.5/24">In the last five years, alongside rising petrol prices and increasing turnover, the rents paid on many petrol filling stations has grown. It is only fair to all ratepayers this is reflected in rate bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.5/25">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government. Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.5/26">The percentage increase in rateable value does not necessarily result in a similar increase in rates liability. As the total rateable value for the whole country is increasing by approximately 20 per cent., only businesses with an increase over this figure will see an increase in their bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.5/27">The Government intend to put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.645W.8/1">Sir Michael Pitt's review of the summer 2007 floods found that the policy approach in Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), &quot;Development and Flood Risk&quot;, is sound and should be rigorously applied. In June 2008, Communities and Local Government published a Practice Guide to PPS25 which reflected the more detailed findings of Sir Michael Pitt's review and took account of responses to the earlier 'living draft' version of the guide, including responses made in the light of the 2007 floods. A further updated version of the guide was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-07">7 December 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.645W.8/2">In 2009 we carried out an initial review of the implementation of PPS25. This found that good progress was being made and the policy was working in helping to deliver sustainable development that is safe from flood risk. This view is supported by the Environment Agency. In August 2009 Communities and Local Government published consultation proposals to amend and clarify some limited aspects of PPS25. We will publish a revised version of PPS25 soon with refinements to further improve the policy's implementation and effectiveness.</p>
