Salt stock requirements are ascertained from a combination of longer term weather forecast information and records of salt usage. Salt capability is expressed as the number of treatment days available based on six treatments per day at 20gm/m2&mdash;the level of treatment typical for snow conditions. A weekly summary is produced which gives an overview of salt stocks and provides advance warning when salt stocks are approaching a critical level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1102W.2/3">As a result of the recent severe weather, central government, the Local Government Association and the Highways Agency have been working together to provide daily advice to suppliers on the most effective distribution of available salt supplies in order to minimise the risk to public safety. This advice is based on daily demand estimates informed by the Met Office's 24 hour forecast and comparisons between existing salt stocks and available supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.6/2">The Government take data protection very seriously. Following the Cabinet Office Review of Data Handling Procedures in Government, departments have implemented a raft of measures to improve data security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1103W.6/3">The Ministry of Justice is considering actively with the ICO how the Promise might add additional value to those measures we have already signed up to.

	<p pid="b.1116W.9/1">Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) are asked to provide an anonymised copy of each full serious case review to the Department for Children, Schools and Families as soon as possible after the publication of the executive summary. This is to inform biennial overview reports which analyse the key findings from serious case reviews taken as a whole and identify the implications for policy and practice. When an individual serious case review is complete the report is then evaluated by Ofsted. DCSF children and learners teams in the Regional Government Offices have a support and challenge role, in particular with respect to the implementation by LSCBs and local agencies of recommendations in individual serious case review reports.</p>

Clearly, secondary school pupils who leave the school premises at lunchtime and do not eat a school lunch will not benefit from the healthier food on offer at the school.

	<p pid="b.1122W.6/1">A DEFRA-funded study carried out by Drew Associates into the economic impact of the recreational sea angling sector in England and Wales was published in 2004. This study estimated that 18,889 people were employed in the sector and that the total expenditure of anglers was &pound;538 million per year. Although we do not have detailed data on angling activity in North Devon, the same report considered the principal locations for angling in that area and identified that there were 15 charter angling vessels in the North Devon and Bristol Channel area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1122W.6/2">In England there are around 400 charter angling vessels that would require an authorisation under Article 47 of the draft EU proposal, plus an as yet unquantified number of privately owned vessels. As part of the process of negotiating this proposal, we shall be seeking clarification from the Commission on a number of issues relating to Article 47. Until we have that clarification it is difficult to assess accurately its potential impact on recreational sea angling. We shall be seeking stakeholders' views on these points and considering them in more detail in the impact assessment that my officials are drawing up and which we shall publish as part of the formal consultation procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124W.8/1">Performance related pay schemes encourage high attainment, help drive performance in departments and agencies and support better public service delivery. DEFRA's uses non-consolidated payments to reward high performance during the year and these are based on how well an individual has met or exceeded set objectives, relative to their peers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.8/2">Non-consolidated performance payments are one-off payments and do not count towards pension. They are allocated from a 'pot' expressed as a percentage of the salary budget each year. Non-consolidated performance payments paid from the 2007 pay budget relate to performance in the, 2006-07 appraisal year and those paid from 2008 pay budget relate to performance in the 2007-08 appraisal year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.8/3">For the senior civil service (SCS) the size of the pot available is agreed centrally each year following recommendations from the senior salaries review body.

	<p pid="b.1124W.8/4">The size of the pot for non-SCS is determined individually by Departments and Agencies through the pay remit process and in negotiations with the Trades Unions.

	<p pid="b.1127W.3/1">There have been 910 incidences of 'secondary flooding' in Hull since January 2008, although the relationship between the flooding in summer 2007 and subsequent water ingress remains to be explored further. The city council is working with the Environment Agency and the university of Hull to understand the factors which contribute to the continuing incidences of water ingress into homes. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-29">29 January 2009</phrase>, of the 472 households displaced from their homes in Hull by flooding, 360 were displaced as a result of water ingress from January 2008 or subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.3/2">The Government are concerned about all households which are still displaced from their homes following the 2007 summer flooding. Approximately 100 households returned each week between the end of June and the middle of November and on that basis we estimate that more than 19 out of every 20 households originally displaced are back home. That compares well to the Carlisle floods in 2005 when one in 10 were still out of their homes after 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.3/3">But we recognise that is no consolation to those still displaced and the Minister for Local Government, my right hon.

	<p pid="b.1128W.2/2"><i> </i>In a transparent and fair process which involved stakeholders in drawing up a set of business and quality of life criteria and the consultancy firm KPMG carrying out an independent assessment against these criteria, Plymouth was selected as one of the six shortlisted locations for the Marine Management Organisation's headquarters. The criteria used to arrive at the shortlist, and subsequently tested through site visits and presentations from the locations, were:</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/3" class="indent">Business needs for the MMO HQ such as availability of skilled work force and good transport links.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/4" class="indent">Cost and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/5" class="indent">Government policies on location of public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/6" class="indent">Quality of Life factors including cost of living, education, employment, healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/7">As well as carrying out site visits to further test locations against these criteria, all shortlisted locations were given the opportunity to present their case to be the home of the MMO HQ and I met with MPs from all the shortlisted locations. Plymouth presented a strong case and, like all of the shortlisted locations, would have been a good home for the MMO HQ, allowing the MMO to meet its business needs and benefit from local marine expertise, organisational networks and academic links.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/8">However, Tyneside demonstrated the strongest and most comprehensive case to be the home of the organisation and provides a location from which the organisation can best achieve its aims. Among other factors, Tyneside has a broad range and good balance of marine interests with a working port, all of which fit well with the role of the MMO. Tyneside also provides strong transport links in terms of access to key stakeholders in London, Brussels and Scotland. There was a compelling demonstration of support from a wide range of stakeholders across the North East region, a region which has benefited little to date from the Lyons Review in respect of the relocation of public sector employment. The extensive evidence of partnership working in the area provided confidence that Tyneside had actively considered the bespoke requirements of the MMO with regard to its role under the Marine and Coastal Access Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129W.9/1">The current system of local authority housing finance is based on a system of surplus authorities (where assumed income exceeds assumed costs) making payment to central Government and deficit authorities (where assumed income is less than assumed costs) receiving subsidy. In the current year approximately &pound;550 million will be paid to deficit authorities in aggregate.

Our aim is to have a long term solution to financing council housing that is sustainable and fair to both tenant and taxpayer. The issue of councils retaining all rental receipts is closely bound up with a number of other key policy decisions, including what rents should pay for and how these receipts would be used in a local area. It would be premature to reach conclusions specifically on this matter until the Review reports to Ministers later this year, when it will be considered as part of the overall structure for a new or improved system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1130W.5/2">, and can confirm that the letter in question will be placed in the Libraries of the House. On carbon offsetting, it is very difficult to ensure that UK-based carbon offset projects are truly additional&mdash;that is, that they result in real emission reductions that would not have happened anyway in the absence of carbon finance. For this reason the government's voluntary quality assurance scheme for carbon offsetting which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February 2009</phrase> will not cover projects based in the UK. Support for local emission reduction projects can be beneficial, but caution should be exercised in claiming those emission reductions as offsets to balance a carbon footprint.</p>

Prescription applied only to the operational land of the statutory port not to other companies or businesses operating under licence or other agreement with exclusive use of property within the boundaries of ports.

Since its launch in June 2007 to November 2008 there have been over 1.3 million visitors to the Act on CO2 calculator.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.9/6">As of December 2008 awareness of the phrase 'Act on CO2' is 72 per cent. and 73 per cent. of respondents currently say they have taken actions or are planning to take actions to reduce their CO2 emissions as a result of the campaign. This compares favourably to 50 per cent. in summer 2007, when research was undertaken to evaluate the first television campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.9/7">Act on CO2 is currently ran as an England-only campaign. The Devolved Administrations ran their own bespoke communications approaches and therefore we do not actively pursue or measure its effectiveness within the devolved areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1134W.5/1">Discussions were held across Whitehall in preparation for the agreement by parties that 2 per cent. of the share of proceeds from the Certified Emissions Reductions issued for the Clean Development Mechanism will go towards the Adaptation Fund. This international financing mechanism is now in place. The UK Government are working with others on the Adaptation Fund Board to establish sound operational procedures for the Adaptation Fund to ensure that it will meet international fiduciary standards and be an effective mechanism for delivering increased finance where it is needed. The UK Government take the subject of adaptation finance extremely seriously and recognise that the process will be complex and will take time to get right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.5/2">The board's approach to making the fund operational was approved by parties in Poznan, thus enabling it to start operations in 2009. The board is now working to put in place the mechanisms it set out in the approach submitted to parties in Poznan, and the UK continues to play a key role in assisting the board to find innovative ways to enable the fund to become operational this year. The UK was the board's biggest financial supporter in 2008 (&pound;500,000) and has set aside an additional &pound;500,000 for 2009 to assist the board in its work to set up the necessary operational structures to enable direct access.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.5/3">Discussions by parties in Poznan revealed weaknesses in the governance structure of the Adaptation Fund, which have restricted the authority and operational efficacy of the board. These will need to be addressed to ensure that the fund will be able to make decisions on allocation of funding that are not affected by political considerations. This process has been particularly challenging as parties have requested access to funding without the assistance of intermediaries. The international community has thus far relied on these to provide sound fiduciary risk management for international assistance to developing countries. The UK has been playing a key role in the board to find ways to facilitate such direct access to funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1134W.5/4">The UK Government will be considering options for scaling up the movement of international financial assistance through the Adaptation Fund after consideration of the adequacy of the implementation structures the fund will have put in place this year, and in line with our wider objectives on the international financial architecture. It is clear that a blend of options will offer the best prospects of raising the level of funding required. Our vision is of a climate 'compact' between developed and developing countries whereby funds are disbursed at scale on the basis of national plans that integrate mitigation and adaptation needs alongside development priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1137W.0/2">The UK (the Department for International Development (DFID) and my Department) has allocated the &pound;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund to the World Bank-administered Climate Investment Funds. The Climate Investment Funds are divided into the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund. Sub-programmes of the latter include: the Pilot programme for climate resilience, and two programmes under development: the Forest Investment programme and the Scaling-up Renewable Energy programme. The funds will be administered by the World Bank with individual programmes implemented through any one of the Multilateral Development Banks. Decisions are made by recipient countries on the basis of their country-led investment plans. We expect UN agencies to participate as delivery agents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.2/2">The Government have invested &pound;5.8 million into Eaves Housing for Women to run the Poppy project since 2003. The grant for this financial year is &pound;1.3 million. This provides for a range of services including 35 supported accommodation places and eight full-time staff. While the project facilitates access to counselling and interpretative services and can pay for this where necessary, it does not directly employ these professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/3">Eaves Housing for Women is required to submit regular monitoring and financial information, which is reviewed on a quarterly basis. The organisation does not submit any specific information on the use of volunteers. However the organisation is required to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of clients, which includes undertaking Criminal Records Bureau checks for staff and volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/4">Under the terms of the grant clients can be supported for an initial four weeks, with longer-term services provided in return for cooperation with the authorities. To qualify for support women must be over 18-years-old, trafficked into the United Kingdom and sexually exploited through prostitution in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/5">Between March 2003 and December 2008, 423 women received support from the Poppy project; 215 benefited from supported accommodation and 208 received outreach support. The Poppy project has developed partnerships with other organisations to help provide alternative services for individuals that do not meet the eligibility criteria or when the project is at capacity. Information on the number of individuals that have been unable to access the Poppy project is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/6">It is open to the courts to award compensation orders in favour of a victim of crime and victims of violence can also apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. While the Poppy project can inform victims of avenues to access compensation, it is not within their authority to determine eligibility for, or administer compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.2/7">This year we will be expanding support services for victims of human trafficking and extending the reflection and recovery period to a minimum of 45 days. The Government will also introduce new renewable temporary residence permits for identified victims of human trafficking that participate in a criminal investigation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154W.0/1">Information on the number of recorded offences of rape and burglary in the Winchester Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership area has been provided by the Home Office and is shown in the following table 1. However, there are no statistics currently available relating specifically to offences of grievous bodily harm or actual bodily harm. Such offences would be included in the Home Office classifications of 'more serious wounding' or 'less serious wounding' as appropriate and cannot be separately identified from other offences within those classifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.0/2">From data held by the Ministry of Justice, the number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for offences relating to rape, grievous bodily harm, actual bodily harm, and burglary in Hampshire police force area can be viewed in Table 2 as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.0/3">Court proceedings data are not available at constituency level. Therefore Hampshire police force area data have been provided in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.0/4">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.0/5">Court proceedings data for 2008 will be available in the autumn of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154W.0/6">Recorded crime and court proceedings statistics are from two different databases and recorded in quite different ways. Recorded crime data are provided on a financial year basis and counts offences whereas court proceedings data are on a calendar year basis and count offenders. Therefore, these two separate data-sets are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1157W.5/1">Potential breaches of the rules on the use of parliamentary allowances, including the communications allowance, are investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, which reports to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.5/2">However, it is not for the Commissioner to rule on whether that expenditure should then be regarded as a candidate election expense under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (&quot;the 1983 Act&quot;). Rather, as with any other potential item of election expenditure, responsibility lies with the candidate and agent to consider whether expenditure meets the definition of election expenditure used by the 1983 Act and, if so, to ensure that the expenditure in question is recorded on the candidate spending return as required under section 81 of the 1983 Act. This states that such a return must include a statement of all election expenses incurred by or on behalf of a candidate. Section 82 of the 1983 Act requires that this return be accompanied by declarations by the candidate and election agent which verify the return. It is a corrupt practice knowingly to make a false declaration under section 82. It is an illegal practice to fail to comply with the requirements of section 81 or section 82.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.5/3">Breaches of the 1983 Act are pursued through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.5/4">Illegal practices in the 1983 Act are triable summarily. Corrupt practices in the 1983 Act are triable summarily or on indictment. It would therefore ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide whether a particular item of expenditure was knowingly excluded from a candidate's expenditure return where it should clearly have been recorded. In reaching its decision, the court could well take into account any judgment from the Commissioner of Standards in relation to expenditure which breached the rules on the use of parliamentary allowances, should the court consider this relevant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.12/1">In 2004, haemophiliacs were notified that they were considered as 'at risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) for public health purposes'. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) wrote to all haemophiliac care centres asking them to notify haemophilia patients and give them the opportunity to discuss the implications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.12/2">On the advice of the UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO) and the CJD Incidents Panel, it was agreed that all patients with bleeding disorders who had received plasma product clotting factors between 1980 and 2001 should be managed as 'at risk' whether or not they were known to have received specific product batches manufactured from donors who subsequently developed clinical vCJD. Haemophilia centre doctors were asked to give patients the choice of finding out whether or not they had been treated with products known to have been manufactured using plasma from donors who developed vCJD. In 2006 when further implicated batches were identified, doctors were asked to notify those patients who had received these batches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.12/3">In February 2009, the HPA coordinated a patient notification exercise about a finding at post mortem of abnormal vCJD prion protein detected in the spleen of a patient with haemophilia. The HPA and the UKHCDO wrote to centres asking that a letter be sent to all patients informing them of this finding and emphasising that it did not change the status of patients already informed that they were 'at risk'. The doctors were asked to give patients the opportunity to discuss the finding if they wished.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.12/4">The patient notification exercises were supported by a wider communication strategy in which documentation was sent to others, including medical directors of NHS trusts, general practitioners and clinician and patient organisations, including the Haemophilia Society, and information placed on the HPA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.12/5">There are thought to be approximately 4,000 patients who received plasma products between 1980 and 2001, and these patients were contacted by their clinicians. However, the precise numbers of patients contacted in each exercises is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.12/6">Expenditure on these notification exercises has not been separately costed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170W.2/1">There already exist well-established national service frameworks for diabetes, kidney disease and coronary heart disease and a national stroke strategy was launched in December 2007. All four of these strategies include a focus on prevention. A vascular risk assessment and management programme is under development at present. This will target the group of modifiable risk factors shared by these four conditions. The analytical modelling and evidence base underpinning this programme indicate that there are significant health gains to be made in this area. No recent assessment has been made of the potential benefits of integrating treatment and care in respect of diagnosed cases of these conditions. However there is considerable opportunity for sharing examples in generic areas, such as support for people living with a chronic condition, across these four disease groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.3/1">The strategic Cerner Millennium system at the Royal Free Hospital went live on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-15">15 June 2008</phrase>. It has been widely reported that, following a successful go-live, initial operation did not go as smoothly as everyone involved would have wished, and that the problems experienced affected trust performance. The local service provider, BT, and the system supplier, Cerner UK, with the close involvement of the London Programme for IT, addressed the problems as a matter of urgency, and service enhancements have been implemented incrementally since October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.3/2">The trust has reported that the system became stable in its operation following changes made in November and December 2008. A small amount of additional functionality was added in mid-January and, by the end of January 2009, the trust confirmed that the system was fit to be deployed at other acute hospitals in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.3/3">Lessons have been learned from the deployment at the Royal Free Hospital, which now has an effective patient record system. These lessons will help to improve future deployments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.3/4">The cost of deploying the computerised record system at the Royal Free Hospital, as at other trusts, has three components. A one-off deployment charge is paid when the trust has accepted the system. An ongoing monthly service charge is then made for the live service, and there will be local costs associated with preparation, deployment and support. The agreed deployment charge for full deployment of all bundles of service at the Royal Free Hospital is &pound;4.676 millions at 2003-04 prices, and the monthly service charge &pound;33,644 per month. Information is not held centrally about the local costs, which will vary from trust to trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189W.8/1">The Government have set a deliberately stretching target that all new homes must be zero carbon by 2016. The stamp duty land tax relief (SDLT) for zero carbon homes was introduced to help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of micro-generation, and sets a gold standard for green homes. The Government have committed to conducting an interim review by 2010 of the effectiveness of the relief in stimulating the production of zero carbon homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189W.11/1">An individual's residence status for tax purposes is not a matter of simply counting days in the UK. Individuals who can demonstrate that they have left the UK permanently or indefinitely, for example because they either work full-time abroad for at least a complete tax year or have left the UK for at least three years, will be treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident for income tax purposes from the day after the date of their departure. Once non-resident, individuals can then normally spend up to 182 days in the UK in any tax year and up to 90 days in a tax year on average, taken over a maximum of four tax years and still continue to be treated as not resident.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.11/2">Individuals who normally live in the UK or who cannot prove that they have left the UK and are absent for shorter periods will continue to be resident in the UK, even if they spend less than 183 days in the UK in any tax year or less than 91 days on average.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.11/3">Since summer 2008, officials from HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs have been consulting with a group of key external stakeholders (representing a wide variety of interests including low income groups) to explore the feasibility of putting the test for tax residence on a statutory basis.</p>

We do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties but, despite our efforts to specifically target the insurgents, there are times when the ordinary people of Afghanistan are harmed by the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.9/2">We are deeply saddened by any civilian deaths in Afghanistan. We particularly regret incidents where civilians are killed as a result of actions by international forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.9/3">We continue to take incidents of civilian casualties very seriously. They present a real risk to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and international forces' presence and support in Afghanistan. ISAF has made strenuous efforts to reduce incidents. The UK welcomes the recent Tactical directive from the commander of ISAF which further tightens the rules of engagement in Afghanistan to cut civilian casualties. The new rules stress the need for proportionate use of force and for Afghan forces to take the lead in searching Afghan homes and religious sites unless a clear danger is identified.</p>

In negotiating with international organisations as they set their budgets for 2009-10, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) will endeavour to limit budget increases to zero real growth. The fall in sterling will have an impact on subscriptions paid in US Dollars and Euros. The FCO shares the burden of exchange rate movements on international subscriptions with the Treasury under the arrangement whereby the Treasury fund 60 per cent. of any increase above a baseline of &pound;102 million. Our foreign currency forward purchase contracts do include an element for our international subscription costs intended to help offset any further falls in sterling.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary and I have met privately with numerous non governmental organisations, Muslim and Jewish community groups and parliamentarians. We have also written to many individuals and groups, including my letter to all MPs and Peers on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-09">9 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.6/2">As part of this engagement, Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials drew up summaries of our actions, policy, humanitarian efforts and key ministerial statements on areas of concern to audiences. These were distributed widely across Whitehall and to our embassies and high commissions around the world. Research, Information and Communications Unit (RICU) also disseminated them to their network. The factsheet evolved as the crisis progressed and continues to be updated regularly. I will place a copy of the latest factsheet in the Library of the House.</p>
