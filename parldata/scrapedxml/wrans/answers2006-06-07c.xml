	<p pid="c.617W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.617W.9/2">The frequency of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd testing is determined by EU legislation but this does not establish the frequency of tests on individual cattle. In Great Britain, cattle herds are tested every one, two, three or four years depending on how widespread bTB is in their respective regions; these frequencies are reviewed on an annual basis. The percentage of herds and parishes being tested annually has increased over the last few years; currently, about 25 per cent. of herds are tested annually and another 14 per cent. are tested every two years. In 2005, approximately 43,500 herd tests were carried out on 4.85 million cattle.</p>
	<p pid="c.617W.9/3">An analysis of bTB testing coverage in the GB cattle population has been carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and published in the Proceedings of the Society for Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine 2006<sup>(1)</sup>. The findings from this preliminary work showed that 71 per cent. to 85 per cent. of the cattle included in the study appeared not to have been bTB tested during their lifetimes. However, it should be noted that the study included cattle which had lived through the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak when bTB testing was severely disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="c.617W.9/4">Many of the animals not being tested do not present a disease control risk. For example, some animals in low risk herds are slaughtered prior to a herd test becoming due. However, we accept that a small percentage of animals missing a bTB test may present a disease risk. Defra is supporting further work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.617W.9/5">Recent policy changes should have a positive effect on the percentage of animals being tested during their lifetimes, such as the introduction of zero tolerance for overdue herd tests and pre-movement testing for animals moving out of high risk herds.</p>
	<p pid="c.617W.9/6">In addition to live skin testing of cattle, the bTB surveillance programme is supplemented by statutory inspection of cattle carcases at slaughterhouses by the Meat Hygiene Service.</p>

	<p pid="c.619W.15/3">The Government do not however propose to introduce a Graduated Fixed Penalty and Deposit Scheme.

The proposals are contained in the Road Safety Bill, currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.619W.15/4">The new Scheme would allow for a graduated system of fixed penalties for traffic and roadworthiness offences, so that the level of penalty would vary according to the level of offence severity and number of offences committed. There would also be new arrangements for enforcement examiners of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency to issue fixed penalty notices.</p>
	<p pid="c.619W.15/5">There would also be a provision for the taking of deposits, similar to arrangements in many other EU countries. This would require drivers without satisfactory proof of an address in the UK to make an immediate payment at the roadside at the time the offence is committed. The deposit would be returned if the driver was subsequently found innocent by the Courts.</p>

Military aircrew continue to form part of the strategy for delivery of this future service. Real-life training experience will be provided for military aircrew both through the training they will undergo to fulfil this role and their operational experience. This in turn will continue to meet our policy of transferring skills to the deployable military forces. Counter-terrorism capabilities will also continue and will be provided by equally capable military units in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.633W.5/1">Child care costs are affected by a number of factors, such as the availability of child care provision, local wage levels, or land or rental prices where child care is offered. The child care element of the working tax credit has had a significant impact on the affordability of child care for low to moderate-income families, reducing the proportion of child care costs that they pay. Through the child care element of the working tax credit, working parents receive financial assistance with up to 80 per cent. of the costs of registered and approved child care, up to a maximum of &pound;300 per week (&pound;175 for one child). In April 2006 374,000 families were benefiting from the child care element, and they were receiving an average of &pound;50 per week towards their child care costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.633W.5/2">The Government remain committed to its vision to ensure that all families are able to afford flexible, high quality child care services that are appropriate to their needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.638W.6/1">Neither the daily costs nor the per copy costs of producing the <i>Official Report</i> are held in the form requested, as the printing and publishing contract structure allows for payments in relation to printing consolidated classes of papers supplied complete. Internal staff, and other costs, are not associated with them or apportioned to individual documents. The following figures have been derived from printing contract data. The total printing expenditure per sitting day on the daily part of the <i>Official Report</i> for financial year 2005-06 is estimated at approximately &pound;11,300, which equates to about &pound;9.10 per copy taken by the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.642W.2/1">These are matters for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). Anthony Douglas, the chief executive, has written to my hon. Friend with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Anthony Douglas, dated June 2006</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/3" class="indentitalic">Parliamentary Questions Concerning CAFCASS</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/4" class="indent">I am writing to you in response to the three parliamentary questions that you tabled recently.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/5" class="indentitalic">PQ74682&mdash;what reasons were given by the relevant trade unions for rejecting the pay offer made to staff at the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service during 2005-06; and if he will make a statement</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/6" class="indent">The pay award for 2005/06 was rejected because the initial offer was regarded as too low. Following a short and constructive negotiation, a revised offer was accepted.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/7" class="indentitalic">PQ74683&mdash;how many vacancies there were in the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service in the most recent period for which figures are available, broken down by region</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/8" class="indent">At the end of March 2006, CAFCASS staff vacancies were equivalent to 65.3 full time posts, broken down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/9" class="indent">Family Court Advisors&mdash;37.9;</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/10" class="indent">Service Managers&mdash;7.5; and</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/11" class="indent">Others&mdash;19.9</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/12" class="indent">A regional breakdown is attached. The vacancies represent 3.5% of the workforce. CAFCASS vacancies levels are kept under regular review.</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/13" class="indentitalic">PQ74683&mdash;what plans he has to negotiate a new strategic pay deal with the trade unions in the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service</p>
	<p pid="c.642W.2/14" class="indent">CAFCASS has agreed a set of principles with the CAFCASS trade unions, to underpin a strategic pay review, and discussions on the review have started. Completion is expected before the end of 2006, with at least partial implementation anticipated from April 2007, depending on the progress made and budgetary considerations at the time.</p>

Complaints about CAFCASS in particular cases, which are not resolved by its complaints procedure, can be referred to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. CAFCASS' annual reports and accounts are audited by the National Audit Office before they are published and laid before Parliament. In addition, CAFCASS has a non-executive board; the chair and 10 members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and 2 members are co-opted to provide particular expertise.</p>

However, we know that a number of schools incorporate chess clubs within their study support (out of school hours learning) provision. Schools and local authorities have access to Government funding for study support and the freedom to decide which activities to offer to best meet local need and demand. By 2010 the Government also wants all schools, as part of their extended schools provision, to provide a varied range of interesting activities, such as chess clubs, before and after school and during the school holidays.</p>

	<p pid="c.654W.2/1">Local authorities are not obliged to provide milk, but where they do so they must provide it free of charge to pupils entitled to receive a free school lunch. Local authorities decide whether or not to provide whole milk. They are also free to make use of the EU School Milk Subsidy Scheme, which reduces the cost of whole milk and semi-skimmed milk purchased. The new nutritional standards in schools, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-19">19 May 2006</phrase>, stipulate that only semi-skimmed and skimmed milk should be made available in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.654W.2/2">The advice of the School Meals Review Panel and the School Food Trust was that only very young children require full-fat milk as part of their diet; and that once children are at school, semi-skimmed and skimmed versions of milk are entirely adequate. This approach reflects current nutrition advice, which is based on advice from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (now replaced by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) who considered this issue in relation to cardiovascular disease. Current advice highlights the important role that milk and dairy products play in children's diets, particularly their contribution to children's calcium intake; and states that school-aged children should have the opportunity to choose lower fat versions of milk as these contain at least the same amount of calcium as whole milk, but less fat.</p>

It will give independent support and advice to schools and parents to improve the standard of school meals and to ensure that the issue of school food remains high on the agenda. We have developed a parents' toolkit &quot;Food in Schools: A short guide for parents and carers&quot; which encourages parents to take an interest in the food their children are being served at school and supporting what happens at school in the home.</p>

	<p pid="c.658W.2/2">Schools' core business is teaching and learning, but teachers themselves recognise that to achieve the best results they must supplement their focus on teaching and learning with appropriate additional support, and work with other professional agencies to remove barriers to achievement. The Every Child Matters reforms will help them do this by enabling schools to link in with wider children's services, and access their expertise and experience. This is particularly useful in helping schools respond to the needs of more vulnerable young people, such as those who may run away. In addition, the Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme is improving integrated working at the local level along with enhanced information sharing between children's services leading to earlier identification of young people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/3">More broadly, there exist opportunities within the current curriculum, under PSHE and Citizenship Frameworks, for schools to explore issues to do with recognising and managing risks (i.e. if you run away, what risks would you face); understanding emotions and strategies for dealing with stress; the importance of family and stable relationships; and knowing where to get help. We are not prescriptive with schools about what issues schools explore to achieve the learning objectives set out within the frameworks, and local need determines local provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/4">In addition, DfES has run 6 development projects to test out how best to provide safe, flexible and responsive community-based services that can be easily incorporated into mainstream children's services. When we disseminate the lessons learnt so far from these, later this year, they will include information, materials and support models from work with schools in the pilot areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.662W.5/1">The Department has a health and attendance management strategy that draws on the recommendations of the &quot;Choosing health&quot; White Paper, &quot;Health, Work and Well-Being&quot; document and &quot;Small Change Big Difference Campaign (SCBD)&quot;. In this context, we have recently delivered a number of initiatives to promote health and well being within the Department. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/2" class="indent">Health Events on all of our sites to promote &quot;5 a day&quot; where literature on 5 a day was supplied by the Department of Health and this was distributed to staff along with free fruit. These events were well attended with around 50 per cent. of our staff participating;</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/3" class="indent">Free pedometers have been made available to all staff along with literature supplied to us by the British Heart Foundation and Countryside Agency on the benefits of walking. Around half our staff have come forward to claim their pedometer and we plan to distribute more at future health events;</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/4" class="indent">Yearly site health check events where staff are offered health literature, weight assessment, cholesterol tests, lung function and blood pressure tests. Our last events were held in October 2005;</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/5" class="indent">The launch of our new smoking policy, shortly after National No Smoking Day (8/3/2006). This acted as a launch pad to announce that we will close all our smoking rooms, in line with the commitment that we have made to the Health Secretary to make DfES smoke free by the end of 2006. We have offered the services of our occupational health advisers to have initial discussions with staff about giving up smoking and we have distributed smoking cessation literature supplied to us by the Department of Health. We intend to provide focussed smoking cessation support to all staff who require it as we close down our smoking rooms on a phased site by site basis throughout 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/6" class="indent">We have ensured that our catering contractor, Aramark, provides health options in the staff canteens including reducing salt levels in food, using semi skimmed milk, lowering fat content and vegetarian options;</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/7" class="indent">Our two largest sites (London and Sheffield) have a gym available to all staff and all sites have exercise or well-being classes such as aerobics or yoga with the exception of Darlington (one of our smaller sites) where there was insufficient demand.</p>
	<p pid="c.662W.5/8">As the programme of work on SCBD develops, the Department of Health will be working across all of Government to ensure the programme joins up to promote maximum impact. DoH is leading the implementation for this initiative as part of its cross-Government commitment to deliver the public health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot;.</p>

Implementation will be staged&mdash;as was recommended in Sir Michael Bichard's report into the Soham murders&mdash;to ensure that the new requirements are established effectively. Until then the current barring schemes will continue to operate alongside the system of Criminal Records Bureau checks. Since the Secretary of State's review into list 99 in January, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen this scheme including the establishment of an independent expert panel to advise and assist the Secretary of State in carrying out his list 99 functions, and new regulations making Criminal Records Bureau checks mandatory for all newly appointed school employees. We will also be introducing new regulations shortly to ensure that any individuals working with children who are convicted or cautioned for sex offences against children will be automatically entered on list 99.</p>

	<p pid="c.666W.3/1">I believe the hon. Member is referring to a planning application for a new ground for Shrewsbury Town Football Club at Oteley Road, Sutton, Shrewsbury. The application was approved by Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council in September 2003. I understand the local planning authority did not refer the case at the time to the Secretary of State to consider whether to call it in for his own decision, as the authority considered the application was in accordance with the terms of the adopted local plan. It was for the borough council as local planning authority to take into account the views of local residents when determining the application.</p>

However, a study we commissioned from the Energy Saving Trust suggests that at the end of 2004 there were around 82,000 microgeneration installations in the UK, which means that at least 82,000 dwellings and community buildings are not wholly reliant on external energy sources.</p>

(The Life Time Plans set out the total scope of activities e.g. project scope, schedule, and cost which need to be undertaken over each site's planned lifetime to bring the site to its proposed end state). The process is that each site produces a skills strategy which, as a minimum, covers the following areas: key skills required in the short, medium, and long term; identification of skills gaps and links to the migration of the existing work force; sensitivities relating to demographic change; recruitment and training strategies; links with training providers; succession planning; and supply chain strategies for long-term availability of skills. The sites' skills strategies are analysed and developed by the NDA to ensure the appropriate supporting infrastructure is in place, and that any key issues or skills gaps are identified.</p>

	<p pid="c.677W.0/1">In its review of election timetables in 2003, the Electoral Commission recommended standardising the hours of polling for all elections at those used for parliamentary general elections and other national elections, to increase participation and reduce confusion between local and parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.0/2">The Government agreed with this recommendation and the standardised polling hours of 7 am to 10 pm applied generally at local government elections in England for the first time in May 2006. The Commission informs me that it is collecting data from returning officers on levels of voting during the additional polling hours, and intends to publish the results of its analysis in late summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.0/3">The Commission has also evaluated a number of electoral pilot schemes trialling extended polling hours at local elections since 2002. In these, between 5 and 10 per cent. of people voting in person at polling stations chose to take advantage of the extended polling hours.</p>

	<p pid="c.678W.3/2">Bereavement allowance is an income maintenance benefit for those who have lost a spouse who had worked and therefore contributed to the national insurance scheme, whilst carer's allowance provides a measure of income maintenance for those forgoing the opportunity of full-time employment to care for a severely disabled person who is entitled to attendance allowance or the middle or highest rate of the disability living allowance care component.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.3/3">In practice, where there is entitlement to both benefits, bereavement allowance as a contributory benefit takes precedence. However, where the rate of bereavement allowance is less than the rate of carer's allowance, an amount of carer's allowance can be paid to make up the difference. Even where no carer's allowance can be paid, underlying entitlement to the allowance gives access to the carer premium in income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, and to the carer's additional amount in pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.5/1">Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) has plans and resources in place in order to respond to a major pollution incident. During the year EHS runs two shoreline booming exercises in order to test its resource and command and control functions in response to a major coastal water pollution incident. The latest exercise, in mid-2005, was designed to test the agency's ability to protect the River Roe. In 2003, EHS took part in a major national coastal pollution response exercise in Lough Foyle, coordinated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which was designed to test the National Contingency Plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.5/2">EHS plans are currently undergoing an extensive review and this is due to be completed in the summer of 2006. As part of this, EHS is a partner in a European Union funded project designed to develop effective contingency plans which minimise the risk from coastal pollution using best practice from four European partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.695W.2/4" class="indent">how many <i>(a) </i>properties and <i>(b)</i> gardens have been bought by the Roads Service in the Shandon Park area of East Belfast in each of the last 25 years and on what date each site was (i) purchased, (ii) last maintained and (iii) completed; and</p>

	<p pid="c.695W.2/7" class="indent">By way of background, I should explain that the proposed widening of the A55 at Knock Road is included in the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan and Roads Service's Major Works Preparation Pool. The two detailed options still being considered are a dual carriageway or two lanes in both directions with right turning lanes at junctions. Both of these options currently include a link road from Ascot Park to Shandon Park. We plan to present these options at a public consultation day in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.2/8" class="indent">In the past 25 years, 2 properties/gardens were acquired by Roads Service for the proposed A55 widening scheme&mdash;number 2 Shandon Park (purchased <phrase class="date" code="1984-05-23">23 May 1984</phrase>) and number 4 Shandon Park (purchased <phrase class="date" code="1987-12-07">7 December 1987</phrase>). Both these properties were subsequently demolished. In addition, 2 properties/gardens were acquired for the associated proposed link road from Ascot Park to Shandon Park&mdash;number 11 Shandon Park (purchased <phrase class="date" code="1997-11-17">17 November 1997</phrase>) and number 13 Shandon Park (purchased <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-07">7 February 2003</phrase>). The total cost for these two properties was &pound;406,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.2/9" class="indent">The day-to-day management of property acquired by Roads Service in advance of road schemes is carried out by the Department for Social Development's Lands Service, under the terms of a Service Level Agreement (currently under review). This document, among other things, stipulates response times for reacting to maintenance problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.2/10" class="indent">DSD colleagues have advised that 11 and 13 Shandon Park were rented to tenants but vacated in January and February 2005 respectively. Unfortunately DSD was unsuccessful in its efforts to secure new tenants for them after advertising in the local press in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.2/11" class="indent">I understand maintenance work has been ongoing at these properties. At 11 Shandon Park work was carried out between February and April 2005 with further work to be carried out this month.

	<p pid="c.698W.2/1">Sex offender compliance with the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is high at around 97 per cent. in Northern Ireland. Notifications are recorded by the police on a live database and the number of unregistered offenders in breach of the requirements may therefore fluctuate on a daily basis. A search of the database to provide the information in reply to the hon. Gentleman's question showed that the number of offenders subject to the notification requirements and for whom the police did not have a current residential address has now reduced to 11. The offences for which these offenders had been convicted were as follows: three for rape; one attempted rape; two unlawful carnal knowledge; two indecent assault on a female; two making/possessing indecent images of children; one buggery. One person with a conviction for making/possessing indecent images of children was subject to probation supervision at the time they failed to comply with the notification requirements. Of the 11 offenders, four had been subject to a multi-agency risk assessment with no one being assessed as Category 3 High Risk i.e. someone whose sexual offending has been assessed as currently likely to lead them to seriously harm other people. PSNI pursue a policy of actively seeking to trace offenders who fail to comply with the notification requirements. This includes placing the offender's details on ViSOR and PNC to alert other UK police forces, checking with agencies such as social security to establish if the offender is claiming benefits etc, and providing full details to colleagues in An Garda Siochana who then complete similar checks for the offender in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

In planning local provision of A and E services, health communities are expected to observe the general principle that all emergency and urgent care should be delivered as close to home as is compatible with clinical safety.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.6/3">However, the Department does set national response time requirements for ambulance trusts. It is for ambulance trusts, together with primary care trusts as commissioners of ambulance services, to ensure that these requirements are met. This includes ensuring that sufficient numbers of vehicles and staff are available to respond to 999 calls within the national response times. Considerations such as journey times should be taken into account when doing so.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.6/4">Guidance on commissioning ambulance services, &quot;Driving change: Good practice guidelines for PCTs on commissioning arrangements for emergency ambulance services and non-emergency patient transport services&quot;, was issued by the Modernisation Agency in 2004. A copy of this document is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.708W.8/1">Good quality scientific studies from relevant populations in the United States of America and the United Kingdom suggest that childhood obesity does appear to persist into adulthood. It should be noted that the majority of obese adults have gained weight during adulthood. However, a significant proportion of children will remain obese and become obese adults. The risk increases when one or both parents are obese. The likelihood of adult obesity also increases with the age of the child and their degree of obesity.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.8/2">Children who are obese at the age of 13 are more likely to be obese as adults than children who are obese at age nine.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.8/3">Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated critical times in childhood (perinatal, five to seven years and adolescence) when the development of obesity is more likely to persist into later life. The physiological mechanisms behind this are still being investigated.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.8/4">The data underline the importance of a population based obesity prevention strategy for children for both immediate and long-term health benefits. It also demonstrates that the evidence based multi-component treatment of obesity should not be delayed until adulthood.</p>

The introduction of personal dental services pilots in October 1998 and subsequent growth has affected the figures from September 1999 onwards; these changes affect comparisons over time. Registration rates are given for SHAs and for England. However, registration rates for PCTs are not available before 2001 because population estimates are not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.714W.0/1">No such estimate or assessment has been made centrally. The Department is quite clear in that referrals to community-based clinical assessment services, and other such centres, should happen only where it adds genuine clinical value for patients. Where they add clinical benefits and are properly integrated as part of the wider primary care health team, such services have a real potential to benefit patients by ensuring that they see the most appropriate clinician in the most convenient setting.</p>
	<p pid="c.714W.0/2">The Department is working closely with Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority to ensure that waiting times of patients referred through North Somerset primary care trust's referral management centre are reported appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="c.714W.0/3">The Department recognises however, that guidance on waiting list reporting is complex, especially in light of changing referral practices, choice, and the 18-week pathway. We therefore intend to work closely with the Royal College of General Practitioners and other professional bodies to develop clear guidance on the role and appropriate use of clinical assessment services and other similar services within the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="c.715W.8/1">It is for councils to decide whether and how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be 'reasonable' and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can. This position contrasts with that applying to charges for residential care, where regulations prescribe a national means test, which councils must follow.</p>
	<p pid="c.715W.8/2">The Department issued statutory guidance, 'Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other non-residential Social Services&mdash;Guidance for Councils with Social Services Responsibilities', which is available in the Library, to all local councils in November 2001. It was amended in September 2003 to reflect the introduction of pension credits. It does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, for these services. It is intended to ensure that charges generally should be reasonable and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can.</p>
	<p pid="c.715W.8/3">The guidance aims to ensure in particular that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness. Councils are required to ensure that charges do not put any users' incomes below basic income support levels or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent. This can lead to real improvements in the position of many users, who will cease to pay charges or pay a smaller charge.</p>

However, there is now a much closer match between the demand and supply of health care workers and there is more competition for posts. It is a joint responsibility between higher education institutions and local NHS organisations to see that nursing and other health care graduates are supported to find employment. Vacancies for graduates continue to be posted on NHS Jobs and the NHS careers information service can direct graduates to appropriate sources of information and advice.

Health visitors and general practitioners are trained to recognise deformities in babies, including plagiocephaly. We have not tried to raise awareness of parents about plagiocephaly but we give advice in &quot;Birth to Five&quot; which is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.5/1">Since the introduction of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) schools programme in 1953 the epidemiology of tuberculosis has changed from a disease of the general population to one predominantly affecting high-risk groups. The new recommendations are based on the advice of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation and are aimed at delivering an improved targeted risk based programme. The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.5/2">The Chief Medical Officer announced changes to the BCG programme via a letter to the medical profession and primary care trusts on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase>. In support of these changes an updated leaflet, factsheet, and poster were produced and sent directly to the professionals and primary care trusts. All of these resources were aimed at raising awareness of tuberculosis, and also informing health professionals and the general public alike, of the changes to BCG policy. All these resources were also made available to order free of charge via the Department's publications line.</p>

	<p pid="c.734W.2/1">The Government's drug interventions programme (DIP) which began in 2003 is providing a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders who commit crime to feed their habit. DIP uses contact with the criminal justice system as an opportunity to engage drug misusing offenders in treatment and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/2">Individuals who are arrested for certain offences including theft&mdash;which includes shoplifting&mdash;in the 98 areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime are tested for class A drugs as a part of DIP. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Other key elements of the programme are operating across England and in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/3">The drug interventions programme continues to have a positive impact in communities not only by the interventions that it offers but also by delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems of offenders. Since the programme began over 43,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.2/4">Acquisitive recorded crime&mdash;to which drug related crime (including theft) makes a substantial contribution fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005 compared with the previous 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.742W.9/1">Joint police and Crown Prosecution Service Witness Care Units (WCUs) were piloted in 2003 in 5 areas, Gwent, Essex, North Wales, South Yorkshire and the West Midlands. An independent evaluation of these pilots found that witness attendance at court improved by nearly 20 per cent. and that there was an overall increase of six per cent. in victim and witness satisfaction. It also showed that the number of trials which had to be adjourned as a result of witness difficulties decreased by 27 per cent. and that there was a 17 per cent. reduction in 'cracked' trials where the witness withdrew their statement or did not attend. There was a 10 per cent. increase in the number of 'positive' cracked trials where the defendant entered a late guilty plea.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.9/2">Building on the success of these pilots, Witness Care Units were rolled out across all 42 criminal justices areas in England and Wales under the No Witness No Justice project. Full coverage was achieved in line with our target of December 2005, with 165 Witness Care Units now in operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.9/3">Although relatively new, Witness Care Units have already demonstrated their effectiveness. The number of trials that did not go ahead as planned because a witness did not attend was reduced from a national average of 908 in September 2004 to 727 in August 2005, a decrease of almost 20 per cent. In those cases handled by Witness Care Units, the witness attendance rate has increased from 78.5 per cent. in the 3 months before WCUs went live to 84 per cent. in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.9/4">A sustainability plan for the project is currently being developed which will provide a detailed analysis of the benefits of Witness Care Units, taking into account savings in time for the police, prosecutors and court officials, reductions in cracked and ineffective trials and savings in legal costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.2/2">Witness Care Units are a vital part of the Government's drive to improve support for victims and witnesses. Witness Care Units, jointly staffed by the Crown Prosecution Service and the police, have helped to move the criminal justice system from a concept of partnership to a reality, where Government, agencies and practitioners work together to deliver better services for the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.2/3">It is important that witnesses are valued, kept informed and looked after whether or not they are called upon to attend court. Witness Care Units ensure that witnesses receive a more thoughtful and tailor-made service, with their individual needs considered from the time a statement is first taken by the police. If the case proceeds to court, witnesses will have a single point of contact to keep them up to date on how the case is proceeding, if and when they are required to give evidence and what the final outcome is.</p>

	<p pid="c.752W.5/1">The Home Secretary's letter setting priorities for the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in its first year of operation has been laid before Parliament. The priorities set out there include tackling organised crime threats from fraud against individuals and the private sector. The SOCA Board has subsequently determined that approximately 10 per cent. of its overall effort should be devoted to fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.752W.5/2">The Home Secretary has set a broad performance framework for SOCA within which its performance will be judged on its ability to contribute to the reduction of the harm caused to the UK by serious crime. The measures on which SOCA will be judged will include the quality of its knowledge and understanding of the crime networks and markets in its priority areas, and the dislocation that it is achieving in respect of those networks and markets.</p>

	<p pid="c.754W.0/1">The Government are determined to tackle sales of alcohol to under-18s. Enforcement of the law takes place on a daily basis through test-purchase operations carried out by Police and Trading Standards officers. In addition to this regular activity, the fourth national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC 4) is currently under way. Part of this includes the provision of extra funding for up to 5,000 test-purchase operations during the four-week period of the campaign. Those who sell to under-18s risk a &pound;80 fixed penalty notice, or prosecution. Licensees selling to under 18s additionally risk having their licence reviewed and conditions applied, or even having their license revoked.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.0/2">The Violent Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament establishes a new offence of persistently selling alcohol to under-18s. If three sales are made in three consecutive months, the new offence will be committed, and the licensee risks a fine of &pound;10,000 and having their licence suspended for 3 months. The police can offer the licensee the option of avoiding prosecution by closing their premises for 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.0/3">In addition to enforcement activity, Ministers and officials from the Home Office and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are working very closely with the licensed industry, and have secured commitments from both the off-licensed sector and the on-licensed sector to seek to eliminate sales of alcohol to children. Progress against these commitments will be monitored closely through test-purchase failure rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.0/4">The Government are aware of the problems faced by young people when wishing to prove their age or purchase age-restricted products, also by retailers when requesting proof of identity. Consequently, the Government are working with the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should be accepted. The logo is trademark registered, making it an offence to forge. In the longer term, the identity card can be used as proof of age as well as proof of identity, however, this is a few years away from introduction.</p>
