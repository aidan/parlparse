We consider that learner drivers should gain more experience before they take the driving test and earlier this year we issued a consultation paper on ways to achieve this. This included an option to introduce a mandatory requirement for a minimum amount of professional tuition.</p>

This Regulation also provides for co-operative activities between the EC on the one hand and North America and Australasia on the other, but the Committee has had no role in these activities. The Committee has met once in the last 12 months. A British Trade International official represents the UK. It is impossible to calculate the cost of its work to public funds without incurring disproportionate cost. The Committee is currently considering the detailed arrangements for the EU trade promotion campaign towards Japan &quot;Gateway to Japan III&quot;.

As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February</phrase> (COM(2001)783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government have encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through the website.</p>

	<p pid=".988W.2/1">As with a number of such legacy facilities at Sellafield, the costs of carrying out the various projects at B241 are met by BNFL with appropriate contributions from relevant customers. In the case of B241 financial responsibility for the liability falls primarily to the Ministry of Defence and the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Work is continuing. It is not yet clear what the final cost of cleaning up B241 will be.</p>

	<p pid=".988W.5/1">Changing the Timeshare Regulations 1997 or the Timeshare Act 1992 will not help UK consumers who often buy timeshare and new products while on holiday abroad. The EU Commission is proposing next year to review the Timeshare Directive 1994 and will be considering new products and other related issues. We will therefore work closely with the Commission to ensure that our views are taken into account and are reflected in any potential amendments to the Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".991W.8/3">Innovation of a technical or functional nature is protectable by patents. The maximum duration of a patent is 20 years (trade mark rights can be renewed without limit), after which inventions pass into the public domain for anyone to use or develop. This period of 20 years, which accords with international norms, represents a balance between encouraging inventors to develop new products by preventing others from using their inventions for a limited time, and encouraging competition by publishing full details of patented inventions so that they may be widely used when rights expire.</p>
	<p pid=".991W.8/4">On the other hand, trade marks indicate the trade origin of goods. Allowing trade mark registrations to confer on proprietors an open-ended right to product characteristics or technical features would upset the balance created by the patent law.</p>

But the prospect of plant-produced vaccines for the routine prevention of diseases of poverty is still a distant one. At present, an important challenge facing many developing countries is to strengthen their health service delivery systems to achieve and sustain high coverage with existing vaccines, which are safe and inexpensive.

This year's series of forums, which follow previous rounds in 1998 and 2000, have focused on development and trade, the role of the private sector, and sustainable development. Participants come from a wide range of backgrounds, and have participated in both plenary and workshop discussions of the issues. These are designed to deepen understanding of development, and to enable participants to share views and ideas on how to reduce global poverty. Feedback from participants on the process remains, as with previous rounds, very positive; and all participants will receive a copy of the report at the end of the process.</p>

	<p pid=".998W.2/1">In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the farmgate price of milk has fallen over the last few months. The most recent official figures show that for milk delivered in April the average farmgate price of milk in the UK had fallen to 16.10 pence per litre and it is likely that the average figure for May will be even lower. As a result, some dairy farmers will be receiving less for their milk than it costs to produce it. A situation that is clearly unsustainable. However, these low prices have largely been caused by factors that are temporary in nature, most notably, oversupply of raw milk in the UK and the weakness of EU and world markets for dairy products.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.2/2">For the longer term, it is likely that the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations will further restrict the use of export subsidies and increase the exposure of EU markets to world markets. In addition, enlargement of the EU is likely to lead to pressure on the Community budget, if the CAP is not reformed.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.2/3">In order to produce a sustainable dairy industry that can compete successfully on the growing world market for dairy products, the industry must be given the opportunity to trade free of artificial constraints imposed by the WTO, as well as by the EU dairy regime. The EU price support system is focused on butter and skimmed milk powder, both in clear surplus, hampering the development of genuine markets, while milk quotas are bureaucratic, constrain production by the most efficient farmers and represent a significant financial burden to most farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.2/4">The Government therefore favour the orderly phasing out of milk quotas in combination with a reduction in EU support prices to world prices, and direct but digressive aid to help farmers adjust to the new regime. During the forthcoming review of the milk quota system, due to start in June, the UK will be pressing to achieve confirmation that quotas will not continue after they lapse on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. These changes are intended to provider longer-term direction within the framework of the dairy regime, which farmers need in order to plan their businesses effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".998W.5/1">Information from the World Conservation Union (IUCN) on the conservation status of species is reported in UNEP's Global Environment Outlook (GEO 3) published recently. The IUCN analysis from the year 2000 estimated that about 24 per cent. (1,130) of mammals and 12 per cent. (1,183) of birds are considered to be globally threatened. Since IUCN's previous assessment in 1996 the number of critically endangered species has increased from 169 to 180 mammals and from 168 to 182 birds. These figures are a stark warning of the need for action to conserve biodiversity and to protect species and an indication of the size of the challenge. It needs international co-operation to address problems on this scale. We are working within existing international agreements to this end and will be looking to the World Summit on Sustainable Development for a renewed level of commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.5/2">Many mammal species in danger of over-exploitation through trade are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This regulates trade in animals and plants, and products derived from them, to ensure it is carried out in a sustainable way to safeguard the long-term survival of species. Trade in the most endangered species is banned while that in species which may become endangered is carefully regulated and monitored through a system of import and export permits. There are approximately 30,000 species listed on CITES, around 5,000 of which are mammals.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.5/3">The UK is taking action at home and abroad to conserve biodiversity. The Darwin initiative launched at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 is a fund to assist countries that are rich in biodiversity but poor in resources to conserve their biological diversity. The fifth report on the Darwin Initiative was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-17">17 July</phrase> and copies placed in the Library of the House. So far it has provided &pound;27 million to over 270 projects with links to some 80 developing countries. Through the UK's contributions the Global Environment Facility (GEF) we are helping developing countries and countries with economies in transition to meet their obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. We are aiming for a significant replenishment of the GEF as soon as possible. And DFID are supporting sustainable forest management programmes in a number of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid=".1000W.8/1">Progress was made on the importance of sanitation in eradicating poverty and meeting the millennium development goal on safe drinking water. Broad agreement was also reached on key issues such as the urgent need to restore fish stocks and address illegal fishing, and on the important role non-governmental actors can play in achieving sustainable development. The meeting also recognised the need for a strong focus on Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1000W.8/2">Other difficult issues remain outstanding, such as how the summit can address trade and finance issues to complement the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Development Agenda. There are also specific targets on sanitation, biodiversity loss and energy which have yet to be agreed. We are continuing to ensure a successful outcome for Johannesburg, including concrete actions and coherent work programmes on energy, water and sustainable patterns of consumption and production.</p>

	<p pid=".1001W.5/1">One year after the creation of DEFRA, it gives me enormous pleasure that what were different Departments are now working well together to develop an integrated approach to the problems of pollution, and especially diffuse pollution from agriculture.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/2">The increased intensification of farm production and the great steps made to reduce point source pollution from factories and sewage works mean that, as the Policy Commission on Food and Farming noted, agriculture is now clearly one of the major contributors to the pollution of water. It is also a significant polluter of air.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/3">Over time we will need to take further steps to reduce pollution from agriculture, but in a cost-effective way. We therefore need to involve farmers very closely in continuing work to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. Many farmers are committed to protecting and enhancing the environment, but much more needs to be done to raise standards across all farms to the standards of the best, and to tackle the specific problem of diffuse pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/4">Over the next few years we will be implementing the EU directives we have signed up to in order to improve water quality. As part of this work, later this year we will be holding a more detailed consultation with all sectors to follow up our first general consultation on implementing the water framework directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/5">Over 70 per cent. of nitrates and over 40 per cent. of phosphates in English waters originate from agricultural land. Up to a half of England's bathing waters are affected by short-term contamination by agricultural pollution, mainly by microbes from livestock manure being washed off farm land after rain. Excessive loads of fine silt are generated by soil erosion from intensively farmed land. Pesticides are contaminating drinking water sources, requiring expensive additional treatment at water works to remove pesticides before water can be supplied to consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/6">No one farmer is responsible for this, but cumulatively diffuse pollution from farms is having a substantial impact on the quality of English waters. That is why we have begun a strategic review of diffuse water pollution from agriculture, to identify cost-effective policy measures to prevent and control this pollution and to improve the sustainability of agriculture. We are co-ordinating this review with work announced in the Budget to review the particular role that economic instruments could play in tackling such pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/7">As part of the open approach to policy development that we are seeking to adopt in the new Department, I am publishing today a discussion document, &quot;The Government's Strategic Review of Diffuse Water Pollution From Agriculture in England&quot;, so that we can start a debate with farmers and other stakeholders about the problems that we face and how we can best solve them. This marks the beginning of a process for working with stakeholders to develop a package of policy measures to reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/8">Part of what we need to achieve is improved control of the application of manures and fertilisers to land. Through the review we are considering the full range of policy mechanisms that could play a part in the future in encouraging and assisting farmers to improve their management of manure and nutrients. But we also have to implement some measures now, to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment that we have failed to meet our obligations under the 1991 Nitrates Directive to tackle agricultural nitrate pollution of waters.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/9">We published proposals for implementing the directive in December 2001. We have carefully considered the responses to the consultation, and I am today publishing an analysis of these responses. We have decided to apply the minimum regulation consistent with our obligations under the directive, to avoid closing off other options for tackling the wider problem of diffuse pollution that might be identified through the current review.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/10">We will designate new nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) covering 47 per cent. of the land area of England, which will take the total designated area in England to 55 per cent. These are areas draining into rivers, ground water and other waters which are affected by nitrate pollution. In consequence, farmers using manufactured nitrogen fertilisers or organic manures will be required to follow an action programme to reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/11">This action will help to prevent and reverse damaging impacts of eutrophication, and improve the quality of drinking water sources. Better control of manure spreading will also cut microbiological inputs to water, helping to maintain and further increase the quality of bathing waters and shellfish waters.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/12">The overall extent of the new designations will be less than was originally estimated in the consultation document, as a result of work to define and quantify the NVZ areas more accurately than was possible at the time the consultation document was issued. Some new areas have been added, as was anticipated in the consultation document; but more areas have been removed.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/13">I am today publishing a revised regulatory impact assessment, which estimates that the compliance costs incurred by farmers will amount to about &pound;20 million per year. Costs will vary considerably from farm to farm, but I acknowledge that some farmers, particularly those who need to construct additional slurry storage facilities, will incur substantial costs. To assist those farmers who are most affected, we will extend the existing farm waste grant scheme to the new NVZ areas to help finance improvements to slurry storage facilities required to implement the action programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/14">Formal designations setting down the precise boundaries of the new zones will follow as soon as possible, and it will become a legal requirement to follow the action programme from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-19">19 December 2002</phrase>. By the end of July, DEFRA will make available detailed interactive maps of the new NVZ areas. As soon as these are available, we will write to farmers to explain how to access these maps. We will also send all farmers in affected areas explanatory guidance material, together with sources of further advice on how to comply with the measures and details on the availability of grant under the farm waste grant scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/15">We are also taking action to reduce phosphate and nitrate pollution of waters from other sources, and are announcing, separately, additional designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive that will require water companies to reduce phosphate or nitrate discharges from certain sewage treatment works.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/16">We are also committed to improving air quality. 85 per cent. of the ammonia which enters the atmosphere in the UK comes from fertilisers and manures used in agriculture. We will be publishing a booklet later this summer, which will explain the problems caused by ammonia emissions, to initiate debate on how to tackle this related problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/17">This all adds up to a substantial agenda for change. I recognise that we must secure these changes in ways which maximise the beneficial impact on the environment while minimising the regulatory burden on farmers. As we said in &quot;Working Together&quot;, we need to explore joined-up ways of working; to develop whole farm approaches; and to identify smarter ways of regulating. For example, several of the measures I have mentioned could affect the ways farmers handle manures and fertilisers, pointing to the benefits of more integrated approaches.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.2/1">Based on recommendations from the Environment Agency I have reviewed the identification of Sensitive Areas in England in accordance with the criteria in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 (which transposes the European Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment).</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/2">This review has resulted in the identification of 33 more water bodies in England as Sensitive Areas. 32 are because the waters have since the last review in 1997 been found to be eutrophic, or that they may in the near future become eutrophic if protective action is not taken. Eutrophic waters are those which are, or may be, adversely (in terms of their ecology and quality) affected by discharges from sewage treatment works serving communities of more than 10,000 inhabitants.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/3">The remaining water body, the River Itchen in the midlands, which supplies drinking water, has been identified on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/4">Identification of these areas will result in more stringent treatment being provided at 53 qualifying treatment works by water companies. This treatment involves reducing levels of phosphorus and/or nitrogen in discharges to tackle eutrophication and nitrate levels of these waters.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/5">These new requirements on water companies to remove these nutrients from sewage treatment work discharges will complement and add to the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive, and by my Department on diffuse pollution, which I also announced today.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/6">Lists of the new sensitive areas have today been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. Maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (eutrophic) and (nitrate) will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".1004W.8/2">The average time taken by local authorities in England to re-let their housing stock is one of the best value performance indicators for housing (BVPI 68) for 2001&ndash;02. The Audit Commission expects to publish information on authorities' performance against this indicator in 2001&ndash;02 in January 2003. The latest available information is in respect of lettings during 2000&ndash;01, as reported to the Audit Commission, and can be found in their publication &quot;Local Authority Performance Indicators 2001/2002 Council Services Compendium for England, Volumes 1 and 2&quot;. Because of variations in the way local authorities maintain lettings records and compile these estimates, average figures and any comparisons between authorities should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.8/3">BVPI68 is a &quot;top quartile&quot; performance indicator. The Government expect local authorities to set targets for these BVPIs which are consistent with reaching the performance standard set by the top quartile of authorities over five years (i.e. by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>).

The Housing Corporation's regulatory code does not set recommended turnaround time for RSLs to make affordable empty homes available to new tenants.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.0/1">We have received occasional NGO reports suggesting mistreatment of Christians in Bhutan. Although we have made no recent representations, we have in the past expressed our concern to the Royal Government of Bhutan that the right to choose, declare, and practice one's religion should be respected. We understand the position of the Royal Government of Bhutan is that there is freedom of individual religious practice in Bhutan. We have had no reason to discuss the issue with our European Union colleagues.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.0/3">The form and content of the Bhutanese constitution is a matter for the Government and people of Bhutan. The Commission established by HM the King in 2001 has been tasked with drafting a constitution that reflects international norms and democratic practices. The Commission has yet to produce its first report. HMG would be glad to respond to any request from Bhutan to share legal expertise and good practice on constitutional drafting.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.5/1">Based on 2001 statistics, Castle Point was not identified as one of the highest users of bed-and-breakfast hotels (B&amp;B). The authority was not, therefore, required to submit a B&amp;B reduction action plan in the first round of applications for funding to reduce numbers of families with children in B&amp;B. However, the latest data from Castle Point indicates that is has 20 homeless households in B&amp;B, of which 16 are families with children. We will be contacting the authority shortly to discuss their proposals to meet the commitment that, by March 2004, no homeless family with children is in B&amp;B except in an emergency and even then for no more than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.5/2">Castle Point, like all authorities has been sent a 10-point check list of good practice, outlining the key 'building blocks' which we expect every authority to have in place to deliver reductions in B&amp;B hotel use. In addition, the changes to housing benefit subsidies provide an incentive for authorities to lease private sector homes as a better quality alternative to B&amp;B hotels.</p>

	<p pid=".1037W.3/1">I am today publishing a consultation document, setting out a number of possible changes to the future licensing and regulation of the lottery.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.3/2">The document addresses the licensing arrangements which should apply when Camelot's second licence expires in January 2009. Our principal aim is to consider in good time therefore whether, and if so what, changes to the law governing the operation of the lottery are needed to ensure effective competition at that point, in the interests of maximising the income for good causes which it raises. The document takes account of the views of reports by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and by the National Audit Office into the award of the second licence.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.3/3">The document also invites views on the issue of whether the lottery should continue to be regulated by the National Lottery Commission, or brought within the remit of the Gambling Commission which we propose to establish, as described in &quot;A safe bet for success&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.3/4">We shall shortly be publishing a further document which sets out our thinking on the arrangements for the distribution of lottery income, with a view to ensuring that the money for good causes is spent to best effect.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.3/5">In this way, looking at both the income and distribution sides of the lottery, we aim to underpin its long-term success and appeal, so that the public can have confidence in supporting it.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.3/6">I am arranging for copies of the consultation document to be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. The consultation document is also available on the DCMS website at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>; and copies may be obtained, free of charge, from the Department.

My decisions follow the completion of Stage 1 of a quinquennial review which examined the past performance of Forensic Science and the alternative organisational arrangements available for the delivery of forensic services in Northern Ireland. Generally the agency was found to have performed well and I commend its staff for their dedication through a difficult period. Stage 2 of the review will now be carried out to look at ways of improving the delivery of services by the agency. Copies of the Stage 1 report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available in due course on the NIO and Forensic Science websites.</p>

Those training to teach 14 to 18-year-olds will train to teach whatever national qualifications are relevant to their subject, including vocational qualifications, key skills and work related learning. An extensive programme of staff training and free support materials for schools and colleges is being funded by my Department to coincide with the introduction of new vocational GCSEs in September 2002. This is in addition to existing professional development opportunities which teachers can use to address any training needs on specialist or cross curricular activities.</p>

They include measures to stimulate recruitment to initial teacher training, such as Training Salaries and &quot;Golden Hellos&quot;; a major boost to the Graduate Teacher programme for experienced entrants; a funded strategy for teachers' continuing professional development; extra pay flexibilities to allow schools to reward staff with scarce skills; extra support on behaviour management in the classroom; and funding for local Recruitment Strategy Managers within local education authorities. There were 9,400 more teachers in our schools in January 2002 than in January 2001&mdash;the biggest year-on-year rise for 20 years.

Following the first opportunities to take the test, 852 individuals had still to pass. Individuals had unlimited opportunities to pass the test throughout their induction period.</p>

As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-05">5 September 2001</phrase>, 355 had still to pass either the numeracy or literacy skills tests.

	<p pid=".1057W.0/2">As part of the substantial package of measures to help carers announced in autumn 2000, the Government have responded positively to representations made by older carers and their organisations by abolishing the age 65 upper age limit for claims to invalid care allowance. This change comes into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-28">28 October 2002</phrase>. It will enable older carers with little of no retirement pension to receive the allowance, while those with low incomes will benefit by gaining access to the carer premium paid with income-related benefits, and follows the substantial increases to the carer premium and to the earnings limit for entitlement to invalid care allowance made in April 2001. Overall these measures, together with the continued payment of invalid care allowance for up to eight weeks after the death of the severely disabled person being cared for, will provide over &pound;500 million in extra support for carers over three years.</p>

	<p pid=".1058W.5/20">2. &quot;Median income&quot; represents the income of the person or family exactly in the middle of the range of ranked incomes of the age group. For each age group there is a wide range of incomes.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/21">3. The data are from the Family Resources Survey 2000&ndash;01 and are rounded to the nearest &pound;1 or 10,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/22">4. Estimates are for pensioner units. Pensioner units are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/23">5. Pensioner units are allocated to age categories according to the age of the head. The head of a couple is defined as the man.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/24">6. Estimates have not been split by gender for couples as the extent of income sharing within pensioner units is not known.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/25">7. Means tested benefits refer to minimum income guarantee, working families' tax credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit and social fund grants.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/26">8. These results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and are therefore subject to misreporting.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.2/1">Firms with five or more employees are required to designate a stakeholder pension scheme for their staff, unless exempted from doing so because they provide an occupational scheme for their work force or allow their staff access to a personal pension scheme to which the employer makes a contribution of at least 3 per cent. of the employee's basic pay. Part of this designation process involves consulting relevant employees prior to selection of a scheme and then notifying them of the name and address of their designated stakeholder pension scheme. They must also allow representatives of the designated scheme reasonable access to their employees in order to supply them with information about the scheme. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra), which has responsibility for regulating compliance with all aspects of the designation process, has received no specific reports of firms failing to notify employees of their stakeholder arrangements. However it is a matter that they sometimes come across on following up a report alleging non-designation. Reports to Opra tend to be of a general nature rather than alleging a specific breach of one part of the designation requirement. To date Opra has received 361 reports alleging lack of workplace access to a stakeholder pension scheme, of which 327 have been resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.2/2">Figures on designations of stakeholder pension schemes are not broken down by size of company. However the majority of employers required to designate a stakeholder pension scheme for their work forces are small to medium enterprises. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has reported that around 322,000 of those 350,000 employers estimated as required to do so had designated a stakeholder pension scheme for their staff by the end of March 2002. This represents a compliance rate of around 90 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.5/1">The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries schemes during their working lives can usually receive an old age pension from each country which reflects the proportionate amount of their insurance in, or contributions to, each country's scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".1067W.2/1">At present it takes too long to extradite someone from the United Kingdom. Not only is this against the interests of justice and the victims of crime but it is the British taxpayer that foots the bill: paying for the fugitive to be detained and often funding their legal battle.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/2">The previous Home Secretary launched a review of extradition law and the Home Office published proposals for consultation in March last year. Since then the attacks on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase> have added impetus to European Union (EU) plans for an EU-wide arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/3">The Government has already announced that we intend to legislate to bring this into effect. This will dramatically speed up the extradition process between EU states, but not at the expense of fugitive's rights.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/4">It should also make it possible in some circumstances to return people to the United Kingdom who, under the old system, would not have been extradited.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/5">We also plan to streamline procedures for non-EU countries too.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/6">I am today publishing a consultation paper containing a draft Extradition Bill which outlines our proposals and invites all of those with an interest to comment.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/7">An Extradition Bill will be introduced when parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid=".1067W.8/1">The majority of prisoners have serious basic skills needs which must be addressed if we are to help them re-settle effectively into the community on release. In 2001&ndash;02 prisoners achieved over 24,000 basic skills qualifications. Almost 16,000 were at level 2&mdash;an increase of 30 per cent. over the previous year. The basic skills target for 2002&ndash;03 is 28,800 at all levels.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.8/2">We collect monthly information on the number of basic skills qualifications gained at establishment level. The Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit (PLSU), based in the Department for Education and Skills, supports establishments which are falling short of expectations.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.8/3">We have ensured that prisons are part of national developments in basic skills, and have been piloting new national curriculum materials and tests in seven prisons. Additional capital resources over this year and next from the Capital Modernisation Fund will help us to deliver improvements in basic skills by supporting initial assessment, the integration of basic and key skills into prison workshops and the transformation of Libraries into learning resource centres.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.8/4">From April 2002, education and training in prisons&mdash;including basic skills provision&mdash;has been inspected against the criteria set out in the Common Inspection Framework, which covers all post-16 learning. With the support of the PLSU, the majority of prisons have established quality improvement groups to secure better planning and delivery of all their learning provision and to respond to the findings of inspection reports. We expect the remaining prisons to do so shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".1070W.5/1">Day to day arrangements for the policing of Nottingham is an operational matter for the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire (Stephen Green QPM) has told me of the proposed changes to the policing of the Nottingham (C) Division planned by the Divisional Commander (Chief Superintendent Johnson). I understand that the changes to beat policing have yet to be finalised and implemented, but they do have the support of the Chief Constable and Nottingham city council.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.5/2">Nottinghamshire force was reorganised on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year with a view to improving policing in the county. This resulted in a change in the structure of Nottingham Division. In addition, Chief Superintendent Johnson (the new Divisional Commander) decided that he needed to increase the number of beat managers in Nottingham. The proposed changes are designed to deliver this.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.5/3">I am told the Divisional Commander also plans to address the different policing needs of Nottingham and recognise the heavy work load that Nottingham beat managers have through the changes he wishes to make.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.5/4">Increasing the number of beat managers will not reduce officers out on the streets as beat managers also patrol their beat. It is intended that there should be teams of two to three shift working beat managers assigned to a beat over seven days. This should give better coverage than the present arrangements under which beat managers work Monday to Friday; give officers improved ownership of the beat, and more responsibility in policing the area. This should help the team to build better relationships with local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1070W.5/5">The Government are committed to increasing the resources available to the police service. You may like to know therefore that in addition to a good police funding settlement in Spending Review 2000, we have, through the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF), allocated 157 CFF recruits to Nottinghamshire Constabulary over the three years to March 2003. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-31">31 January 2002</phrase> the force had 2,313 police officers which is 38 more than it had on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1081W.2/1">The NHS Plan set the context for the major modernisation of the national health service in England. It clearly sets out a vision of a health service designed around the patient, and which enables integrated care to be delivered by a range of organisations. The commitments of the NHS Plan to new ways of working can only be achieved through the well-planned implementation of an information technology (IT) and systems infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/2">In line with the NHS Plan, and in response to feedback from the NHS and the supplier community, we are introducing a far more robust approach to standardisation. An infrastructure based on universal internet technology, government-wide standards and those developed specifically to meet the needs of the NHS will give all staff the means to access the right information in the right places at the right time.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/3">Subject to approval of funding and spending plans from April 2002 to April 2003 we will work on developing the NHS' IT management structure, capacity and capability. We will also define the data, and data interchange standards we will require in the future. We will build the essential system specifications to deliver the national health record service. We will also develop the infrastructure, including broadband capacity, needed to lay the basis for key applications.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/4">Subject to approval of funding and spending plans, between April 2003 and April 2005 we plan to put in place</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/5" class="indent">Broadband access (more than 128kbs) to every clinician and support staff in the NHS</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/6" class="indent">increased bandwidth to minimum&mdash;2Mbps between trusts and across NHS Net Gateways</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/7" class="indent">Access and authentication available for all NHS staff</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/8" class="indent">National NHS directory service</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/9" class="indent">Domain to domain encryption.</p>
	<p pid=".1081W.2/10">Subject to approval of business cases, formal open procurement exercises are planned for NHS networking services (to replace the existing framework contracts that expire in 2003&ndash;04), and for NHS public key infrastructure services.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.5/2">Audiology departments were informed, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-11">11 June 2002</phrase>, that James Strachan, chief executive at Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the national health service purchasing and supply agency (PASA), working with the Department, have now negotiated an excellent deal on the price of digital hearing aids. All NHS audiology departments are free to purchase from these contracts, whether they are currently part of the project or not, provided they have the necessary infrastructure in place and relevant experience of fitting digital hearing aids.</p>

This group has completed its deliberations. The proposals in 'Options for Change' need practical testing and demonstration sites will be set up, working with the NHS Modernisation Agency. We will begin the process of identifying the demonstration sites over the coming months.</p>

The allocation for individual local authorities was calculated in proportion to the distribution of residents with preserved rights as at December 2000. The caseloads of people under 65 and over 65 were considered separately. The data for December 2000 were provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. These data were adjusted by information provided by councils on the numbers of preserved rights residents supported outside their area. These adjusted data are available on the Department of Health's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/scg/incom-sup.htm">http:/www.doh.gov.uk/scg/incom-sup.htm</a>.</p>

The Department is currently working with occupational health providers on further standards related to pre-appointment checks.</p>

	<p pid=".1093W.2/1">The Government welcome the contribution made by the Joseph Rowntree report to the discussion about the appropriate level of care home fees. We support any publication that aids councils in setting fair and realistic fee levels. The Government are putting record levels of investment into the system. We increased resources to social services by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03, this represents a national real terms increase of 3 per cent. per annum. There is evidence that this extra investment is making a difference. In a recent report by Laing and Buisson, the authors of the Joseph Rowntree report, it is stated that councils have raised care home fees by an average of 3 per cent. in the last year.</p>

	<p pid=".1099W.2/2">Local health and social care organisations are responsible for planning and providing services for people with epilepsy. The recently announced budget settlements for the national health service (representing an annual average increase of 7.6 per cent. above inflation over the five years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08) and personal social services (PSS) (representing an annual average increase of 6.0 per cent. above inflation over the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06), will provide the investment needed to support services which best meet patients' and users' needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/3">The Department has recently welcomed the publication of the Government funded national sentinel audit of epilepsy-related death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families. The Department has given a commitment to consider the recommendations of the audit and develop an action plan by September 2002 to try to improve epilepsy services and reduce the number of preventable deaths from epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/4">The Department is also undertaking a range of initiatives to improve services for the care and management of people with epilepsy. For example, we have:</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/5" class="indent">Provided funding to the Joint Epilepsy Council (JEC) to develop a &quot;National Statement of Good Practice for the Treatment and Care of People who have Epilepsy&quot;, which was published in May 2002. The statement makes a series of recommendations for good quality epilepsy services. It is intended to facilitate commissioning and will be of use to NHS purchasers, providers and service users.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/6" class="indent">Asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop a clinical guideline (due in summer 2004) for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy to help address widespread variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. This will be supported by a technology appraisal (due autumn 2003) of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new anti-epileptic drugs in children and adults, to help promote appropriate uptake and equitable access.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/7" class="indent">Announced that the national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions is expected to develop standards of care for specific neurological conditions, including epilepsy. The NSF is expected to be published in 2004. Implementation is expected to start from 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/8" class="indent">Developed the expert patients programme, which aims to provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase will include people with epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.2/9" class="indent">Provided funding to the national society for epilepsy for its living well project. The project aims to promote independent living by providing locally based short-term courses for people with epilepsy to develop self-help and self-management techniques.</p>
