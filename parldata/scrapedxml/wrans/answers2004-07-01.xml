	<p pid=".363W.12/1">East Timor is one of the poorest countries in South East Asia, with most people surviving on less than 50 cents a day. Essential services are of poor quality, especially education and health, and access to them is limited. The Government has prepared a National Development Plan, which focuses upon poverty reduction, and the international community is contributing to the Plan's implementation. East Timor should be able to finance development programmes itself once significant revenues from Timor Gap oil and gas start to flow, probably around 2007&ndash;8. Until then it must rely heavily on external support.</p>
	<p pid=".363W.12/2">Since 1999 the UK have committed over &pound;30 million to East Timor. Currently DFID is contributing &pound;12 million (between 2002&ndash;5) to a World Bank managed fund for implementing their National Development Plan. A further &pound;1.3 million is being provided over the same period, through OXFAM, to support community education. Britain has also contributed some 19 per cent. of European Commission development expenditure in East Timor. Between 1999 and 2002 (the last year for which figures are available) this is estimated to be approximately &pound;14 million.</p>

These have not yet been brought together into one single balanced assessment of DFID's performance at country level.

	<p pid=".368W.9/1">Many strands of my Department's funding, for example, that provided for road maintenance, will be of benefit to cyclists. It is therefore not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the proportion of Departmental funding allocated to cycling.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.9/2">Nevertheless, there are conspicuous examples of funding which target cycling alone. Greatest among these is funding through the Local Transport Planning (LTP) process. Local authorities (outside of London) fund cycling capital schemes from the Integrated Transport (IT) Block grant made by my Department as part of the Local Transport Planning (LTP) process. Allocation of funds from the IT block is a matter for the individual local authority. The LTP regime has been in operation since 2001&ndash;02 and only since its inception has the Department collected returns specifically on local authority spend on capital schemes for cycling. The tables sets out spend or forecast spend, on cycling schemes derived from returns from local highway authorities (outside of London), as compared with total spend on schemes under the IT block and funds allocated by the Department under the IT block.</p>

	<p pid=".368W.9/29">Since 2000, funding for cycling initiatives in London has been the responsibility of Transport for London which is funded through a block grant from my Department. Under the direction of the Mayor for London, TfL is free to allocate this grant in accordance with its priorities for transport in the capital. It spent &pound;13.6 million on cycling measures in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.9/30">Additionally, the Department awarded direct funding of &pound;2.18 million for local cycling projects through its Cycling Projects Fund in 2002&ndash;03, In 2003&ndash;04 it provided a further &pound;2.2 million through the fund.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.9/31">Finally, in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04, the Department funded the English Regions Cycling Development Team to assess and improve local authority performance on cycling at a cost of &pound;3.18 million including VAT.</p>

The charge will be increased again probably in 2005 after the expected roll-out of MOT computerisation to provide VOSA with additional income to fund a full year's operation of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".371W.0/3">VOSA's income from sales of pads of MOT certificates covers its costs administering and controlling standards in the MOT testing scheme. Since 2000 the charge has also funded VOSA's costs managing the PFI contract with Siemens Business Services (SBS) to deliver MOT computerisation. The additional income raised as a result of the certificate charge increase of 25p per certificate in August 2003, was &pound;3.99 million. Some income from charges will be used to smooth the transition to the full certificate charge increase that will be necessary to fund the MOT computerised service once all MOT garages are linked to the service from mid-2005.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.3/1">As far as schools PFI projects are concerned the Department does not collect or collate such information as to do so would involve disproportionate cost. These matters are part of the commercial contractual arrangements between local authorities and private sector providers. The standard schools PFI contract provides for any re-financing gains subsequent to contract signature to be shared equally between the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.3/2">Neither the Department nor its NDPBs have a direct interest in PFI projects in the HE or FE sector and therefore the information is not collected.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.6/1">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase> to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. During this time there was widespread concern at the unrestricted sale of school playing fields. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the proceeds as it wished. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that they meet the needs of local schools and their communities and that any proceeds are used to improve school sports provision or education facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".387W.2/2">Under the provisions of the British Museum Act 1963, the museum is governed by a board of 25 trustees, 15 of whom are appointed by the Prime Minister, following an open and transparent selection process in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments' Code of Practice. Candidates are assessed against criteria reflecting the role they are to fill and detailed in role and person specifications published on the websites of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Cabinet Office. Of the remaining 10 trustees, one is appointed by HM the Queen, one each by the Royal Academy, Society of Antiquaries, the British Academy and the Royal Society, and five by the trustees themselves. Serving trustees' performance is assessed by the chair and this informs Ministers' decision whether or not to reappoint for a second term.</p>

The 2003&ndash;04 survey of partnerships found that 85 per cent. of schools offer cricket to their pupils, making it the sixth most popular sport out of over 40 offered across all partnership schools. 45 per cent. of partnership schools have links with community cricket clubs (cricket being second only to football). We are providing over &pound;800,000 to the England and Wales Cricket Board from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 to enable them to increase further the numbers both of school-club links and of schools and pupils benefiting from them.</p>

	<p pid=".390W.8/1">Long waiting times have developed in Somerset because Somerset Drugs Service provides a wide range of treatment services and there were unpredicted peaks in demand on some of these services during last year. Subsequently waiting times increased for some services, specifically drug rehabilitation services.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/2">There was also a breakdown in communication between Somerset Drug Services and Drug Action Team commissioners, including Primary Care Trust commissioners. However, the Drug Action Team commissioners have re-established links and with the support of the National Treatment Agency are working to ensure such a breakdown does not occur again. All partners are working together with the service to get back on track and to ensure that waiting times are reduced. A variety of strategies have been put into place to reduce waiting times, for example:</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/3" class="indent">The Drug Action Team (DAT) is involved in the National Treatment Agency Opening Doors programme to reduce waiting times;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/4" class="indent">The DAT has invested in two peripatetic nurses in Somerset Drugs Service as a resource to reduce waiting times;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/5" class="indent">The DAT has made additional funding available of &pound;205,600 for prescribing in this financial year to provide an additional 74 places;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/6" class="indent">The DAT commissioned a Strategic Review of the whole adult drug treatment system, which makes clear recommendations about reconfiguration of service provision, which the DAT is currently taking forward;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.8/7" class="indent">The DAT has established data collection system for waiting times by modality to ensure accurate monitoring is in place.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.5/1">The Government has carefully considered whether defendants in cases of sexual offences, including those working within the education system, should be entitled to anonymity until conviction.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/2">We do not believe that there is a case for this. While we appreciate that those accused can suffer distress, the Government believes that it is vital to maintain the principles of open justice which are necessary to the maintenance of public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".394W.5/3">The Association of Chief Police Officers have strengthened guidance on safeguards for those subject to accusations of sex abuse before they are charged. The Government is keen for effective measures to be put in place in this area and believes this is the right approach to dealing with the concerns. In addition, the Government committed to monitoring the results of the revised guidance and Press Complaints Commission regulation through the interdepartmental ministerial group on sex offending which has a remit to monitor the impact of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.0/1">The Government's Strategy for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology sets out a new and enhanced role for the Promoting Science, Engineering and Technology for Women unit, now renamed the DiverSETy team to reflect its broader focus on all under-represented groups in SET. Since the publication of the Strategy, the DiverSETy team has been through a tendering process for the Resource Centre, followed by contract negotiations. A contract with the JIVE consortium was signed in May 2004, and the official launch will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase>. The DiverSETy team also facilitated the appointment process of the Independent Implementation Group which has met twice. The members of this group were announced in January 2004 and the DiverSETy team provides secretariat support for its meetings. The DiverSETy team is strengthening relationships with relevant policy areas across DTI, other Government Departments (including their agencies) and the Research Councils to ensure that the representations and participation of women in SET is considered and incorporated across Government. This includes working towards the Government's target of 40 per cent. female representation on public bodies/policy committees by 2008 on which the DiverSETy team leads. The team is tasked with ensuring that mainstream science policy does not disadvantage women in SET and therefore scrutinises and comments on OST and Research Council policy documents to ensure that diversity is mainstreamed. Recently, it has also been working collaboratively with the DfES and the Treasury on the Skills chapter of the 10 year framework for Science and Innovation to ensure continuity of effort for girls and women in SET throughout education and employment.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.6/1">We welcomed the Royal College of Physicians' report and believe it is a useful contribution to the debate on how to improve National Health Service allergy services. It is the role of primary care trusts, in partnership with local stakeholders, to decide what services to provide for their populations, including those with allergies. They are best placed to understand local health care needs and commission services to meet them.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/2">The information about the number of people requiring treatment from specialist allergy doctors is not held centrally. However the Royal College of Physicians estimated in their 2003 Report, &quot;Allergy&mdash;the unmet need: a blueprint for better patient care&quot;, that around one in six of the population is affected by allergy.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/3">The Department's September 2003 workforce census records 24 hospital medical staff specialising in allergy, including 20 consultants. The number of hospital medical allergy staff as a whole has doubled since September 2000, the first year allergy was collected as a separate speciality and numbers of consultants specifically increased by 14. The NHS Plan also announced that there would be 1,000 general practitioners with special interests by 2004. Already, there are over 100 GP-led schemes and around 35 nurse-led schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/4">Allergy has been allocated an additional centrally funded specialist registrar post in 2004&ndash;05 and a further centrally funded specialist registrar post in 2005&ndash;06. This is in recognition of the desire to increase the allergy workforce and trusts will still have the opportunity to locally fund further posts.</p>

In December 2003, the CSM issued advice on the use of SSRIs that paroxetine, venlafaxine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram should not be used in children and young people under 18 years because of a lack of benefit in this patient population and an increased risk of adverse events, including suicidal behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.0/3">The Department has commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop service guidance on tumours of the brain and central nervous system for use in the national health service in England and Wales. The guidance will address services for the diagnosis, staging and treatment, follow up, rehabilitation and specific elements of supportive and palliative care that meet the particular needs of patients with brain and central nervous system tumours and of their families and carers. NICE expects to publish the guidance in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.0/4">The distinct needs of children with cancer have been increasingly recognised over recent years. That is why we have also commissioned NICE to produce service guidance for the NHS on child and adolescent cancers. The guidance will include recommendations on optimal forms of diagnostic services, treatment, support services and palliative care. It will also include advice on research, the transition from paediatric to adult services and specialist follow up for late effects of treatment. We expect the guidance to be published in February next year.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.0/5">Both sets of guidance will support the planning, organisation and commissioning of services to ensure the best possible outcomes for cancer patients.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.0/6">The Department issued Referral &quot;Guidelines for Suspected Cancer&quot; in 2000 to help general practitioners identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer and who therefore require urgent assessment by a specialist. These guidelines include a section on brain tumours in children.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.0/7">The guidelines are currently being updated by NICE and are due to be published next year. The Department provides specific funding for a specialised research network on paediatric oncology. This network is led by the United Kingdom children's cancer study group (UKCCSG). The brain tumour group of the UKCCSG is currently running eight trials. In addition, several other trials are under development and a number of recent studies are being analysed.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.3/1">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. A two week outpatient waiting time standard was introduced in 2000 for all urgent general practitioner referrals of suspected cancer. In the last quarter&mdash;January to March 2004&mdash;99.5 per cent, of urgent GP referrals for suspected brain and central nervous system cancers were seen by a specialist within two weeks. From 2001, a maximum waiting time of one month from urgent referral to first treatment was introduced for all children with cancer, including brain cancer. In the last quarter, all children who were urgently referred and subsequently diagnosed with cancer were treated within one month. By 2005, there will be a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first treatment and two months from urgent referral to first treatment for all patients with cancer. Progress towards these targets is being achieved through increased investment, additional staffing levels, installing new and replacement radiotherapy and diagnostic facilities and streamlining care processes through the cancer services collaborative&mdash;improvement partnership.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.2/1">The Government established a coalition for cancer information (CCI) in June 2002. The CCI brings together producers and consumers of cancer information from national voluntary organisations, the National Cancer Research Institute, the national health service and the Department. It has been established to oversee the development, delivery and dissemination of high quality information materials for those affected by cancer, including those with brain tumours, and their carers.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/2">Recently published guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on improving supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer will benefit all patients with cancer, including those with brain tumours, and their carers. The Government have also commissioned NICE to develop service guidance on tumours of the brain and central nervous system for use in the NHS in England and Wales. Both pieces of guidance cover aspects of care such as communication and information. NICE has also been commissioned to produce service guidance for the NHS on child and adolescent cancers. The guidance will look at the interface with services provided by non NHS providers, including those providing support for families, carers and siblings, including bereavement support.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/3">The Department also recently awarded a Section 64 core grant to the United Kingdom Brain Tumour Society of &pound;34,000 spread over the three years beginning 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.5/1">There are a number of initiatives underway, many in conjunction with the voluntary sector and support groups, to increase both men's general health awareness and men's awareness of cancer. Most recently the Department provided &pound;30,000 funding towards the production of the Men's Health Forum's Hayne's Cancer Manual for Men, a practical guide for men explaining the causes, symptoms and treatments for cancer in a style that is more accessible and appealing to men.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.5/2">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) improving outcomes in breast cancer guidance clearly stages that men are entitled to the same breast cancer services as women, though male breast cancer is very rare with under 300 reported cases in each year.</p>

To date, overall infant mortality has decreased across all groups since the baseline (1997&ndash;99). We are continuing to work to reduce the higher rates of infant mortality in disadvantaged areas and groups through the Government's health inequalities strategy, &quot;Tackling Health Inequalities: A Programme for Action&quot; (2003), and initiatives such as Sure Start.

Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. This analysis is based on episodes in which the main specialty of the consultant was one of the following: mental illness, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychotherapy, old age psychiatry.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.8/1">The National Programme for Information Technology (NpfIT) is focused on transforming patient care within the national health service. The NPfIT will use world-leading technology solutions to enable NHS staff to treat and interact with patients more effectively and efficiently than ever before. There will also be managerial and administrative benefits, as clinicians, but also other staff, are freed from having to search for missing or incomplete medical information; waiting while records, X-rays, and prescription information are transferred by post; and dealing with missed appointments. However, the NpfIT is not expected to lead to a significant change in the overall numbers of staff. Rather, we expect staff to be able to concentrate on other areas of activity and allow hands-on staff more direct contact with patients.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.8/2">It is still too soon in the NPfIT life cycle to quantify benefits tin any significant level of detail. However, benefits realisation planning is an integral element of implementation at every stage for each key element of the NpfIT. Benefits will be managed and realised as close as possible to where services are delivered to ensure local ownership of the process.</p>

	<p pid=".414W.2/1">The United Kingdom national screening committee (NSC) advises the Government on all aspects of screening policy. It does not have a specific budget for the development of screening programmes. Decisions about screening programmes are made by the four UK countries after the NSC has given its advice. Last financial year, the Department spent a total of &pound;17 million on developing various antenatal, child health and adult screening programmes in the national health service. Allocated funds were fully utilised. The Department also funds the NHS research and development programme, which aims to identify NHS needs for research and to commission research to meet those needs. A list of relevant projects and their costs is shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/2">The total cost of the chlamydia screening pilot was &pound;1.2 million. The total cost of the roll-out of the first two phases of the chlamydia screening programme is &pound;13.5 million.</p>
	<p pid=".414W.2/3">The cost of the English arm of the colorectal cancer screening pilot is &pound;4.75 million. The roll-out of this programme has not yet started.</p>

Responsibility for discussions with representatives of the former civilian internees also rested with the War Pensions Agency and the DSS. Since the end of the legal proceedings brought by representatives of the former civilian internees, the Ministry of Defence, now responsible for the Veterans Agency, has of course remained willing to discuss issues not already resolved by the courts.</p>

I have also placed copies in the Library of the House. This draft text will now be consolidated into a single document and drawn up in all the authentic EU languages. These will be scrutinised by specialist lawyer linguists to ensure that there are no discrepancies between the different language versions without making any substantive changes to the text adopted at the IGC. This is detailed technical work which is likely to take up to four months to complete.
