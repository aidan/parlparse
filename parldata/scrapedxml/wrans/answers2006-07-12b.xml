	<p pid="b.1830W.2/1">I have not had recent discussions with WHO on water and sanitation in Tunisia or Cameroon. DFID does not have a bilateral aid programme in Tunisia, though we make a significant contribution to development in Tunisia through the European Commission's programmes. In Cameroon, DFID's focus is on forestry and governance and we do not have a bilateral water and sanitation programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/2">In Tanzania, DFID works with the Government and a number of development partners in the water sector, including WHO, to help strengthen policies and review their implementation. DFID has a particular focus on increasing the amount of money reaching local government to fund basic rural water supply and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1830W.2/3">DFID is committed to expanding access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in poor countries across the world. On World Water Day 2005, I committed to double UK spending on water supply and sanitation in Africa, bringing our spend to &pound;95 million a year by 2008.</p>

There will be an hourly direct inter-city service but no regular direct &quot;local&quot; West Midlands franchise service via Northampton.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.2/2">Network Rail is currently undertaking the detailed development of the December 2008 timetable. From this date, as set out in the West Coast Main Line Strategy, there will continue to be an hourly direct inter-city service between Milton Keynes and Birmingham. It is also possible that certain local London-Northampton and Northampton-Birmingham services to be operated by the West Midlands franchise may be linked at Northampton, thus providing additional direct services between Milton Keynes and Birmingham. However, this cannot be confirmed until Network Rail's timetable development work is completed later in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1835W.2/1">There are no such specific powers. However, section 94(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 requires any person diagnosed with any condition that may make them unfit to drive, including sleep-related disorders and irrespective of whether they have been convicted of an offence, to inform the DVLA. Section 22 of The Road Traffic Offenders Act also places an obligation on the court to notify DVLA, if in any proceedings for a motoring offence it appears that the accused may be suffering from a medical condition that affects his ability to drive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1835W.2/2">On notification, an assessment will be made of the person's fitness to continue to hold a driving licence. As part of the supporting information needed to retain or reinstate a licence, evidence of symptom improvement (usually as the result of treatment) is required.</p>

Due to an administrative error this was incorrect. The date should have read <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase>. The rest of the answer remains correct and is detailed in full in the following paragraph.Because of the very wide range of goods and outlets involved, the retail sector is affected by more regulations than any other sector. Consequently, major retailers will have regular contact with many departments and may also be involved in working and consultative groups. To list every meeting would involve disproportionate cost, so the following information relates to key meetings only. In the last 12 months, meetings between Defra officials and Asda/Wal-Mart took place on: <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-22">22 July 2005</phrase>; <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase>; <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-11">11 February 2006</phrase>; and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.1850W.2/1">The environmental fate and effects of cypermethrin have been known for many years. A comprehensive monograph on the subject has been published by the World Heath Organisation under the auspices of the International Programme on Chemical Safety: Environmental Heath Criteria 82, Cypermethrin, WHO, Geneva 1989.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/2">The impact assessments for the cypermethrin sheep dip products were performed in accordance with the legislation pertaining at the time of approval of the marketing authorisations. In order to gain approval of the marketing authorisation the applications would have had to meet the required standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Environmental impact is only one part of the overall risk/benefit balance for an individual product.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/3">Cypermethrin-based sheep dip products are important for the control of sheep scab, blow fly strike and a number of other ectoparasites, all of which have serious welfare implications for affected animals. Therefore, the suspension was made on a precautionary basis. Before the future of these products can be considered, the veterinary medicines directorate needs to receive and assess further information on the environmental risks presented by their use and how these can be managed. The Marketing Authorisation Holders have been asked to provide such information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/4">Additionally, the VMD and the Environment Agency have commissioned an R and D project on environmental exposure to cypermethrin released to the farmyard and the impact of recently dipped sheep crossing watercourses. The results of this project should be available by the end of the summer and will be included in the assessments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/5">The existing stocks of the cypermethrin sheep dip products would have been the remnant of the products made for the 2005 dipping season. Therefore, the likelihood is that these will be used during the 2006 dipping season.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/6">We have been working with farming groups to produce further information for farmers on the risks of environmental pollution from the use of cypermethrin sheep dips and the need to use the products carefully to avoid any pollution. The VMD, EA and SEPA have produced a public notice that is on their websites and will be made available to farmers through NFUs and agricultural merchants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1850W.2/7">The EA continues to monitor for sheep dip pollution using the same approach that has detected and reported previous incidents. In addition, further investigative monitoring for sheep dip pollution will also be undertaken by the Environment Agency during 2006. This will provide a detailed picture of levels of pollution across England and Wales and highlight any misuse of existing stocks of cypermethrin sheep dip products.</p>

	<p pid="b.1852W.3/1">The principal mechanism for funding the retraining of farmers is the Vocational Training Scheme (VTS), set up as part of the England Rural Development Programme and administered by DEFRA's Rural Development Service. Under this scheme, applications are accepted from either training organisers, or eligible individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1852W.3/2">VTS funding has been awarded to projects focusing on general transferable business skills, diversification opportunities, or skills development related to specific farming activities, in order to maximise returns.

	<p pid="b.1853W.0/2">I have received no recent representations about membership of the Committee. In making appointments to the Committee my right hon. Friend has regard more to the experience and skills of prospective members than their geographical location. However, one of the DEFRA appointed members does live in Shropshire. Also, we recently advertised a number of DEFRA member vacancies in the Shropshire Star newspaper.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/3">With regard to council appointees, the Committee's area encompasses 32 local authorities and clearly not all can be represented individually if we are to keep the Committee to a manageable size. We have therefore made provision for membership to be shared between some councils; one seat is shared between Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and Worcestershire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.0/4">The arrangement for sharing of seats was based on advice from the Committee themselves on the best strategic alliances and representation based on population and properties at risk from flooding. Within those groupings, councils will agree between themselves who should provide the Committee member at any one time and clearly we would expect that person to ensure that they properly represent issues of concern to the other councils.</p>

	<p pid="b.1855W.5/1">DEFRA, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Executive have asked the Waste and Resources Action programme (WRAP) to carry out research on voluntary ways of reducing the number of free carrier bags taken by consumers from shops and supermarkets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/2">WRAP has recently conducted a pilot &quot;Choose to Reuse&quot; campaign to encourage consumers to reuse bags, whether they choose to purchase a &quot;Bag for Life&quot; made available through retailer schemes, or to bring their own bag with them each time they shop. The campaign was set up with a particular emphasis on supermarket shopping since the vast majority of disposable free carrier bags are dispensed from these stores, and the frequency of visits enabled a more focused campaign with the aim of having the greatest impact on the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/3">The pilots took place in two areas&mdash;Edinburgh and Bristol&mdash;running from mid-September until the end of November 2005. Retailers were invited to join in the campaign by WRAP and also encouraged by the British Retail Consortium, Scottish Retail Consortium and the Scottish Executive (in Edinburgh). The supermarket chains that decided to take part included ASDA, Tesco, Somerfield, Co-op, Scotmid and Waitrose.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/4">The results will be published soon, and we will then look at how this work can be developed further.</p>

	<p pid="b.1858W.0/1">We are working in partnership with the veterinary profession to ensure that we have a sustainable large animal veterinary sector, which is able to play a full and effective part in the implementation of the animal health and welfare strategy, There are a range of challenges facing large animal veterinary practice and many of these are principally for the veterinary profession to address. I therefore welcome the recent Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons' (RCVS) symposium &quot;Postcards from the Future&quot;, as a very helpful contribution to the ongoing dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1858W.0/2">We are training more veterinary surgeons than ever before and there is evidence that large animal work is still attractive to students. However, there are issues about the retention of newly qualified vets which were identified by research jointly funded by DEFRA and the RCVS. The RCVS's initiatives on professional development phase and practice standards are examples of steps taken by the profession to help ensure that farm animal veterinary work provides a challenging and rewarding career for new graduates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1858W.0/3">We are also working with the profession to better understand the trends within large animal veterinary practice and contributed to the RCVS 2006 Manpower survey. This information will help establish a stronger evidence base which should help keep the profession informed on key issues like recruitment and retention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1875W.2/1">Local authorities are responsible for balancing the supply and demand of places in their areas to ensure schools serve the needs of their local communities and provide good quality education in the most cost effective way. As part of this, they need to determine the numbers of schools they need, taking into account the views and aspirations of parents and other stakeholders. Since February 1998 there has been a presumption against the closure of rural schools. Although this does not mean that no rural school will ever close, the case for closure needs to be strong and clearly in the best interests of education provision in the area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1879W.2/1">Manning levels in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) vary across different specialities and services, In some areas we are very well manned, while in others we are experiencing shortfalls.</p>

In terms of overall remuneration, we aim to ensure that DMS pay is comparable with the NHS.

	<p pid="b.1880W.2/1">Military helicopter pilots undergo different phases of training, which vary in type and duration according to which service and type of aircraft is involved. All military helicopter pilots undergo an initial period of elementary fixed-wing training. This is followed by basic and advanced rotary-wing training at the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury. The final phase of training involves pilots undertaking operational conversion flying at their single-service front-line or training units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1880W.2/2">The average number of weeks taken to train helicopter pilots of each service from start to until they are able to fly operationally, including initial fixed-wing training, is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1880W.2/5"> <td><i> Service</i></td> <td><i> Weeks</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1880W.2/6"> <td>Royal Navy</td> <td>87</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="b.1880W.2/8"> <td>Roy al Air Force</td> <td>110</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1880W.2/11">Professionally qualified civilian helicopter pilots would need to develop the relevant low-level flying and tactical skills in order to attain the required competence for operational flying in hostile environments. It is estimated that such training would take approximately 20 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1880W.2/12">Army helicopter pilots are always trained to full operational status. They do not operate light commercial helicopters but are trained to fly military light utility helicopters, such as the Lynx, in hostile environments as part of the mandated training programme described. Military helicopter training is not shortened or hastened to meet operational demands. It is vital that each training phase is completed and that the syllabus is fully achieved in order to produce the high standards that military flying demands.</p>

	<p pid="b.1884W.2/1">Harmony guidelines are measured in two ways: unit harmony, which is expressed in tour intervals, and individual harmony through separated service, which is the length of time individuals spend away from their home base. The former is relatively easy to measure but can mask the actual effect of deployments on individuals. Work is therefore in progress to develop a common and effective system of separated service measurement. Currently, each service has its own procedures for measuring harmony. These take account of the different service regimes for manning and career management, training requirements and patterns of deployment. The different systems do not allow straightforward comparisons of the impact of separation on people to be made between services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.2/2">A common definition of separated service has now been developed and the service rules for recording have been harmonised. These harmonised rules take effect, for each service in turn, with the roll out of the Joint Personnel Administration system. This is now in operation for the Royal Air Force and, when complete for the Royal Navy (anticipated in November 2006) and Army (anticipated in March 2007), will allow accurate measurement of separated service across the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1888W.9/1">Through its Whole Sport Plan, the FA provides coaching in the Crewe and Nantwich area. Detailed information in the requested format is not available. However, I can confirm that 15 Community Sports Coaches are employed within the Cheshire and Warrington Sports Partnership to provide coaching sessions, including in primary schools and after school. Three of these coaches spend a proportion of their coaching time in Crewe and Nantwich. Two of the Community Sports Coaches coach football, although not in Crewe and Nantwich. However, the local authority in Crewe and Nantwich has recruited a part-time football Community Sports Coach who will focus on females, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.9/2">According to Sport England figures, between April 2005 and March 2006, there were 108,209 attendances at coaching sessions provided by Community Sports Coaches in the Cheshire and Warrington Sports Partnership area. Of these, 36,428 were female, 2,632 had a disability and 2,306 were from black, Asian or other minority ethnic group.</p>

	<p pid="b.1892W.5/1">The draft Legal Services Bill, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>, builds on recommendations made by Sir David Clementi following his independent review of the regulatory framework for legal services in England and Wales which was published in December 2004. Both Sir David and the Government have been keen to ensure wide engagement with stakeholders in developing these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.5/2">The proposals in the draft Bill respond to consumer demands. They provide for a new and independent oversight regulator, the Legal Services Board, and a single and independent Office for Legal Complaints. They also provide, through the licensing of alternative business structures, for legal services to be delivered in new ways. The Government are committed to putting the consumer at the heart of these reforms, and there is also a statutory duty on the Legal Services Board to establish a consumer panel to advise it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.5/3">Taken together, these proposals will provide for greater independence in regulation and complaints handling, and increased competition through a more flexible approach to the delivery of legal services. Subject to robust safeguards, lawyers and non-lawyers will be able to work together on an equal footing to deliver legal and other services. External investment will also be possible. These arrangements will provide practitioners with flexibility to respond to market demands by providing consumers with the services they want, when they want them, and in the packages they want them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1892W.5/4">The draft Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee. The Joint Committee is due to report by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase>. After considering the Committee's report, the Government intend to introduce legislation as soon as Parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="b.1894W.8/1">The administration of disability living allowance is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service, Mr. Terry Moran. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Terry Moran:</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether he plans to review the requirement for those with lifelong disabilities to make periodic reapplications for disability living allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/4" class="indent">The Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire MP, promised you a substantive reply from the Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/5" class="indent">There is no specific requirement for those with lifelong disabilities to make periodic reapplications for disability living allowance (DLA). As you may be aware, entitlement to DLA does not depend on the diagnosis of a condition but on how that condition affects a person on a daily basis. It is entirely possible for a person with permanent disability not to satisfy the conditions for an award of DLA. There is a wide variation in the amount of help required by people with similar disabilities and for this reason entitlement to DLA is based on needs rather than diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/6" class="indent">Where a Decision Maker concludes that a customer is entitled to DLA, and in their judgment there is unlikely to be any change in the way the customer's disabling condition affects their mobility or ability to self-care, an indefinite award would be the expected outcome. Such customers would not be required to renew their claims at intervals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/7" class="indent">However, even where entitlement to benefit is awarded indefinitely, it can be affected by a change in the disabled person's circumstances. There is a statutory obligation for the customer to report relevant changes of circumstances that may affect entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/8" class="indent">Awards for a limited period are made where the Decision Maker judges that there might be some material change, affecting either the entitlement or the rate of benefit as a person adapts to their disability or their condition improves or worsens over a period of time. The customer would be invited to make a renewal claim at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/9" class="indent">As part of the Government's plans to modernise the Welfare State we introduced the &quot;periodic inquiry&quot; procedures to ensure that our customers are receiving the correct level of benefit. These involve the random selection of cases where checks are made upon a customer's continuing entitlement to benefit. Accurate, up to date information about a customer's needs is collected to make sure that the benefit entitlement is correct. It is applied fairly giving people the opportunity to have their award increased as well as decreased in line with entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1894W.8/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1896W.2/1">The social security schemes of all the member states of the European Union are co-ordinated by EC Regulation 1408/71. It provides for member states to pay their state pensions to pensioners resident in other member states at the same rate as if they were living in the paying state. The UK also makes winter fuel payments to people aged 60 or over living in other member states provided they qualified for a payment before leaving the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1896W.2/2">The UK maintains bilateral social security agreements with many EU member states, including Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Cyprus. They were entered into before the application of Regulation 1408/71 and continue to be of relevance to the Crown Dependencies, where they also apply, as their social security schemes are outside the scope of co-ordination under the EC Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1896W.2/3">The EC legislation relating to private pensions is council directive 98/49/EC on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the community. The directive ensures that the occupational pension rights of scheme members who move from one EU member state to another are protected. The provisions of the directive have been implemented in the UK through an amendment to the Pensions Act 1995. Section 66A of the Act ensures that occupational pension schemes cannot have different rules for members who have accrued pension rights in the UK but who now reside overseas.</p>

Furthermore, prisoners with any history of sexual offending and those serving sentences for certain serious offences such as manslaughter, child cruelty, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a firearm with intent, certain explosives offences and racially aggravated offences are presumed unsuitable for release unless there are exceptional circumstances. All eligible prisoners must pass a careful risk assessment before release on HDC is possible. No prisoner who is considered to present a significant risk to public safety or of re-offending during the curfew period is released on HDC.

	<p pid="b.1908W.3/1">It is too early to provide accurate figures on the area and yield of this year's opium crop in Helmand Province. However, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) Rapid Assessment Survey of March 2006 suggests that following a 21 per cent. reduction in overall cultivation last year, planting may increase in 13 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, including Helmand. Research commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has shown that in areas with better security, governance and access to resources, there may be further reductions this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1908W.3/2">Eradication was carried out in Helmand by the Afghan Government, at the request of and under the control of the Provincial Governor. The UNODC is currently in the process of verifying levels of eradication delivered, both in Helmand and in Afghanistan as a whole. Final figures for both eradication and cultivation should be available in the autumn. Eradication is a useful deterrent where there is access to legal livelihoods, tackling the drugs problem requires a range of activities including arresting and convicting the traffickers who profit from the trade, and putting in place the development programmes which enable fanners to move away from growing poppy. That is why the UK is spending &pound;270 million over a three-year period on supporting the Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1909W.5/1">Neither my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, nor I have yet raised this with our counterparts. However, education is part of the reform agenda that officials regularly discuss with Balkan states. We recognise the importance of this issue as a means to tackling inter-ethnic tension in the region. It is a vital element of longer-term stability. We have funded a range of projects to support this, including part funding the book 'Clio in the Balkans&mdash;The Politics of History Education'. Our Embassy in Sarajevo is also involved in supporting educational reform. 'Education and Youth' was the theme of our local EU presidency and the ambassador in Sarajevo has co- chaired the Education Reform Committee.</p>

Afghan Ministries are also responsible for implementation of the campaign. Co-ordination of assistance takes place nationally via the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MCN) and the Counter Narcotics Cabinet Sub-Committee, which brings together all relevant Ministries to oversee and monitor the implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS). With support from the British embassy drugs team in Kabul, the MCN also chairs a series of working groups to take forward detailed implementation planning for all aspects of the NDCS. International partners including the military take part in the working groups and structures are also in place to ensure Afghan counter narcotics law enforcement operations are co-ordinated and deconflicted with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and US Operation Enduring Freedom operations. As partner nation for counter narcotics, the UK continues to encourage international partners including all ISAF troop contributors to provide support to the Afghan counter narcotics campaign in line with the commitments identified in the Afghanistan Compact and with agreed ISAF policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1913W.11/1">Security Council Resolution 1679 called for a UN force for Darfur. The African Union (AU) reaffirmed its support for a UN force at its recent summit in the Gambia, President Bashir continues to oppose this. But, there are signs of different views within his Government on this issue. His own coalition partners, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, have said that they accept a UN force for Darfur, We will continue to urge the Government of Sudan to admit a UN force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1913W.11/2">Chapter 8 of the UN charter provides for the UN to support peacekeeping operations by regional organisations. We believe that, even with substantial UN or other support, the current AU force in Darfur would struggle to meet the substantial new demands placed on it by the Darfur Peace Agreement, and thus that full transition to a UN force needs to occur as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1920W.2/1">A formal assessment has not been made of the merits of creating a database or registry of people in the Province with foetal alcohol syndrome or other alcohol-related complications of pregnancy. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a difficult condition to diagnose accurately because of the wide range of symptoms with which it can present, signs and symptoms which themselves can be indicative of other conditions e.g. behavioural problems. In addition there are also the difficulties associated with ascertaining or establishing the mother's alcohol intake before and during pregnancy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1927W.5/3">Waiting list information is collected by time band. It is therefore not possible to calculate the arithmetic mean (average) length of time waiting. It is however possible to identify the median or mid point waiting time band. Current median (average) waiting times for children waiting an initial paediatric cardiology out-patient assessment, in each applicable Health and Social Services Trust, are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.1929W.2/1">A draft strategy for respiratory disease was published for consultation in June 2005. A final document &quot;A Healthier Future: A Strategic Framework for Respiratory Conditions&quot; was formally launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase> by my hon. Friend, the Member for St. Helens South.</p>
	<p pid="b.1929W.2/2">The framework recommends that a network of local multidisciplinary respiratory groups should be established to facilitate and co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy in their area. The work of these local groups will be overseen by a Regional Respiratory Forum which will comprise the lead professionals from each of the local groups. The Health and Social Services Boards are currently taking steps to constitute their local groups and the establishment of the regional forum will follow later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1929W.2/3">In 2006-07 the Department of Health Social Services and Public Safety has invested an additional &pound;3 million through the QMS Contract in a Directed Enhanced Service to help people with respiratory conditions. These resources will be used to provide effective self-management training to enable people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to manage their own conditions more effectively and to provide care and rehabilitative services to improve the long-term health and wellbeing of these patients.</p>
