CSU purchased items to support campaigns that had been running from 2005-06, such as the domestic burglary campaign. CSU's 2008-09 costs relate more to Community Safety Week and ongoing community safety events rather than major campaigns, hence the fall in spend.</p>

	<p pid="b.759W.6/1">The Government provide incentives and support for recycling by companies, for example through advisory services provided by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). In addition the landfill tax discourages landfill and encourages the recycling and recovery of wastes.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.6/2">The Government also provide capital grant and other funding for the demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of low carbon and renewable energy technologies under the Environmental Transformation Fund, which has a budget of &pound;400 million over the 2008-11 period. The Government also provide support for renewables through market drivers such as the renewables obligation, which is expected to be worth around &pound;1 billion a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.6/3">In December 2008 DEFRA published a report into packaging deposit systems and the role they might play in increasing recovery and recycling of single use drink containers (plastic, aluminium and glass) in the UK. The report was completed in consultation with a range of industry stakeholders and reviewed deposit systems in four other EU member states to assess the implications of introducing such a system in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.6/4">The report concluded that while deposit schemes would increase recycling, alternative schemes could achieve the same or better results at a lower cost, as the relative cost of introducing a deposit scheme system was high. For example, the deposit scheme operating in Germany costs three times as much per container as a household collection system.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.6/5">However, the Government are keeping an open mind in regard to deposit schemes and 'reverse vending', where vending machines take used bottles and cans for recycling and usually give a reward such as supermarket loyalty points or vouchers. A number of reverse vending systems are being set up by major retailers and the performance of these systems is being monitored.</p>

	<p pid="b.767W.6/1">The adding capacity at Heathrow Airport consultation document in November 2007 contained indicative flight path maps. Figure 9 shows that in 2002 Walthamstow was overflown by an average of 298 arriving aircraft a day at a height of 6,000 to 3,000 feet. Figures 8a and 8b show that in 2030, with a fully utilised third runway, numbers are predicted to fall to an average of 260 aircraft a day at a height of more than 6,000 feet. This is because, with a third runway, arrivals would be spread between three runways and final approaches would be further out from the airport, so aircraft would be higher at the point where they are overflying Walthamstow. Walthamstow is not overflown by departing aircraft at a height of less than 4,000 feet and that would continue to be the case with a third runway.</p>

	<p pid="b.775W.5/24">The Government want as many children as possible to walk, cycle or use public transport to travel to school, that is why, in 2003, it launched the Travelling to School project setting out how it wants all schools in England to develop a school travel plan in order to reduce car use for journey to school and allow many more children to take regular exercise. By 2010 more than &pound;140 million will have been committed to support the project through local authority school travel advisers and capital grants to help schools implement their travel plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.780W.2/1">Operation Atalanta is achieving highly positive results in providing protection to World Food Programme and other vulnerable shipping. It has delivered a significant reduction in the number of successful attacks in the Internationally Recognised Transit Corridor in the Gulf of Aden through close co-operation with the shipping industry and close co-ordination with other military operations in the region. While successful pirate attacks continue, these are either overwhelmingly against shipping which is not following the EU's operations advice and agreed best practice, or is in the Somali Basin further south where shipping is much more at risk given the size of the area for the military operations to cover: the military operations are rightly concentrated further north, given the much greater importance of the Gulf of Aden trade artery.</p>

	<p pid="b.785W.3/12">The CAT strategy (2005) compared estimates of the cost of carbon abated with CCS and alternative low carbon power generation technologies. This showed a wide possible range because the cost of CCS is sensitive to the cost of building CCS, its operational performance and the relative cost of coal compared to other fuels. It would not be fruitful to produce new estimates until these uncertainties have been reduced by full-scale CCS demonstration projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.789W.8/1">The Department does not set savings targets for individual national health service organisations. All organisations will be expected to contribute to the savings and, where appropriate, this is reflected when setting allocations from the Department to NHS and other organisations and when setting the payment by results tariff prices that NHS providers receive for providing NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.8/2">Table 6.1 in the Budget report 2009 includes examples of how the Department intends to meet its new savings target of &pound;10.5 billion per year by 2010-11. Further specific details are set out publicly in the Department's Value for Money Delivery Agreement and the Government's 2009 Value for Money Update.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.8/3">There is scope for significant savings through reductions in average length of stay through movement towards the performance of the best organisations, including bearing down on clinical intervention thresholds that appear to be inappropriate when compared to clinical best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.8/4">The World Class Commissioning Programme has supported primary care trusts in focusing their energy towards commissioning for long-term health gain for their local communities. We will build on this by introducing a new efficiency competency into the assurance framework in 2009-10. This will ensure that commissioners are equipped with the capability and planning capacity to drive transformations in both the quality of care and the efficiency of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.8/5">HM Treasury guidance requires that all value for money savings declared under the 2007 comprehensive spending review (CSR) programme are cash-releasing. There are no interim targets but the Department report publicly on progress towards the 2010-11 target in its annual autumn performance report and departmental report. The Department's approach to delivering savings in the 2007 CSR period is set out in its Value for Money Delivery Agreement and the Government's 2009 Value for Money Update.</p>

In total 34 trusts are participating in Pacesetters. These projects are being evaluated independently, and good practice and learning will be disseminated widely throughout the NHS. The Department provides funding and other support to the SHAs, and intends to do so in 2009-10. Final levels of funding in the current financial year have yet to be determined.

	<p pid="b.803W.2/1">The Home Office took part in the stocktake of the police complaints system last year led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission to assess how well the current system is operating and how it could be further improved in the light of experience of its operation since April 2004. The IPCC worked very closely with its stakeholders in identifying areas for potential change and also carried out a public confidence survey to hear what the wider public think and expect from the police complaints system. The process resulted in 10 proposals for change, which centred on the following themes:</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/2" class="indent">shifting the focus from identifying blame to putting things right;</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/3" class="indent">resolving the complaint at a local level;</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/4" class="indent">emphasis on quality assurance rather than bureaucratic checks;</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/5" class="indent">providing information more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/6">The proposals also tie into the recent reform of the police misconduct system and together will have significant impact on investigations into complaints against the police, and how these complaints are resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/7">The proposals for change were published in an IPCC consultation document 'Building on Experience&mdash;taking stock of the new police complaints system after four years operational experience', which ran from <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-23">23 June</phrase> and ran until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-12">12 September 2008</phrase>. In general there was strong support for the proposals, and in light of the responses the IPCC have started to implement those proposals not requiring legislative change.</p>

	<p pid="b.810W.5/2">The Government emphasised their commitment to supporting businesses and local crime fighting partnerships in tackling retail crime locally, in an update to the 2008-11 Crime Strategy, which was published today.

This objective sits alongside tackling not tolerating antisocial behaviour; saving lives through tackling violent crime; and countering organised crime. The revised strategy refocuses the priority approaches to tackling crime, to ensure that we meet new challenges and continue to have a tough and proactive approach to all crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.815W.3/2">We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.818W.5/7">The CML and FSA release slightly different figures. The CML data is for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 95 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, covers possessions on second-charge loans by regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but doesn't cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>

	<p pid="b.820W.9/1">The Mortgage Rescue Scheme was launched nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>. In the Budget 2009 it was announced that the scheme would be expanded to include some households in negative equity from <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-01">1 May</phrase>. Following the Budget, an additional &pound;80 million has been made available for the scheme, funded from the Department's end-year flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.9/2">The main costs of including households in negative equity will usually be met by lenders who have agreed to write down levels of negative equity on a case-by-case basis. However, these cases will have a higher than average unit cost as they will be suitable for Government Mortgage to Rent rather than the Shared Equity option.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.9/3">The extension of the scheme to include households in negative equity was made quickly in direct response to feedback on delivery of the scheme at local level, and will contribute to helping up to 6,000 households through the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.9/4">We have also relaxed the regional property price caps for Mortgage Rescue, to enable more households to benefit from this form of support. This means for example in the South West the cap has increased from &pound;195,000 to &pound;205,000, thereby allowing more households to be considered for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.9/5">We have also announced a further &pound;20 million funding for local authorities to enable them to offer households small loans or one off payment to help prevent repossession or eviction. Homelessness prevention work by local authorities is continuing to have a major impact&mdash;with the number of households being accepted homeless<sup>(1)</sup> being reduced by over 60 per cent. since 2003. The use of temporary accommodation also continues to fall&mdash;this is a remarkable achievement given the current economic climate.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.9/6">We are committed to ensuring households at risk of repossession attending court receive support on the day. Court desks provide free, immediate legal advice and representation at County court hearings, and we have worked closely with the Legal Services Commission to review the provision of court desks across the country. During the current financial year we are providing increased funding through local authorities to provide court desk provision in up to 80 County courts&mdash;double our commitment in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.2/7">The CML and FSA release slightly different figures. The CML data are for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 95 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, cover possessions on second-charge loans by regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but do not cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>

It is not possible, however, to determine what proportion of total expenditure on office supplies relates to recycled products.

	<p pid="b.831W.2/1">As a result of changes being made within the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) staff are being redeployed either within the agency or to roles elsewhere within the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/2">The additional costs for managing the surplus employee system within NOMS in the financial year 2009-10 is estimated to be in the region of &pound;55,000. Costs are relatively small, because the service is able to use new technology to manage these process.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/3">Staff who are made surplus are subject to redeployment procedures but remain the responsibility of an identified line manager who is required to maintain support, identify any temporary work and assist the employee to find a new role. A range of support arrangements is currently being implemented, including retraining where this is appropriate. Staff who need to relocate to find a new post are able to apply for assistance with additional travel or relocation under existing NOMS arrangements for staff transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/4">Information on the outcome of the redeployment arrangements are as yet unavailable until the new IT is fully functional at the end of May. It is NOMS policy to avoid redundancies and to date no member of staff has been made redundant as a result of the redeployment arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.837W.6/1">EU competence in relation to education is restricted to contributing to the development of quality education and encouraging member states in their responsibility for their own educational systems and content of teaching. The draft directive cannot therefore affect faith schools in the UK. We are seeking to make this clear in the text during negotiations on the directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.837W.6/2">The draft directive proposes to prohibit discrimination in the provision of services on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. It applies to those who are providing the service and not those who are procuring the service. Any organisation that is delivering a service, whether a faith group or not, will have to deliver that service in a non-discriminatory way. This is already a requirement in UK law on three of the grounds covered by the draft directive (religion or belief, disability and sexual orientation) and we are introducing protection from discrimination on the remaining ground (age) in the Equality Bill. The directive will not therefore affect public authorities procuring services from faith groups.</p>

The NGBs will define what they need for their sport at a national, regional and sub-regional level to ensure more people play and enjoy their sport. NGBs are currently planning and taking decisions on where best to invest their money, and this includes the north-west.</p>

Twenty two per cent. of DFID's total spend in 2007-08, including that provided through multilateral partners such as the World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme, was aimed at improving governance in developing countries. This included developing the capacity and accountability of institutions, such as parliaments and bureaucracies, to function and deliver effectively, as well as supporting civil society to hold governments to account and voice its concerns.

	<p pid="b.865W.2/1">I met the hon. Member in March to discuss the position of a number of individuals, including members of the Rover pension schemes, who took early retirement before the relevant scheme entered the pension protection fund (PPF).</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/2">PPF compensation payable to scheme members who are under the scheme's normal pension age when the sponsoring employer becomes insolvent is subject to the compensation cap. The compensation cap affects compensation payable to active and deferred members and those who take early retirement and remain under normal pension age at the point of insolvency unless that early retirement was on the grounds of ill health.</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/3">The cap ensures consistent treatment, based on age, relative to the trigger point for entry to the PPF. It also ensures that people who are able to take early retirement before the insolvency event are not placed in a more beneficial position than people who stay in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/4">A person who takes early retirement before the PPF becomes involved with the scheme is not treated any less favourably than a person under normal pension age who did not take early retirement. Both are eligible for the 90 per cent. level of compensation and both are subject to the compensation cap. While both will have the cap actuarially reduced if they draw compensation before age 65 the person who took early retirement before the PPF became involved could have had a number of years where they were in receipt of their pension at full rate and the PPF does not recover those amounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/5">After careful consideration the Government has decided not to make any changes. We realise that this decision will be a disappointment for some people. Any change could impose extra costs and we need to bear in mind not only those people who receive PPF compensation but also those people who pay the PPF levy to enable that compensation to be paid.</p>

Pupils now learn more about the applications and implications of science (for example, global warming and genetic screening).</p>

	<p pid="b.874W.5/2">Unauthorised absence is absence without leave from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences such as lateness, holidays during term time not authorised by the school, absence for which reason is not yet established, and truancy. Information collected by my Department on absence is a more comprehensive measure of children's missed schooling. Our focus is on reducing all forms of absence, not just a small subset. The issue is not whether the pupil had permission to be absent; it is how much absence the pupil has.</p>
