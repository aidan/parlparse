	<p pid="b.424W.3/1">The grey partridge is a farmland species whose population trend is declining. It is currently being targeted by Environmental Stewardship (ES)-an agri-environment scheme, administered by Natural England-that provides financial support to farmers to manage their land effectively for environmental and wildlife outcomes. ES includes a number of land-management options designed to deliver the nesting and year-round feeding habitats required by farmland birds.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.3/2">Recent research by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, funded by Natural England, suggests that three ES groups of options have consistently shown positive effects on farmland birds, including grey partridges. These are: beetle banks; conservation headlands; and wild bird seed mixtures. A total of &#163;34.2 million will be paid to farmers for these three groups of options over the 10-year life of the agreements (initiated since 2005) for tailored management arrangements, known as Higher Level Scheme agreements. In addition, a further &#163;2.57 million was paid in the past 12 months to farmers implementing these options through the Entry Level Scheme, which requires a simpler, generic management approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.3/3">The grey partridge may also benefit from the Campaign for the Farmed Environment work by farmers. This is an industry-led initiative to which DEFRA is contributing &#163;1.5 million over three years. The campaign seeks to improve the environmental benefits of farmland across three schemes including one focused on increasing the populations of species of farmland birds that are currently in decline.</p>

	<p pid="b.427W.5/1">The UK Government remain entirely committed to the conventional cage ban coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase> and to supporting industry during this transitional stage. I have received many questions and concerns from UK egg industry representatives and egg producers regarding the introduction of a code 4 for eggs. These concerns have been raised with the European Commission which has made it clear that the introduction of an additional production code would be confusing to consumers and thus is not an option it is willing to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/2">I recently wrote to the Commission about my concerns about the possible non-compliance with the EU-wide ban on eggs and egg products produced from hens housed in conventional cages after <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase> and requested that it begin work on a practical enforcement solution to help manage the transition across Europe. This might be through the introduction of an intra-community ban on the trade in eggs produced by hens still housed in conventional cages after <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>. In practice this would mean that such eggs may be sold in the member state of production for a limited period only. This will help protect compliant producers and ensure that they are not disadvantaged if there is any delay to the ban, or other member states do not meet the 2012 deadline.</p>

	<p pid="b.428W.2/1">Any development or use is subject to the need for planning permission from the relevant planning authority under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Current planning policy expects local authorities to assess the suitability of proposed sites for waste management facilities against certain locational criteria. These include the physical and environmental constraints on development, existing and proposed neighbouring land uses, and any significant adverse impacts on environmental quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.428W.2/2">The operation of a waste management facility is also subject to an environmental permit under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010. In prescribed cases the operator of a recycling site facility may benefit from an exemption from the need for a permit. Environmental permits for waste operations are generally granted by the Environment Agency and the agency may only grant a permit for certain 'specified waste management activities' where relevant planning permission is in force.</p>

	<p pid="b.434W.5/1">Since November 2009, it has been compulsory for every parking enforcement company to be a member of an accredited trade association in order to be eligible to receive the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) vehicle keeper data. This applies to companies issuing parking tickets and prevents the release of DVLA information to &quot;rogue&quot; parking companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.434W.5/2">The coalition Government are working closely with industry to improve enforcement practices and the compliance of parking companies with the relevant codes of practice, and with the BPA to develop a non-statutory ombudsman-type complaint system for parking on private land.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.5/1">Low noise surfacing materials are used as a matter of course when major maintenance is required on the strategic road network. As the noise reduction results are a secondary benefit it would be inappropriate to assign costs from resurfacing to noise reduction alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.5/2">Generally, noise mitigation measures are included as part of the Highways Agency's improvement schemes, where warranted, as it is more cost-effective to do this work concurrently with other scheme works. The cost of these works is subsumed within the overall cost of the individual schemes. Therefore, the exact figure allocated to noise mitigation is difficult to extract without a disproportionate commitment of resource.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.5/3">However, in addition to the areas listed above, the agency does have an identifiable small programme of works specifically targeting noise mitigation measures in the most serious and pressing cases, where practical and cost-effective measures can be provided.

	<p pid="b.440W.9/1">Co-operatives are key partners in the fight against poverty in many low income countries. The Department for International Development's (DFID's) Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund (FRICH) provides funding to co-operatives which, for example, are helping smallholder Kenyan farmers in co-operatives to access a guaranteed market for the tea they produce. Co-operatives are also eligible to apply to the Department's Business Innovation Facility. In addition our new funding instruments for private sector development will be designed to be accessible to co-operatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.9/2">DFID does not have a specific policy on enabling smallholders to form secondary co-operatives. However we do recognise their importance as one way for smallholders to capture more of the value chain and increase their incomes. These are key objectives that we support through our funding for fair trade, private sector enterprise and civil society, a good example of which I have seen for myself in Rwanda as part of a DFID-funded Social Protection Programme.</p>

Individual amounts for programme spend are not available for dengue and yellow fever. To reduce diarrhoeal disease, such as dysentery, &#163;87 million was spent in 2009, on water, sanitation and hygiene programmes.</p>

Through the joint United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Poverty and Environment Initiative, DFID has supported 22 developing countries to integrate environmental sustainability into national planning processes. With DFID support, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has delivered over 750 projects in 155 countries to improve the management of biodiversity. We also provided support during the preparatory stages to the World Bank's partnership for the valuation of natural resource assets, which will enable six to 10 developing countries to incorporate the value of their natural assets into their national accounts to strengthen sustainable economic growth.

	<p pid="b.444W.12/1">Lord Carlile, who carries out an independent assessment of the arrangements for handling national security in Northern Ireland, provided me with his second annual report earlier this year. Copies of his report were placed in the Libraries of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-15">15 September</phrase>. In it, he comments that he is:</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/2" class="indent">&quot;firmly of the view that the Security Service is as likely to gather information for the protection of the public as is possible using proper means, compatible with the principles of liberty applicable in a democratic society such as our own.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/3">He goes on to observe that:</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/4" class="indent">&quot;the Service Level Agreements between the Security Service and the PSNI have been in operation for about two years and well tested. There has developed a good degree of partnership between the two organisations, different though they are in nature, history and purpose. ... There are many examples of advantages resulting from the new arrangements. They include greater interaction between the services, better handling and organisation of covert human intelligence resources, improved debriefing practices, and more effective use of equipment for intelligence gathering purposes. The Security Service and the PSNI continue to learn from each other.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/5">He concludes that:</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/6" class="indent">&quot;The now established national security arrangements for Northern Ireland work more efficiently than analogous arrangements described to me elsewhere in the democratic world, and in a more acceptable human rights context than anywhere comparable. ... I am satisfied that the work of the Security Service now being carried out in Northern Ireland will continue to make a significant and increasing contribution to the national security of the whole of the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.444W.12/7">I was pleased to accept, and entirely agree with, Lord Carlile's report.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.5/14">The Department has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to address carbon emissions from the estate. To generate engagement throughout the management structure we have used the improved data resulting from our installation of &quot;smart meters&quot; to set specific reduction targets for all the Department's businesses. They in turn ensure these are cascaded to site level where Energy Champions are in place to lead local action. A tailored pack of information is available for use at site level to promote energy efficiency and carbon reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/15">Technical solutions, such as improved lighting controls, resulting from individual site audits are being delivered by our estate partner Telereal Trillium. A combined heat and power (CHP) plant is being installed in Quarry house in Leeds, which is estimated to deliver both carbon and financial savings (428 tonnes CO2 and &#163;93,000 p.a. respectively). Additional CHP opportunities are being assessed. We are also working with the Carbon Trust to identify funding schemes for further low-carbon energy generation initiatives such as solar, wind and biomass.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/16">We launched our AWaRE (Avoid Waste and Reduce Energy) campaign formally at the beginning of June. Working in conjunction with Telereal Trillium, this actively promotes to all staff the part they can play in meeting the 10% challenge. Information has been made available and is continually promoted to encourage staff to adopt energy efficient practices (such as using the 'off' switch). In addition, the Department's executive team have agreed a further package of measures designed to generate further savings, such as:</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/17" class="indent">Challenging the need for unnecessary equipment and removing it where need is not proven.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/18" class="indent">Ensuring buildings are not heated outside normal occupancy hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/19" class="indent">Ensuring that where buildings are used outside normal office hours, staff are brigaded together where operationally and logistically possible, so that additional heating and lighting are used most efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/20" class="indent">Disabling cooling in buildings between November and April unless there is a proven need, at the same time as restricting access to heating and cooling controls.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/21" class="indent">Site Energy Champions reporting direct to building senior responsible officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.449W.5/22" class="indent">Including environmental issues formally within the remit of local health and safety committees.</p>

	<p pid="b.454W.2/1">When invalidity benefit customers had their benefit changed to incapacity benefit in 1995, they received transitional protection that meant they had their existing level of benefit protected. Their awards then continued to be uprated in line with the arrangements for incapacity benefit. This meant that their benefit maintained its value but that they continued to be paid incapacity benefit at a higher rate than many new claimants to incapacity benefit. This remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.2/2">These transitional arrangements will not continue on conversion to employment and support allowance. However, new transitional arrangements will be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.2/3">When a customer moves from any of the old-style incapacity benefits to employment and support allowance, the cash level of their benefit will be protected. However, it will not continue to be uprated beyond the protected level. If the employment and support allowance rate they are entitled to is less than the amount they received on their old benefit, they will receive a transitional addition to make up the difference. The amount of benefit they receive will then not rise with annual uprating, but will be frozen until the rate of employment and support allowance catches up. Over time, all recipients of employment and support allowance will therefore receive comparable awards, dependent on capability.</p>

	<p pid="b.463W.11/1">The most recent evidence of the effectiveness of the education maintenance allowance (EMA) in widening access to further education was the research report on &quot;Barriers to Participation in Education and Training&quot; which was published on the Department's website on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June 2010</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.463W.11/3">The research, which was commissioned by the previous Administration, surveyed a large number of young people. The survey included questions about EMA. A key finding was that only 12% of young people overall receiving an EMA believe that they would not have participated in the courses they are doing if they had not received an EMA.</p>

The GTCE will continue to make those decisions until the point at which it is abolished. We are now in the process of considering a range of options for handling the current suite of GTCE functions, including how the regulatory and disciplinary functions should operate once the GTCE has been abolished. We will announce further details on how these functions will operate in due course and we hope to include these within new legislation later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.478W.2/1">The Department has no plans to determine the payback period for installing energy efficiency circulator pumps in either domestic or non-domestic properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.2/2">Payback periods are difficult to determine precisely. They are influenced by the unit cost of the pump, the cost of installation, the actual running hours per year and the value of the fuel saved. As these variables are bespoke to each building payback periods are likely to vary considerably. The 2010 Building Services Compliance Guide recommends the use of circulators that have an A to G rating.</p>

	<p pid="b.480W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not held any discussions with the private insurance industry on this matter but other DECC Ministers and DECC officials have as part of the Department's work on implementing revisions to the Paris convention on nuclear third party liability and the Brussels supplementary convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.480W.8/2">The conventions provide that operators of nuclear installations are to be liable to pay compensation for certain categories of third party damage caused by a nuclear incident. Operators are required to have insurance or other financial security to cover their liabilities. The revisions to the conventions increase the liabilities which nuclear operators will be responsible for and for which they will need to have insurance cover or other financial security. The Department has therefore engaged with the insurance industry on the cover it is willing to provide for the increased liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.480W.8/3">Government intend to issue a public consultation on the implementation of the revised conventions later this year. The consultation will set out our understanding of the current insurance market position and will provide an opportunity for the insurance industry to comment about what they may be able to cover.</p>

	<p pid="b.481W.2/1">Under the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003, the civil nuclear industry is required to have in place a range of security measures to protect nuclear sites, materials, transports and information. The cost of these security measures and the costs of their regulation by the Office of Civil Nuclear Security are met by the civil nuclear industry in accordance with the Nuclear Industries Security (Fees) Regulations 2005 and the Energy Act 2004 (part 1, chapter 3, section 60). In addition to this, my Department has provided some capital funding to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority (CNPA) for the procurement of large items of equipment to enable the Civil Nuclear Constabulary to operate effectively. The CNPA then recovers the cost of these items from the civil nuclear industry. In 2009-10, &#163;2.7million was provided to the CNPA by the Department.</p>

I can confirm that through the coalition Government's Green Deal we will introduce substantial new measures to enable home energy efficiency improvements to be paid for by savings from energy bills, and these measures will apply to the private rented, as well as both owner-occupied and social housing, sectors. This is a big step forward as it will remove the need for private landlords to pay upfront costs for measures that they do not directly benefit from.</p>

	<p pid="b.483W.9/1">The Pay As You Dine (PAYD) programme is currently being introduced across non-operational bases and barracks in the UK, and covers more than 65% of service personnel, who pay for the food themselves. Contractors are required to seek best value for money in the open market, consistent with meeting EU quality standards, and wherever competitive, give full consideration to procuring British products. The last year for which we have data is 2008-09 and relates to a sample basket of fresh and frozen ingredients as specified by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. 49% of this basket was domestically produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.483W.9/2">Personnel not being fed under the PAYD programme are covered by the single food supply contract placed by the Defence Food Services Team, part of the Defence Equipment and Support Organisation. This covers personnel serving on operations and overseas exercises, as well as those at UK bases not yet covered by PAYD. The proportion of domestically produced food procured under the single food supply contract in 2008-09 was 62%.</p>

	<p pid="b.484W.2/1">Only other ranks in the armed forces are paid according to the allocation of their rank and trade to either the higher or lower pay range as determined by a process of job evaluation. The job evaluation system has six factors against which each job subject to evaluation is measured. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/2" class="indent">Knowledge, skills and experience needed for the post, and how widely they must be applied.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/3" class="indent">Complexity and mental challenge of the job.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/4" class="indent">Judgment and decision-making, and their impact on the success of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/5" class="indent">Use of resources (personnel, equipment, budgets etc.); level of supervision and the jobholder's influence in the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/6" class="indent">Communication-the level of internal and external communications and their significance.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/7" class="indent">Working conditions-health and safety aspects, bodily constraints and physical environment of the job in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/8">The addition of each of the six factor scores produces a numerical score for the job. Scores from a sample of statistically representative jobs are combined to produce a weighted average score for the trade and rank. This score largely determines whether a trade/rank is to be paid in the high or low pay range. However, each rank has a pay boundary threshold and, if the score falls within 5% of it, the service concerned may exercise management discretion to allow the rank group concerned to be moved up or down across the pay boundary.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/9">Checks and balances within the job evaluation process are:</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/10" class="indent">Jobs are scored by independent single service job evaluation judges;</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/11" class="indent">Job scores (and therefore trade/rank scores) are consensus scores;</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/12" class="indent">Engagement of branch managers/trade sponsors throughout the process;</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/13" class="indent">Evaluations of similar trades from two or three services undertaken in the same year and results not published until all is complete; and &quot;Feel-fair&quot; exercises conducted by the judging panel on conclusion of each judging session.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/14">A number of mechanisms exist that provide a wider perspective on the overall pay structure, including centrally sponsored research and analysis, an extensive evidence gathering process in support of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body annual pay round, and routine communication through the chain of command.</p>

	<p pid="b.488W.6/1">The UK welcomed the report of Madeleine Albright and the Group of Experts. It rightly emphasises the alliance's enduring core purpose in providing collective defence; the importance of responding to threats emanating beyond its borders; of succeeding in Afghanistan; adapting to new and emerging security challenges, including cyber attack; continuing its process of reform and transformation; developing productive relationships with a range of partners, including the EU and Russia; and being able to play its part with others in a comprehensive approach to responding to crises. The group's thorough and inclusive work is an important contribution to the development of NATO's new Strategic Concept, which is due to be endorsed at the Lisbon summit next month.</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.0/1">The separate arrangements made by the Ministry of Defence to address the allegations comprise several elements which look both at the historical issues arising from operations in Iraq, where we no longer conduct detention operations, and the current arrangements in those theatres of operations where UK forces are still deployed. Legislative provisions to ensure that we can deal robustly and transparently with allegations are contained in the Armed Forces Act 2006.</p>

The treaty will help improve interoperability and the support provided to our armed forces. It is a symbol of the close defence relationship between our countries. We envisage that the detailed preparations required to bring the treaty arrangements into force will take up to twelve months and will be conducted in close consultation with the US Administration and with UK and US industries. By simplifying export licensing arrangements for Government end use, the treaty will facilitate the more rapid movement of equipment and information between the UK and the US whether purchased off-the-shelf, as part of bilateral project or in support of joint operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.512W.3/1">My Department does not issue guidance specifically advising against the use of technical jargon in planning applications. However, it does advise planning authorities to ensure that they fully understand each development proposal before they consider whether or not it should be granted planning permission. Developers are encouraged to provide only information that is relevant, necessary and material to their application, and to keep the volume of supporting documentation to a minimum, so that their proposals are clear. Local authorities have the right to request clarification from applicants during the determination period, and-if these requests are not met to their satisfaction-may refuse to grant planning permission. I have not received any recent representations on the accessibility of planning applications containing technical jargon.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.3/2">The new Government are supportive of the Local Government Association campaign against jargon and its 250 banned words from 'Goldfish Bowl facilitated conversations' to the 'wellderly'. And, as outlined in his speech of <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-06">6 July 2010</phrase>, the Secretary of State has pledged to abolish the TLA (Three Letter Abbreviation), such as the IPC, CAA and RSSs.</p>

A decision on the exact nature of the NCA's future role, in addition to its organised crime and border policing functions, has yet to be made, but one of the Government's aims are to declutter the policing landscape. We are in the process of considering all the responses, including the possibility of including missing persons investigations within the NCA, and my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary has committed to publishing figures on cost and the business case for the NCA in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.528W.6/5">Within IT a considerable number of services are already provided through centralised procurement. These include contract provision of the police 'Airwave' radio service, Ident1 fingerprint capture and matching, Police National Network (PNN3) and applications such as Holmes2 which is utilised by police forces in major enquiries. In addition, proposals for mandating certain goods and services for policing have been the subject of a recent consultation in the interests of efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.531W.2/1">The UK Border Agency takes very seriously the health and well-being of those in its care. This is particularly true in respect of the small number of children who are detained with their parents for a short period of time immediately prior to their removal after they refuse to leave the UK voluntarily or while checks are being made at the border to ascertain whether they and the adults accompanying them should be admitted to the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.2/2">Safeguarding procedures in respect of children are kept under constant review across the immigration removal estate to ensure that they are consistent with section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 which requires the agency to carry out its functions having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the UK. Prior to detaining an individual family, the agency considers medical and welfare needs to assess the appropriateness of detention and any particular support which may need to be put in place for the child. On arrival in Yarl's Wood, on-site social workers from Bedford borough council make their own assessment and monitor the child during the period of detention.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.2/3">The Government have made clear their commitment to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. We are currently conducting a review to consider how this can be done in a way which protects the welfare of children while ensuring the return of families who have no right to be in the UK. The Department for Education, as the lead Department for children, families and safeguarding is closely involved with the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.2/4">We have already announced that the family unit at Yarl's Wood will be closed as soon as we have identified a credible alternative way of ensuring the departure of families who do not wish to go voluntarily, despite being given every opportunity to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.532W.5/1">People should not have to make excessively long or difficult journeys to attend court. However, we must recognise the infrequency with which most people need to visit a court, compared to other public services which they use and travel to more regularly such as banks, schools, supermarkets or hospitals. We must also consider that the majority of people have their own transportation so may not need to use public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.532W.5/2">I believe it is reasonable that our court estate enables the majority of people to be within an hour's journey of their nearest court using public transport. I do however acknowledge that for some smaller communities there may be very little or no public transport, which may mean journeys are longer than an hour. For those court users who have particular transport difficulties, courts will try to list those cases at a time to accommodate this. This practice is well established in courts and relies only on the person notifying the court office of their specific circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.539W.3/1">Figures for the number of solicitor offices in England and Wales providing legal aid services in each year since 2005 are available and are shown in the following table. Prior to the introduction of the civil unified contract in April 2007 and criminal unified contract in July 2008, legal aid providers delivering services in more than one office would hold separate contracts for each of those offices. In addition, where providers have decided not to continue providing civil legal aid services, they may nevertheless still have an account or accounts with the Legal Services Commission while they continue to deal with their remaining clients.</p>

So far, two duty demands have been issued in 2010 where the accompanying proof of preferential origin showed that the goods were produced in a settlement.

	<p pid="b.550W.3/1">For reasons of commercial confidentiality, HMRC cannot disclose its dealings with specific UK companies. However, it continues to experience traceability problems as a result of intermediaries rather than supermarkets being shown as importers on customs import declarations. HMRC therefore supports the work of DEFRA in encouraging supermarkets, under voluntary labelling arrangements, to ensure that their suppliers correctly mark the origin of the produce originating in the settlements. This will help HMRC to identify such products at the time of importation.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.11/1">The IMF holds regular bilateral discussions with each of its member countries as part of its country surveillance function, under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement. IMF staff recently visited the UK as part of their 2010 Article IV consultation, and met with a variety of institutions including HM Treasury to discuss issues relating to the economy. The IMF's Concluding Statement sets out its view that the Government's deficit reduction plan will ensure the sustainability of the public finances and support economic growth. The IMF concluded that the early action taken by the Government has increased the credibility of the consolidation and is consistent with a sustainable recovery, in line with the OBR forecasts in the June Budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.554W.2/1">It is a normal part of the PAYE cycle that changes in circumstances that cannot be reflected in in-year tax deductions need to be reconciled annually. This is not a Revenue error but the PAYE system not being able to react quickly enough to changes. PAYE works well for the majority of people, particularly those with stable circumstances, but because the processes remain fundamentally unchanged since they were introduced in 1944 there are limitations. The coalition Government are looking at how to reform PAYE further and make it more efficient.</p>

	<p pid="b.554W.2/5">HMRC has put in place a new process for people with 2008-09 and 2009-10 underpayments that cannot automatically be paid through their salary deductions-generally those who owe &#163;2,000 or more. Individuals in this position will be offered the same length of time to pay as those with smaller underpayments and not face interest, provided they engage with HMRC and agree to pay their underpayment. Individuals who owe &#163;2,000 or more will also have the option where possible of paying up to &#163;2,000 through their salaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.554W.2/6">People facing financial difficulties in paying will be treated sympathetically and, where necessary, will be able to spread their payments up to three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.566W.5/1">There has been a consistent failure of independent European and American studies to confirm the original American study that described the detection of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), a virus related to rodent viruses, in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, sometimes referred to as myalgic encephomyelitis. An expert subgroup of National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) met in May 2010, to consider all available evidence about XMRV and conduct a risk assessment. The subgroup concluded that XMRV can infect humans but there is currently no evidence that it causes human disease and that on the evidence before the group, no public health action is required at this time. Since the subgroup meeting in May there has been no new scientific evidence that would change the conclusions of the subgroup but they are keeping it under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.5/2">The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), on the basis of current evidence does not recommend further measures at present but wishes to continue to monitor the situation. The NHS Blood and Transplant and Health Protection Agency study group concur with the views expressed both by NEPNEI and SaBTO but also recognise the need for further research on the prevalence of XMRV in the United Kingdom. In a recent unpublished pilot study conducted by the group a series of 540 randomly selected English blood donors were screened for XMRV and none were found to be infected.</p>

			<tr pid="b.575W.2/65"> <td colspan="4"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)-A FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 2. Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure:<br/> The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br/> 3. OPCS-4 Codes:<br/> The OPCS-4 codes used to identify the procedures are:<br/> (I). Insertion of pacemaker<br/> K60.1 Implantation of intravenous cardiac pacemaker system NEC<br/> K60.5 Implantation of intravenous single chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K60.6 Implantation of intravenous dual chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K60.7 Implantation of intravenous biventricular cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K60.8 Other specified cardiac pacemaker system introduced through vein<br/> K60.9 Unspecified cardiac pacemaker system introduced through vein<br/> K61.1 Implantation of cardiac pacemaker system NEC<br/> K61.5 Implantation of single chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K61.6 Implantation of dual chamber cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K61.7 Implantation of biventricular cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K61.8 Other specified other cardiac pacemaker system<br/> K61.9 Unspecified other cardiac pacemaker system<br/> 4. Assessing growth through time:<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> 5. SHA/PCT of residence:<br/> The strategic health authority (SHA) or primary care trust (PCT) containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> 6. Data quality:<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.586W.3/11">The Combining Age Related and Additional Needs (CARAN) formula replaced the Allocation of Resources to English Areas formula as the needs component for the prescribing and hospital and community health services elements of the formula (with the exception of mental health) used for PCT revenue target allocations from 2009-10. It is estimated that the impact of this formula change alone would have been to move North Tyneside PCT further above or less below target by 1.8%. When combined with changes to other components of the formula the overall effect was to move the PCT from at target at the end of 2008-09 to 1.5%, under target at the start of 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.586W.3/12">However, the actual allocations PCTs receive depend on a combination of both the distance from the target set by the funding formula, and how quickly PCTs are moved towards their target allocation (the pace-of-change policy). Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish the individual impact of any formula change, including CARAN, on PCTs' actual per capita allocations.</p>

	<p pid="b.589W.3/2">For HIV, the age distribution of people living with this infection in the United Kingdom is changing, with older age-groups increasing both in number and proportion. In the UK in 2009, almost one in five individuals accessing HIV-related care were aged 50 years and older, compared to one in seven individuals in 2005 and one in 10 in 2000. This increase is partly explained by the improved life expectancy of adults infected in their 20s, 30s and 40s, as well as those diagnosed soon after infection in the over 50s.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.3/3">It is for local areas to decide which information and services should be commissioned to meet the needs of their local populations. However, quick access to GUM services is important to reduce the spread of infections and we are seeing more people coming forward for testing. In May 2005, only 45% were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. In July 2010, 99.9% were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours. This means that more people are being tested and therefore having infections detected, including those aged over 50. It also means that more people than ever before are getting the information and advice they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.3/4">We know that more needs to be done to ensure all people regardless of age get the right information and advice at the right time to make responsible choices, and we are considering how we can tackle these issues. Later this year we will publish the Public Health White Paper which will set out a cross-government strategy for public health and plans for the new public health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.3/5">The following six tables show the new diagnoses for STI in the aged 50 and above for HIV and 45 and above for STIs.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.5/1">We have not made any estimates concerning the future cost of adult social care in Warwickshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.5/2">The funding of care and support is one of the biggest challenges faced by society today. Because of our ageing population and advances in healthcare, we expect the number of older people and younger adults with a potential care need to increase by around 1.7 million over the next 20 years. This is double the present number receiving publicly funded care. Urgent reform is needed to ensure there is a fair partnership between the state and the individual in meeting care costs; help people protect their assets; and give individuals and carers more control over their care and support.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.5/3">This debate has continued for too long without a solution. So the Government established the Commission on the Funding of Care and Support in July this year to make recommendations on how to achieve a fair and sustainable funding system for care and support for all adults in England. The Commission will present its recommendations to the Chancellor and the Secretary of State by the end of June 2011.</p>

Government set the regulatory framework under which electricity generation plants operate. This framework, supported by requirements set out in Environmental and Health and Safety legislation and in the grid code, gives the owners of electricity generation plants a commercial incentive to ensure that their plant is reliable. This creates an incentive to ensure that operations and maintenance services are carried out in an efficient and timely manner to support the Government's security of supply objectives.</p>

We also made changes to national insurance contributions (NIC), raising the employers' threshold to increase the number of employees for whom employers pay no NICs by 650,000 and introducing a regional employer NIC holiday to encourage new businesses in selected regions to take on employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.5/4">Because ensuring that growing businesses can access the finance they need is vital to growth, we extended the Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) by &#163;200 million at June's Budget, benefiting around 2,000 extra small businesses. We have also announced two new capital funds for SMEs with growth potential, and will shortly respond to the recent Green Paper on the future of business finance.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.5/5">One of our earliest priorities for the coalition was to make sure that there is less red tape and less regulation, giving businesses an opportunity to expand. We have already introduced a &quot;one-in, one-out&quot; rule for new regulation, a new Cabinet Reducing Regulation Committee, and a review of all inherited regulation in the pipeline. The &quot;Your Freedom&quot; website, launched within two months of the election, gave businesses and the public the opportunity to let us know what regulations we should be looking at or scrapping, and we are taking forward suggestions put forward.</p>

It is estimated that around 11,700 UK students undertook such placements in 2009/10.

	<p pid="b.612W.5/1">Under EC law, European Union (EU) students are eligible to the same access to education as those from the member state. Tuition fee loans are paid directly to the higher education institution, not the student. EU nationals are generally eligible for tuition fee support only, provided that they have been ordinarily resident in the European economic area (EEA) or Switzerland for the three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of their course.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/2">EU nationals have been eligible to apply for tuition fee loans since their introduction in academic year 2006/07. Borrowers do not become liable to repay until the April following graduation which means that the majority of EU students were not liable to repay until April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/3">Data on balances and numbers of borrowers as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> are available from the Statistical First Release on Student Loans for Higher Education published by the Student Loans Company (SLC) at:</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.slc.co.uk/pdf/slcsfr032010.pdf">www.slc.co.uk/pdf/slcsfr032010.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/5">These show that there were 39,000 borrowers with EU tuition fee loans of which 400 had fully repaid. The outstanding balance (including loans not due for repayment) was &#163;167.1 million. The majority of these borrowers were still at university or had recently left and were therefore not yet liable to begin repaying. 4,300 were liable to repay with a balance of &#163;12.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/6">Information on repayment status as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-30">30 April</phrase> is available from the SLC publication on Repayments by Repayment Cohort and Tax Year at:</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.slc.co.uk/pdf/SLCOSP032010.pdf">www.slc.co.uk/pdf/SLCOSP032010.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/8">The following figures exclude those who became liable to repay after March 2010, in order to be more consistent with figures in the preceding paragraph. This publication shows that a further 400 borrowers had repaid their loan in full, 400 were making repayments and a further 1,900 were not required to do so because their earnings were below the threshold or HMRC are in the process of confirming their earnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/9">In addition, as at that date, 1,000 were considered to be in arrears. This figure includes accounts where borrowers have defaulted on their loan repayments. However, the majority (900) are borrowers who are known to be overseas, have not provided details of their income, and have therefore been set up with repayment schedules and put into notional arrears in order that the Student Loans Company (SLC) can commence tracing and possibly legal action where appropriate. This is an essential step in the overseas collection process. SLC were still seeking information to establish the correct repayment status of the remaining borrowers. Figures in the publication are rounded to the nearest 100, therefore figures in this answer derived by adding categories are approximate.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/10">The April 2010 publication shows detail of the new cohort of students who completed their courses in summer 2009 and who had just become liable to repay in April 2010, but this is only a snapshot at a very early stage in the repayment process.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/11">EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for the three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of their course may qualify for the full support package. In addition, certain EEA migrant workers and specified family members may be eligible for the full support package provided that they satisfy specific residence conditions. Information is not available in the format requested which separately identifies these borrowers from English borrowers.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.8/3">In 2008/09 there were around 100 new apprenticeship starts in the Witham area. Essex county council is currently working with the National Apprenticeship Service on an Apprenticeship Training Agency pilot which is testing out a new way to make it easier for businesses to take on apprentices in the area and has already created over 100 new apprenticeship places.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.8/4">On a national basis, the Skills Funding Agency has been working to focus public funding on vocational qualifications on the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) which are designed to meet employers and learners needs. Currently over 44% of QCF vocational qualifications are in receipt of public funding and during 2009/10 there were over 600,000 learners, both pre and post 19, following publicly funded learning aims.</p>
