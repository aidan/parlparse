	<p pid="a.833W.2/1">The latest figures published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that students from England applying for entry in 2007 are up by 6 per cent. compared to last year. They have also exceeded the large increase in 2005, meaning we are now seeing the largest ever numbers applying for higher education at this point in the application cycle. The small downturn we saw last year, which we always anticipated, has been strongly reversed this year. I am also pleased to see that there has been a slight increase in the proportion of applicants from the lower socio-economic groups. These highest ever figures show that tuition fees are not putting students off applying to university as many predicted. The critics of the new system are being proved emphatically wrong.</p>

The literacy standards of all pupils have improved markedly over the past decade, but within this there remains a roughly constant gender gap: boys tend to read less than girls, and to achieve lower rates of literacy as measured by English tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.838W.17/2">The Boys into Books initiative which the Government launched last month allows every state-funded secondary school with boys on roll to select 20 free books from a new list created by the School Library Association; the take-up of this offer is already approaching two-thirds of all eligible schools. The Reading Champions initiative provides a range of ideas and resources to encourage boys to read more by using the motivational power of reading role models. Both initiatives support our wider programme to promote literacy, including the planned National Year of Reading in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.841W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-26">26 June 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.841W.3/2"><i> :</i> The likelihood of teenage pregnancy is far higher among young women with poor educational attainment. 29 per cent. of girls leaving school at 16 without qualifications will have a birth under 18, and 12 per cent. an abortion under 18, compared with 1 per cent. and 4 per cent. respectively for girls leaving school at 17 or over. This association between teenage pregnancy and low attainment is evident even after accounting for the effects of deprivation. On average, among the 20 per cent. most deprived wards in England, those with poor levels of educational attainment (less than 40 per cent. of young women achieving 5 GCSE's A-C) have under 18 conception rates twice as high as similarly deprived wards with better levels of educational attainment (more than 60 per cent. of young women achieving 5 GCSE's A-C). Consequently, the teenage pregnancy strategy focuses on raising aspirations and attainment as well as on delaying first sex and better contraception use&mdash;giving young people the motivation as well as the means to prevent early pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.841W.3/3">However, while there is a strong association between absolute teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates, the association between changes in rates over time is less strong and more difficult to interpret. In large part, this is because teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates are independently influenced by a wide range of factors. Accounting for how these factors impact on the relationship between changing teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates is problematic as many are not captured by routinely collected statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.843W.2/1">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations oblige businesses in the packaging chain which have an annual turnover of more than &pound;2 million, and which handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year, to recover and recycle a specified amount of packaging waste. This amount is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. The packaging recovery note (PRN) system was established as the mechanism for businesses to provide evidence of compliance with these regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.843W.5/1">Currently, the Green Dot Licensing Company (a subsidiary of Valpak) is vested with the task of managing the Green Dot trademark in the UK. The Green Dot Licensing Company administers Green Dot licences in the UK on behalf of the licence-holder, Pro-Europe and this decision was made by Pro-Europe rather than the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.5/2">Valpak, as part of the agreement with Pro-Europe, are required to manage the Green Dot registered trademark according to English trademark laws. This includes the policing of its use, granting &quot;User Agreements&quot;', ensuring the integrity of the mark is protected and that it is not used in a misleading fashion or in derogation of its meaning in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.5/3">Valpak operates the Green Dot Licensing Company on a non-profit making basis and charges a flat licence fee. The licence fee reflects Valpak's operating costs and these will depend on the number of Green Dot users; the more users, the lower the fee. The costs are purely operating costs which will be charged back to those companies using the Green Dot logo.</p>

The RNF are mathematical formulae that include information on population, social structure and other characteristics of each authority. For social care, there are separate formulae for older people (aged 65 and over) and younger adults (aged 18 to 65). The older people's formula also includes an age top-up for those aged 90 and over (as a proportion of the older people population), which takes into account the higher needs of those of very advanced age This age top-up is calculated as part of the econometric analysis carried out in an academic research project in 2005. There is, however, no set proportion of older people which leads to 'additional funding'.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.0/5">The Government (in consultation with local government) have developed separate formulae to cover the major service areas, because there are different factors influencing each service area.

These formulae apply to all local authorities providing particular services.</p>

	<p pid="a.846W.0/7">Relative needs are designed to reflect the relative needs of individual authorities in providing services. They are not intended to measure the actual amount needed by any authority to provide local services but simply to recognise the various factors which affect local authorities' costs locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.852W.4/1">Progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) is reported on officially by the UN and varies across goals and targets and across regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.4/2">The world is on track to meet the poverty reduction and hunger goal. The most recent official data at global level show that between 1990 and 2002, the percentage of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world dropped from 28 to 19 per cent. However, progress across regions varies. The proportion of people in Asia living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion over that period. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the goal is seriously off track and, although the poverty rate itself did not increase, the number of people living in extreme poverty increased by 140 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.4/3">Progress towards the other seven millennium development goals (MDGs) goals also varies. For example, reducing child mortality is on track in Latin America, South East Asia and North Africa, and slightly off track in most other regions. There is less progress towards goal 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases): this goal is seriously off track for at least one of its composing targets in most regions (including Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Oceania and the Commonwealth of Independent States both in Europe and Asia). Progress towards environmental sustainability is mixed, with most regions off track for some targets and on track for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.4/4">On current rates of progress, Sub-Saharan Africa will not meet any of the goals by 2015. The UK has placed Africa at the forefront of our campaign for more and better aid. Out of the 25 key countries on which DFID focuses its work, 16 are in Africa. The 2006 White Paper sets out DFID's future work on governance, basic services, climate change, the international system, and fragile states, which will all help make further progress towards meeting the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.4/5">The 2006 UN Millennium Development Goals Report, which can be found on <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/default.asp">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/default.asp</a>x, gives a comprehensive account of progress to date on each of the goals, and how great an effort remains necessary if they are to be met. The report is about to be updated by the UN this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.852W.4/6">DFID's 2007 annual report &quot;Development on the Record&quot;, which was recently published includes an annex on progress towards all goals including UK progress towards MDG 8. A copy of the report is available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.3/2">UNRWA provides food aid to 850,000 Palestinian refugees in Gaza, along with other essential services. With ICRC, UNRWA is assisting the 250 people trapped at the Erez crossing. DFID has provided &pound;15.6 million through UNRWA this year for its operations in Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>
	<p pid="a.854W.3/3">Through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), the European Union is providing fuel to ensure the continued operation of electricity, water and sanitation services in Gaza, supporting front line health services and providing allowances for government workers, pensioners and other needy Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. DFID has provided &pound;15 million through the TIM so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.854W.3/4">The European Community (EC) is providing &euro;9.8 million through the World Health Organisation, &euro;6 million for UNRWA's food programme, and &euro;9 million through the World Food Programme for the West Bank and Gaza. This is in addition to the European Community's contribution to UNRWA's core fund of &euro;66 million this year. The UK contributes about 17 per cent. of EC assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.854W.3/5">The key humanitarian issue in Gaza at this time is access. 104 containers of UNRWA supplies await transit to Gaza through the Kami crossing. Without regular and reliable access for aid supplies and privately traded goods it will not be possible for Gaza's 1.3 million people to meet their basic needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.861W.2/1">We consulted the Youth Justice Board and Directors of secure training centres about the proposed change. Wider consultation was not necessary or appropriate, as there is no change of the policy on the use of physical restraint. That policy is set out in section 10 of the Youth Justice Board's code of practice &quot;Managing Children and Young People's Behaviour in the Secure Estate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.2/2">Monitors appointed by the Youth Justice Board monitor the use of physical restraint in secure training centres and are required to submit to the Board a report of any incident in which physical restraint is used. The Board also collects statistical data on the use of physical restraint across the under-18 secure estate. In April 2007, it introduced a new system of data collection, which will provide more detailed information and allow more accurate comparisons to be made about use of restraint in the three sectors of the estate (young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children's homes).</p>

Where cases are stopped because of a technical error, steps may be taken to correct the error so that the case may proceed in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="a.864W.5/2">More general guidance has been issued, which states that a decision to re-institute proceedings should only be taken when 'special circumstances' exist that demand the reinstitution of proceedings in order to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system. If it is decided to re-institute proceedings, action is taken to bring the defendant back before the court by way of a charge or summons. This process is independent of the previous proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="a.867W.3/3">In advance of such an SSA being carried out, and subject to the outcome of the Government's consultation on the future of nuclear power, DTI has no plans to consult on the feasibility of locating new nuclear power stations in any particular geographical area. However, any proposed locations for new nuclear power stations emerging from an SSA would be the subject of local consultation through the planning process.</p>

	<p pid="a.872W.2/1">The Bexhill to Hastings link road scheme was granted Programme Entry in December 2004 with an agreed departmental funding contribution of &pound;47.12 million. In July 2006, we accepted the South East region's advice that the scheme was a priority for the region at an increased cost of &pound;48.5 million. However, it has since been reported that the estimated total cost of the scheme has increased to around &pound;89 million. As a result, the South East region will need to decide whether it still wishes to prioritise funding for this scheme at its higher cost within its regional funding allocations. Should the region formally advise that the scheme continues to be a priority, it will then be subject to a re-appraisal and value for money assessment in accordance with the Department's guidance before a final decision is taken on whether to provide additional funding for the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.8/1">The Government do not judge there will be discernable long-term financial effect on pensions resulting from changes to income tax announced in Budget 2007. Any long-term financial effect would depend not only on the marginal rates of relief but also on the future structure of the tax system, the numbers saving for pensions and their contribution levels, the numbers in receipt of pensions and any behavioural response to the changes in rates of relief.</p>

For older people, the Budget announced that the age-related income tax allowances for those aged 65 or over and 75 or over will rise by &pound;1,180 above indexation in April 2008. By April 2011 no pensioner aged 75 or over will pay any tax until their income reaches &pound;10,000 a year. These reforms will remove 580,000 pensioners from paying tax in April 2008.</p>
