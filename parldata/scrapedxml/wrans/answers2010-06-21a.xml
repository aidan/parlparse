This reflects the priority this Government places on repairing the Military Covenant and properly supporting our armed forces in Afghanistan. It also acknowledges that although the MOD budget has been protected in 2010-11, it is vital that all Departments prioritise resources to the front line and assist in the key task of reducing the debt inherited by the new Government.</p>

For reasons of operational security, I am not able to comment on the number of counter-IED (C-IED) teams in theatre. However, the additional funding announced by the Prime Minister will allow us to equip a significant increase in that number. The additional funds include approximately &#163;40 million for more protected vehicles for use by our C-IED teams; the remainder will be used to enhance other critical capabilities, including more remote control vehicles, and enhancements to our military working dog capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.6/2">The question on the funding of King's Centre for Defence Medicine is presumed to be referring to the work of King's Centre for Military Health Research with whom, in 2003, the MOD commissioned research into the health of military personnel deployed to Iraq. In 2006, the study was extended for a further three years and broadened to include all subsequent Iraq deployments as well as deployments to Afghanistan. This research programme now follows a cohort of over 20,000 serving and former members of the armed forces. Earlier this year the study was extended for a further three years to maintain the database and further explore the data obtained in phases one and two.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.6/3">MOD funding to the King's Centre for Military Health Research to conduct the Health and Wellbeing Survey since 2003 and going forward is as follows (exclusive of VAT):</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.3W.6/6"> <td><i> Contract period</i></td> <td><i> Funding (&#163; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.3W.6/7"> <td>May 2003 to May 2006</td> <td>2.585</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.3W.6/12">Phases one and two have shown that the health and wellbeing of the UK armed forces is in general good and that there was no overall significant increase in mental ill-health as a result of operational deployment, although effects were seen in both reservists and those in combat roles.</p>

	<p pid="a.4W.2/1">Under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) pensions are not normally stopped on imprisonment. A pension could be withheld at the point of leaving the armed forces if the individual was going direct to jail for at least 10 years for acts such as treason or breach of the Official Secrets Acts.

Guaranteed income payments made under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) are not stopped during a term of imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) made careful assessment of the effects of the cancellation of the Olympic Park wind turbine on the environmental sustainability of London 2012 and has committed to meeting its 20% renewable energy target using the biomass boilers at the Energy Centre which will be commissioned in autumn 2010, together with alternative options.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/2">The decision not to proceed with the turbine project was taken because of a number of factors in the industry, including new safety legislation introduced in 2010 applying to design elements of this particular wind turbine (specifically the internal operator lift), which the preferred bidder's turbine supplier for the project felt unable to meet before the Games. This led to them subsequently withdrawing from the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/3">Subsequent industry feedback on the new safety directive, coupled with a challenging delivery timetable, revealed a limited commercial interest in the project, and led the ODA to conclude that the installation of a wind turbine was no longer feasible.</p>

	<p pid="a.19W.3/1">The seaside remains an important part of our visitor economy. We recently announced a goal to increase the proportion of UK residents' tourism spend that goes on domestic holidays to 50% of their total tourism spend at home and abroad, and coastal destinations and attractions can contribute significantly to that achievement. VisitEngland are currently developing a seaside resorts action plan, as part of their broader planning to improve the growth and competitiveness of the visitor economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.2/1">I recognise the difficulties currently facing the inshore fleet. The shortage of fishing opportunities in the Thanet area is, in part, the result of international quota swaps that are usually secured to supplement the inshore fleets' allocations not being forthcoming this year. The Marine Management Organisation is continuing to pursue swaps in order to secure additional quota.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.2/2">However, there are more fundamental issues to resolve in order to deliver reform of the inshore fleet that is clearly needed. I plan to meet representatives from across industry to drive forward work to find long-term solutions, as a matter of priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.11/1">Production of the statutory River Basin Management Plans provides the planning mechanism for ensuring that the country meets its obligations under the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The Plans provide an assessment of the current status of water bodies in each river basin district and a summary of agreed measures for achieving the environmental objectives of the WFD. Plans are updated on a six yearly cycle, starting from 2009-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.11/2">The first River Basin Management Plans were developed in consultation with relevant organisations and individuals and were published by the WFD deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-22">22 December 2009</phrase>. River basin district liaison panels, which included representatives of the key water interests in the river basin district, assisted the Environment Agency in producing draft plans before a formal six month written consultation was carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.11/3">Mechanisms to achieve the environmental objectives set under the WFD include: compliance with existing regulations, codes of practice and controls on the use of certain substances; Catchment Sensitive Farming activities and agri-environment schemes; and water efficiency measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.11/4">The actions summarised in Annex C of the plans will improve more than 8,300 miles of rivers in England. More than 8,500 investigations that are in progress or planned will provide the evidence base required for further action to protect and improve our water resources within the first and subsequent planning cycles. The plans are available on the Environment Agency's website:</p>

He has asked Nicholas Shott-head of UK Investment Banking at Lazard-to examine the potential for commercially viable local television stations within the local media landscape across the UK.

	<p pid="a.52W.5/1">The number of court starts will not be affected by, an as yet, unevaluated proposal to have one deputy justices clerk managing the legal advisers in both Northumberland and North Tyneside. As ever, the number of court sittings will be driven by factors such as work loads, fluctuations in the business and waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.5/2">The proposal regarding the deputy justices clerks is actually about management structures and the need to standardise the ratio of legal managers to legal advisers across the country generally. The proposal from the justices clerk is merely an initial response to the publication of a service-wide activity based cost model and has not formally been considered, or approved, at any level. I should clarify that it is unlikely to take effect for some time yet. However, when it does, it will not dictate how many sittings are listed in those courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.8/1">Up until recently, the Area Director for Cleveland, Durham and Northumbria was working on a business case to support the introduction of two additional magistrates' district judges to the Northumbria Area. However, given the need for all government bodies to review how they conduct their operations in the light of the current economic climate, that business case has been put on hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/2">By way of background, although Northumbria already has two magistrates' district judges, that number is fewer than areas elsewhere in the country with similar workloads. The Area Director believes that additional district judges will help improve case management and increase throughput. Consequently she was considering putting forward a case to make Northumbria's numbers commensurate with those found nationally. Before any such request is submitted, formal consultation will be undertaken with the Northumbria Benches and other stakeholders, where the reasons for the business case will be set out. I can confirm that Bench Chairmen have been informed of the decision not to progress the case at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/3">As the matter is not being advanced at present, there will be no change to the overall cost of magistrates' business in Northumbria.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.2/3">For Civil Licensed Work, the LSC acknowledge that payments are currently taking longer than in the equivalent period last year. This is due to a significant increase in numbers of claims in addition to tighter checks and controls that the LSC has put in place for the scrutiny of claims following the National Audit Office's qualification of the LSC's 2008-09 accounts. The LSC has made additional staff available to process payments with the aim of addressing the increase in volume.</p>

	<p pid="a.54W.5/1">The Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2009, underpins the Critical Public Protection Case Notification Scheme, which allows Members who wish to be informed of the release of a dangerous offender into their constituency to sign a confidentiality agreement and receive notification of such releases. The scheme allows for Members to be reassured of the robust arrangements in place to manage those offenders on their release from custody and to make further inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/2">As I made clear in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-06-17.567"><i> Official Report</i>, column 567W</phrase>, and in my letter to all MPs on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-11">11 June 2010</phrase>, I am continuing the scheme. The risk management plans for relevant offenders involve the close collaboration between the Police and Probation Trusts through the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Offender managers will supervise offenders to ensure that they comply with their licence conditions and, where they do not, they are liable to recall to custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.54W.5/3">Since the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2009 was approved by Parliament, 16 notification letters have been sent out to 13 Members. As the vast majority of relevant offenders are released initially into Approved Premises, formerly known as probation and bail hostels, notifications will mostly be sent to Members with an Approved Premises in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.8/1">The term 'restorative justice' is widely used to describe a range of interventions, both formal and informal. It can refer to interventions where an offender takes steps to make good their offence in some way and/or to interventions that give victims the chance to explain the impact that their experience of being a victim has had on them, or to seek an apology, or answers to any questions they may have, from an offender. A range of restorative justice approaches are in use within the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.65W.9/2" class="indent">&quot;When a service user permanently moves from one council area to another (or has a clear intention to move to another council), the council whose area they move into should take account of the support that was previously received and the effect of any substantial changes on the service user when carrying out the assessment and making decisions about what level of support will be provided.

	<p pid="a.66W.5/1">We have set out, in Our Programme for Government, a commitment to ensure greater access to talking therapies to reduce long-term costs for the national health service. This is a clear public health priority for us and we are currently working to identify how we will take forward this commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.5/2">Revised National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on schizophrenia was published in March 2009. This outlines the best way to treat and manage adults with schizophrenia in primary and secondary care. The guidance recommends that treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) should be offered to all people with schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.5/3">Psychological therapies can be a key element of the treatment of people with severe and enduring mental health conditions, particularly when these conditions are experienced alongside depression and anxiety disorders. In these cases, the delivery of CBT and other NICE-compliant therapies is the recommended treatment. Services for these clients is largely provided by psychology departments in specialist mental health trusts. The implementation of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services for people in community settings with mild to moderate conditions can reduce the number of referrals to specialist mental health trusts and enable them to focus on providing services to those with severe and enduring mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.5/4">General practitioners or consultant psychiatrists can prescribe any medicine or treatment which they consider to be necessary for treating NHS patients, including NICE-approved treatments, provided that the local primary care trust or NHS trust agree to supply it on the NHS. Clinicians are responsible for deciding on the most appropriate form of treatment for their patients, and in doing so they are expected to take NICE guidance fully into account. The Department does not become involved in making clinical decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.86W.6/14" class="indent">The Insolvency Service Executive Agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills set out its plan for 2010/11 in its Corporate Plan. This included a planned reduction in non-frontline staff working in corporate services functions during 2010-11 of 12.6 (FTE). With the recent announcements of plans to cut &#163;61/4 billion of wasteful spending across the public sector The Insolvency Service is reviewing its Corporate plan for 2010-11 which may lead to further changes in planned numbers of non-frontline staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.6/15" class="indent">A large proportion (73%) of the Insolvency Service's functions are funded by fee income and the impact of any reductions will therefore only apply to the 27% funded from the public purse.</p>

In addition to a 25-strong team based in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar, UKTI also employs a business specialist in the UK focused on identifying supply chain opportunities in Saudi Arabia arising from the Saudi Government's Fiscal Stimulus packages.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.2/2">UKTI provides a broad range of support for British companies wishing to do business in Saudi Arabia-from conferences and trade missions to support for trade fairs and exhibitions. In December 2009, the then Minister for Trade, Lord Davies, led a high-level mission of over 40 UK companies to Jeddah and Riyadh. In February this year, UKTI organised &quot;Partner Middle East&quot;, a three-day road show that exposed over 450 companies in London, the West Midlands and Manchester to business opportunities in Saudi Arabia (and elsewhere in the Middle East). UKTI is rolling out a programme of follow-up activities over the course of 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.2/3">UKTI funds and provides secretariat support for the Saudi-British Joint Business Council. The council meets twice a year to identify new business opportunities and also focuses on ways to tackle barriers to trade and to improve the environment for business. The Business Council has had a particular focus on the energy sector, as well as health care, education and skills and construction/transport, bringing together companies from both the UK and Saudi Arabia to explore the opportunities for new business partnerships in these key areas. To build new business in the financial services sector, UKTI, working closely with the Business Council and private sector partners, has overseen the creation of a UK-Saudi Arabia Financial Services Task Force, which is focused on a number of areas including public-private partnerships, investment banking law and regulation.</p>
