	<p pid="b.1099W.5/1">The Environment Agency is the principal authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England. Most of the Agency's flood risk management activities are funded by Defra grant in aid. The Agency is promoting five studies which are currently underway, namely Thorpeness to Hollesley Coastal Strategy (&pound;330,000 between 2003&ndash;04 and 2008&ndash;09), Stour and Orwell Estuary Strategy (&pound;575,000), Deben Estuary Strategy (&pound;550,000), Aide Ore Estuary Strategy (&pound;625,000) and Blyth Estuary Strategy (&pound;565,000).</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.5/2">Suffolk coastal district council is developing its Felixstowe Strategy (&pound;110,000), partly in partnership with the Agency for the southern part which covers flood risk as well as coastal erosion and is complete. (The cost given covers both the flood risk and coastal erosion components as Defra does not hold separate figures for these). A review of the Lowestoft to Harwich Shoreline Management Plan is underway, led by Suffolk coastal district council (&pound;110,000). This will cover both flood risk and coastal erosion but the respective costs of these two components have not been separately estimated. Both these studies will be supported by Defra funding.</p>

The UK has not sought state aid approval for a grant scheme offering a similar type of aid and we have no plans to do so. We have, however, obtained approval under aid scheme N 424/2003, to provide grant to English Farming and Food Partnerships which was set up to encourage and support collaboration and co-operation between farmers in England, and between farmers and the rest of the food chain. Grants are also available under the Agriculture Development Scheme (aid N 505/2002 extended as N 508/2005) for projects in England which involve collaboration and co-operation benefiting primary producers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1109W.13/1">The Government are actively working to build an evidence base on the economics of carbon capture and storage (CCS). At Budget 2006, HM Treasury launched a consultation exercise on barriers to wide-scale commercial deployment of the technology and the potential role of economic incentives in addressing those barriers. The results of this exercise will be fed into the Energy Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1109W.13/2">Consideration of whether there is a need for economic incentives for CCS in the UK is taking place in addition to support which has been made available for demonstrations of CCS through the Department for Trade and Industry's Carbon Abatement Technologies Strategy. The Strategy is providing capital grant funding of 35m for demonstration projects of carbon abatement technologies over four years starting in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1109W.13/3">In reflection of the global challenge which carbon emissions present, during the UK's presidency of the EU and G8, the Government initiated a project aiming to build a demonstration zero emissions coal plant with CCS, as the centrepiece of the EU-China Partnership on Climate Change. It is providing &pound;3.5 million to fund the initial phase of this project.</p>

	<p pid="b.1112W.8/1">The most recent data available that allows assessment to be made of the number of households with no access to a bank account is the Family Resources Survey from 2002&ndash;03. This indicates that 8 per cent. of households in the United Kingdom had no bank account of any kind. This equated to 1.9 million households containing around 2.8 million adults. This data is broken down to Government Office regional level. This shows 9 per cent. of households in the North West and Merseyside were unbanked.</p>
	<p pid="b.1112W.8/2">In 1997&ndash;98, the Family Resources Survey was collected on a Great Britain basis, excluding Northern Ireland. 11 per cent. of households in the North West and Merseyside were unbanked at that time compared to 8 per cent. of households in Great Britain as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1112W.8/3">In December 2004, the Government and the banks agreed to work together towards the goal of halving the number of adults in households with no access to a bank account of any kind and of making significant progress within two years. The financial inclusion taskforce has been asked to monitor progress. The taskforce recently made its first annual report, which concluded that steady progress has been made towards the goal but also encouraged banks to continue to address the difficulties faced in opening a bank account.</p>

	<p pid="b.1126W.5/1">The cost burden of maintaining secure ports and harbours falls mainly to industry. The lead for dealing with terrorist attacks when they occur in the UK lies with the Home Office, the police and other emergency services. The Department is unable to provide information on how much of their total provisions for 2005&ndash;06 was made available to prepare for terrorist attacks in the UK's ports and harbours. Within the Department, the Directorate of Transport Security and Civil Contingencies works closely with industry to ensure that the regulatory provisions for security that apply to ports and harbours .are met. In 2005&ndash;06 the Directorate budgeted &pound;1.7 million which includes the running costs for 34 staff who are mainly working to prevent terrorist attacks on maritime transport targets including our ports and harbours. Staff who are working on cross-cutting tasks within the Directorate also contribute to this effort.</p>

	<p pid="b.1127W.4/2">No recent representations have been made by local community leaders in Helmand Province to the British embassy in Afghanistan regarding the non-payment of compensation for poppy eradication. However, I am aware of claims by the Senlis Council on this subject. As my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-03-27.529"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 529&ndash;31</phrase>, the Senlis Council campaigns for the legalisation of opium production in Afghanistan on the grounds that it might be used for medicinal purposes. Neither the Government of Afghanistan nor the UK believe that legal cultivation would be viable in the present situation in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.4/3">The programme of compensated eradication in 2002 was led by the Afghan Transitional Authority who considered it appropriate to offer a one-off programme of payments to opium farmers on the basis that the poppy crop had been planted during the Taliban regime, before the current regime came to power. The UK provided financial assistance worth &pound;21.25 million to support the new regime's commitment to tackle drugs production, but it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to administer the system of payments with farmers. The Government did not set up a bank account for this purpose. Compensated eradication was never seen as a long-term solution to drug control and does not form part of the present Afghan government's National Drug Control Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.4/4">We are aware of reports that UK funds for compensated eradication may have been misused in the past. The Government take all reasonable measures to guard against fraud and financial irregularity in the use of public funds. All public expenditure, including that in respect of counter narcotics work in Afghanistan, is subject to the established scrutiny procedures of parliamentary committees and the National Audit Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1128W.5/1">It is difficult to quantify the specific UK spend on medicines since 1997 due to the rapid changes over this period in how DFID finances health. Increasingly DFID contributes to pooled funds with other partners or provides untied funds into the health sector budget or contributes to the general budget of a country. The procurement of medicines is carried out directly by recipient governments or by the recipients of UK funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.5/2">The UK Government are a major donor to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and has committed &pound;359 million through to 2008. Almost half of the GFATM funds are used to procure drugs and medical supplies. The UK also provides substantial support to other global health initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), Roll Back Malaria and Stop TB, and to UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), all of which procure medicines and/or vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.5/3">In September 2005, the UK launched, with other donors, the International Financing Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm). This will provide $4 billion over a 10-year period to support the purchase of vaccines by developing countries and the strengthening of immunisation systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.5/4">The United Kingdom (UK) Government are committed to improving access to essential medicines in developing countries. In general, DFID spends money on efforts to, strengthen national medicine systems; ensuring affordable pricing and sustainable financing, reliable health services and the rational selection and use of drugs, rather than buying medicines specifically.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.5/5">Since 1997, DFID has spent over &pound;1.5 billion to support the development of health systems in poor countries. Specific initiatives related to medicines include providing &pound;39 million to support the Nigeria Partnership for Transforming Health Systems and &pound;3.6 million to the South African Drug Action programme which has increased the number of health care centres that use approved lists of essential medicines. DFID has provided support to the WHO to appoint national professional officers for essential medicines in 11 African countries, to provide technical assistance on supply, management and rational use of medicines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129W.2/1">The agreement reached at the G8 summit was to support the Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, Mr. James Wolfensohn, in his intention to stimulate a global financial contribution of up to $3 billion per year over the coming three years. However, this was based on a recognition that certain conditions need to be in place for additional aid to be effective, notably on movement and access to markets for Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="b.1129W.2/2">An agreement reached on November 15, 2005, between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on movement and access would, if implemented, meet several of those conditions. So far this agreement has not been fully implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1129W.2/3">Following the recent Palestinian elections in which Hamas won an absolute majority further assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) is under review. The Quartet, comprising the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia has said that aid to the future Palestinian Government will depend on it giving up violence, recognising Israel's right to exist and signing up to previous peace agreements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1132W.0/1">DFID keeps informed about poverty and income levels in Peru through its regional Andean office, based in La Paz Bolivia. Currently, national poverty rates put total poverty (moderate and extreme) at 54.7 per cent., and extreme poverty at 21.5 per cent. of the population <sup>1</sup> . Average household income is estimated at 317 Nuevo Soles per person per month (just under US$100). Inequality in Peru is a grave problem and poverty is much higher in rural areas, where total poverty is 76.4 per cent. and extreme poverty 45.6 per cent., versus 43.0 per cent. and 8.5 per cent. for urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1133W.2/1">As a middle income country, Uruguay receives a relatively low share of international development assistance. DFID does not provide direct bilateral assistance to Uruguay. DFID's main financial contribution to Latin America is through the UK's contributions to multi-lateral organisations such as the European Commission (EC), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the World Bank, whose programmes include support to Uruguay's development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.2/2">The EC's present country strategy paper (2001 to 2006) for Uruguay, with indicative funding of &euro;18.6 million, includes an &euro;8.4 million (45 per cent.) component for economic reform. This is aimed particularly at helping Uruguay to diversify its industrial base beyond the production and export of commodities. Furthermore, the Commission is continuing to negotiate with Mercosur, of which Uruguay is a member, for a new EU-Mercosur free trade agreement. If successfully achieved, such an agreement, with appropriate complementary policy measures in place, could be expected to contribute to Uruguay's trade diversification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.2/3">The World Bank's country assistance strategy for Uruguay, which projects assistance of up to US$800 million between 2005 and 2010, includes the promotion of sustained and broad-based growth. New loan projects, such as a $70 million project to upgrade the country's transport infrastructure, can be expected to help facilitate access to markets and diversification of economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.2/4">The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) country strategy for Uruguay (2005 to 2009) includes the objective of enhancing the regional and international competitiveness of national outputs and promoting private sector investment. Within this, the strategy aims to strengthen Uruguay's access to export markets and the internationalisation of its business and industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1133W.2/5">As part of its regional assistance plan for Latin America, DFID is also providing &pound;7.5 million over four years (2005 to 2009) to strengthen the effectiveness of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank in reducing poverty in Latin America through activities related to markets and international trade. While aimed primarily at those countries in the region with lower incomes and greater poverty, the programme could bring benefits to Uruguay in terms of the improved effectiveness and operations of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>

In that consultation, we state that we will publish research into the harm caused by organised immigration crime, including trafficking. This research will provide a better understanding of the trafficking problem faced in the UK and will be updated annually. This year we will commence a scoping exercise focused on trafficking and the off-street prostitution market.</p>

We will also use the evaluation of the POPPY scheme and the responses to the consultation on the UK Action Plan to inform our decisions on the nature and scope of future support.</p>

	<p pid="b.1140W.9/1">The importance of manufacturing to the North East of England, and to the whole UK economy, is reflected in the Department of Trade and Industry's Manufacturing Strategy. Launched in 2002, the strategy sets out the actions needed to create a high value, high skill manufacturing sector capable of introducing new products and processes into our economy, creating new markets, and delivering a huge boost to our prosperity. In response to the strategy, and the subsequent review in 2004, we have:</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/2" class="indent">Established the Manufacturing Forum to ensure the effective implementation and evolution of the Manufacturing Strategy. This sets out priority areas for targeted action, bringing together Government, industry, trade unions, Regional Development Agencies, and other stakeholders to support manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/3" class="indent">Set up the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) to give manufacturers in every region direct access to practical advice and support from manufacturing experts. Since its establishment in 2002 the MAS has generated over &pound;12 million in value-added for manufacturing firms in the North East of England alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/4" class="indent">Set up innovation and growth teams to plan how the UK can best respond to the competitive challenges that key UK industries, such as automotive, aerospace, chemicals and materials, will face in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/5" class="indent">Built on the UK's world class science base, and strengthened links between higher education and industry. The science budget has more than doubled from &pound;1.3 billion in 1997. This will rise to &pound;3.4 billion in 2007&ndash;08, enabling businesses gain competitive advantage by drawing on a strong science base.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/6" class="indent">Launched the Technology Programme to support research and development in key new and emerging technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/7" class="indent">Extended the scope of R&amp;D Tax Credits, encouraging manufacturers to invest in R&amp;D.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/8" class="indent">Put in place a network of Sector Skills Councils to ensure industry gets the skills it needs, and strengthened Apprenticeships by introducing a structure that is more responsive to employers' needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.9/9" class="indent">Supported investment through changes to Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax, through the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme, and through programmes such as Selective Finance for Investment in England (previously Regional Selective Assistance), Grant for Research and Development, and new regional venture capital funds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.6/3">The strategy recognises that low (or capped) gas prices in Russia (and by implication China) deter investors from building new capacity in production and infrastructure and reduce incentives for energy efficiency. DTI, FCO and DEFRA will continue to assess the implications to UK energy security in the context of all the issues identified in the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1145W.5/2">In financial year 2005&ndash;06, Advantage West Midlands offered a total of &pound;185,056 to four companies in Coventry South under the DTI's Research and Development Grant Scheme, which is designed to help individuals and small and medium-sized businesses research and develop technologically innovative products and processes. The corresponding figures for the West Midlands are &pound;1,607,871 being offered to 19 companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.5/3">Advantage West Midlands also contributed 332.6 million towards the &pound;70 million Premium Auto Research and Development Program (PARD) at the University of Warwick.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.5/4">PARD assists companies involved in supplying to the luxury car industry and is also supported by partner companies including Jaguar and Land Rover. It allows companies who would not normally be able to invest heavily in research and development to use the cutting-edge facilities at the Warwick Manufacturing Group, ensuring West Midlands firms gain access to the highest level of skills and technology. Since being launched in 2003, projects have covered areas such advanced body joining techniques, characterisation of new vehicle materials, crash analysis and the exploitation of IT technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.5/5">CovPress, a company based in Coventry South, is one of the 200 companies that have benefited from PARD to improve their productivity. Through PARD, the company has been able to tackle a series of production issues at their plant and develop increasingly sophisticated body parts.</p>

It is difficult to arrive at a more accurate and current estimate as that would depend very much on the timing and approach taken. In particular, we expect more IT systems to be euro compatible as a result of ongoing modernisation programmes, which would reduce the costs of any euro changeover.</p>

The figures relating to the numbers of the communications received since 1992 on the subject of pardons for the soldiers executed during the First World War and to the views expressed have not been collated. It is understood that some of the earlier correspondence may not have been retained and the cost of the work required to compile the information requested would in any event be disproportionate.

	<p pid="b.1154W.6/1">No decisions have yet been taken on whether or not to acquire ballistic missile defence for the United Kingdom. Work by officials continues to examine potential options for future UK participation in a missile defence system, including the strategic, cost and legal issues arising. UK officials are also working with their NATO counterparts to consider the implications of a recently completed NATO Feasibility Study into options for Alliance missile defence. No terms for basing interceptors in Europe have been proposed, so it is premature to speculate on the range of options that might be available, or on the viability and desirability for the UK of further participation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.8/1">There are no offenders released on parole who are subsequently recalled after their Licence Expiry Date. Prisoners sentenced to four years or more under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 become eligible to be considered for parole at the half-way point of the sentence. If not released on parole, prisoners are released at the two thirds point of the sentence, on supervision licence to the three quarter point of the sentence, the Licence Expiry Date&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.8/2">During the period between release and Licence Expiry Date, all offenders are subject to licensed supervision, and may be recalled if they breach the conditions of the licence, or re-offend. At the Licence Expiry Date, the offender is no longer under licensed supervision, but begins the 'at risk' period which lasts until the Sentence Expiry Date. If the offender commits further offences during this period, the court dealing with the new offences, may impose all or part of the outstanding period of the original sentence, to be served with any further sentence given for the new offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.8/3">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 replaced these arrangements. Prisoners sentenced to the standard determinate sentence for offences committed on or after five April 2005 will be released at the half way point of their sentence and remain on licensed supervision for the whole of the remainder of the sentence. Special arrangement apply in respect of those made subject to public protection sentences.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165W.5/1">My Department's guidance 'Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People from Working with Children in the Education Service' (issued May 2002) sets out arrangements for both salaried and non-salaried staff and volunteers in schools. As I have already announced, Criminal Records Bureau checks will become compulsory for all newly appointed members of the schools work force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.5/2">The proposed vetting and barring scheme will extend further the requirement for mandatory checks. It will become an offence if a check is not made of a governor's, or other regular volunteer's, barred status before they are appointed.</p>

The sponsorship extends to having the learndirect logo and name mentioned at the beginning and end of each programme and during the commercial breaks.

	<p pid="b.1168W.12/3">This is necessary contingency planning. If a decision is made to change ambulance trust configuration, we would need to be able to move quickly to establish the new organisations in order to minimise uncertainty for staff and for business continuity. This includes having full boards as soon as possible so that decisions can be taken and staff transferred to the new organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.12/4">If new organisations are not established, appointments will not be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169W.2/1">These conditions affect many people of working age. Although rheumatoid arthritis is not caused by work, the development of osteoarthritis can be affected by work activity. With effective management and support, most people with osteoarthritis are able to stay in or return to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/2">Osteoarthritis is recognised in the Health and Safety Commission and Executive HSC/E guidance booklet Upper limb disorders in the workplace as one of about 15 kinds of medically diagnosable upper limb disorders. It also affects other parts of the body such as hips and lower limbs. Following HSC/E's recognised ergonomic approach, as set out in the guidance, employers can design jobs and tasks which control the exposure of the workforce to risk factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/3">HSC/E has not had specific representations on rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. However, we have worked closely with ARMA, the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance, who have recently published Standards of Care for people with Inflammatory Arthritis, with Osteoarthritis and with Back Pain. HSC/E endorses the advice contained in this guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173W.2/1">Some studies have shown that ruminants fed fresh grass and other forage produce meat and dairy products with slightly higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids. However, these fatty acids differ chemically from the longer chain omega 3 fatty acids present in oily fish and which have been shown to be beneficial for cardiovascular disease. The nutritional consequences of slightly higher levels of intake of the shorter chain omega 3 fatty acids are not known, and so there is no currently justification for such labelling.</p>

The underlying purpose of this service is, for pharmacists, with the patient's agreement, to improve a patient's knowledge and use of medicines. In particular, the pharmacist can identify side effects and drug interactions that may affect the patient's compliance with instructions given to them by a health professional for taking the medicines and improve the clinical and cost effectiveness of medicines prescribed for patients, thereby reducing waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.1180W.3/1">According to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, a total of US$ 490 million worth of international aid was committed towards alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan in 2005&ndash;06. US$47.3 million of this assistance was committed to Badakhshan and US$70.1 million to Nangahar. There are no reliable collective figures for assistance specifically to develop alternative livelihoods prior to this date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180W.3/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports alternative livelihoods by providing funds for the Government of Afghanistan's National Priority Programmes, which provide immediate support and long term development inputs across every province in Afghanistan. In particular, since 2003 the UK has provided &pound;40 million to the National Solidarity Programme which has helped establish Community Development Councils which deliver community-led development initiatives in thousands of Afghan villages; the National Rural Access Programme, which has brought about employment through public works, such as irrigation schemes and renovation of roads; and the Microfinance and Investment Support Facility, which delivers loan schemes for investments in small-businesses, agriculture and to support service industries such as small shops. All three of these programmes are operating in Badakhshan and Nangahar Provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180W.3/3">In addition to supporting these national programmes in Badakhshan DFID has, since 2003, provided &pound;2.5 million to the Aga Khan Foundation to develop alternatives to poppy cultivation and &pound;3 million to an International Organisation for Migration cash-for-work programme which has provided 500,000 labour days as an alternative legal source of income for those who would otherwise be engaged in poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180W.3/4">In Nangahar, DFID is providing &pound;300,000 over three years to Relief International to undertake research into the livelihood impact and market potential of six legume and vegetable crops as potential viable alternatives to opium poppy cultivation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1183W.5/1">It was expected that PRISM performance would be slower at satellite posts. For this reason, Cape Town, a satellite post, was chosen as a PRISM pilot ahead of the main rollout. This post was able to use the system effectively, as were many satellite posts in the early rollout to Europe and the Americas. However, as the rollout progressed, it became evident that performance was poorer at more satellite posts than was acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.5/2">The interaction of PRISM and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's communications infrastructure is complex. We have worked closely with the supplier, Capgemini, to consider how to deploy PRISM over our infrastructure. We continue to work with both the supplier and Oracle to analyse and address performance problems. It is not a question of apportioning blame, but of working together to improve performance.</p>

The international community is clear that the security situation in Sudan, especially Darfur, must be improved as a matter of urgency. We have therefore supported the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission through the north and south of Sudan, and the African Union mission in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="b.1188W.2/5" class="indent">You will be aware that the introduction of charged parking in the Magee Campus car parks in September 2004 led to complaints from residents in adjacent areas about parking problems. As a result, the University did agree to re-evaluate their decision however, residents would still appear to be concerned about the increased level of parking in adjacent streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.2/6" class="indent">At present there are no residents' parking schemes operating in Northern Ireland. However, I can advise that policy development on the introduction and operation of residents' parking schemes is well advanced and it is hoped that this process will be completed within the next two months, at which time it will be submitted to the Minister for approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.2/7" class="indent">Subject to Ministerial approval, Roads Service proposes to initiate detailed surveys and commence formal consultation with the residents living in the vicinity of Magee College to seek agreement on the extent and detail of any such scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.2/8" class="indent">You may be aware that the local PSNI agreed to enforce a pilot residents' parking scheme in the university area, however it is unlikely that any scheme will be brought forward in advance of the introduction of Decriminalised Enforcement Parking in October 2006, when the Department will take over the responsibility for the enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.2/9" class="indent">I am advised that in an attempt to provide an interim resolution to some of the concerns of the residents, staff in our Northern Division wrote to the Aberfoyle Residents Committee in October 2005 suggesting the introduction of limited parking waiting restrictions in the area. I understand that to date a reply to this letter has not been received.</p>
	<p pid="b.1188W.2/10" class="indent">I trust you find the above information useful and I can assure you that when residents' parking schemes are being introduced in Londonderry, the area around the Magee Campus will be given a high priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191W.5/32">On the fall in detected cases after 1999:</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/33">1. In line with the fall in benefit fraud there has been a reduction in the stock of fraud, leading to fewer referrals and fewer cases for investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/34">2. There has also been a more focused approach to investigation with a more selective referral management system. This has enabled us to concentrate on the more serious criminal investigations to maintain the level of sanctions imposed where fraud has been detected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/35">3. The development of new initiatives such as data matching with other agencies has also played a significant part in this more targeted approach to fraud investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.5/36">4. We are also introducing a new customer compliance approach as a more effective method of dealing with the lower level frauds that do not need to be investigated to the criminal standard.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-30b.60920.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-30b.1197W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" colnum="1197W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/text/60330w32.htm#60330w32.html_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/1">The failure of non-resident parents to face up to their responsibilities and pay maintenance causes real hardship for their children. The Child Support Agency (CSA) does have powers to enforce payment of maintenance but this is an area where the Agency has not been sufficiently effective. The issue of enforcement appears regularly in correspondence we receive from parents and their representatives. Enforcement will be considered by Sir David Henshaw as part of his work to redesign the child support system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/2">In the shorter term we have announced plans to improve collection of maintenance in the agency's operational improvement plan. The agency will be using deduction from earnings orders earlier and more frequently for those who either default on other payment arrangements or indicate that they are unlikely to pay. The agency will more actively manage higher risk cases to ensure payments are made and make more use of information held by HMRC and credit reference agencies to track down those who owe money for their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/3">The CSA will employ external debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt and use their best practice to improve its own collection activity. Over 600 more staff will be trained and effective within the next year and staffing dedicated to enforcement activity quadrupled over the period of the plan. For those parents who continue to avoid paying maintenance we will significantly increase the number brought before the courts, securing debt through liability orders and seizing of assets where appropriate. We will also work with the media and stakeholders to develop a campaign to make clear that failing to pay maintenance has real and lasting consequences for children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1197W.2/4">The cumulative effect of all of these measures will lead to more maintenance being paid and more children lifted out of poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.2/1">Invalidity benefit was replaced by incapacity benefit in April 1995. There are a number of reasons why an award of incapacity benefit may be reduced. These include where a claimant has occupational pension income above &pound;85 per week, where a claimant starts work which is not within the permitted work limits where a claimant's spouse's earnings increase to a point which extinguishes entitlement to an adult dependency increase, where a claimant is in hospital and where Child Support Agency payments are deducted from benefit. In addition in areas where Jobcentre Plus is rolled-out and in Pathways to Work pilot areas incapacity benefit can also be reduced where a sanction is applied following non-compliance with the conditionality requirements of the benefit. The vast majority of cases have more than one reason for a deduction and it is not possible to disaggregate the information about all these reductions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.5/1">The Department currently classifies customers with learning difficulties within the category of 'Mental and behavioural disorders' using the criteria internationally agreed in the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision). At the moment we are unable to separate these data further into more specific conditions, but we are looking into the feasibility of doing so in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/2">The National Benefits database therefore contains information on customers' periods of time on benefit and also records the associated health condition or disability using the ICD10 criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/3">Not everyone with a disability identifies themselves in the same way, nor do they have the same support needs, even if they are diagnosed with the same disability or health condition. Jobcentre Plus personal advisers are trained to discuss with each customer the affect their disability has on them and help them to identify the support most appropriate to them as an individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/4">Jobcentre Plus collects a minimum of information about its customers, commensurate with the need to manage programmes and to better meet the needs of the customer. Collecting information about customers' health conditions or disabilities cannot always be relied upon to yield accurate information and even if it did, the information is not always relevant to the job finding process. In the interests of minimizing bureaucracy, and because we prefer to see each customer as an</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/5">individual with individual needs, we do not consider it appropriate for Jobcentre Plus to routinely ask customers for information which some might regard as unnecessarily intrusive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/6">However, as a result of changes made recently following consultation with Mencap, from 2006 information on learning disability and on learning difficulty will be identified separately for the Labour Force Survey. Until now, information about people with a learning disability or learning difficulty has been combined into one category. These data are collected independently of the information in the National Benefits database.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205W.2/1">We estimate that since 1997 around 125,000 people have lost some part of their pension due to the insolvency of the sponsoring employer or where the employer no longer exists. We are now collecting information from pension schemes applying to the financial assistance scheme (FAS), which will enable us to provide actual data on the number of affected members in eligible schemes. However, as this information can only be provided by the pension scheme when close to winding up, it is likely to be some time before we have sufficient data to provide robust figures for each constituency and region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.2/2">As explained in my previous answer, based on our most recent data collection for the FAS, we know of around 70,000 non-pensioner members (in 380 schemes) that are potentially eligible for assistance from the FAS as a result of their schemes being wound up in circumstances of insolvency or where the employer no longer exists. In addition to these members we anticipate that a few hundred more schemes, including around 50,000 non-pensioner members and a small number of pensioner members, could come forward and be eligible for assistance. Some of these members may have suffered limited losses and would therefore not be eligible for FAS.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208W.7/2">The Housing Corporation has reported to me that it has discussed with Birmingham city council the effect of land costs for housing associations on the 2006&ndash;08 Affordable Housing Programme as there were concerns that high land costs were delaying housing associations from planning new social housing in the city. I understand that the Housing Corporation and Birmingham city council have made significant progress with regards to land costs and improving value for money which has resulted in an increase in the new homes that can be provided through the Housing Corporation's Affordable Housing Programme for 2006&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1208W.7/3">There remains a concern about the council's longer term approach as it progresses its plans to dispose of surplus housing land to provide new affordable homes or other community facilities. I therefore have asked officials in Government office west midlands to continue to investigate with the city council its approach to the sale of housing land, and the implications of this for the provision of affordable housing and wider neighbourhood regeneration in the city in the long term.</p>

The Act sets out clear roles and responsibilities for local responders (including local authorities) establishing a basis for effective performance assessment. The Act's accompanying regulations (Contingency Planning 2005&quot;) set out the detail of the new legislative framework providing a clear set of standards for responders to meet. The supporting statutory guidance Emergency Preparedness&quot; describes in more detail how these standards can be met. It sets out the requirements of the Act and provides advice on good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/3">The performance of responders against the requirements set out in the Act is assessed by their existing performance assessment frameworks. English local authorities' performance is assessed by the Audit Commission through the comprehensive performance assessment (CPA) process. The performance of local authorities in Wales is assessed by the Wales Audit Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.2/4">The Scottish Executive is responsible for making regulations and issuing guidance, under the Act, to local authorities in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, local authorities are subject to the non-statutory Northern Ireland civil contingencies framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.1214W.2/1">The total debt attributed to council housing in 1980 is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214W.2/2">In 2000&ndash;01 the total debt was &pound;17.6 billion. This has now fallen to an estimated &pound;13.3 billion, although that figure may vary between now and when the final figure for the 2005&ndash;06 financial year is known. With the exception of &pound;1.8 billion in 'overhanging debt' payments made by government, the reduction of &pound;4.3 billion has been due to repayments made by local authorities. ('Overhanging debt' is the debt an authority is unable to repay from the receipt it gets on the transfer of its stock to a housing association. Debt repayment is the first call on such receipts. Where the outstanding debt exceeds the receipt, the Government pays off the excess amount of debt&mdash;the overhanging debt. The Government chooses to repay such debt rather than continuing to support that debt&mdash;as had happened previously through the allowance made for debt service charges in the Housing Revenue Account subsidy system. The choice between paying off overhanging debt and continuing to support the debt through subsidy is intended to be broadly neutral in net financial terms for the authority.)</p>

It may keep the remaining 25 per cent. to spend on capital purposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1214W.5/4">Pooled capital receipts collected from debt-free and with-debt authorities are treated differently. Pooled capital receipts from debt-free authorities, that is, local authorities that had no long term outstanding borrowing on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> come to the ODPM, where they are used to support sustainable communities projects such as new social housing and decent homes. Pooled capital receipts from debt-free authorities, that is, local authorities that had long term outstanding borrowing on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> go to the Treasury, where they are recycled as investment, for instance as capital investment in housing as described above.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214W.5/5">If the disposal of the council house is not to somebody who intends to use it as their principal dwelling and is not through the right to buy, the local authority may use their capital allowance to extinguish up to 100 per cent. of the capital receipt for use on the provision of affordable housing or regeneration within the local authority. In 2004&ndash;2005, &pound;23 8 million of capital receipts were extinguished in this way for retention by local authorities.</p>
