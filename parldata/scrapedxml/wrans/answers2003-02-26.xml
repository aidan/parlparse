I have also written to the French minister and spoken individually to ministerial colleagues from Spain, Germany and Denmark. The outcome has been, progressively, the inclusion of action on cetacean bycatch firstly in the Commission's roadmap on CFP reform and secondly in the action plan on environmental matters under the CFP, and publication of the Commission's discussion paper on the reduction of cetacean bycatch in December 2002. I shall continue to fund our scientific work and to press for action, with a view to securing concrete proposals from the Commission and then their adoption by the Council.</p>

(In Wales these arrangements are dealt with by the National Assembly for Wales which operates similar arrangements). Assistance is available to authorities to help with uninsurable clear-up costs following a disaster or emergency in their area which involves destruction of, or danger to, life or property. In March last year the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister wrote to all authorities reminding them of the existence of the scheme and advising them how to go about getting assistance under it.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.8/3">Under this scheme authorities are themselves responsible for the first tranche of expenditure on emergency work. The amount each authority affected will be expected to find is just 0.2 per cent. of its annual budget. Expenditure above that will be eligible for 85 per cent. assistance from Government.</p>

	<p pid=".549W.5/1">The Department has made no assessment of populations of white, hammerhead or thresher sharks, as these species are rare in UK waters. I am concerned at the decrease in shark populations, and so have been working to protect sharks at national and international level. In particular I have pressed for early adoption of a strict measure based on the Commission's welcome proposal to restrict shark finning; I have also introduced measures to protect the basking shark under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and secured improved international protection for basking sharks through strengthened CITES listing.</p>

Any disruption to their current situation could lead to a serious humanitarian crisis. The Government is committed to minimising the suffering of the Iraqi people. In the event of military action a key priority will be to re-establish critical humanitarian infrastructure as quickly as possible, including the Iraqi hospitals, clinics, sanitation facilities and water treatment plants which already suffer from a terrible lack of maintenance. The medical risks of the use of chemical and biological weapons are horrendous. Most traditional deliverers of medical aid are not adequately prepared for the worst case scenarios.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.3/2">Of DFID's bilateral aid programme allocable by sector, the amount spent on education projects in 2001/02 was &pound;112 million. This figure represents expenditure on projects specific to the education sector but does not capture the full extent of our efforts as it excludes multi-sector projects and programmes, strategic funding to civil society organisations and budget support and balance of payments. Also excluded are activities funded through multilateral channels.</p>

	<p pid=".552W.9/1">My department is providing &pound;120,000 to the Fairtrade Foundation over three years (2001&mdash;2003) in support of its efforts to target new groups through its annual Fairtrade Fortnight campaigns. These help to raise consumer awareness of development issues in international trade as well as highlighting ways in which consumers can act to make a difference.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.9/2">In addition, DFID has provided &pound;168,930 over three years (from 1999 to 2002) in support of Fairtrade Foundation's year round media work, helping it to raise awareness of the &quot;FT mark&quot; and what it stands for.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.9/3">Last year DFID also approved a project (at a total cost of &pound;300,000) designed to address a recognised bottleneck within Fair Trade&mdash;namely the limited number of products for which international Fair Trade standards exist. The project aims to develop new Fair Trade product standards, secure the registration of new producer groups and help bring additional Fair Trade products to supermarket shelves over the next 2 years. The target is to increase the retail value of Fair Trade sales in the UK to over 100m per annum by 2004 and by so doing extend the benefits of Fair Trade to a greater number of producers in developing countries. By expanding the scale of Fair Trade activities, the project also aims to secure a sustainable future for the Fairtrade Foundation, so that its core operational costs (including the cost of subsequent promotional activities) can be fully funded from the income it receives from licensees.</p>
	<p pid=".552W.9/4">Owing to travel commitments, I am unable to attend the launch of the Fairtrade Fortnight this year. However, the Fairtrade Foundation has invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

Iraqi oil production currently stands at around 2.5 million barrels per day only 3 per cent. of total world oil production and of which only around 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day is exported. There are a number of other factors such as the weather, supply from other countries, etc which affect the underlying demand and supply balance of the oil market: e.g. OPEC producers are likely to increase their production to cover any loss of Iraqi supply; seasonal oil demand is reducing; and the International Energy Agency has general arrangements in place to take international action, including release of stocks, in case of a supply disruption.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.8/1">Multilateral debt relief for Zambia is provided through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Under the HIPC initiative a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches Decision Point and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at Completion Point. The UK supports this internationally agreed policy.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/2">To reach Decision Point and demonstrate its commitment to poverty reduction, a country must prepare an Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). To reach Completion Point it needs to develop a full PRSP, and usually make progress in implementing it for one year.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/3">The PRSP is drawn up by the country, with the participation of civil society, to show how debt relief and other resources will be targeted on reducing poverty. The country must also be on track with its IMF programme for which there will be a range of conditions, for example on macro-economic stability or public sector management.The IMF is committed to ensuring that the social impact of key macro-economic reforms is analysed to ensure that reforms are designed appropriately and negative consequences addressed. For example, the IMF carried out an analysis of the possible social impact of the privatisation of the Zambia National Bank and the Zambian Government plans to develop a strategic plan that will consider the future of rural branches and design an appropriate institutional structure for rural services, which might include seeking technical and financial assistance from donors for the purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/4">Hence to reach Completion Point countries must demonstrate a commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform by meeting key conditions (or Completion Point triggers). These conditions may include privatisations or reforms that address the effectiveness and financing of parastatal companies, and thus support the country's strategy for reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.8/5">For Zambia the key conditions, for multilateral debt relief through the internationally agreed HIPC initiative, include progress in combating HIV/AIDs, education and health sector reform along with macro-economic and structural reforms. The Completion Point triggers in relation to the Zambia National Bank and the power utility Zesco require the issuance of international bidding documents for the sale of a majority (controlling) interest. The telephone company Zamtel no longer has a domestic monopoly, and while the sale of a substantial share is part of Zambia's overall poverty reduction strategy it is not a Completion Point trigger.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.3/1">In 2001, about 77,700 people who had been bailed to appear at court failed to do so, representing 13 per cent. of defendants at magistrates' courts and 10 per cent. of Crown Court defendants (13 per cent. overall). Figures are not available for what proportion of those failing to appear were subsequently re-arrested and brought back to court, or how many defendants broke the terms of bail conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.3/3">It is important that bail should be used appropriately, and the Government keeps the legislation relating to bail under review in order to ensure that it does everything possible to ensure this. The Criminal Justice Bill now before Parliament makes several changes, including extending the prosecution's right to appeal against a decision by magistrates to grant bail.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.5/1">Tackling the causes of offending is an integral part of the street crime initiative. To this end, provision exists for those who are arrested for a street crime offence and who are drug dependent, whose offence is linked to their drug dependency and who are willing to access treatment to do so within 24 hours of release into the community (whether on bail, following release from custody, or on receipt of a community sentence following a custodial remand). Participation is voluntary and not all those misusing drugs make use of the scheme. Delays in accessing treatment beyond 24 hours can be explained in some cases by release occurring over a weekend or by offenders simply not keeping initial appointments.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.5/2">Of those who have, to date 62 per cent. of the reported individuals entered treatment within 24 hours of release. 15 per cent. were seen within two to three days, and 21 per cent. were seen between four to seven days. The remaining three per cent. were seen between one to two weeks after release from custody.</p>

	<p pid=".580W.6/1" class="italic">(a) Generic skills</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/2">Our recent statement '14&ndash;19 : opportunity and excellence' set out our vision for a 14&ndash;19 phase where all young people can choose from a range of courses and qualifications covering a wide range of general and specialist subjects and skills. Our statement specifically included the following measures on generic skills.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/3">To help ensure that all young people are well equipped in literacy, numeracy and computer skills we will introduce (from 2004&ndash;05 onwards) an entitlement for them to continue studying up to age 19 until they reach the standard of a good GCSE or the corresponding Level 2 key skill qualification. Those going on to higher education or professional study after 19 should be encouraged to achieve a Level 3 qualification in at least one of these skill areas.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/4">We will invite the 14&ndash;19 working group, chaired by Mike Tomlinson, to look at how young people can develop the essential practical skills for life, and how the content of individual subjects and programmes could place a greater emphasis on analysis, problem solving and thinking skills, as well as the presentation and argument of conclusions. Practical and analytical skills are equally essential in adult life and in the workplace. Existing programme and subject requirements do not always sufficiently emphasise these skills.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/5">In addition, &quot;Skills for Life&quot;, the Government's strategy for improving adults' literacy and numeracy skills, identifies young adults as a priority group. We are determined to bring young people who leave school with poor literacy, language and numeracy skills back into learning. These skills are important prerequisites for young adults to find and keep work and overcome potential barriers to participating fully in society.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/6" class="italic">(b) Specialist learning</p>
	<p pid=".580W.6/7">We have also asked the 14&ndash;19 working group to consider the appropriate balance between specialist and general skills in learning programmes for this age group. At present, we believe that for many young people who follow an academic path, particularly at ages 16&mdash;18, the range of studies is too specialised and narrow when compared with advanced level students in other countries. We want young people to be able to combine a broad range of studies with more specialist choices that meet their own individual interests and aspirations.</p>

	<p pid=".581W.2/1">Specialist schools are a key driver of the Government's plans to create a more diverse secondary education sector. Schools can currently apply for one of eight specialisms (or they can combine any two). In the secondary strategy document 'A New Specialist System' we introduced two new specialisms&mdash;Music and Humanities&mdash;and an option for rural schools to add a rural dimension to an existing specialism.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.2/2">The Specialist Schools Application Guidance encourages headteachers and governing bodies to investigate which specialism is appropriate for them in the context of collaboration with other local secondary schools and their local education authorities (LEAs) in order to increase diversity and maximise the impact of specialist schools in the locality.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.2/3">A significant number of LEAs have been working with their schools on developing a strategy for increasing their specialist provision. Excellence in Cities partnerships in particular, have played a significant role in nominating and deciding when schools should go forward for specialist status. The Diversity Pathfinders LEAs are developing and implementing models of diversity based on the Specialist Schools Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.2/4">At the beginning of February, 217 new specialist schools were designated across all eight specialims: 29 Arts, 28 Business &amp; Enterprise, 4 Engineering, 14 Language, 26 Mathematics &amp; Computing, 40 Science, 40 Sports and 29 Technology Colleges, and 7 schools with combined specialisms.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.2/5">However, our aim of increasing diversity in the secondary sector goes beyond the Specialist Schools Programme. Academies, again with a special curriculum emphasis, will also contribute to diversity of provision. The first three academies opened in September 2002. We expect at least 33 to be open by 2006 and further academies to be opened beyond that. The Department are also encouraging new providers to come forward and offer new types of schools as they are needed. These providers will include: parents and community groups; private and charitable companies; voluntary groups including church and faith communities; those offering distinctive educational philosophies; and existing schools or consortia of schools.</p>

	<p pid=".583W.2/1">It is not possible to estimate the number of persistently truant school children in Lancashire from the data we have available at present. The data for the national pupil absence survey is collected at school level and there is only one set of figures for each school, so that we cannot identify which children were persistently absent. Information on the characteristics of individual pupils cannot be deduced from this data. However, in 2001/02 there were 17,934 pupils that were absent for at least one half day due to unauthorised absence and the average number of half days they missed was 15.</p>

	<p pid=".584W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) changed its clemency policy towards British nationals detained overseas in May 2001. Under the new policy, HMG will now consider supporting appeals on compassionate grounds, where there is prima facie evidence of a miscarriage of justice, or where the prisoner is a minor. An appeal for clemency is a request to the detaining state to release the prisoner unconditionally, not reduce the original sentence. Since the new policy came into effect, we have supported appeals on behalf of 15 British nationals. The FCO does not hold statistics on representations made before the introduction of the new clemency policy. Nor does it record the ethnic origin of those who are offered consular assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/2">As a general rule, HMG will lobby against the death penalty imposed on any British national overseas. In this instance, HMG is not appealing for unconditional release, but for the death penalty to be commuted to imprisonment. We have supported 11 such cases since May 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/3">Other than lobbying against the death penalty, HMG would not normally appeal for a reduction in sentence. This is on the basis that states must recognise the rights of other sovereign states to sentence according to their own laws. However, HMG would consider making representations to a sentencing state if a British national appeared to have been harshly sentenced purely because of nationality. There have been no instances of this since at least May 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".584W.2/4">The welfare of British nationals detained overseas is of primary concern to the FCO. We ensure that prisoners are visited regularly and we raise any concerns that we, prisoners or their relatives may have about their treatment or the conduct of their trial. As a last resort, when all other options have failed, we will consider supporting an appeal for clemency under the criteria outlined above.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.6/2">Our diplomatic relations with North Korea and a British Embassy in Pyongyang allow us to express our concerns about reports of widespread and serious violations of human rights in DPRK directly to the North Korean authorities on a regular basis. But a lack of hard evidence and access for independent monitors makes it difficult to substantiate allegations, most of which come from defectors' reports. Freedom of expression is curtailed and criticism severely punished (there are reports of up to 200,000 political prisoners). Freedom of movement is restricted within the country and foreign travel is only permitted for a select few. There are reports of widespread use of the death penalty and detention without trial. The DPRK does not participate in international refugee fora, nor is it in contact with the UNHCR. It is at least six years since a UN rapporteur was allowed into the country. The UK has financed human rights training courses for North Korean government officials, and we will continue to request access for international observers, including UK diplomats, to verify negative reports circulating internationally about the situation in DPRK. We are also pressing North Korea to co-operate fully with UN mechanisms and to fulfil its UN reporting obligations.</p>

	<p pid=".596W.2/1">HSE inspectors are given training and instruction and are provided with guidance and information about the types of situations and incidents, which can give rise to release of asbestos fibres. Many HSE publications provide information on the typical exposure levels likely to be generated by certain activities and which of these will exceed the control limit.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/2">Exposure limits and levels are never used in isolation. Inspectors check compliance with the range of controls required by the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 to ensure that the hierarchy of control measures has been applied and that exposure has been reduced to as low a level as is reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/3">In most cases, inspectors will use this information together with their knowledge, rather than arranging for scientific measurements to be taken, to assist in forming an opinion about a risk of serious personal injury and the appropriateness of serving a Prohibition Notice. In cases of doubt, they will often seek a view from a more experienced senior colleague or a specialist inspector.</p>
	<p pid=".596W.2/4">There is a statutory right of appeal to an Employment Tribunal available to the person who, in the opinion of the inspector, has breached the regulations and to whom an enforcement notice has been served.</p>

	<p pid=".599W.2/2">In England, Scotland and Wales the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) enforces the legal requirement for companies to maintain Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI) and to display a valid certificate. The HSE undertakes this enforcement activity during general inspections by HSE Inspectors and through the work of its Workplace Contact Officers who focus on small and medium-size enterprises.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/3">Workplace Contact Officers and Inspectors may ask to see a valid ELCI certificate during a visit. Where the certificate cannot be produced at the visit, HSE will write to the employer, and if no satisfactory response is received within a reasonable time that is 21 days under current instructions, will make a statutory request ('Notice to Produce') for its production. However, there may be circumstances where HSE considers it appropriate to issue a Notice to Produce straightaway where an employer fails to produce a valid certificate. Failure to produce a certificate will result in on-site inquires and prosecution, subject to evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/4">A total of 4,366 contacts were made by Workplace Contact Officers between April and September 2002. Of these, just 14 (or 0.3 per cent.) merited the serving of a statutory notice to produce. In addition, HSE Inspectors carry a large number of issues during regulatory contacts, but because of the varying nature and range of visits undertaken, it is not possible to give exact figures as to how many of these regulatory contacts covered the issue of ELCI. However, during the same period of April to September 2002, HSE inspectors issued an additional 30 Notices to Produce. So the total number of Notices to Produce issued by HSE in this 6-month period was 44.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/5">Of those served notices, 31 employers (70 per cent.) have subsequently produced valid ELCI certificates. Inquiries relating to the 13 employers who have failed to produce ELCI certificates are continuing and may result in prosecution, subject to evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/6">There were four prosecutions in 2002 resulting in penalties being imposed in three cases. Between 1997 and 2001, HSE successfully pursued 25 prosecutions for non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/7">The above figures cover England, Scotland and Ireland. There is not available a breakdown for each area.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/8">In Northern Ireland a total of 1,924 visits to work places were made by HSE (Northern Ireland) Inspectors between April and September 2002. Inspectors routinely check on ELCI cover during visits although, as with HSE in England, Scotland and Wales, it is not possible to give exact figures as to how many of these visits covered the issue of ELCI. However, during the time period referred to above, no employers were detected by HSE (Northern Ireland) to be operating without ELCI.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/9">HSE (Northern Ireland) records show one prosecution in recent years relating to ELCI in Northern Ireland. In December 2000, an employer was convicted for non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".599W.2/10">These figures suggest that levels of compliance remain very high. However, the Government are aware of the recent problems being faced by employers in getting ELCI, and we announced in the Pre-Budget Report our intention to undertake a formal review of the operation of ELCI.</p>

	<p pid=".601W.2/1">The New Deal for Young People is continuing to help significant numbers of disadvantaged young people into work. Many of these have moved into jobs more quickly and have stayed there longer than they would have done without the New Deal. Up to September 2002, 313,700 New Deal clients had moved into jobs lasting 13 weeks or more.</p>
	<p pid=".601W.2/2">Since 1999, the proportion of leavers to known destinations entering unsubsidised, sustained jobs has remained largely constant at around 54 per cent. Research has also shown that people leaving to unknown destinations are just as likely to leave the New Deal for work as those going to known destinations. Further evaluation is planned this year to confirm this position. Jobcentre Plus is working closely with New Deal providers to improve the collection and recording of the destinations of programme participants.</p>
	<p pid=".601W.2/3">The change in the proportion of leavers from the New Deal for Young People entering unsubsidised, sustained employment is largely due to an increase in leavers going to unknown destinations (from 25 per cent. in 1998 to just under 33 per cent. so far in 2002).</p>
	<p pid=".601W.2/4">As long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated, we are now also getting feedback from those delivering the New Deal that an increasing proportion of people on the programme are facing greater barriers to moving into sustained employment. That is why we have introduced initiatives such as StepUP and progress2work which build on the New Deal and help the most disadvantaged people overcome the barriers they face and move into work.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.4/1">Since 1997, youth unemployment has fallen by a third in Jarrow and South Tyneside, by nearly 40 per cent. in Tyne and Wear and by 47 per cent. in the UK. Over the same period, long-term (over six months) youth unemployment has been cut by 86 per cent. in Jarrow and by around 80 per cent. in south Tyneside, Tyne and Wear and the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.4/2">In 1998 we introduced the New Deal for Young People to tackle the waste of long-term youth unemployment. The programme has played an important part in the massive reductions in long-term unemployment among young people across the country. Almost 400,000 young people have moved into work through the New Deal. Independent research found that the number of young people unemployed for six months or more would be twice as high without the New Deal.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.4/3">The New Deal has been successful in the north-east of England. By the end of September 2002, in Tyne and Wear, 13,880 young people had moved from welfare into work through the New Deal, 2,390 in south Tyneside, and 1,070 in Jarrow.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.4/4">We are building on the achievements of the New Deal. Early last year, we started tailored pathway pilots, including one in Wearside, to help young people use the New Deal Options more flexibly and move into sustained jobs. In 2002 we launched StepUp in 20 pilot areas, including Sunderland, to provide transitional jobs for people who have not secured sustained jobs through New Deal. We have introduced progress2work to provide additional support to help unemployed drug misusers into work. The initiative is already up and running in Newcastle, and will be starting in Sunderland very shortly, and will be rolled out across the country later this year. We have also developed ambition initiatives to help unemployed people gain the right skills to meet the needs of employers in key sectors. One such initiative for the retail sector is operating in Gateshead. We are introducing progress2work-LinkUP to help those facing the greatest disadvantages in the labour market, including ex-offenders, homeless people and recovering alcohol misusers. One of the pilots will start in south Tyneside later this year. These initiatives are ensuring that all young people, even those who face great disadvantages in the labour market or who live in the most deprived areas, are given the help and support they need to gain independence through moving from welfare to work.</p>

If a commercial recruitment agency is alleged to be contravening the code of practice, the Department will carry out an immediate investigation to determine whether that agency should be removed from the list of agencies operating under the terms of the code.

Details of all agencies working in line with the code of practice appear on the Department's website and is updated regularly. NHS organisations are strongly recommended to refer to the current list of approved agencies when establishing new contracts but there is no legislation requiring them to do so. The list is publicised through regular contacts with the NHS and workforce development confederations.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.0/1">The information on Quarter 3, 2002&ndash;03, delayed discharge and emergency readmission figures has been placed in the Library. Between September 2001 and December 2002, more than 2,000 fewer people were waiting to be discharged from hospital on any single day. The rate of 28-day emergency readmission for patients of all ages has increased very slightly over last quarter from 5.35 to 5.4 per cent. In the last five years, the basis of the information collection has changed to patients of all ages, rather than only patients over 75 years, and from April 2002, the data have been collected by primary care trust area instead of the former health authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.0/1">The Updated Drug Strategy 2002 recommendation, that heroin should be available on prescription to all those who have a clinical need for it, does emphatically not mean that heroin is preferable to other treatments. Heroin prescribing may be a valuable supplement to other treatment but only in a limited number of cases, usually where oral methadone has not proved successful. It is for individual clinicians to make a decision about this on a patient by patient basis.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.0/2">Prescribing oral methadone as a substitute for illicit opiates has proven benefits for both the individual and for society, particularly in terms of reducing injecting behaviour and criminal activity. Methadone can be prescribed for a range of treatments including detoxification, stabilisation and longer-term therapies. Additional guidance for practitioners on the use of heroin as a treatment option is due to be published shortly by the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.2/1">Gender reassignment surgery consists of a series of different surgical procedures, for example, female to male gender reassignment may require a mastectomy and a hysterectomy and a series of operations to construct a phallus. The Department collects Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from national health service trusts on operations specifically for sexual transformation, but those procedures such as mastectomies or hysterectomies are collected separately and it is not possible to identify if these were carried out as part of a gender reassignment operation. Details of the NHS trusts who have undertaken any operations for sexual transformation in the past five years are listed in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.2/2">The HES data shows that 89 operations were undertaken for male to female gender reassignment surgery in 2001&ndash;02. No operations for female to male gender reassignment were recorded during this period.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.5/1">The original timetable for appointing the Health Protection Agency (HPA) shadow Chief Executive Officer (CEO) had been for the end of October 2002, to enable the incoming shadow Chair of the HPA to participate in the appointment procedure. Following advertisements in the national press and professional journals, it was felt that the field of responses could be strengthened and that, given the importance of the role of the new HPA, the assistance of executive search consultants should be sought to advise on and co-ordinate the appointment. This was undertaken during November and December 2002, enabling competitive interviews to be held in early January. The result of that process has been the announcement of the CEO appointment (Dr. Pat Troop) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January 2003</phrase> and there is therefore no need for this post to be re-advertised.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.8/1">The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) consulted the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) on the safety of kava-kava, as this falls within its statutory terms of reference which are: &quot;to give advice with respect to safety, quality and efficacy in relation to human use of any substance or article (not being an instrument, apparatus or appliance) to which any provision of the Medicines Act 1968 is applicable; to promote the collection and investigation of information relating to adverse reactions for the purpose of enabling such advice to be given.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/2">The CSM convened an expert working group with the following remit.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/3" class="indent">To consider the currently available evidence on the issue of hepatotoxicity suspected to be associated with the use of the herbal remedy kava-kava (piper methysticum).</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/4" class="indent">To assess the risks to public health and whether these can be quantified or prevented and to advise on the risk/benefit balance.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/5" class="indent">To consider the possible regulatory actions and provide advice on a recommended course of action including how the information should be distributed to healthcare professionals and consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/6">The CSM received the working group's recommendations, considered the available evidence and arguments and gave preliminary advice that the most appropriate regulatory option was the revocation of the marketing authorisations for the three licensed products containing kava-kava and prohibition of the supply of the unlicensed products under section 62 of the Medicines Act. Other options considered were label warnings about hepatic adverse reactions; restrictions of strength, dosage or type of formulation; restricting the status of kava-kava to a prescription only medicine or no regulatory action.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/7">Following preliminary advice from CSM the MCA undertook a public consultation on the prohibition of kava-kava. The MCA sought advice on the responses to the consultation both from the CSM and the Medicines Commission, whose terms of reference are broadly to advise Health Ministers on matters relating to the execution of the Medicines Act 1968. Both bodies were asked to advise on the regulatory options in light of the latest scientific evidence and the responses to public consultation. Both advised that kava-kava should be prohibited in unlicensed medicines and that the marketing authorisations for the licensed products should be revoked.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/8">The advice of the CSM and Medicines Commission on the safety of kava-kava is contained within the minutes of the meetings, which are available in the Library, together with copies of the assessment reports.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.8/9">In the light of this advice and having considered all the evidence the Minister considered that the sale, supply and importation of kava-kava should be prohibited.</p>

Apart from rare instances of hypersensitivity, no adverse reactions have been proven. Alternative dental restorative materials are not so easily, quickly and reliably placed. Neither are they so durable. The 1998 European Union expert report concluded that currently available data indicate that mercury from dental amalgam restorations will not cause an unacceptable health risk to the general population.

	<p pid=".627W.2/2">Whilst the proposals contained in the Department for Education and Skills' White Paper include allowing universities to increase tuition fees, there is as yet no clear indication from the higher education sector of the scope or scale of any increased charges. The Department of Health will ensure that any increase in the cost of university courses will not have any adverse impact on the supply of students for health training programmes, including medicine.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/3">We are already making a significant investment in extra places at existing medical schools and in establishing new medical schools. By autumn 2003, United Kingdom medical school intakes are planned to total over 7,050, the highest figure ever. The number of UK applicants to study medicine is at the highest level since 1986, which is the earliest year we have figures for.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.8/1">Good progress has been made since the national health service prostate cancer programme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-06">6 September 2000</phrase>, setting out the Government's approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/2">As part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England from <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-23">23 September 2002</phrase> to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/3">Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow-up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Primary care and laboratories were informed of recommendations from the scientific reference group, which supports the PCRMP, in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/4">By 2003&ndash;04, the Department will be directly funding &pound;4.2 million of research a year on prostate cancer. This is a 20-fold increase compared with 1999&ndash;2000. Two National Cancer Research Institute prostate cancer research collaboratives have been established in Newcastle and London. Funded research includes studies on various treatments for prostate cancer, improving the PSA test and ethnic differences in prostate cancer incidence. The National Cancer Research Institute considered prostate cancer as part of its strategic analysis in 2002, but made no specific recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/5">The Department is funding a Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase further information about prostate cancer. This is supporting the creation, review, provision and dissemination of a range of awareness material, supported by &pound;135,000 over three years. 92.4 per cent. of patients with suspected urological cancers, including prostate, were seen for their first out-patient appointment within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding they should be urgently referred, and the hospital receiving the referral within 24 hours, in April to June 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/6">The cancer services collaborative is modernising cancer care, including prostate cancer, by reducing unnecessary delays in the system for patients throughout the cancer journey.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/7">The number of consultant urologists grew from 382 in 2000 to 427 in 2001, and is set to grow to 504 in 2005. There may be around an additional 100 trained specialists available to take up consultant posts in urology.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/8">The Government welcomed the launch of the prostate cancer charter for action on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January 2003</phrase>. We look forward to working closely with the charter. To ensure better collaboration and communication between the charter members, the Government intend to set up a prostate cancer advisory group, allowing us to combine the expertise of the voluntary sector with the national health service for the benefit of patients.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.0/2">The information requested is not collected centrally. The Department of Health issued Health Service Guidance (95)25, NHS early retirement arrangements, which clearly states that offers of re-employment or payments for consultancy work are not expected to be made to former national health service employees who have taken early retirement from the NHS at public expense, unless the offer clearly represents good value for money in relation to alternatives.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.0/3">Further employment of staff who receive early payment of NHS pension benefits as a result of compulsory redundancy, or who volunteer to retire early with actuarially reduced pension benefits, is not restricted. However, the HSG provides guidelines on the abatement and suspension of NHS pension during re-employment in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.6/1">During October and November 2002, there was a marked increase in the number of outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis. Many of these were linked to the use of eggs in catering and in the majority of these, the eggs appeared to have originated from Spain.</p>
	<p pid=".638W.6/2">Investigations of eggs linked to outbreaks and of eggs in catering premises, carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service, have identified a higher level of contamination of Spanish eggs by Salmonella (5 per cent. of pooled samples) than was found in previous surveys of eggs, whether United Kingdom produced (1 per cent. of pooled samples) or non-UK produced (2 per cent. of pooled samples).</p>
	<p pid=".638W.6/3">Eggs, regardless of their origin, cannot be guaranteed to be Salmonella free. However, the risk to public health can be minimised if eggs are properly handled and cooked. The FoodStandards Agency has reiterated advice to a wide range of food businesses, including those catering for vulnerable groups, on the correct handling and use of raw shell eggs. It has drawn the problem with eggs to the attention of the European Commission and the Spanish authorities and has advised importers and wholesalers of imported eggs to send eggs imported from Spain for commercial heat treatment until further notice. Since this advice was issued, the number of outbreaks has fallen to normal background levels.</p>

	<p pid=".639W.5/1">&quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot; gives primary care trusts (PCTs) the responsibility of improving the health of the community, securing the provision of high quality services and integrating health and social care locally.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/2">We are assisting this by increasing the numbers of speech and language therapists (SLTs). Between September 1997 and 2001, the number of SLTs employed in the national health service increased by 17 per cent., from 4,870 to 5,680. The numbers of SLTs entering training have increased by 21 per cent., from 457 to 553 between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2001&ndash;02. Also, with the extra investment announced in the 2002 Budget, by 2008 the NHS will have net increases of at least 30,000 scientists and therapists, including speech and language therapists, over the September 2001 staff census.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/3">A children care group work force team was established in December 2001 to take a national view on the health and social care work force pressures and priorities for children and maternity services. It supports the strategy set out in &quot;The HR in the NHS Plan&quot;, published in July 2002, which aims to grow and develop the NHS work force.</p>
	<p pid=".639W.5/4">One of the main priorities for the care group is to support the development of the children's national service framework. This includes action to develop a framework of the skills and competencies needed in the work force to deliver quality person-centred care for children, young people and expectant mothers. This will help to ensure that national educational needs are identified and action taken through the care group, and that at a local level, primary care trusts have the information needed to make adequate provision for children's services. This would include the provision of speech therapy.</p>

The decision as to the appropriate diagnostic test for any patient will be for the clinical judgment of the clinician in charge of the patient's care, taking full consideration of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p>
