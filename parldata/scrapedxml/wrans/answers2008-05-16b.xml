	<p pid="b.1794W.8/1">Under the Postal Services Act 2000, Parliament established Postcomm as the independent regulator for postal services. Postcomm's primary statutory duty is to ensure provision of a universal postal service. Subject to this, Postcomm will exercise its functions in the manner which it considers is best calculated to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.1794W.8/2">Postcomm has wide-ranging powers to gather information and investigate complaints about anti-competitive behaviour in the mail market.

	<p pid="b.1795W.9/1">Local authorities working with their partners in children's trusts are responsible for the overall delivery of the Sure Start Children's Centres programme in England, building on the early Sure Start Local Programmes and other provision, including planning, securing value for money and ensuring overall quality in children's centres. We encourage them to involve voluntary, private and independent organisations both in managing children's centres and as service providers in order to harness the best of all sectors in delivering quality services for children. Reliable information on how many Sure Start Children's Centres are run by voluntary organisations is not available centrally. A survey of around 1,100 children's centres last year showed around 58 per cent. of child care provision in children's centres is provided by the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sector and that 74 per cent. of children's centres are using voluntary organisations to deliver other services.</p>

They will look to review a list entry if information is brought to their attention to suggest that the banding is not correct.

The financial support available will depend on the claims made by local authorities. Funding will be available for some items of expenditure incurred by local authorities on an agreed cohort of supported families cases processed by the agency. We cannot therefore accurately estimate the level of funding required.</p>

	<p pid="b.1800W.2/1">I would like to apologise for the delay in answering these questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/2">Information on the number of foreign national households allocated social housing is collected in the Continuous Recording of Letting form (CORE). A question on nationality was first introduced to the form for the 2006-07 data collection period. CORE is collected on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government by St. Andrew's University. Historically CORE has only collected information from registered social landlords. An increasing number of local authorities are now providing information through this process as well, but there are still some gaps in the data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/3">In 2006-07 for registered social landlords, there were 1,769 new general needs lettings made to foreign nationals from European Economic Area (EEA) countries and 2,259 from non-EEA countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/4">Adjusting for missing data from local authorities, we estimate there were around 7,000 general needs local authority lets to foreign nationals. It is not possible to estimate the split between EEA and non-EEA foreign nationals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/5">Overall, we estimate that around 6 per cent. (equivalent to around 11,000) new general needs lettings were made to foreign nationals in 2006-07. This estimate adjusts for missing local authority data, and includes lets made to nationals from EEA countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/6">These estimates are the first to be made on the basis of a full year's information and are therefore the most robust information available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1805W.2/2">Hazard warning signs are generally intended to provide information to responding emergency services in the event of an incident. The Ministry of Defence police escorting convoys have this and more information to hand. All factors, including security, will be taken into account in determining whether hazard signs will appear on the replacement vehicles when carrying special nuclear material.</p>

	<p pid="b.1805W.5/2">Prior to deploying on operations soldiers receive welfare and personal briefings that are intended to assist them in coping with the demands of operational tours and the subsequent return from theatre. These briefings are supplemented by a booklet and a DVD.</p>
	<p pid="b.1805W.5/3">At the end of an operational tour personnel leaving theatre will go through a 24-36 hours period of 'decompression', prior to return to their home base. This enables them to unwind physically and mentally and to talk to colleagues and superiors about their experiences. Personnel also attend mandatory briefings during this period, designed to help them manage the transition to normal life. On return to the home base, and prior to the mandatory post operational leave, soldiers go through a normalisation process. This lasts for up to five days and is a structured programme of briefings and activities to help the re-adjustment to non-operational service life in barracks. Access to specialised mental healthcare is available at every stage of the process, as is access to the Army's comprehensive range of welfare services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1805W.5/4">For those leaving the operational theatre with illness or injuries it is often not practical for them to undergo decompression or normalisation. Those hospitalised at Selly Oak are visited at least daily by the Service Brigade Liaison Officers and the Defence Medical Welfare Staff. Arrangements are also made for their families to visit them as soon as possible to offer additional bedside comfort and support after their arrival in a UK hospital. They can also be counselled by Army welfare staff and, where appropriate, referred for more specialist treatment. For those who are evacuated from theatre to home sick leave the Army Sickness Absence Management process involves regular unit representative contact until individuals return to their units or are discharged from the Army. Where support requirements are identified before discharge an action plan is developed with the Veterans Welfare Service that ensures support continues for at least two years beyond discharge where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1805W.5/5">The Army has also recently implemented Trauma Risk Management (TRiM). This aims to identify at the earliest possible stage those who may have been affected by traumatic incidents so that appropriate counselling, or other forms of treatment, can be arranged for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1808W.0/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>

For 2007, the number of such requests was 152, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1810W.3/1">DEFRA published in 2007 a report by independent consultants that assessed the health impact of fortnightly residual collections of biodegradable waste. Part of the work assessed available evidence on health risks to members of the public from air-borne micro-organisms and air-borne biological material from household waste. They concluded that there is no evidence which indicates that fortnightly residual waste collection will result in an increase of these substances to levels in air which could pose any risks for members of the public. The research literature provides no evidence that fortnightly residual household waste collection will cause any significant health impacts for residents, or that any health impacts are likely to be significantly greater than those associated with weekly collections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.3/2">This is consistent with wider studies of the health effects of waste management, which indicate that waste management has at most a minor effect on health.</p>

	<p pid="b.1812W.2/1">The Government Response Paper published in October 2004 acknowledged that transfer of ownership to sewerage undertakers would result in far-reaching changes and that further work was needed to understand the implications. Since then DEFRA has undertaken this work, which has included further cost estimates, a stakeholder seminar and qualitative customer research. Details of this work can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1812W.2/2">As a result, the Government announced in February 2007 their decision to transfer private sewers and lateral drains draining to the public sewerage system into water company ownership. We subsequently published a public consultation in July 2007 on implementation options for the proposed transfer. The consultation also posed questions on the scope of assets to be included in the transfer and ways in which the creation of new private sewers can be prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1812W.2/3">A summary of responses was published in March 2008 and we are currently preparing proposals for implementation with the help of a steering group of key stakeholders. The work of the steering group will inform the decision on the timing of transfer and the drafting of regulations for implementation. We expect to be in a position to consult on these regulations later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1822W.2/1">Postgraduate dental deans determine priorities for the continuing education and training of dentists within block allocations made by the Department. However, as the diagnosis of oral cancer is included in the curriculum for the basic training of dental undergraduates in accordance with the 'First Five Years' published by the General Dental Council, specific courses on detection and diagnosis are not routinely included in postgraduate training programmes. However, we understand it is the policy of the postgraduate dental deanery for the east of England to include and update training in the detection of oral cancer in relevant training programmes for groups of dentists like vocational dental trainees. The deanery also makes available copies of the distance learning programme 'Early Detection and Prevention of Oral Cancer' funded by the Department and published in 2007.</p>

It employed a major national advertising campaign, aimed at attracting a much wider range of applicants than had been achieved previously.

The Workforce Modernisation Programme was formed to focus on developing new pay and grading for all staff working in National Offender Management Service and new workforce structures for all staff working in prison. New pay and grading structures will be underpinned by the new Job Evaluation System to ensure that pay and reward is fair across our different staffing groups. However, development of the different projects shaping aspects of the programme are in their early stages and no decisions have been made on whether changes to terms and conditions will be required.</p>

	<p pid="b.1836W.5/2">However, any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm will be cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of health during 2005-07 to replace the old F2052SH system. All at-risk prisoners are subject to a minimum required frequency of staff supervision (conversations and observations) set by an individual case review. Such frequency can vary widely between different at-risk prisoners depending on the level of risk and the needs of the distressed individual.</p>

	<p pid="b.1838W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service has a prisoner suicide prevention strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all who live and work in prisons. This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, drugs, resettlement, leadership and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.5/2">A revised strategy was published in October 2007. This builds on several years of learning from the experiences of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, and aims to embed improved suicide prevention and self-harm management methods of working in all areas of prison life. The strategy further develops cross-agency information flows, and reflects long-standing areas of safer custody work such as Listener and Insider peer supporters, local Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators and working with outside organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1838W.5/3">It also incorporates Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT), the care-planning system for prisoners at-risk of suicide or self-harm, introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07. The key benefits of ACCT include a faster first response, engagement with the prisoner, and the provision of flexible, individual and accountable care.

	<p pid="b.1839W.2/1">In December 2007 the Government announced their response to Lord Carter of Coles' report on prisons, including measures to both increase the supply of prison places and reduce the demand for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1839W.2/2">The Government are committed to increasing prison capacity by providing an additional 10,500 places, on top of their previously announced 9,500 place building programme, with the aim of achieving overall capacity of 96,000 places by 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.1839W.2/3">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act will give effect to measures recommended by Lord Carter to reduce the demand for prison places. These will start to have an impact later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1839W.2/4">The measures we are taking will ease the pressure on the prison estate. No prison will be expected to operate at a level of crowding beyond that agreed by the Prison Service area manager (or the Regional Offender Manager, in the case of a contracted prison).</p>

	<p pid="b.1850W.9/1">The Government have a range of programmes to provide assistance to those with mental health problems, including outreach services, and is developing a National Strategy for Mental Health and Work to improve the employment chances of those with a mental health condition. In addition, many people on low incomes, and particularly those from vulnerable groups, are unable to access sources of affordable credit that meet their needs. The Government are therefore committed to increasing the supply of affordable credit from credit unions and has allocated &pound;80 million over five years (2006-11) as a Growth Fund to support credit unions and other third sector lenders. Funded organisations have provided more than 70,000 loans to financially excluded customers, including those from vulnerable groups, since 2006. In addition, &quot;Financial inclusion: an action plan for 2008-11&quot;, published in December 2007, announced a commitment from the high street banks to support third sector affordable credit, including actions to develop new provision in 25 high priority areas.</p>
