Bus and light rail patronage in England increased by 6.3 per cent. between the baseline year of 2000&ndash;01 and 2003&ndash;04, the latest period for which data are available, covering the first three years of the 10-year target period.</p>

However, local authorities will need to include at least one local accessibility target in their second round Local Transport Plans and the Department will monitor progress against these targets. The Department has developed a range of core indicators, which will be used to build up a national picture of accessibility. Local targets may be based on these core indicators, or on other factors relevant in the local area.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.6/6">A pilot national survey of bus punctuality in England was carried out in March 2004. The first main survey is planned for March/April 2005. We are not yet in a position to assess whether punctuality is improving. Local authorities will need to include a bus punctuality indicator in their second round Local Transport Plans and monitor progress in their areas. Local authorities and bus operators are encouraged to work together in Punctuality Improvement Partnerships to overcome problems which lead to poor punctuality.</p>

I stressed that rural development measures should deliver public benefits. On competitiveness, I argued that support should be targeted on those businesses that found it difficult to raise capital through the normal channels. On simplification, I suggested that it would be appropriate to reduce the number of measures and adopt a more flexible approach to cross cutting projects. And I supported the Commission's work on biodiversity and Natura 2000 while suggesting that there could be a focus on water and climate change issues. No specific conclusions were drawn but the presidency indicated that it would be producing a revised draft of the proposal in the course of the week.</p>

	<p pid=".168W.9/6">A number of points were raised under any other business. The Commission reported on: the case of a French goat in which BSE had been diagnosed; and on continuing contacts with the Russian authorities over their veterinary and plant health import requirements. The presidency accepted a Dutch request to discuss at a future Council the threat posed by Avian Influenza. Germany urged the Council to seek involvement in action on food and health, sought an update on the WTO Dispute Panel considering the EU approval system for GM crops and products, and suggested a greater use of country of origin requirements in food labelling. The Commission rejected a Spanish proposal that the sugar trade concession offered to certain developing countries under the Everything But Arms commitment should be amended. The Commission also undertook to examine a Spanish request as to whether a regionalised approach to decoupling of tobacco aid could be permitted under the CAP reforms agreed last April. Olive oil producing countries pressed for the EU to resume its contributions to international promotional campaigns. Italy requested a change in the method for calculating part of the aid granted to nut producers. Several landlocked countries pressed for action to help dispose of the exceptionally heavy cereals harvest of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".179W.2/1">UK support to malaria control is provided through funding to: bilateral programmes at country level; global partnerships and programmes; multilateral agencies; and research agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/2" class="italic">Funding at country and regional level</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/3">At country-level DFID supports malaria control through bilateral programmes. Some of these are malaria specific, but increasingly DFID funds the broader health sector plans of developing country governments through sector wide programming and poverty reduction budget support. Such sectoral programmes will build capacity in health systems to improve the way health services diagnose and treat all main causes of illness. It is therefore not always possible to identify the proportion spent on malaria. From 1998&ndash;99 to date UK support at country level to specific malaria programmes was about &pound;58 million. In addition we have provided approximately &pound;49 million for projects targeted on malaria and other diseases or which may have an impact on malaria control. This funding is part of over &pound;1.5 billion committed by the UK to strengthening developing country health systems since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/4" class="italic">Funding to organizations at international level</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/5">DFID has contributed about &pound;153 million from 1998&ndash;99 to date to international programmes which target malaria and other diseases. In addition we also provide funding to multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the European Commission which also support malaria control and health services.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/6">DFID has committed funding to a number of global health partnerships, multilaterals, research agencies, and public-private partnerships. These current and future commitments are set out in table A as follows. These figures are not broken down by year.</p>

However, our response will be guided by the findings of needs assessments of the affected countries currently being finalised, and the level of resources which are already available to the affected countries, rather than by linking the Government's contribution to that of the British public. We are continuing to work hard with partner governments and the international community to ensure that support reaches those most affected by the disaster.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.6/1">Sure Start Tamworth is a round 4 Sure Start local programme which received approval in November 2001. It has a capital allocation of &pound;1 million. Its revenue allocations were: &pound;115,000 in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;404,000 in 2002&ndash;03, &pound;599,000 in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;613,975 in 2004&ndash;05. We have just written to the programme announcing its future revenue allocations of &pound;629,324 in 2005&ndash;06 and the same amount in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.6/2">The programme has 619 children aged 4 and under in its catchment area, which covers the wards of Glascote and Belgrave. This area represents the highest level of multiple deprivation within Tamworth. Glascote ward falls wholly within the 20 per cent. band of deprived wards in England and ranks as the fifth most deprived ward in Staffordshire according to the 2000 index of local deprivation.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.6/3">The programme has used its capital for two builds, the Exley Centre based in Belgrave which has focused on the refurbishment of a Community Centre providing a much needed central point for families in that area. This centre has recently received Ofsted approval to deliver 16 full day-care places. The Glascote Centre based in Glascote Heath is a new build currently registered for 24 full day-care places and providing a base for family support, training, health provision and Jobcentre plus links.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.6/4">The programme has made strong links with health and employs a midwife and a public health promotion co-ordinator within the programme. This had led to some unique service developments&mdash;the programme run a very successful food co-operative and provide families with 'healthy meal bags' which can be purchased for minimal costs but provide a family with all of the ingredients for a healthy, nutritious meal. The success of this project has led to the development of the 'Glascote Soup Kitchen' involving families in the preparation and consumption of nutritious meals, also providing an opportunity for parents to drop in and access not only healthy eating advice, but discuss wider issues with Family Support Workers and Health Advisors.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.6/5">The Programme has also developed a very successful training and volunteer programme&mdash;with parents currently engaged at all levels&mdash;from basic first aid through to a familiarisation course with Staffordshire University. There are also clear links with Jobcentre plus, with on-going training for Sure Start staff on in-work benefit calculations and back to work support and guided visits (supported by the Child Care Partnership Manager) to the local Jobcentre plus office for parents wishing to return to work.</p>

	<p pid=".189W.5/17">The EHJ is fitted with a comprehensive and sensitive fire detection system which reflects the value of the facility and the activities undertaken there. Flammable material is strictly controlled and constitutes only a small percentage of the EHJ construction. A vigorous precautionary approach is taken to all alarm triggers and all are attended by the on-site Defence Fire Service (DFS).</p>
	<p pid=".189W.5/18">Nuclear material is strictly controlled throughout the Depot and is not stored on the EHJ. While nuclear material onboard a submarine is likely to be within 100 yards of the EHJ, any fire on the jetty would present negligible hazard to the onboard nuclear material because submarine design limits the risk from external hazards.</p>

	<p pid=".191W.6/1">It is not possible to know what exactly proportion of applications made in 2004 will prove to be unfounded, or will eventually result in removal. Some applications made in 2004 are still awaiting the outcome of initial decisions or of appeals. Other cases are in the process of removal, can, in certain cases, create a number of barriers, for example the length of time it takes to obtain documentation to allow individuals to be accepted back by their countries of origin. Many failed applicants may either leave the UK voluntarily without advising the Home Office, or seek to evade the Home Office in order to try to avoid removal, or come from countries where removal is very difficult due to the situation in the country (e.g. Iraq).</p>

	<p pid=".201W.8/1">Several Home Office funding streams will benefit the locations that have been designated as growth areas, as they will other areas of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/2" class="italic">Crime Reduction</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/3">From April 2005, the main funding streams for crime reduction in communities will come under the Safer Stronger Communities Fund. This is a joint fund from the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Home Office, merging a number of current funding streams, including the Building Safer Communities Fund and the Antisocial Behaviour CDRP Allocation. In 2004&ndash;05, the authorities that cover the growth areas received &pound;11,278,810 from the Building Safer Communities Fund. Funding for local areas in 2005&ndash;06 will be finalised shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/4" class="italic">Policing</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/5">The eight police authorities that cover the growth areas will receive a total of &pound;2,824.3 million in general police grants in 2005&ndash;06. Formula grant, which takes into account the relative needs of authorities, consists of:</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/6" class="indent">Revenue Support Grant;</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/7" class="indent">Redistributed Business Rates; and</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/8" class="indent">Police Grant.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/9">Grant increases for these authorities next year range from the minimum increase of 3.75 per cent. up to almost 6.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/10">In addition, these authorities will also receive, in 2005&ndash;06, a total of around &pound;295.5 million in specific grant funding for a range of schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/11">Allocation of these resources is a matter for each chief constable and police authority, who will make decisions according to local plans and operational priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/12" class="italic">Antisocial Behaviour</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/13">In February 2005 the Home Office announced that intensive family support will be introduced in 50 TOGETHER antisocial behaviour action areas through a &pound;1.25 million cash boost. The &pound;1.25 million will be split equally between the 50 action areas with each area getting &pound;25,000. The growth areas which will be covered by the scheme are: Harlow, Peterborough, Southend on Sea, Northampton and Hackney.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/14">Additionally, in 2005&ndash;06 some growth areas will receive funding from ASBU to tackle local issues. Commitments are already in place for the following areas:</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/15" class="indent">Hackney will receive &pound;106,000 for the Hackney Crackdown project.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/16" class="indent">Harlow will receive action area funding of &pound;25,000.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/17" class="indent">Peterborough will receive action area funding of &pound;27,800.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/18" class="indent">Southend on Sea and Northampton are still to be agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/19">In 2005&ndash;06, the growth areas named will receive at least &pound;283,800 between them for antisocial behaviour action.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/20" class="italic">Tackling Drug Misuse</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/21">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the House Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/22" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/23" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/24" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/25" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/26">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse across all four strands&mdash;not only those delivered by the Home Office&mdash;amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".201W.8/27">The growth areas have seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme.

	<p pid=".206W.3/1">The Government have introduced new legislation to enable appropriate authorities to confiscate the proceeds of crime. The Government encourage the police and other agencies to make use of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) at every appropriate opportunity. Under the Act anyone convicted of a criminal offence is liable to confiscation proceedings to recover any proceeds of their criminality. In the absence of a conviction it is open to law enforcement agencies to refer the case to the Assets Recovery Agency to consider civil recovery or taxation proceedings instead. POCA also contains provisions for enabling the seizure of cash where it can be demonstrated that it is from, or intended for use in, crime.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.3/2">The Home Office funds Reflex, the multi-agency enforcement taskforce established to tackle organised immigration crime, including human trafficking. Many of the recent court cases have resulted from Reflex supported operations. Confiscating the proceeds of crime is an important part of the reflex strategy and a new dedicated Reflex Financial Investigation Unit has recently been established within the National Crime Squad.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.3/3">In addition the Home Office funds five multi agency Regional Asset Recovery Teams to increase the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and tackle money laundering.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.6/1">There is no specific offence of under-age drinking.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.6/2">However, the available information from the Home Office Court Proceedings database, gives the number of defendants aged 10&ndash;17 years who were proceeded against in each London borough, for offences of being drunk, drunk at a designated sports event and drunk and disorderly together with defendants proceeded against for the offence of: &quot;Selling etc., intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 for consumption on the premises&quot;. Figures for 1990 to 2003 are given in the following table. Statistics for 2004 will be available in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.6/3">In addition, the penalty notice for disorder scheme provides for persons who commit specified penalty offences to be issued with a fixed penalty notice instead of being prosecuted or cautioned. The scheme was extended to 16 and 17-year-olds from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-20">20 January 2004</phrase>. The second table details the number of penalty notices issued for the listed offences which involve under age drinking. These include offences committed by 16 and 17-year-olds and alcohol offences involving the purchase for, sale or delivery to persons aged under 18 years.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.6/4">The penalty notice for disorder scheme has been extended to allow penalty notices to be issued to 10 to 15-year-olds and pilots of these powers are now under way in seven police force areas including the borough of Kingston in the Metropolitan police force area. A further under age drinking offence, purchase of alcohol on licensed premises by a person under 18, is to be added to the scheme as set out in a draft Order laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.2/1">In recent months there have been a few signs suggesting an improvement in the political relationship between China and Taiwan. For example, over the Chinese new year there were direct flights across the Strait for Taiwanese businessmen, the first time for over 50 years that mainland commercial aircraft have landed in Taiwan. Moreover, cross-Strait trade increased by a third last year.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/2">We welcome these developments and believe that such practical measures build confidence and promote dialogue. We believe that through such pragmatism, real progress can be made. We continue to oppose the use of force and to take the view that the Taiwan question should be settled peacefully through negotiation between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/3">We are paying close attention to the development of China's proposed anti-secession legislation, the background to which I discussed recently with the Vice Minister of China's Taiwan Affairs Office. We continue to urge both sides to avoid unilateral measures that might raise tension.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.8/2">Euratom safeguards measures are to detect the diversion of nuclear material from its declared uses. The frequency of Euratom safeguards inspections at the Sellafield MOX Plant (SMP) has been a function of the type and form of nuclear material and the processing activities involved. Such inspections were performed at intervals ranging from two weeks to a month in the run-up to plutonium commissioning of SMP in 2002, with the frequency increasing thereafter&mdash;and currently running at an inspection every two weeks. Our information shows that the plant has been subject to approximately 240 safeguards inspections during the period in question.</p>
	<p pid=".227W.8/3">Materials accountancy and safeguards issues that arise in the course of particular safeguards inspections are addressed during the inspection and by means of follow-up correspondence from the European Commission. Such correspondence is classified by the Commission, and this classification must be respected by the UK Government. The Commission does however publish an annual report of its safeguards activities and their findings. Reports are available for the years 1999 to 2003 (references COM (2001) 436, COM (2002) 566, COM (2003) 764 and COM (2004) 861 respectively) and include information on Euratom safeguards activities at SMP.</p>

It appears from discussions with producers that individual producer responsibility is, in many instances, not yet practical, but it may become so in the future. The Government are concerned in UK implementation both to deliver the objectives of the WEEE Directive and to establish a workable UK system for separate collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE.</p>

	<p pid=".233W.6/10">1. The winter fuel payments leaflet is usually only displayed between October and March to coincide with the information campaign. 2. Bilingual or stand alone Welsh versions are available from post offices in Wales. 3. Until June 2004, the new deal for lone parents leaflet was also available from post offices. This information product is now targeted at a more local level, for example through the local office relationship with libraries etc.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.6/11">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-02">2 June 2004</phrase>, the Department had a contract in place with Post Office Ltd. for the display of key Departmental leaflets and posters in post office display panels. This was known as the POPOS (post office point of sale) display. Post Office Ltd. terminated this contract with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-02">2 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".233W.6/12">The last direct cost for displaying leaflets in post offices was &pound;332,000, which covered the final quarter of the POPOS contract (April 2004&ndash;June 2004).</p>
	<p pid=".233W.6/13">The leaflets currently available from post offices are issued as part of the wider Order Book Encashment Contract. It is not possible to separately identify the costs for this service from the fixed costs within the contract.</p>

	<p pid=".248W.2/1">The burns services at Mount Vernon are currently housed in temporary buildings erected in 1943 and it is felt by Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority (SHA) that they are not suitable for delivery of 21st century care. Therefore, it is proposed through their 'Investing in your health' programme that the burns and plastics unit be re-sited to Watford general hospital. There is a programme board considering the viability of this move, with representation from Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire SHA and the North West London SHA, Hillingdon primary care trust and the community voice (an umbrella action group of local organisations interested in the service). The outcome of the review will be subject to consultation.</p>

The reduction in bed numbers reflects a transfer of local cardiology services to local hospitals and a redistribution of clinical care into community settings, following a major review involving local primary care trusts.</p>
