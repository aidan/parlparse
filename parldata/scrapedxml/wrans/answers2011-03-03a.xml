Pilots and projects will then be subject to procurement competitions run by the relevant local authorities or devolved administration with BDUK support and advice.

	<p pid="a.516W.2/2">While it is generally accepted that the greatest threat to the survival of polar bears continues to be climate change, and the UK is playing its part in tackling that, other domestic threats such as those posed by oil development also exist. Addressing such national threats is the responsibility of the range states themselves. Where international trade in polar bears or their parts exists, however, the UK works through its membership of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to ensure that such trade is sustainable and does not further threaten the species' survival in the wild.</p>

	<p pid="a.517W.11/2">The UK has no plans to bring forward legislative proposals on shark fin products. We consider that the most effective means of protecting these species is through working at an EU and international level to better manage fisheries, while, where necessary, seeking to ban the international trade in shark products through the convention on international trade in endangered species (CITIES).</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.11/3">The UK has already taken the strong and proactive decision to ban UK vessels from removing fins from sharks at sea. All UK vessels now have to land sharks with fins naturally attached-a measure that will prevent shark finning. We want this to be the case for all vessels worldwide, and so are leading work on the review of the relevant EU legislation, and will continue to seek international agreement on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.517W.11/4">We are also leading the way on shark management in both in Europe, and international fisheries management bodies, by calling for appropriate limits to be set on the numbers of sharks that can be caught, and for total bans on catching endangered species.</p>

	<p pid="a.518W.5/1">In England, the approach to red squirrel conservation is to secure long-term habitat and conditions favouring the red squirrel in areas which grey squirrels have not yet reached in significant numbers and to limit grey squirrel expansion into these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.5/2">In the south-east, where there are secure populations on the Isle of Wight and Poole Harbour Islands there is an action plan in place to respond to the appearance of grey squirrels. In the north of England 17 reserves have been identified where long-term survival of the species is considered most likely. Targeted control of grey squirrels is carried out in the reserves and surrounding buffer zones. In addition, the reserves and surrounding areas are being managed in ways that favour red squirrels.</p>

	<p pid="a.519W.2/1">No estimate has been made of the impact of illegal shooting on UK wintering populations of whooper or Bewick's swan.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.2/2">The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust has a programme of marking of whooper and Bewick's swans, which includes monitoring the extent to which these species carry embedded shotgun pellets in their body tissue and this provides an indication of the extent to which birds are being illegally shot. While there is no evidence to suggest the level of illegal shooting in the UK has a significant impact on populations, it is recognised that such shooting across the full migration range of these species may be significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.2/3">The proportion of Bewick's swans carrying embedded shot has declined in recent decades from 38.8% In the 1980s to 22.7% in the 2000s. The proportion of whooper swans carrying embedded shot has not declined significantly over time, being 14.9% in the 1980s and 13.2% in the 2000s.</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.2/4">For species of high conservation status that are protected throughout their world ranges, this evidence of continued illegal hunting is a significant concern especially given the Bewick's swan population is declining globally and is now significantly below former levels of abundance. Accordingly, the UK is working with other Contracting Parties to the African-Eurasian Waterbirds Agreement (AEWA) as well as with other interested stakeholders, to raise the profile of the issue and work towards the elimination of this illegal activity. In particular, we are working towards the restoration of the Bewick's swan population to its former level through participation in the development of an AEWA action plan for the species.</p>

	<p pid="a.519W.5/1">The most recent available estimates for numbers of whooper swan <i> Cygnus cygnus</i> and Bewick's swan <i> Cygnus cygnus bewickii</i> in the UK are 15,047 and 7,005 individuals respectively, and derive from a co-ordinated international swan census undertaken in January 2005. In the UK the census was undertaken by the Goose and Swan Monitoring Programme (a partnership between the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee) and the Wetland Bird Survey (organised by the British Trust for Ornithology, RSPB and JNCC in association with WWT).</p>
	<p pid="a.519W.5/2">A further international census was undertaken in January 2010 but the results are not yet available. Monitoring of numbers at key sites through the annual Wetland Bird Survey shows that numbers of whooper swans (which largely migrate from Iceland) have increased since 2005, while numbers of Bewick's swans (which breed in arctic Russia) have continued to show a long-term decline. For these migratory species change in global population levels is an important context to the UK figures as the birds may change their wintering distribution within their wintering ranges. The most recently compiled international trends show that the Icelandic/UK whooper population is increasing, while the Bewick's swan is declining.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.5/5">We are introducing automatic enrolment into workplace pensions from 2012. This is a central element of our strategy to reinvigorate private pension savings and aims to harness inertia and bring about a change in people's behaviour in saving for retirement. We expect this to radically increase the number of people saving into a pension and to lead to between five million and eight million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/6">This is in addition to the measures we have already put in place, which include restoring the earnings link for the basic state pension and giving a &quot;triple guarantee&quot; that the basic state pension will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, price increases or 2.5%. It is estimated that the average person retiring on a full basic state pension in April 2011 will receive &#163;15,000 more in basic state pension over their retirement than they would have done under the old prices link.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/7">This Government are also protecting key benefits for pensioners. Free eye tests; free prescription charges; free bus passes; free television licences for the over 75s; and winter fuel payments will remain exactly as budgeted for by the previous Government-as we promised. We have also made the temporary increase in the cold weather payment to &#163;25 permanent.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/8">We want to ensure that older people receive the help that they are entitled to and we are conducting a research study into the feasibility of using existing data to help to improve the take-up of pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/9">The changes that we have put in place will provide a more generous state pension giving a solid financial foundation from the state which is essential as part of the pensions system and will help make it easier for people to save into a pension.</p>

	<p pid="a.526W.0/1">As the administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Ruth Owen:</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question, how many delays to benefit payments there were in (a) Gloucester (b) the South West and (c) England in each of the last five years; and if he will make a statement. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Darra Singh as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. As Darra Singh is currently on annual leave, I am replying in his absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus does not hold figures on delayed benefit payments; so we are unable to supply data for this. We do, however, have formally published targets for the average actual clearance time (AACT) taken to process benefit claims. This covers the main benefits of Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance/Incapacity Benefit. Incapacity Benefit was not included in the published AACT target from 2009/10, because it was replaced by the introduction of the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). ESA went live on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-28">28 October 2008</phrase> so AACT figures for this benefit are only available from October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/5" class="indent">The AACT target does not mean that all claims for that benefit are processed within that time as it is an average. We do expect some claims to take longer particularly if the customer's circumstances are complex or there is a delay in the customer returning information required to enable us to process their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.526W.0/6" class="indent">For each benefit the target for the AACT in days is in the table below:</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.5/1">The Government have no plans to direct Ofgem to commission a study. However, as part of its transmission price control (RIIO-T1) Ofgem is engaging with stakeholders across a range of matters. Following the publication of its December 2010 RIIO-T1 Initial Strategy Consultation document, Ofgem has been working with the Department and other stakeholders to consider how further guidance might be provided to help network companies and stakeholders consider the broader environmental costs and benefits of their potential investment decisions. The attitude of consumers to the costs through willingness to pay analysis is one tool that could play a role in this process. Ofgem will set out its views in this area in its end-March 2011 RIIO-T1 strategy document and would welcome further engagement on this issue both before publication and as the network companies develop their subsequent business plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.536W.2/1">In July the Department published the 2050 Pathways report, which as well as presenting the assumptions lying behind the 2050 Calculator, calculated high-level costs in the large scale power generation sector for six illustrative pathways. The analysis set out cost figures for the physical capital; fixed and variable operating costs; fuel; nuclear decommissioning and waste; and infrastructure (such as the electricity transmission and distribution network). It does not consider the cost of financing, carbon, electricity imports, research and development, behavioural change or wider macro-economic impacts. Each of these pathways showed a marked increase in electricity demand, up to a doubling in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/2">The six illustrative pathways that reached the 2050 target involve a shift from expenditure on fuel, such as fossil fuels, to upfront expenditure on capital, such as building low carbon power plants. Compared with a reference case where little action is taken to address climate change, average annual fuel costs are &#163;5-12 billion lower in six illustrative pathways over the period to 2050, while average annual capital costs for the same period are &#163;7-17 billion per year higher. The annual fuel costs are undiscounted, and the relative costs of the high and low carbon pathways are heavily dependent on the assumptions made about technology costs and fossil fuel prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/3">As promised in the July publication, the Department is continuing to explore this area in further detail, and will publish an updated version of the Calculator including costs data later this year. Respondents to our Call for Evidence in October indicated strong public support for this course of action.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.5/1">The prevalence of infective donors remains unknown. A study of stored tissue samples found abnormal prion protein in three appendices out of 12,674 samples. This suggests a prevalence of about one in 4,000, though with very wide confidence interval of between one in 1,400 and one in 20,000. On the expert advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, this single study is given considerable weight, though a larger subsequent study suggests a lower range of estimates. Not all of the individuals in the first study would be of an age eligible to donate blood, nor is it clear whether presence of abnormal prion protein in tissues such as the appendix or tonsils indicates that the blood of such a donor would transmit variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). All precautionary measures are assessed in the context of the fundamental uncertainties about prevalence.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;In relation to groups for whom the market does not provide affordable insurance or indemnity, the four health departments should consider whether it is necessary to enable the continued availability of the services provided by these groups; and, if so, the health departments should seek to facilitate a solution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.8/4">We agree with this recommendation and will take forward work on a case-by-case basis where this is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.2/1">Funding to support midwifery training is part of the Multi Professional Education and Training (MPET) budget allocated to strategic health authorities (SHAs) as part of the national health service central budget bundle. The MPET budget is not calculated on a profession specific basis and responsibility for how it is invested lies with SHAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.548W.2/2">SHAs, in conjunction with their associated deaneries, higher education institutions, primary care trusts and NHS trusts are responsible for commissioning the appropriate level of midwifery training posts to meet the needs of the local population. From 2011-12 the SHAs and associated national health service organisations will be expected to take account of the training recommendations produced by the Centre for Workforce Intelligence when planning and commissioning their trainee numbers.</p>

A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record.

Transfusions can also cause other unpredictable side effects, such as allergic reactions. Though fortunately any such events are rare, there is no intention to remove warnings from blood bags.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.0/2">Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is mentioned specifically on blood pack labels because it is a relatively new and rare infection. There have been three cases where blood has been the presumed route of vCJD transmission, all from donations in 1999 or before, from donations where the donor later went on to develop clinical vCJD to a recipient who themselves later went on to develop clinical vCJD.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.3/1">Guidance from the Department places responsibility on Hospital Transfusion Committees to ensure that patients who are likely to receive a blood transfusion are given timely information, informing them of the indication for transfusion, the risks and benefits of transfusion, and any available alternatives to transfusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.3/2">NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) provides a patient information leaflet for hospital staff to give to patients who may receive a transfusion. It indicates that patients should be told that transfusions should only be given if the benefits outweigh the risks, and they should be informed of alternatives to transfusion if these are appropriate and available. The infective risks of blood transfusion are clearly stated. The section on variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) specifically states:</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;Although the risk of getting variant CJD is probably low from a single transfusion, the risk of any infection will increase with additional blood transfusions. Each year approximately 2 million units of blood are transfused in England, and there have just been a handful of cases where patients are known to have become infected with vCJD from a blood transfusion.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.0/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/2" class="italic"> Libya</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/3">We have serious concerns regarding freedom of expression and freedom of the media in Libya which we continue to raise. The UK drove through a UN Security Council Resolution which demanded the lifting of restrictions on the internet and media and an end to the intimidation and detention of journalists. We are clear that the Libyan regime must heed the calls of the international community. We note that the Libyan Government has recently opened its borders to foreign journalists.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/4" class="italic"> Tunisia</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/5">During the Ben Ali regime media was heavily restricted and there were regular reports of journalists imprisoned for negative coverage of the Government. Since Ben Ali left Tunisia on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January 2011</phrase> the press have experienced unprecedented freedom. With the country undergoing significant reform we will be monitoring this situation closely over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/6" class="italic"> Yemen</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/7">While legislation exists in Yemen to protect media freedoms, in practice self-censorship is widespread as independent media, especially if allegedly linked to those opposed to the Government of Yemen, face sustained Government harassment.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/8">In September 2010, the EU issued a demarche criticising the treatment of journalists opposed to government policy. Recent reports from Yemen suggest increasing violence against journalists who are covering the internal protests. We have made clear to the Yemeni Government that this is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/9" class="italic"> Bahrain</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/10">The Bahraini constitution guarantees freedom of the press however there is an element of self-censorship in independent media and internet censorship does occur. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-14">14 February 2011</phrase> the Bahraini Government pledged to enter into discussions with media organisations to expand the media freedoms in Bahrain. We have seen no changes to freedom of the media in Bahrain during the course of the recent unrest during which Bahrain continued to host a wide range of international and local journalists.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/11" class="italic"> Morocco</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/12">We assess that it is safe for journalists to operate in Morocco.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/13">Morocco recently introduced a press code to professionalise the operations of the media. We are not aware of any incidences of violence against journalists working in Morocco but there are some clear red lines; criticism of the King, Islam and questioning the territorial integrity of Western Sahara is not permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/14" class="italic"> Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/15">In Iran, freedom of the media is tightly restricted by the Government and therefore the movements and activities of journalists are closely controlled and some foreign news agencies are denied entry into the country. The BBC is one such agency which has, together with other reputable international broadcasters, experienced a campaign of jamming by Iran of its Persian television service when seeking to broadcast news and current affairs programmes to the Iranian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/16">Foreign journalists seeking to cover events in Iran have been subject to arrest on serious criminal charges, including espionage.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/17" class="italic"> Algeria</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.0/18">We are not aware of any recent violence against journalists in Algeria. The print media enjoys relative freedom, with commentators and journalists able to openly criticise the Algerian Government including criticism of the President. The Algerian Government have recently committed to lift limitations on the broadcast media. While Algerian journalists are generally able to operate without undue restrictions, access to Algeria by foreign journalists is not straightforward.</p>

They have an important task in explaining to the public, the media, our own people and other audiences-at the local regional, national and international levels-the role of Defence, Defence activities, capabilities and operations. Main effort for Defence communicators at present is explaining our mission in Afghanistan. They comprise military and civilian personnel deployed to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Head Office. The majority are located in the service commands and units outside London including people working on service recruitment. The total cost of Defence communicators-covering all the various communications functions-identified during a cross Government Cabinet Office led exercise in financial year 2009-10 was &#163;32.5 million. Further reductions have been made during the last financial year and we expect to see further cost savings as part of the civilian reductions being made at the MOD.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.5/1">In order to deal with the deficit in the defence budget and contribute to wider deficit reduction, a decision was taken as part of the strategic defence and security review to withdraw from service the remaining four Type 22 Frigates, including HMS Cumberland. The savings arising from this decision will include overheads and other costs relating to the operation of a class of ship. Therefore, the precise savings arising from the withdrawal of an individual ship are not separately identifiable. The total savings from withdrawing all four ships are estimated at some &#163;240 million across the comprehensive spending review period.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.12/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase> I announced that we will be increasing awareness and understanding of family mediation through a new pre-application protocol for family mediation information and assessment meetings. This will harmonise the position between self-funding and publicly funded individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.12/3">In our recent legal aid consultation paper we proposed that most family private law proceedings-other than cases where domestic violence or forced marriage is involved and child abduction cases-be removed from the scope of legal aid. Crucially, however, as we believe that supporting families at their most difficult moments is vitally important, it is proposed that free mediation for the types of dispute that previously were in scope will continue to those who are eligible. This will mean that those vulnerable people who need support will be able to benefit from mediation.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.12/4">In 2009-10, we spent &#163;14.4 million on publicly funded family mediations. With the proposed legal aid reforms, it is anticipated that, subject to increased demand for publicly funded mediations, an additional &#163;5 million will be spent annually.</p>

My Department has worked with the LSC to enable improvements to be made to existing processes, particularly in terms of governance and financial management and control. A revised framework document has been published, detailing roles and responsibilities and relationships between the two bodies. The Magee report also presented options for further investigation, including the restructure of the LSC to an Executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. The Government have stated their intention to abolish the LSC as a non-departmental public body and replace it with an Executive agency of the MoJ.

	<p pid="a.581W.6/1">Decisions on the future size of the prison estate will be driven by prison population demand. Prisons will only close when capacity allows. We will ensure that there are enough places for those offenders sentenced to custody by the courts, including a margin to manage fluctuations in the prison population. Decisions to reduce or make changes to prison capacity will only be taken if they do not put this ability at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/2">The prison population is under review following the announcements made earlier in the year about Lancaster Castle, Ashwell and Morton Hall prisons. No decisions have been taken about the need for further reductions in capacity. However any proposals for future closures will be based on the following primary factors:</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/3" class="indent">an economic assessment which identifies prisons that are inefficient to operate or maintain; and</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/4" class="indent">an operational assessment to consider whether the closures of prisons can be managed while continuing to maintain the safe and decent operation of the prison estate and to meet the needs of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/5">The prison estate as a whole is kept under review and is subject to consideration through the assessment process described above.</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/6">Individual business cases were completed for each site which considered the cost of closure and the benefits that would be accrued.</p>
	<p pid="a.581W.6/7">Lancaster Castle will close as a prison by the end of March 2011. There is a three year notice period in the lease and the site will be returned to the Duchy of Lancaster in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.588W.5/1">At the G8 summit in L'Aquila, Italy in 2009 the international community pledged $20 billion dollars in support of food security and agriculture. The UK agreed to contribute &#163;1.1 (US$1.7) billion between 2009 and 2012. DFID has spent &#163;408 (US$612) million for the financial year 2009-10. &#163;98 million of this figure was spent on bilateral programmes In Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/2">Many of the beneficiaries of these programmes will be poor rural workers and smallholder farmers in Africa. For example, DFID is co-funding a programme on land tenure reform in Rwanda which will result in 8 million smallholder farmers receiving land titles, leading to increased sense of ownership and increased investment in productive capacity. It is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of specific impacts on smallholder farmers as a group.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) rarely provides direct funding support to microfinance organisations. Our work on microfinance is incorporated into broader financial sector development programmes, which have a range of interventions including policy and regulatory reform, capacity building, product innovation and research. Programmes are often implemented by intermediaries, such as non-governmental organisations, central banks, Government agencies or in partnership with other donors. It is not therefore possible to identify specific microfinance institutions which may have benefitted from DFID's financial sector development programmes without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.592W.5/2">However, improving the self-sufficiency of financial institutions is a key objective of financial sector development programmes. For example, DFID's Financial Inclusion Programme, implemented through the State Bank of Pakistan (SPB), aims to increase the sustainability of the financial sector through capacity building, product development and regulatory reform. FIP also supports the transformation of donor-dependent, unregulated microfinance institutions into regulated microfinance banks and provides guarantees to help them access commercial financing.</p>
