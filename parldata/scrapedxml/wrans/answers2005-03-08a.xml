	<p pid="a.1628W.5/2">The Highways Agency is taking over responsibility for certain aspects of incident management on motorways from the police over the next twelve months. As part of this process data relating to incidents will be systematically collected by the Highways Agency. No decision has yet been made about which aspects of that data would be routinely published.</p>

	<p pid="a.1631W.2/1">This information is not routinely available. Vehicles are registered to the name and address of the keeper, and each record can be accessed via the vehicle registration number only. Through special scans of the record it would be possible for DVLA to identify vehicles registered to specific streets and postcodes. However, these are only normally carried out to assist police inquiries. There is no link between vehicles and the polling district or ward in which the address is situated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1638W.7/4" class="indent">The latest year for which figures are available is 2003. The attached table shows the numbers of deaths among residents of local authorities in the former metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear where the underlying cause of death indicated a condition directly related to alcohol use in the years 2000 to 2003. During this four year period, six of these deaths in the former metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear were of people aged under 30.</p>
	<p pid="a.1638W.7/5" class="indent">The ONS definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

The data refers to the year in which (column B) applications were received; (column C) applications were presented to council and (column D) the year that the final approval decision was taken by the planning service. It cannot be assumed that the number of applications overturned in one year is directly related to the number of applications presented to council with a recommendation to refuse.

	<p pid="a.1659W.11/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary Question asking how many accidents on Ballyquin Road, Limavady, County Londonderry, have been reported to DRD Roads Service within the past 10 years (220441). I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls with my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659W.11/4" class="indent">With regard to accident statistics I should explain that the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) gathers road traffic injury collision information. Roads Service has access to this information for its own investigation purposes. We currently hold PSNI records for the B68 Ballyquin Road for the period January 1996 to February 2005. During that period there were 50 such injury collisions, including the recent double fatality at a bend on the road near Dungiven.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659W.11/5" class="indent">Like the vast majority of the rural road network, Ballyquin Road was not designed to modern standards, though a number of improvement schemes have been carried out on the road over recent years, including the erection or bend warning signs at the double fatality accident location. However, the collision history along this road remains a cause for concern. We have, therefore, been analysing the nature and type of collisions along the road, with a view to delivering a package of measures designed specifically to reduce the number of collisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659W.11/6" class="indent">As a result of this work, a route action Collision Remedial Scheme (signs, white lines etc.) for the Ballyquin Road has been included in our programme of works for the next financial year. Detailed analysis of the route is underway and we are intending to complete the necessary design work for this scheme within the next few months. The bend referred to above will be given priority within the scheme, so that any suitable measures can be implemented at this location, as soon as possible. Any more major improvement proposals along the road (realigning of bends, improving sight distances, road widening etc.) would, of course, have to compete for funding with other worthwhile schemes within our Northern Division area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659W.11/7" class="indent">You may also be interested to learn that we also intend to carry out some resurfacing work on the Ballyquin Road during the incoming financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659W.11/8" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

Sheep and pigs can be traded freely, subject to European Union rules, which are actively enforced by the relevant authorities in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The export of cattle from Northern Ireland is prohibited under European Union rules though incentives to smuggle do exist. To prevent such smuggling there is close liaison between the enforcement authorities who share information and target action where necessary. Such action includes joint operations and following one such operation last year several prosecutions are pending. Other action taken includes the establishment of a central enforcement team within the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development's Veterinary Service, the targeting of cattle identification inspections and tightening the rules on movement of animals to ensure that the system of traceability is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.1663W.9/2">After careful consideration and close consultation with the relevant enforcement bodies and stakeholders, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, has charged the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) with overall responsibility to ensure cross compliance enforcement meets the Commission's minimum requirements in 2005, provides appropriate coordination of inspections and acts a single point of contact for all cross-compliance related farmer inquiries. The RPA will discharge this responsibility working in partnership with the various specialist enforcement bodies, such as the Environment Agency, who will be formally delegated to carry out inspections within their respective areas as required.</p>

	<p pid="a.1668W.12/1">There is no established regulation on the provision of 'block leave' prior to deployment on an operational tour. Many units do work a 'block leave' system in which the unit will stand-down as a whole. These periods may take place at the discretion of the commanding officer before an operational tour, providing they do not conflict with the interests of the service and that there is sufficient time prior to deployment for leave to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1668W.12/2">Post operational tour leave and post operational detachment leave were introduced in recognition of the stresses and strains that operational deployments bring to both an individual and their family and friends. The general entitlement for all personnel returning from a tour in Iraq of six months is a minimum of 20 working days leave. However, the breakdown of this entitlement between additional post-operational leave and an individual's annual leave entitlement differs between the three services.</p>

This approach is in line with normal practice and consistent with Treasury guidance on interdepartmental services. The MOD's activity&mdash;the full costs of which are estimated to be some &pound;14 million&mdash;was central to the delivery of relief and it is realistic to see its additional costs as within the scope of the relief effort.

	<p pid="a.1672W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence's extra costs reported to the end of January 2005 in relation to the relief effort following the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami amount to &pound;1.7 million. All of this is related to costs for which MOD is not funded and which we would not otherwise have incurred. It is, therefore, recoverable from DfID as agreed at the outset and consistent with Treasury guidance on interdepartmental services. The full cost of MOD's activity in relation to this relief effort are estimated to be some &pound;14 million.</p>

All directions were granted under regulation 7 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations 1992, except for the direction for Leeds city council. We are currently considering the council's latest application. The directions that have been granted were to protect the visual amenity of residential areas of special quality from persistently high numbers of estate agents' boards and because there was no other way to effectively control the display of estate agents' boards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1681W.3/1">Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs) were first pioneered by the London borough of Islington with the Metropolitan police. Their successful model has been promoted by the Home Office and adopted across the rest of the country. They are voluntary agreements between a person who has been involved in antisocial behaviour and one or more local agencies. They are not statutory orders and we currently have no plans to place ABCs on a statutory basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681W.3/2">The use of ABCs and other early interventions are crucial as they show communities, and potential perpetrators of antisocial behaviour, that action will be taken against those who behave in an antisocial manner.</p>

Orders often contain prohibitions that prohibit a person from carrying out certain acts and excluding them from certain places.</p>
	<p pid="a.1682W.2/2">The most common behaviour tackled by ASBOs is general loutish and unruly conduct such as verbal abuse, harassment, assault, graffiti and excessive noise. The wide range of antisocial behaviour that a can be tackled by ASBOs and the ability to tailor the terms of the order to each specific case illustrates their flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1682W.2/3">It is for the courts to decide what prohibitions go into an order. Prohibitions should aim to cover the range of antisocial behaviour acts committed by the defendant and be specific to the behaviour.</p>

Clause 41 of the Bill allows for exemptions and exceptions to be made in any order requiring compulsory registration. No decisions have yet been taken on what exemptions and exceptions may apply. Prior to any order requiring compulsory registration, people will register with the scheme when applying for documents such as passports which will be designated under powers contained within the Identity Cards Bill. Members of the royal family other than Her Majesty the Queen hold passports and would therefore join the scheme in the same way as members of the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.1700W.8/1">With the exception of the powers in Part 4 of the Anti- Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which are immigration powers applicable to foreign nationals, counter terrorism measures are aimed at terrorists, whatever their background, section of society or nationality they may come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.8/2">The Home Office provides the law-enforcement and security agencies with the powers and funding they need to do their job. There are two main pieces of legislation which they use to fight terrorism: the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 These Acts deliver UK-wide legislation that is effective in countering the threat we face from terrorism.The legislation includes measures to outlaw membership, support and fundraising for terrorist groups, seizure of terrorist cash and property, the creation of offences specific to terrorism at home and abroad, and special powers for terrorist investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.8/3">The Home Secretary introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> a Bill&mdash;The Prevention of Terrorism Bill which contains new proposals for preventative control orders which are intended to disrupt and restrict individual's involvement in terrorist related activities. We are also looking at the scope for new terrorist related offences and other measures to bring suspected terrorists to justice. My hope is that we will be able to bring further legislative proposals on this as soon as time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.8/4">The Government have provided resources to finance a 50 per cent. increase in the size of the Security Service over the next three years. The bulk of these extra resources will go into counter- terrorism work. In 2005&ndash;06 dedicated ring fenced counter terrorism funding for the police service in England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police service, will amount to &pound;96 million revenue and &pound;8 million capital. This is very nearly double the amount of the first dedicated counter-terrorism grants in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.8/5">Combating the threat posed by terrorism does of course go beyond funding and legislation and it is important that we continue to build and develop partnerships at every level in accordance with our overall strategy&mdash;to prevent terrorism, to pursue terrorist networks, to protect the UK, its citizens and its critical infrastructure, and to plan for attacks in order to minimise their consequences. Our objective remains to reduce the threat from terrorism so that our people may continue to go about their business freely and with confidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1706W.8/1">I regularly receive representations about unfair trading practices which the Department discusses with enforcers and regulators as appropriate. I am therefore aware of the problems caused by bogus sweepstakes and prize draws which give the false impression that all recipients have won a substantial prize. These scams, which are estimated to cost UK consumers around &pound;150 million of detriment a year, are a matter of concern. The Government therefore welcomes the decision taken by the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-24">24 February</phrase> to outlaw such scams as part of wider EU rules on unfair commercial practices to be adopted later this year. Prohibiting these practices in all 25 member states will ensure that more effective action can be taken against those scammers who locate themselves outside the UK in the hope of avoiding enforcement action being taken against them, including that available under Advertising Standards Authority's code of practice of advertising, sales promotion and direct marketing.</p>

In addition to their activities being subject to general requirements of the law, the Act places some specific restrictions on the use of such powers. RDAs may only give financial assistance to achieve their aims if the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry consents. Restrictions also apply to the disposal of land in certain circumstances and to the acquisition and use of housing by RDAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1715W.11/1">This legislation was introduced in December 2000 to enable couples to share the value of their pensions on divorce. It allows a former spouse to acquire a pension in her, or his, own right, providing security of income in retirement and a clean break settlement. Section 101C of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 in particular specifies that pension credit benefit paid under a pension sharing order in an occupational pension scheme must be paid from age 60 to 65. Each scheme sets its own normal benefit age within this range. We do not plan to change this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1719W.3/1">The policy on charging for residential care is the responsibility of health departments. The current financial assessment for residential care takes account of an individual's income, including benefit income, leaving each resident with a personal expense allowance. Pension credit, which may include an amount of savings credit, is taken into account in the council's financial assessment. For those individuals in receipt of the savings credit, they are left with the amount for personal expenses and in addition receive a savings credit disregard. For individuals living in their own homes and being financially assessed for home care and their non-residential care services, the savings credit is fully disregarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719W.3/2">Payment of attendance allowance (AA) and disability living allowance (DLA) stops after four weeks residence in a care home, except where a resident can meet the full cost without help from a local authority or other source of public funding (other than payments for free nursing care), as this does not affect payability of AA/DLA for self funders. The mobility component of DLA can continue in payment because care home costs do not cover mobility needs. Pension credit recipients who have been in a care home for 13 weeks or more at the end of the specified qualifying week are not eligible for a winter fuel payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1722W.7/1">Highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza type A viruses are of most concern as these are known to have caused infections in people. Of these, A/H5N1, A/H7N7 and A/H9N2 have caused outbreaks of infection in the past five years. Because of their potential to adapt to become more transmissable to humans, or to exchange genes with a human influenza virus to produce a completely novel virus capable of pandemic spread, all pose a threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722W.7/2">There is as yet no vaccine available for the prevention of the disease. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control has secured an isolate of the current avian influenza virus strain and has produced a candidate vaccine virus using reverse genetics&quot; technology for use should this be required. We are working closely with other countries, the World Health Organisation, the European Commission and manufacturers to ensure that a vaccine can be developed as quickly as possible once a pandemic flu strain emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.1729W.2/1">The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has carried out ultra violet (UV) measurements of solar UV in the United Kingdom and these have shown a small upward trend. However, the data are still being analysed and may be within experimental uncertainties. The incidence of skin cancer, due to UV exposure is rising in most middle latitude countries. This is attributed to behavioural factors (sunbathing, holidays in the sun etc.) and not changes in the intensity of incident ultra violet radiation or other meteorological factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1729W.2/2">The SunSmart&quot; campaign is funded by the Department and run by Cancer Research UK and seeks to educate people about the dangers of excessive exposure to UV and gives simple steps to avoid the harm. The messages would be equally valid and useful and possibly even more necessary, should UV levels in the UK rise because of meteorological changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1730W.6/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has received representations from ASH and other health groups raising concerns that the availability of cheap illegal tobacco is undermining the Government's tobacco control strategy, particularly the use of high duty rates to discourage people from smoking. Smuggled tobacco has meant a continuing supply of cheap tobacco, often targeted on areas of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730W.6/2">This is why the Government, in Tackling Tobacco Smuggling,&quot; published in March 2000, has set challenging targets for Her Majesty's Customs and Excise to reverse the growth in tobacco smuggling. As a result, in the first four years of the strategy, the total number of cigarettes smuggled into the United Kingdom each year has been reduced by over five billion, a reduction of over a third.</p>

These facilities include those required to enable MHS staff to wash, shower and ensure their personal hygiene and cleanliness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732W.2/2">In ensuring that adequate facilities are provided, the MHS also has an obligation to ensure that premises, including plants in which its inspection staff work, comply with the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (as amended). Regulations 22 and 25 place a responsibility on all plant operators to provide facilities for rest and eating meals in the premises they control or own.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732W.2/3">The plant operator is the primary duty holder under the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations. Some plant operators provide canteen facilities which are available to be shared by MHS inspection staff. Where shared eating facilities are not available, the MHS has provided refrigerators in some plants exclusively for the storage of food by inspection staff, and has also provided items such as microwave cookers and electric kettles for their usage.</p>

In accordance with this policy, any individual who considers their health is at risk from ergonomic factors would be referred to BMI Services Ltd. for an assessment. In the light of their report, adjustments to the working conditions would be made where these were considered reasonable as required by statute. Where ergonomic factors in a licensed meat plant are of general concern, a report from BMI Services Ltd. may be commissioned. This would be referred to the MHS regional office for consideration with the plant operator before being reviewed by the joint MHS/UNISON health and safety committee for any recommendations they wish to make. The MHS has also provided ergonomic/manual handling training at both instructor and risk assessor level to 20 employees who will be deployed to review potential risks in licensed premises as appropriate.</p>

Although Sudan 1 could contribute to an increased risk of cancer in humans, at the levels present in food that risk is likely to be very small. It is not possible to further quantify the risk, but experts advise that exposure should be kept as low as possible.

	<p pid="a.1739W.5/1">Following advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the Department commissioned two research programmes in 1999 to study the therapeutic benefit of pentosan polysulphate (PPS). The first study, lead by Dr. Christine Farquhar of the Institute for Animal Health's Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh, showed that PPS was effective in preventing the development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in mice, but only if given at the time of infection or shortly after. It was not effective if given after clinical disease had developed. The second study, lead by Dr. Harbans Sharma from Manchester University, studied the pharmacokinetics (uptake) of PPS in mice and in human volunteers. These studies showed that PPS was very poorly absorbed by the body when taken orally and did not enter the brain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1741W.5/4">The amendment will allow local authorities to set fees, which, taking one year with another, will enable them to recover an amount up to, but not in excess of, the costs they incur in providing local land charge services. In setting fees, local authorities will have to have regard to guidance issued by the Lord Chancellor. An illustrative version of the type of guidance the Lord Chancellor may issue has been placed in the House Library. Further consultation will be undertaken before any guidance is issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.5/5">The amendment does not change the position in Wales, where the National Assembly for Wales has, since <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>, had responsibility for setting local land charge fees. Nor does it change the position in relation to fees for personal searches of the local land charges register, where a review is to be undertaken before any decision on changing the arrangements for setting these fees is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.5/6">It is expected that the study into the market for property search information being conducted by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will include consideration of the issues relating to personal searches. The OFT aim to complete the study this summer. I will consider in the light of the OFT report whether any further work is necessary to complete the review before making any decisions on the way forward.</p>

The LSC does not hold data on how much Legal Help is awarded to Gypsies and Travellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742W.3/14">Legal Representation at planning applications and appeals is generally outside the scope of legal aid. However, since April 2000, funding can be made available in exceptional cases under section 6(8)<i>(b)</i> of the Access to Justice Act 1999, when the relevant criteria are satisfied, for example, where the case concerns the applicant's home. This protects the applicant's fundamental rights and ensures a fair hearing. It is not possible to give a precise figure for total costs but, since April 2000, a maximum of &pound;45,000 plus VAT (excluding Legal Help costs) has been spent on planning applications in relation to Traveller encampments.

	<p pid="a.1745W.4/1">Since the publication of the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) in July 2001, the Department has undertaken a very extensive programme of consultations with interested bodies about options and proposals for changes to gambling law in Great Britain. There have been two formal public consultations, the first on the Review Body's report and the second on the draft clauses published for pre-legislative scrutiny in November 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1745W.4/2">In addition to these consultations the relevant Government Departments have corresponded with and met individual companies (including those who have expressed an interest in trading in Great Britain as well as those already doing so), trade associations, charities and other bodies concerned with problem gambling or who benefit from lotteries, local authorities, trade unions, law enforcement agencies, academics and many other bodies and individuals, including members of the public, with an interest. These contacts, designed to ensure that the Government's policy proposals are sound and take full account of all relevant benefits, costs and risks, have involved both Ministers and officials. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code and the Civil Service Code.</p>

	<p pid="a.1746W.2/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Croydon, Central since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. Two school sport partnerships involving eight School Sport Co-ordinators and 36 Primary Link teachers is based in Croydon, Central. They have received two Sport England grants totalling &pound;678,454. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Croydon, Central have benefited from three Sport England Lottery grants totalling &pound;3,018,850.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, London grants increased from &pound;13.6 million to &pound;133.8 million, including from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> funding to major national arts organisations in London. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in London will be &pound;151.6 million. Croydon, Central has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including the Croydon Clocktower.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/4">Young people in Croydon, Central benefit from the London Youth Music Action Zone, known as Sound Connections. Since 2000, the Action Zone has been awarded three grants totalling &pound;1,245,000, and so far it has successfully engaged over 2,000 young people in music-making opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/5">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Croydon, Central will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/6">Croydon, Central also benefits from the Renaissance in the regions museums initiative. The London Museums Hub in partnership with several museums, including Croydon Museum, is working with local refugee groups on an exhibition to be displayed in the museum or a local community centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/7">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/8">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Croydon area. FilmLondon have funded a number of film related activities in the Croydon, Central constituency including &pound;1,000 towards the Croydon Film Festival in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;7,000 to the Croydon Film Fund between 2001&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/9">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Croydon, Central with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,715.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/10">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year's Eve to 11 am on New Year's Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/11">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Croydon, Central, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/12">Tourism in Croydon, Central has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the London Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Croydon, Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/13">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;217,367 to Croydon, Central since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including &pound;100,637 to the Church of St John the Baptist from 2002 to 2004 and &pound;81,000 to St Peter's Church from 2003 to 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/14">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Croydon, Central constituency are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million Lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/15">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Croydon Council has recognised this value and took part in an initiative called the Croydon Online Community Network. This enabled some libraries&mdash;two of them in Croydon, Central&mdash;to be connected to the Croydon Online Network and the creation of a Croydon Job Mart website and a Croydon Health Information Network. Housebound users were also enabled to connect to the internet. The project received a total award of &pound;128,000 from the DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 1998&ndash;99. A proportion of this was of benefit to libraries in the Croydon, Central constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/16">In 2003 the London Borough of Croydon were successful at stage one of the application process for PFI credits, and were allocated &pound;4.6 million on a provisional basis for the Ashburton Learning Village project, which incorporated a new branch library, support for an improved household library service, and music service. This will be of direct benefit to residents within the Croydon, Central Constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746W.2/17">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Croydon, Central has benefited from 221 awards totalling just under &pound;13 million. Of these, 47 awards worth over &pound;5.6 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.1749W.0/1">Viewers in Solihull will be receiving their conventional television signals from the main Sutton Coldfield transmitter. Sutton Coldfield does broadcast the full range of digital services, but congestion of the spectrum means that their coverage currently has to be limited to avoid causing interference to viewers of analogue television services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.0/2">Although many viewers in the West Midlands are able to receive digital services from Sutton Coldfield, the coverage restrictions result in patchy digital coverage in and around Solihull.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.0/3">At switchover, these restrictions will be removed and enable the coverage of the digital services to be increased to ensure that everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form (BBC 1 and 2, ITV, Channel 4/S4C and Channel 5) can receive them on digital systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.1750W.3/1">There have been two recent public consultations on <i>(a)</i> draft Regulations and an Order under the Licensing Act 2003 which took place between <phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-10">10 November 2004</phrase>, and <i>(b)</i> draft fee regulations under the 2003 Act which took place between <phrase class="date" code="">4 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-23">23 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750W.3/2">In respect of <i>(a)</i> we received 269 responses from 230 public bodies, organisations and individuals, some of which responded more than once. These included two from amateur sports clubs; 10 from police forces including one from their representative body (the Association of Chief Police Officers); 0 from alcohol abuse charities; and 0 from religious groups. We also received a response from a Member of Parliament on behalf of The National United Temperance Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750W.3/3">In respect of <i>(b)</i> we received 427 responses, including 97 from amateur sports clubs and their representative bodies; one from a police force and one from ACPO; 0 from alcohol abuse charities; and 0 from religious groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750W.3/4">Since these consultations ended we have received correspondence from a wide range of groups and individuals including from sports clubs and their representative bodies, individual police officers, individuals from the field of alcohol abuse charities, and from those representing religious groups. This correspondence has primarily concerned the level at which fees have been set and the potential impact of 24 hour opening.</p>

	<p pid="a.1759W.0/1">There is no legal definition of nightclub&quot;. The procedures for the licensing of all premises selling alcohol or providing regulated entertainment or late night refreshment were reviewed during the White Paper consultation on licensing and the subject of detailed scrutiny during the Licensing Bill's passage through Parliament. The Licensing Act 2003 and Guidance to Licensing Authorities explain the new procedures and can be read on the Department's website (<a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a> ). The requirements for advertising applications for the grant or variation or review of premises licences are contained in regulations that are also available on our website. These include the need to display for 28 consecutive days, a legible notice prominently at or on the premises to which the application relates where it can be conveniently read from the exterior of the premises and, in the case of a premises covering an area of more than 50 sq m, a further notice in the same form and subject to the same requirements every 50 m along the external perimeter of the premises abutting any highway; and also to publish a notice in a local newspaper or, if there is none, a local newsletter or similar document at least once during the 10 working days after the application is given to the licensing authority. We do not think that there is a case for further extending the publicising of applications for licences for nightclubs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1765W.2/1">Since April 2001, all new building work at schools has been subject to the Building Regulations. With regard to fire safety, the design of new school buildings must comply with Part B of the Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1765W.2/2">The Building Regulations do not require the installation of sprinkler systems in schools, but this does not prohibit local education authorities from specifying their use. Currently the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is carrying out a review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations and its accompanying guidance Approved Document B. The review will include schools and it should be completed early in 2006. The decision on whether or not to install sprinklers in new schools needs to be taken locally. For example, in the Department's Managing School Facilities Guide 6, Fire Safety&quot;, we give the example of a school in an area of high arson risk as being a suitable candidate for their installation see <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire">www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire</a>. However, we are mindful of the need to provide more detailed advice than before and have produced new draft guidance&mdash;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. This stresses the value of using risk assessments to determine what sort of fire detection and alarm systems should be used in a new school, and whether or not sprinklers should be installed. This advice will be subject to public consultation, which will commence shortly, and we expect to publish it in the early autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1767W.0/1">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 amended both the Education Act 1996 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. To help schools, local education authorities and others meet their amended special educational needs (SEN) duties under the Education Act 1996 the Department published the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001). To help schools meet their duties under part 4 of the amended Disability Discrimination Act, the Disability Rights Commission produced a Code of Practice in 2002. The Code of Practice explains, and provides guidance on, the duties schools have not to discriminate, without justification, against children for a reason related to their disabilities and to make reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination. In June 2002 the Department for Education and Skills issued separate guidance to schools on carrying out their duty to draw up and publish plans for improving access to disabled pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1767W.0/2">The Department for Education and Skills has made widely available a guide for parents and carers on the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. The Disability Rights Commission provides advice to parents and schools on disability discrimination and runs a dedicated telephone help line. Parents have the right to appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal and admissions appeal panels if they think their children have suffered discrimination or if they disagree with the decisions of their local education authority about their child's special educational needs. The Tribunal has made available to parents publications explaining their rights of appeal, how they can make an appeal, and what this entails.</p>
	<p pid="a.1767W.0/3">The Office for Standards in Education (OfSTED) consider how well schools are meeting the needs of children with special educational needs as part of their inspections; they consider how schools are complying with their duty to produce accessibility plans and the quality of those plans. OfSTED's recent survey reviewing the implementation of the revised inclusion framework introduced as a result of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, Special Educational Needs and Disability&mdash;towards inclusive schools,&quot; found that schools had a growing awareness of the benefits of inclusion and that there had been some improvements in practice. It also identified the need for further progress, for example, of the schools surveyed around 50 per cent. had produced a disability access plan. OfSTED recognised that the broad and sustained programme of action under the SEN strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; (February 2004) is designed to bring about improvements to the provision for children with learning difficulties and disabilities. The programme includes the development of practical resources for schools that should help them to comply fully with their duties under part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.1768W.11/2">The programme delivers a wide range of services to support local families including: occupational therapy, counselling services, health and social services, respite care for parents, individual support for children identified as needing developmental help and training in both parenting skills and basic education.</p>

	<p pid="a.1769W.2/1">There is one Sure Start Local Programme (SSLP), one Neighbourhood Nursery (NN) and one children's centre (CC) in it's planning stages in Wellingborough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/2">The Wellingborough Sure Start local programme was approved in 2003 and supports around 730 young local children and their families living in the catchment area. It has an indicative allocation of &pound;1,075,000 capital grant, all of which has been approved and has received revenue of &pound;700,000 in 2004/05, and will receive &pound;768,752 in 2005/06 and &pound;768,752 in 2006/07. The catchment area comprises three separate estates which each form part of three wards&mdash;Queensway, Croyland (Kingsway) and Hemmingwell. The programme delivers a wide range of services to support local families including:</p>

	<p pid="a.1769W.2/11">Since opening, Sure Start Wellingborough has helped improve the quality of life for local families. Local health visitors report back to the local programme on all women identified with post natal depression&mdash;including specific referral to the Sure Start programme to provide support. The programme funds a HomeStart worker to train and support an increased number of volunteers. There are four support groups currently running weekly where there are quality play activities and support for parents. A new group is starting in 2004/05 specifically for teenage parents. Groups which will run for specific periods of time are: Speakeasy (helping parents to talk about sex appropriately with their children), Parentzone (parenting course), EarlyStart (adult literacy and numeracy with activities with their children).</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/12">Health visitors aim to visit all children within two months of birth and give parents information about Sure Start services. Visit or contact is offered to all parents/carers not seen in the preceding three months. Roadshows&quot; taken round to all three estates on a rolling programme provide information on aspects of parenting and respond to requests from parents for information. This five week programme deals with a theme each week which corresponds to one of the Sure Start objectives . The SSLP health visitor and midwife also provide outreach services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/13">As a recently approved round 5 Sure Start Programme, Wellingborough have only recently been required to submit reach data, however recent Sure Start Unit monitoring reports show that the programme is seeing 122 of their 729 children (17 per cent.) each month, and saw 11 per cent. new children in September 2004 as well as visiting 89 per cent. of new babies in the catchment area within the first two months of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/14">The programme has recognised the need to broaden parental consultation to all .families. They have employed community development workers to work with parents in setting up the forum and continuing consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/15">The Croyland Neighbourhood Nursery is the only one in the constituency and opened as a 42 place nursery in March 2004. The nursery was awarded &pound;202,851 revenue funding up until 2007, and also received a one off capital grant of &pound;175,000 from the Big Lottery Fund. It is part of the planned children's centre and based on a school site.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769W.2/16">The children's centre will bring together the SSLP and the NN and also includes a maintained nursery school and a pre school. The centre has an indicative allocation of &pound;80,000 revenue from 2004&ndash;06 with a total indicative capital allocation of &pound;350,000. The Croyland Centre will be situated in Croyland Ward and will work closely with the SSLP to provide integrated daycare and education. Centre managers are currently negotiating provision at both sites with the Primary Care Trust and Lifelong Learning. The Sure Start midwife is already working with a community midwife to provide ante-natal care on all three Sure Start estates. Family support will also be available on both sites, with the exact nature of this dependent on the expressed needs of the families. A pre-school in the town will be extended to provide a further 24 daycare places.</p>

	<p pid="a.1771W.5/1">Like many other areas of the country, young children and their families in Morecambe and Lunesdale have benefited from significant Sure Start funding since 2001. There is one Sure Start local programme in Morecambe and Lunesdale (Sure Start North Lancaster). This programme received a revenue grant of &pound;794,303 in 2004&ndash;05. It has an indicative revenue allocation of &pound;814,161 for 2005&ndash;06 and for 2006&ndash;07. The programme has had &pound;960,000 of its &pound;1,000,000 capital allocation approved for specific projects in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771W.5/2">Evidence from local evaluation shows that a six-week breastfeeding peer supporters training programme was put in place for women living in the Sure Start area. five of eight women initially participating completed the course and were presented with a certificate of achievement. A second training programme held in October 2003, with women from a wider geographical area, resulted in 10 women successfully completing the course. The Baby Club started in March 2002 as a means to identifying clients with, or at risk o developing post natal illness. Between <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-01">1 August 2004</phrase>, over 3,000 visits to the Baby Club were made by parents and 3,200 by babies. In 2004 weekly attendance averaged at 18 parents and their babies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771W.5/3">The programme has also put together a comprehensive volunteer policy and developed an induction and training programme to help volunteers develop their skills and build awareness of community issues such as cultural diversity and child protection. Once basic training is completed (and CRB clearance has been gained) volunteers can move into work experience placements within any area of Sure Start's work. Volunteers have work shadowed midwifery, health and childcare colleagues and others have completed individual community based projects. 13 volunteers have completed the in-house programme, as well as parents on the management and partnership boards. Many have moved on to FE such as Pre-School Diploma and Access to Higher Education, while others have pursued training in job search techniques or employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771W.5/4">Lancashire county council has a planned children's centre reach of 16,629 children under the age of five by March 2006. It is developing two children's centres in the Morecambe and Lunesdale area, creating 82 new integrated early education and care places. Sure Start North Lancaster is one of the two children's centres and has been allocated indicative revenue funding of &pound;175,496 for 2005&ndash;06. It will deliver 71 integrated early education and care places by March 2006; 41 of which will be new children's centre funded places. The centre will reach children and families in the wards of Skerton East, Skerton Central, Skerton West and part of Bulk. An indicative children's centre capital allocation of &pound;400,000 has been made available to the Ridge Primary School which will link to the North Lancaster children's centre and deliver further outreach services and integrated early education and care as part of the core offer. The centre is expected to be designated by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771W.5/5">The other children's centre is being developed in the Poulton ward based on a former Social Services Family Centre site. Lancashire county council have allocated indicative children's centre revenue of &pound;317,134 and indicative children's centre capital of &pound;1,000,000 to this centre which is expected to be designated by March 2006. This centre will create 41 new integrated early education and care children's centre funded places.</p>
	<p pid="a.1771W.5/6">Lancashire county council has also developed two neighbourhood nursery projects in the Morecambe and Lunesdale area delivering a total of 57 new early education and childcare places. Sure Start has made available revenue funding of &pound;284,215 and &pound;23,505 capital grant in total to Lancashire County Council for these two projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.1776W.2/17">Sure Start 4 Wards&quot;, the Sure Start local programme which supports families and young children across Kettering, was approved in September 2002. The programme works closely with a number of providers to improve support for young children and their families, delivering a variety of services including: reading groups; parent support; fathers' group; parenting skills; baby massage; breastfeeding support; and outreach services through Citizen's Advice Bureau.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.2/18">The Sure Start programme undertook a local evaluation of their services in 2003/04 and as part of this they recruited and trained eight parents to take a questionnaire out to a range of local toddler groups. The survey also included the opportunity for parents to feedback their suggestions for improvements. 75 per cent. of respondents said the quality of the Sure Start services they received was very good&quot; and that their child had done new things as a result of involvement with the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.2/19">The programme has invested &pound;938,000 of their capital grant in a new building which will provide a family centre, 26 full day care places and accommodation for up to 20 multi-disciplinary workers under one roof.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.2/20">The Grange Neighbourhood Nursery opened in January 2004 and provides 62 full daycare places, 54 of which are funded through Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative. This nursery is based on a school site which also incorporates a Healthy Living Centre and a community sports and arts facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.2/21">A children's centre is planned for the Grange school which is approximately half a mile from the Sure Start local programme building. Both sites will provide integrated full daycare places and early learning in due course and an additional 24 places will be created by extending another setting. The children's centre will build on the existing provision already available in Kettering.</p>

	<p pid="a.1776W.5/1">Sure Start Inner Burton was established in 2001. 687 families with a total of 717 children are currently registered with the programme. It has received a capital allocation of &pound;1 million and a revenue allocation of &pound;746,000 in 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;764,650 in 2004&ndash;05. We have just written to the programme announcing its future revenue allocations of &pound;783,766 in 2005&ndash;06 and the same amount in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.5/2">The programme has achieved a number of successes, including raising the proportion of mothers with children breastfeeding from 40 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 50 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04. In 2002&ndash;03 the programme made 21,000 face to face contacts with children and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.5/3">East Staffordshire children's centre is located in the north of the programme's area and provides integrated education and day care on a full day, part day, or casual cr&egrave;che basis, combined with health, family support and a range of services including JobCentre Plus drop-in sessions and Children's Information Service signposting. Other services and facilities planned or provided include a toy library, training room and access to computer facilities for parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.5/4">Families in the programme's area will also have access to outreach services provided at Queen Street Community Centre, to be opened in March 2005, which will consist of a child minder support group, volunteer training, speech and language therapy sessions, ante-natal activities, English as a second language classes, a Saturday group and evening dads' group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1777W.2/1">There are three Sure Start local programmes in Hartlepool, which are all at different stages of development. Sure Start South is a round two programme and began to develop its services from 2000. It has received &pound;2,972,982 revenue and &pound;1 million capital grant to date. Sure Start North is round three and services began to be delivered in 2000. It has received &pound;2,349,675 revenue and &pound;1 million capital grant to date. Sure Start Central began to deliver services in 2003. It has received &pound;1,425,000 revenue and &pound;l million capital grant to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/2">The three programmes have provided services to approximately 2,673 families since they began to deliver services. This is broken down as follows: Sure Start South 533; Sure Start North 1,014; and Sure Start Central 1,136.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/3">There are seven neighbourhood nurseries in Hartlepool providing a total of 291 places. Two of these are linked to the local programmes (Sure Start Central and Sure Start South). The total funding for these nurseries is &pound;1,143,201 capital and &pound;938,063 revenue. There were a total of 1,050 three-year-olds in free nursery education places across Hartlepool in 2004. The figure for four-year-olds was 1,100.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/4">Each of the local programmes has implemented a number of initiatives within their respective catchment areas to help improve children's ability to learn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/5">Such initiatives include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/6" class="indent">Bookstart Plus project has been developed in conjunction with Hartlepool libraries. The initiative provides a free book for all children living in the Sure Start area when they are 12-months-old and library membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/7" class="indent">Chattersacks scheme in local primary schools nurseries aimed to encourage families to be involved in children's learning, language development and early reading skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/8" class="indent">Delivery of full day care and regular playgroup sessions using Birth to Three Matters and the Foundation Stage framework, to ensure that all children are offered a well structured routine that will enhance their all round development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/9" class="indent">Various play sessions/groups to promote speech and language development, in particular all children in the Sure Start area are involved in the speech and language measure and implemented as part of the Sure Start Pathway of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/10">The impact of these services are demonstrated by the following.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/11" class="indent">Library membership of children aged 0&ndash;3 in Sure Start South catchment area has increased from a baseline 5 per cent. in 2000/01 to 12.7 per cent. in 2003/04.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/12" class="indent">Language development&mdash;the Sure Start South programme also reports that there has been a small increase in local word count scores (56 to 59) which are higher than national figures from Sure Start Unit (46 to 47). The proportion of children with higher word count scores has also increased slightly and there are no parental concerns about language.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/13" class="indent">Sure Start Central has linked closely with all schools in the programme's catchment area and operates a joint health, social and education methodology. Each school has a COOL project offering sporting and educational opportunities for the 5&ndash;11 age range and they see 80+ children per session in the areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/14">Sure Start will be expanded in Hartlepool through the roll out of children's centres. There is already one designated children's centre based on the site of Rossmere primary school, St. Teresa's RC primary school and Sure Start Hartlepool South. Four more children's centres will be designated by March 2006. Both the central and north programmes will be included in this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1777W.2/15">Hartlepool local authority is planning to open a further five children's centres by March 2008 with a town wide approach to create a children's centre in every community by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.1778W.2/1">The Sure Start Fleetwood local programme was approved in 2001 and supports around 667 children and their families living in the Pharos and Mount wards, part of Bailey ward and Park ward. The programme has been allocated a total of &pound;2,721,463 revenue funding and &pound;1,000,000 capital funding from its inception up to the end of 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/2">The programme delivers a wide range of child, family health and parental support services to local families. As Fleetwood has one of the highest incidences of teenage pregnancy in England, the programme offers a well attended weekly Young Parents group to support and advise teenage mothers and fathers. The programme has also been successful at encouraging mothers to breast feed their babies. Six out of eight mothers attending the Baby Group now breast feed compared with two out of eight last year. Five mothers are also undertaking a twelve week accredited training course run by the Breast Feeding Network, which will be followed by a breast feeding home visiting support service to help mothers continue breast feeding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/3">The Start Now! Project run by programme brings together a number of organisations (Jobcentre Plus, Wyre Primary Care Trust, Connexions, Blackpool and the Fyde College, NHS recruitment, Wyre borough council) who offer co-ordinated advice and support for parents wishing to move into employment and training. These agencies have found that this group has enabled then to reach parents who would otherwise not use their main service. This one stop shop approach allows parents with complex needs to receive a joined up collaborative service and has been very successful in encouraging parents into training and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/4">The local new deal for lone parent advisors are working full time from the Sure Start main centre which has to be proved mutually beneficial with the NDLP advisors reporting an improved uptake of their services. In the last three months, six parents have moved into training and 24 parents have moved off income support into employment. This is a significant increase compared to the previous five month period where only ten parents had been placed into employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/5">The Sure Start Fleetwood local programme has a high level of parental involvement and participation. Parents are taking an active role within the programme with 11 of the 18 volunteers being local parents who initially used Sure Start services. The Partnership Board also includes seven parent representatives, one of which is the Vice Chair of the Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/6">Fleetwood has one neighbourhood nursery called Y tots which is attached to the Sure Start Fleetwood local programme. The nursery has received a total of &pound;302,400 in revenue funding and provides 56 full day care places. Both the Sure Start local programme and the neighbourhood nursery are located within one building and form Fleetwood children's centre. All the core services will be delivered from the centre and to a further three wards on an outreach basis in community buildings and a primary school. The implementation plan for the centre received approval to proceed from the Unit in July 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778W.2/7">In addition, there were 800 free nursery education places taken up by 3-year-olds in maintained schools and other maintained private, voluntary and independent providers within the Blackpool, North and Fleetwood parliamentary constituency area in 2004. The equivalent figure for 4-year-olds was 860.</p>

	<p pid="a.1779W.5/1">The Birmingham, South West Sure Start local programme was approved in February 2003 and supports 867 children under four and their families living in the Bartley Green Ward and Welsh House Farm Housing Estate in Birmingham. To date the programme has had access to &pound;1,402,122 in revenue funding and &pound;960,000 in capital funding. A further &pound;1,112,400 in revenue funding over the next two years (2005/06&mdash;2006/07) has been allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1779W.5/2">The programme has helped improve the quality of life for local families through the delivery of a wide range of services including: the development of a Teenage Pregnancy/Parent Group to support pregnant teenagers and young mums under 21; the provision of a Child Psychologist and Speech and Language Therapist; the availability of nutrition and dietetics services; access to the Relate Counselling Service and Money Advice Service for families; working with the charity KIDS in the West Midlands to provide support to children with additional needs/disabilities; working in partnership with Barnardos' Community Plus Project&quot; to provide family support and advice; outreach workers who provide flexible one to one support and advice for parents; group sessions for parents on parenting; provision of safety equipment for families and advice on home safety formulated with the West Midlands Fire Service; and links with Fircroft College enabling parents to access training courses. Several parents are undertaking South Birmingham PCT's short course Introduction to Community Family Work' which leads on to the OCN Certificate in Family Work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1779W.5/3">The development of a children's centre on the programme's Doddington Grove site will extend Sure Start services to children under five and their families.

	<p pid="a.1780W.2/1">The target for 50 per cent. of children to reach a good level of development was set in July 2004. It is based on the 2003 foundation stage profile (FSP) results and data from Sure Start local programmes. It is provisional as the 2003 FSP data were published as 'experimental statistics'. FSP data for 2004 will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-17">17 March</phrase>, and for 2005 later this year. At this point we will be able to confirm the target and establish the baseline against which progress towards the target can be assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.5/1">We set this target to be challenging, but achievable. The Social Exclusion Unit's 1999 Bridging the Gap&quot; report identified three important elements in reducing the number of young people not in education, employment or training: an improved curriculum offer, appropriate financial support and high quality advice guidance and support focused on the needs of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.5/2">The strategies set out in the recent 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills White Paper, alongside the earlier Supporting Young People to Achieve&quot; and Every Child Matters&quot; publications, build on the good practice and progress that has been made since Bridging the Gap. This includes the success that Connexions has had in achieving its own target to reduce the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training between 2002 and 2004. They will make sure we give the right tools and support to the statutory and voluntary services that work to prevent young people becoming disengaged and reengage them if necessary, giving a sound basis for meeting the target.</p>

	<p pid="a.1781W.8/1">Since 1998&mdash;the baseline year for the strategy&mdash;the England under-18 conception rate has fallen by 9.8 per cent. The 2010 PSA target is very challenging and achieving it will require sustained and strengthened implementation of the strategy at national and local level, involving a wide range of services, professionals, parents and young people. That is why we have written to local authority chief executives, asking them to strengthen delivery of local strategies in high rate neighbourhoods and on teenagers most at risk&mdash;50 per cent. of conceptions occur in the 20 per cent. of wards with the highest rates. Local areas have been given new data and analysis to help them to effectively target local strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1783W.2/2">Government officials have informed representatives of the UK aerospace and defence industry of the EU's review of its arms embargo on China and of US attitudes towards this review. Officials informed industry of the resolution of the House of Representatives of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase> on this arms embargo, and discussed with them the possible meaning of references to limitations and constraints&quot; to transatlantic defence co-operation as mentioned in that resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783W.2/3">The US has a legitimate and understandable interest both in the effectiveness of the EU's system of arms control and in the stability of the East Asian region. We have to do our very best to address US concerns and reassure them on the effectiveness of the EU Code of Conduct. The latter, and not the embargo, is the key to controlling EU arms exports to China.</p>

	<p pid="a.1786W.2/1">Her Majesty's Government is deeply concerned by the announcement that North Korea has suspended its participation in 6 Party Talks (6PT). The world is looking for early progress in the discussions. We deplore North Korea's refusal to negotiate on the issue, the resolution of which would bring so much benefit to the people of that country. We call on the government of North Korea to review its decision, to reconfirm its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and to re-engage in discussions with the other participants of the 6PT process to achieve their objective peacefully through negotiation. We also continue to be gravely concerned about the human rights situation in North Korea and raise this regularly with the North Korean authorities at Ministerial and official level.</p>

The requirements for entry are therefore the same, irrespective of where the application is made. Local conditions, including the prevalence of forged documentation, mean that different procedures may apply in respect of the application process. However, differences in local processes serve only to facilitate the consideration of the application in accordance with the immigration rules.</p>

Among the common reasons for the refusal of an application is the failure of the applicant to show an intention or an ability to undertake a proposed course of study. In addition, students who fall for refusal will often have failed to show that they can meet the cost of the proposed course or that they can be adequately maintained and accommodated in the UK without recourse to public funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1792W.8/1">We will make a full assessment of the conduct of the election once they have taken place taking into account our own observations as well as those of the various election observer missions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1792W.8/2">However, we are not convinced that Zimbabwe has taken the steps required to ensure a free and fair election. As I said in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase>, we are concerned about reports of serious irregularities in the electoral roll. We continue to urge the Government of Zimbabwe to honour in full its commitment to the South African Development Community (SADC) electoral principles. We also urge the SADC to ensure that its guidelines are adhered to. The elections in Zimbabwe will be a test of the credibility of the SADC as well as of the Zimbabwean Government.</p>
