In those cases the CAA will need to investigate the proposed modification as part of the approval process. The applicant will be charged for modification investigation in accordance with the CAA's published Airworthiness Scheme of Charges. The CAA charging schemes are reviewed annually in consultation with the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

	<p pid="e.1208W.6/2">Foreign-registered vehicles represent around 3.5 per cent. of all heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic on Britain's roads. In 2008-09, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) checked 61,000 foreign-registered HGVs and found roadworthiness related concerns with 40 per cent. of them. This compares with 64,800 spot checks on UK registered HGVs where 32.6 per cent. were found to have roadworthiness related concerns.</p>
	<p pid="e.1208W.6/3">The Government have introduced a number of measures to tackle non-compliance with the regulations. We have made an additional &#163;24 million available to VOSA over a three-year period from 2008 to enable them to carry out more enforcement checks on HGVs on international journeys.</p>
	<p pid="e.1208W.6/4">We have also introduced a new scheme to allow the police and VOSA to take on the spot financial deposits from offending drivers with no satisfactory address in the United Kingdom. In the first three months of operation, almost &#163;700,000 has been collected from such drivers.</p>
	<p pid="e.1208W.6/5">In addition, VOSA routinely informs the authorities of other EU member states about offences involving their commercial vehicle drivers.</p>

	<p pid="e.1209W.2/1">A summary of the responses to the consultation will be published at the same time as the statutory instrument amending the lighting regulations so as to provide (among other things) for the new retro-reflective marking requirements. This is expected to be before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1209W.2/2">The methodology used to estimate the cost of mandatory conspicuity markings is contained in the impact assessment that accompanied the consultation. This is available at:</p>

	<p pid="e.1209W.2/4">The cost to fit tape to a new vehicle was estimated at between &#163;186 and &#163;388 per vehicle depending on whether simple line marking or full contour marking is used. A seven year life span was assumed, after which the markings would need to be replaced. The total number of new vehicles to be fitted with markings was estimated at 35,821 per year. Using these figures the average cost to fit markings on new vehicles was estimated at approximately &#163;8.8 million per year. Taking into account the additional replacement costs after seven years the estimated annual cost over twelve years was between &#163;16 and &#163;17 million per year depending on the implementation strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1209W.2/5">Both the Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association (FTA) responded to the original consultation. There has also been regular contact between Department for Transport officials and the FTA to discuss how the regulations would be implemented and to answer technical queries.</p>
	<p pid="e.1209W.2/6">No detailed analysis of the effect on tape manufacturers and fitters of postponing conspicuity marking tape requirements has been carried out. They will, as now, be free to market their products in the period leading up to the mandatory requirement for marking tape in 2011.</p>

Figures for lost and stolen devices reported between 2005-06 and 2007-08 represent core-DEFRA, Animal Health, Natural England and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. From 2008-09 onwards the figure above represents core-DEFRA only.<br/> 5. Computers/laptops are paid for via a managed service which is charged for on a usage basis. DEFRA monitors the total volume of kit on the estate (which consists of a user base made up of the core-Department and several agencies/NDPBs) on a monthly basis to calculate charges, rather than how many devices are issued or replaced over time.<br/> 6. DEFRA has invested in encryption technology in the laptop and BlackBerry services for all new issues. Over 95 per cent. of the current devices are encrypted.<br/> 7. The total PC/laptop kit has reduced overall within DEFRA. The increase in laptop volumes above is due to 'single device' policy that has removed a significant number of desktop PCs in exchange for one corporate laptop per user in order to drive up environmental and mobile working benefits.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.1214W.0/1">There are no plans to change the responsibilities regarding conservation issues in the UK's Overseas Territories.</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/2">The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) was commissioned by the Interdepartmental Ministerial Group on biodiversity (IDMGb) to draft a Government Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in the UK Overseas Territories. This was done with the express intention of improving the effectiveness of co-ordination of the UK Government's support for biodiversity in the Overseas Territories. The strategy was announced at a reception on Collaboration on Environmental and Biodiversity Issues in the Overseas Territories, hosted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) at the end of June.</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/3">The strategy, which is shortly to be published, establishes, inter alia, a partnership of the three participating Government Departments, with JNCC providing the secretariat. The Strategy also establishes that my Department will co-ordinate the work of the partnership with the FCO and the Department for International Development (DFID).</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/4">In addition, an Interdepartmental Group on Biodiversity in the Overseas Territories has been established following agreement of the strategy. This group, comprising the same member Departments as the IDMGb, met for the first time on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-29">29 September</phrase> and established its key principles and terms of reference, one of which will be to co-ordinate to best effect UK Government support for biodiversity in the Overseas Territories.</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/5">Turning to the Darwin Initiative's new Overseas Territories Challenge Fund, I announced the establishment of this fund in June. It is intended to pay for up to 10 projects relating to biodiversity in the Overseas Territories, each costing up to &#163;25,000. These will be comparable to existing Darwin scoping projects, aiming towards main-round projects, but for longer periods and involving some initial implementation work. The cost of Challenge Fund payments will come from a sum of up to &#163;1.5 million, which I announced at the same event will be earmarked within the Darwin Initiative this year for Overseas Territories projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/6">In terms of specific figures provided under the Darwin Initiative for projects in the Caribbean and South Atlantic Overseas Territories, these are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.1214W.0/7">For the Caribbean Overseas Territories, since 2005, the figures are:</p>

I have provided one authorisation within my area of responsibility in the last 12 months involving co-operation and training to Libya. This related to an approval under Section 8 for a serving member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to provide training to the Libyan Police. This approval followed a request from the National Police Improvement Agency for the assistance of the PSNI, and in response to the Northern Ireland Policing Board who supported this request. The assistance involved the delivery of three weeks tactical command training in January 2009 as part of a Foreign and Commonwealth Office sponsored programme of work designed to help Libya meet their human rights obligations by fostering policing techniques that meet international standards.</p>

	<p pid="e.1220W.3/1">The Defence Medical Services manage a widespread armed forces rehabilitation network that has some 180 Primary Care Rehabilitation Facilities and 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs) as well as the flagship Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court in Surrey. Patients from all the armed services requiring rehabilitation are treated at the facility and location that is most appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="e.1220W.3/2">The annual running costs of Headley Court are approximately &#163;13.5 million. Responsibility for the individual management of the primary care and RRU facilities is shared between the single service commands, with oversight from the Joint Medical Command. However, each service funds its respective RRUs differently. Owing to the number of different internal budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed analysis of local rehabilitation expenditure would therefore incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1220W.3/3">Where an individual requires specialist rehabilitation services or equipment that can best be provided by a non-MOD organisation (such as some aspects of neurological rehabilitation and specialised prosthetics) this will be arranged at additional cost. In the financial year 2008-09, about &#163;1.6 million was spent on such services by the Joint Medical Command.</p>

	<p pid="e.1224W.3/1">The information requested for 2006-07 and 2007-08 is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. With the introduction of the Defence Travel (DT) in 2008, however, visibility of rail bookings can now be captured. Rail booking is processed through an online booking tool or offline through a Travel Management Company, Hogg Robinson Group (HRG). The spend for FY 2008-09 on 1st class travel through DT was &#163;6.497 million. This figure does not include rail warrants (which were not withdrawn until <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April 2009</phrase>) or short notice travellers paying at ticket offices and reclaiming the cost.</p>
	<p pid="e.1224W.3/2">The entitlement to first class travel is laid down in Joint Service Publication 800, Defence Movements and Transportation Regulations. The class of rail travel in UK Mainland is based on rank or, for civil servants, grade. Officers and civil servants who are Lt Cdr, Major, Sqn Ldr, pay band C2 and above are entitled to first class travel at public expense. This includes acting rank. Standard class passengers travelling with entitled officers for essential duty reasons may also travel first class.</p>

On the expiry of that contract in March 2009, a new contractor was employed following an open competition. Lancaster university did not bid for that contract. Following a subsequent review of the group's membership, it was assessed by the MOD that the two individuals' skills were duplicated elsewhere within the group. It was therefore decided that their continued membership was not necessary and, as members' attendance is funded by the MOD, did not represent good value for taxpayers' money.</p>

	<p pid="e.1229W.0/1">Infantry manning deficits have been reduced markedly and the situation continues to improve fast due to a number of factors including the introduction of exceptional action measures, financial incentives, improved marketing and the current economic situation.

It will also include augmentees who are temporarily assigned if needed to support the role of the battalion, for operational military tasks and events that cannot be achieved within required strengths. Similarly, the figures exclude those assigned out of the battalion to augment other units.</p>
	<p pid="e.1229W.0/4">&quot;Fit for duty&quot; has been interpreted as fit for primary role, including personnel listed as having limited deploy ability, plus personnel who are unfit for deployment but who can perform a role in an alternative capacity.

	<p pid="e.1231W.6/1">The Government support the International Convention and believe that it will have an important role in preventing enforced disappearance and secret detention in the future. The UK played an active part in the negotiations prior to the drafting of the convention and supported its adoption in 2008 at the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="e.1231W.6/2">The UK is prepared to give its signature to treaties only when it has a clear intention to ratify within a reasonable timescale. The Government are conscious of the potentially significant impact of the convention in the domestic context, and we are therefore continuing our detailed assessment of the provisions of the convention and their effect across all areas of UK law and policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1231W.6/3">In particular, we are analysing the extent to which common law provisions may need to be replicated in statute law; whether any new criminal offences would need to be introduced; and whether the UK would enter any reservations or declarations on ratification.</p>
	<p pid="e.1231W.6/4">Ratification will require primary legislation to facilitate changes to domestic law and the introduction of such primary legislation will depend on securing parliamentary time. The complexity of the issues still under consideration means that we are not setting a deadline for completion of our analysis, but work is being progressed as rapidly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="e.1232W.2/16">The costs associated with these dismissals and contract terminations are not recorded centrally. In the last five years, there have been no compulsory redundancies.

A manual check of each individual file would need to be undertaken to establish these figures, and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice made a written ministerial statement to the House announcing the launch of 20 consultation exercises for magistrates courts closures. These courts are underutilised and in many cases their facilities for court users, including victims and witnesses, are inadequate. The Lord Chancellor will make a decision whether to close a court after considering the responses to consultations.</p>
	<p pid="e.1235W.5/2">HMCS regularly reviews the use and condition of its estate. Where there is an underutilised court and alternative facilities within a reasonable travelling distance we will consider holding consultations to seek views; on whether to close a court.</p>
	<p pid="e.1235W.5/3">HMCS must keep the level of magistrates courts sitting commensurate to the amount of work-local management decisions, involving local judiciary, including magistrates, and staff will be taken regularly to ensure that that is the case.</p>

	<p pid="e.1239W.5/1">The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) undertakes a very wide variety of scientific projects in Antarctica, South Georgia and the Arctic. These projects are managed through the strategic science framework of the BAS called Polar Science for Planet Earth (PSPE). PSPE concentrates on key scientific questions of global or fundamental importance that can be best answered by research requiring access to the polar regions. It consists of six major programmes each consisting of several projects. The PSPE Programmes are: Climate, Chemistry and Past Climate, Ecosystems, Environmental Change and Evolution, Ice Sheets and Polar Oceans. Further details of PSPE, and the component research programmes and projects, can be found on the BAS website:</p>

	<p pid="e.1239W.5/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office Polar Regions Unit also support a range of projects each year to underpin delivery of the strategic objectives of the British Antarctic Territory; these include projects which contribute to the environmental protection, education and outreach, heritage and governance of the Territory, and many of these are undertaken in partnership with BAS. The unit is also working with BAS and the Royal Geographical Society to develop a new educational website on the Arctic:</p>

This was a three-year community policing project being run in Russia between 2006 and 2009 (at a cost of approximately &#163;300,000) by the Global Opportunities Fund for Human Rights. The aim of the project was to train police officers on prevention of community and domestic violence, working with Justices of the Peace, Non-Governmental Organisations and relevant municipal organisations, to reduce domestic violence.</p>

Al-Qaeda and those groups and individuals affiliated to and influenced by them undoubtedly represent the greatest current terrorist threat to the UK. Al-Qaeda regards the UK as a key target, and as a potential source of recruits. As a result of international military action in Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda has largely been forced out of its 'safe havens' and is now mainly based on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.</p>

	<p pid="e.1254W.5/16">This table covers all individuals in these cohorts who save in any defined contribution pension with an employer contribution at any point after 2012. It is consistent with the payback figures presented in the report, &quot;Saving for retirement: Implications of pensions reforms on financial incentives to save for retirement&quot;, published in February this year. Overall, less than 5 per cent. are modelled as expecting a payback of less than 1.</p>
	<p pid="e.1254W.5/17">This table covers all cohorts who are expected to live out their lives before 2100, including many who will not enter the workforce and/or start saving until many years after 2012, and others who are already saving. As such, the figures should not be compared directly with new savers or those eligible for automatic enrolment in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="e.1254W.5/18">Those with payback of less than 0.5 have not been shown separately due to the small sample size of this group in the model; they make up approximately a quarter of the group with payback of less than 1.</p>
	<p pid="e.1254W.5/19">Please note that opt-out rates in the model are assigned randomly to employees, and do not take account of characteristics of individuals or how they might behave. The numbers in the lower payback groups may be over-estimated if those who go on to see high levels of benefit interactions are more likely to opt out. The figures are based on reasonable assumptions about the future as set out in &quot;Saving for retirement: Implications of pensions reforms on financial incentives to save&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="e.1255W.3/1">Heritage provides a vital contribution to the national economy and contributes to the success of a range of industries including tourism, retail, entertainment and construction. Although no aggregate figure is available, several studies of which English Heritage is aware have sought to identify the contribution within a particular context. In the north-west alone it is estimated that Heritage and its ancillaries contribute &#163;1.6 billion in gross value added (GVA) to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1255W.3/2">A Heritage Lottery Fund study of major projects they completed in 2007 estimates them to have created &#163;33 million in local GVA and to support the equivalent of 1,277 full-time equivalent jobs. Tourism, one of the largest industries in the UK, was estimated to be worth approximately &#163;86 billion in 2007. Evidence from VisitBritain shows England's historic buildings are key motivators for those considering a visit to the country and they also top the table of activities undertaken by those who actually do visit.</p>
	<p pid="e.1255W.3/3">Privately owned historic houses generate an economic contribution of over &#163;1.6 billion; while England's cathedrals generate around &#163;150 million per annum of benefits for the local and national economies.</p>

	<p pid="e.1255W.6/1">We believe that up to 1 million households could have been affected by the loss of ITV3 and ITV4 after the digital television retune. In some cases the services will be restored at digital switchover.</p>
	<p pid="e.1255W.6/2">There is a licence requirement that the three Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) digital multiplexes, which carry the public service broadcasting channels, should reach 98.5 per cent. of UK households after Digital Switchover. Since the national re-tune, ITV3 and ITV4, which are not PSB channels, have been carried on commercial multiplexes where the licence post-Switchover requirement is that 90 per cent. of household coverage is achieved. Any decision to build out beyond 90 per cent. coverage would be a commercial decision for the multiplex operators.</p>

(&#163;2.0 billion), putting in place the extra services and staff needed to transform mental health services.

This will not be pure growth in the number of trained doctors in the national health service since many will be recruited to replace retirements etc. of existing work force.<br/> 2. These are expected CCT dates and are subject to variation due to failure for doctors to progress through training as expected which can be for many reasons for example maternity leave, educational issues, illness, undertaking research.<br/> 3. Also to clarify these will be graduates of higher specialty post graduate training and not medical school graduates.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.1262W.5/1">The Department has not commissioned any specific research in this area but is aware, through stakeholder engagement, of issues relating to postgraduate medical training. Evidence of the impact on training of using out of hours lists and independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) is anecdotal and variable.</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.5/2">However, wherever training takes place, trainee doctors cannot progress through training unless they have demonstrated they are competent and have met the standards set by the competent authority, which in this case is the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board.</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.5/3">In 2006, the Department published its policy on training in independent sector treatment centres. This stated that any training that takes place in ISTCs will be required to meet the same standards as training in other organisations. The Department will also publish shortly the Staff Passport. This will clarify how training standards will continue to be met given the plurality of providers.</p>

The consensus statement issued subsequently by the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain is likely to be of wide interest to the health service. The statement aims to heighten awareness of healthcare associated infections amongst national health service clinicians and managers. It also highlights the benefits of evidence based approaches, such as the care bundles used in our programme to reduce infections.

	<p pid="e.1265W.3/1">In 2008-09, national health service organisations were asked to assess themselves against a core standard that incorporates compliance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) technology appraisals. These self-assessments were independently validated by the Care Quality Commission and showed that 95.2 per cent, of NHS organisations could provide evidence of compliance with this standard.</p>
	<p pid="e.1265W.3/2">Clinical guidelines relate to a whole pathway of care and can make a large number of recommendations spanning all stages of care from diagnosis to treatment of a condition. In view of their complexity and because of the different states of readiness for implementation in the NHS, clinical guidelines are not subject to the same performance management assessment as NICE's technology appraisals. Compliance with NICE's clinical guidelines is a developmental standard for NHS organisations and the Government expect NHS organisations to implement them over time using available resources.</p>
	<p pid="e.1265W.3/3">Use of NICE technology appraisals and clinical guidelines to prioritise investment and promote quality improvement is one of the ways in which primary care trusts can demonstrate progress towards becoming world class commissioners under the world class commissioning assurance framework.</p>

	<p pid="e.1269W.2/1">Arrangements for the vaccination of housebound patients against swine influenza will be the same as for seasonal influenza. As with seasonal influenza we are not being prescriptive about who should vaccinate housebound patients. It will be for primary care trusts to decide which health care professionals are best placed to vaccinate this group of patients but we would normally expect this to be undertaken by community nursing staff who are in regular contact with these patients anyway.</p>

	<p pid="e.1269W.8/1">The consultation on the review of &quot;No secrets&quot; was comprehensive and wide-ranging.</p>
	<p pid="e.1269W.8/2">We were pleased that such a large number of people contributed to the review. A wide range of professionals, totalling approximately 9,000 and including social workers, health staff, police officers, probation staff, lawyers and many others, participated. We were particularly pleased that some 3,000 members of the public took part, including those with learning difficulties, older people, those with mental health problems and people from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds, who came to the consultation events and debated and discussed the many issues with us.</p>
	<p pid="e.1269W.8/3">The summary of the responses was published in July this year, together with all the responses from organisations. The analysis and consideration of such a large volume of responses takes time; these are complex matters, which cut across health, social care and the criminal justice system. The Government response is being prepared by four Departments; the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney-General's Office and the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="e.1269W.8/4">We are examining all the issues raised and plan to make an announcement later this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.1280W.9/1">We have no current plans to change the criteria for EMA eligibility. For most young people, eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA) is subject to an assessment of their household income based on the financial year prior to the academic year in which they start their course. A successful assessment provides a young person with a guaranteed entitlement of up to three years of EMA on the same rate regardless of whether their income increases. If there is a drop in income from one year to the next then a young person may apply to be reassessed for the subsequent academic year. They could be assessed as eligible for EMA where they were not previously, or an increased rate of it. They would receive the EMA guarantee based on the rate awarded following the most recent assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/2">There are a limited number of exceptional circumstances in which a young person may apply to be reassessed for EMA during the academic year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/3">Those circumstances are:</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/4" class="indent">(i) someone whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility has died;</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/5" class="indent">(ii) a person whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility has experienced a reduction in income due to their own disability, or the disability of any other person for whom he or she has responsibility as primary carer (disability means as defined in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995);</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/6" class="indent">(iii) Since the assessment of income was made, the young person has become estranged from their parents, guardians or someone else whose income was taken into account in determining financial eligibility;</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/7" class="indent">(iv) The young person has become a parent with responsibility for their own child.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/8">The financial needs of young people can be affected by a range of circumstances, including reductions in household income due to redundancy, or reduced working hours. Other mechanisms exist to help with the costs of supporting young people aged 16 to 19 in learning. Child benefit provides support for parents regardless of income, and tax credits are designed to tailor support to current circumstances and to be responsive to changing needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/9">In addition to the support provided to families, discretionary learner support funds are made available via the Learning and Skills Council to colleges and local authorities. This funding is provided to enable schools and colleges, using their discretion, to help individual learners who may otherwise experience financial hardship or barriers to continuing in learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/10">This year we have strengthened the guidance to providers to emphasise that these funds must be targeted to young people who have most need of them, including those who may face financial hardship following in year changes to their household income.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.9/11">We will continue to look at additional help via discretionary learner support funds and provide rapid and appropriate responses to changes in employment.</p>

	<p pid="e.1281W.2/1">EMA was introduced as an incentive to encourage more young people from lower income households to stay on in post compulsory learning, and to address the issue that the UK had one of the lowest post-16 participation rates in OECD countries. The scheme was piloted from 1999 and rolled out nationally, to consecutive cohorts of learners in full-time education, from September 2004. It was extended to trainees in unwaged training provision in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.1281W.2/2">We have previously estimated that, to have made the lowest level of EMA (the &#163;10 per week payment) available to all learners not already receiving it would have increased expenditure by around &#163;300 million in the 2007/08 academic year. We have not estimated the cost for 2009/10 and do not plan to do so. We believe that, to be effective, state support needs to be targeted where there is most need.</p>

	<p pid="e.1283W.2/1">The Department does not collect information on how many outreach workers have been, or are expected to be, employed by 2011 in Sure Start children's centres. Staffing levels in children's centres are a matter for local management by local authorities and their partner agencies. The Government's &quot;Sure Start Children's Centres: Phase 3 Planning and Delivery&quot; document suggests that in the most disadvantaged areas there should be at least three outreach workers per children's centre. In less disadvantaged areas, local authorities will decide on the best approach based on their assessment of local needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1283W.2/2">The additional funding which the Government have made available each year since 2008 means that local authorities can increase the number of outreach workers in centres serving the most disadvantaged communities by two, in addition to the funding for one outreach worker per children's centre that had already been included in local authorities' Sure Start early years and child care grant. Funding for outreach is not a separate sum of money allocated to local authorities-they decide how to allocate funding to individual children's centres in their area to meet the needs in each community.</p>
	<p pid="e.1283W.2/3">The qualifications required for practitioners engaged in outreach in Sure Start children's centres will depend on the different job roles and purposes developed in each centre, which will be in response to local need. Relevant qualifications include those from child care, family support, social care, counselling, teaching and community work. The Sure Start children's centres practice guidance makes clear the expectation that children's centres should be working towards all staff being trained to at least NVQ level 2.</p>

The 2009 Budget announced further measures to tackle avoidance including disclosure regime enhancement, swift action to close down aggressive tax avoidance schemes, publicity for avoidance schemes which are considered ineffective, and new principle-based approaches to avoidance legislation. In June HM Revenue and Customs published a consultation document on a voluntary code of practice on taxation for the banking sector. The code seeks to ensure that banks comply with not just the letter, but also the spirit of the law.</p>

	<p pid="e.1290W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated October 2009:</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Questions that ask for a list of declarations of political activities made (292597) and the total annual monetary remuneration of each Board member including expenses and any monies paid to compensate for tax liability (292598).</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/4" class="indent">Appointments to the Commission's non-executive Board (as 'Members of the Commission') only came under the formal regulation of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) in February this year, so a declaration of political activity has not yet been required from the majority of our Board members. The Chair, however, was re-appointed in July under OCPA's formal regulation, so a declaration of political activity was made then. That declaration was that the Chair is inactive politically. The senior Executive team - me and the four Executive Directors, are all Senior Civil Servants and thus abide by the Civil Service Management Code and contractual commitments to impartiality; all of us are politically inactive.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/5" class="indent">We have a comprehensive biographical section and Register of Interests available publicly on our website, respectively at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/commissioners.asp">http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/commissioners.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/decint.asp">http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/decint.asp</a>. These provide further details of the Commission's Board members' and senior executives' backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/6" class="indent">Details of the remuneration of Members of the Commission are shown in our 2008/09 Resource Accounts, available in the House Library and on our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Library/spr/pdfs/resac0809.pdf">http://www.charity commission.gov.uk/Library/spr/pdfs/resac0809.pdf</a>. For ease, I attach at Annex A the relevant table (extended slightly to reflect the compensation for tax liability and the context of this letter) from these accounts. Members of the Commission are remunerated at a rate of &#163;350 a day. The terms of their appointments are for 4-6 days a month for the two legally-qualified Members and 2-3 days a month for the others. The Chair's appointment is for a minimum of three-days-a-week.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/7" class="indent">Expenses for 2008/09 are also published on our website at <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/expenses.asp">http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/tcc/expenses.asp</a> and I attach this table at Annex B. We will be publishing, in the next few weeks, the first six months' of expenses claimed / paid in 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.3/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful and please do let me know if you wish to discuss or need anything further.</p>

The reported expenses include the cost of all travel, accommodation and other support services for board members, the chief executive and directors. The variation in travel and accommodation expenses between board members reflects their respective time commitments and duties, the range of activities they undertake, the location of their homes and other individual factors. All board members, directors and the chief executive are required to travel around the UK to some extent.<br/> 2. The Commission has four offices in England and Wales: London, Liverpool, Newport (Gwent) and Taunton. With the probable exception of the chair and chief executive, the majority of board members' and directors' travel is between these offices.<br/> 3. Rail travel and accommodation are mainly booked through central agencies rather than by individuals who then claim the expense back. The costs shown, therefore, are those incurred by individuals rather than 'expenses claimed'.<br/> 4. 'Subsistence' covers the allowances payable for significant time out of the office and for overnight stays, at rates agreed with HMRC.<br/> 5. Where the board and directors attend key events that are organised centrally and through a 'block booking' by the Commission, e.g. where open board meetings are held away from the London office, the accommodation and food costs are not included as, retrospectively, this would involve disproportionate resource and expense. Events of this type held in 2008-09 were open board meetings in Liverpool and Swansea, the Charity Commission's Annual Public Meeting in London and the board's away day in Hertfordshire. The cost of these would add around &#163;500 in total to each individual's accommodation/food costs.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.1299W.5/1">To date, 27 interim empty dwelling management orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006. However, local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>
	<p pid="e.1299W.5/2">We are confident that the legislation is beginning to work well. We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

	<p pid="e.1302W.11/1">In the past, a number of Government offices have taken media monitoring contracts to ensure we can monitor and respond to issues and concerns of residents in the region, and to help inform our role in working with places-both to challenge and support their delivery for their residents, and to monitor and feedback to Whitehall Departments.</p>
	<p pid="e.1302W.11/2">Local means of doing this have varied between in-house and use of contracted services, but over the last two years the Government office network has driven efficiency savings by taking out a consistent contract for each GO.</p>
	<p pid="e.1302W.11/3">As of this year, there has been one media monitoring contract with TNS Media Monitoring Services which covers the whole network.</p>

	<p pid="e.1307W.5/1">The aim of the Kickstart programme is to unlock stalled sites in England for the development of high-quality, mixed tenure homes. Local authorities are note eligible to apply for funding from the Kickstart Housing Delivery fund as there is a separate funding pot available to authorities to deliver new social housing on land they already own and that can be developed only by them. Where a local authority has appointed a delivery partner, for example through a disposal or development agreement to bring forward a site for housing development, the delivery partner can apply. The successful projects from round one of the local authority new build programme were announced in September. 49 local authorities, covering every region of the country, will receive a share of &#163;130 million Government funding to build over 2,000 homes.</p>
