	<p pid="a.731W.3/1">The Chief Executive and Public Guardian continues to provide me with regular updates on the progress of the OPG's change plans, including those for the Archway Tower office.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.3/2">Archway Tower currently has three occupiers: the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), the Court of Protection (administered by Her Majesty's Courts Service) and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). The OPG's plans concerning its future operating model and structure are distinct from the ongoing activities of the Court and CAFCASS.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.3/3">It has become increasingly clear that the success of the Mental Capacity Act will continue to generate very significant future demand for the services of the OPG. As a result, the OPG has begun developing its strategy to ensure it is able to offer a high quality service to all of its customers: both now as well as in the future. To enable this strategy, it is planning to move OPG business progressively out of London in order to meet its customers' needs on a more efficient, effective and sustainable footing in the medium to long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.3/4">OPG engages actively with staff and trade unions about its change plans as they develop, particularly where they have a direct impact on teams and individuals. All work force change will be managed in line with the Ministry of Justice work force change policies, as agreed with trade unions.</p>

	<p pid="a.734W.0/1">Currently no data is collected from the magistrates courts about numbers of unrepresented defendants.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.0/2">There have been no recent changes to the rules on eligibility for criminal legal aid. Moreover, the introduction of means testing will not alter eligibility for legal aid in the Crown courts. Everyone who applies to be legally aided in the Crown court will be granted it. There is however a risk that the introduction of means testing to the Crown court will result in an increase in unrepresented defendants, as some people may decide to represent themselves rather than pay a contribution. This issue will be carefully monitored during the 'early adopter' phase and as part of the post-implementation review following national roll out.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.0/3">The recent consultation on Crown court means testing received a total of 48 responses. Over two thirds of respondents (34 in all) either explicitly supported or implied in their comments that they supported the principle that those who can afford to pay towards their defence costs should be asked to do so.</p>

All prisoners must be placed in the lowest security category consistent with the needs of security and control and the need to protect the public. Prisoners of a higher security category would not, as a matter of course, be held in an establishment of a lower category. The only exceptions to this will be where prisoners are re-categorised, and then await a move to a different establishment.</p>

	<p pid="a.741W.5/1">The most relevant measure on referral orders is reoffending rates. Data on reoffending rates for 2007, the most recent year figures are available, show that the proportion of juveniles that reoffended following a referral order was 40.5 per cent. The frequency rate of reoffending shows that these offenders committed an average of 117.6 offences per 100 offenders. These are the lowest reoffending rates of all juvenile court imposed sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.5/2">Reoffending rates for different sentences should not be compared to assess the relative effectiveness of these sentences, as there is no control for known differences in offender characteristics or other factors that may affect both reoffending and the type of sentence given.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.6/5">On management and maintenance, the condition of all listed buildings and scheduled monuments is assessed on a four and five year basis respectively. Recommendations are integrated into maintenance and management plans for the asset concerned. Where an asset is considered to be at risk we develop a strategy in conjunction with our heritage partners, local planning authorities and customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.6/6">A sustainability appraisal is undertaken for each new estate construction project. Heritage issues are managed as part of the design and construction process. Relevant planning consents are obtained in accordance with heritage legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.6/7">A formal engagement framework is in place covering liaison with statutory heritage bodies, but we also discuss specific cases with them. As a major stakeholder in the heritage sector, the MOD has also contributed to the development of wider policy and legislation in this area, including the Heritage Protection Bill and the Government's Vision Statement of the Historic Environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.743W.2/1">The pre-deployment training inventory of equipment includes hundreds of items ranging from existing core holdings to those procured specifically for current operations. A breakdown to the level asked in the question would incur disproportionate cost. It is, however, possible to provide representative figures for major classes of equipment:</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/2" class="italic"> Dismounted Close Combat (DCC) equipment</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/3">Availability ranges from above 90 per cent. for small arms to below 50 per cent. for complex items such as night vision equipment and Osprey body armour. The situation continues to improve; 75 per cent. of the funded requirement is expected to be met by December 2009 and 100 per cent. by mid-2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/4" class="italic"> Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) procured vehicles</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/5">The availability of these new types of vehicles is improving from the current figure of just below 50 per cent. As the pace of delivery increases this year, at least 80 per cent. of the funded training fleet for Mastiff, Ridgback and Jackal are expected to be available by November and 100 per cent. is expected to be available by mid-2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/6" class="italic"> Existing vehicles modified to Theatre Entry Standard (TES)</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/7">Vehicles such as Panther, Viking, CVR(T) and Warrior come from the existing fleet of vehicles; there is no shortage for training and crews and users are largely already qualified and practised in their use. There are some shortages in the number of vehicles specifically modified to TES; availability ranges from below 50 per cent. (CVR(T)) to nearly 60 per cent. (Panther).</p>
	<p pid="a.743W.2/8">Our priority has always been to get new equipment to the front line as quickly as possible for use by personnel facing the greatest danger. However, we have looked to ensure that sufficient new equipment is provided for troops during pre-deployment training so that they can use it safely and effectively on arrival in theatre. We have recently introduced measures to reinforce this, and all new Urgent Operational Business cases now include a clear requirement that sufficient numbers of pre deployment vehicles be procured and delivered for training before they are deployed operationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.751W.0/1">The provision of services to victims of domestic violence is a local issue; local decision makers are best placed to assess local needs. The majority of services are delivered through local providers who are supported and funded by local bodies, such as local councils and health organisations. As such, the Government do not collect information centrally on the number of services available for victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.0/2">However, the Government do take the issue of domestic violence very seriously and since 1997 has taken significant steps to combat it. The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act was designed to be deliberately gender neutral and we expect all victims of domestic violence to be taken seriously by all services. The Government are funding a Men's Advice Line (0808 801 0327) which has been specifically set up to support male victims of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.0/3">In addition, the Specialist Domestic Violence Court (SDVC) programme has continued to expand and the Government is committed to increasing the number of SDVCs to 128 by 2011. Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences are currently operational in over 200 areas, and will be rolled out nationally by 2011. Furthermore, in 2008-09 we provided over &pound;6 million to support the roll-out of Independent Domestic Violence Advisers (IDVAs) and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARACs).</p>

This policy places a carbon saving obligation on the main household gas and electricity suppliers. Suppliers are obligated to achieve a percentage of their carbon saving target (this is at least 40 per cent. in CERT) in a priority group of low income and elderly households. The priority group includes all households with a person aged 70 and over. We do not have powers to oblige suppliers to report their expenditure. However, through independent studies commissioned for cost benefit purposes, we estimate that 60 per cent. of suppliers' expenditure goes to the priority group. We estimate that over the nine years of the obligation, some &pound;2.7 billion will be invested by suppliers in meeting their priority group obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.753W.0/3">The Warm Front is the Government's main scheme for tackling fuel poverty and was instituted in 2000. The Scheme has spent in excess of &pound;2 billion on a range of energy efficiency measures including insulation and central heating. Since 2005, over half of the scheme's total budget has been spent on assisting those over the age of 60. The table shows the breakdown of spending in each year for this phase of the scheme. Figures for the last scheme year (2008-09) are not yet available. It is worth noting that in the 2007-08 scheme year alone, over &pound;37 million of the total was spent on helping those over the age of 81.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.6/1">The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is responsible for the development of regulatory procedures to ensure the continued airworthiness of all UK and European registered aircraft, which are engaged in commercial operations. The Civil Aviation Authority is empowered by the Department for Transport to carry out checks and inspections with a view to ensuring that UK operators comply with EASA procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.6/2">Foreign aircraft flying to or from the UK require permission from the Secretary of State for Transport and it is a condition of obtaining his permission that they comply with safety standards promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The Department for Transport operates a programme of ramp checks to ensure that ICAO standards are being adhered to and we are currently increasing our number of annual checks to some 1,000 in 2009-10. Where foreign aircraft are found to fall short of ICAO standards, we will take action to ensure that they remedy the deficiencies, up to and including removing their permission to fly here. We will also refer such airlines to the European Union's Air Safety Committee, which has the power to impose a Europe-wide ban.</p>

	<p pid="a.778W.6/1">Over the period 2002-03, 2007-08 the Department for International Development (DFID) has more than doubled bilateral support to education in fragile states. In 2007 DFID outlined further plans for increasing support to education for children affected by conflict or living in fragile states. This 2007 announcement by Gordon Brown included commitments to provide financial support for education in specific conflict and post-conflict states. Significant progress gas been made in these countries. In Afghanistan DFID has contributed &pound;60 million to the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund that meets the costs of 100,000 teachers. DFID's total contributions in Afghanistan to date have helped increase the number of pupils in school from two million in 2002 to over 5.4 million. In Somalia, DFID's is supporting to date some 18,500 boys and girls in school through partnerships with UNICEF and non governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.778W.6/2">Globally, DFID provides UNICEF with &pound;4 million per year to strengthen UNICEF's humanitarian response, including in the education sector. DFID is also currently working with UNICEF and other development partners to finalise the setting up of a fund, as part of the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) partnership, to support education in countries emerging from conflict and fragility. We will contribute &pound;20 million to this fund.</p>

They do this by ensuring parents understand all the options open to them including the provisions and protections of the statutory scheme. Should parents decide that a private arrangement best meets the needs of their family then there is no requirement for them to notify the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission that they have come to such an agreement.

Table 7.2 gives information on the number of cases where maintenance was collected or arranged as well as the number of cases with a liability to pay maintenance. The information is available from November 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.0/21" class="indent">In question 279117 you asked for an update of figure 11 of the National Audit Office report gives information on the intake of current scheme applications, current scheme clearances and the volume of old scheme uncleared cases. This information is available in table 2.1 of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics from 2003 only.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.0/22" class="indent">In question 279118 you asked for an update of figure 12 of the National Audit Office report, which gives the percentage of cases in age bands of current scheme uncleared applications at clearance and age of uncleared current scheme applications. A full time series is available in tables 4 and 5 of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics. As this is current scheme only, data is only available from 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.0/23" class="indent">Finally, in question 279119 you asked for information relating to errors in maintenance calculation; table 17 of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics gives information on the accuracy of maintenance decisions and how many were accurate to within a penny. This information is based on a sampling exercise and is available from March 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.813W.3/6" class="indent">It is not the change in working hours which may have an effect on the maintenance assessment; rather it is any change in income. Parents should tell us if the non-resident parent's regular income changes, or if there are any other changes to the information that we used to work out the amount of child maintenance that must be paid. For non-resident parents this includes information relating to: changes of address, the name and address of the employer, your payroll number and the amount you expect to earn. Similarly, parents with care must inform us if there is a change to the number of children living with them for which child maintenance is due, and the number of nights a child stays regularly with the non-resident parent. It is the responsibility of the client to inform us accordingly as to any change of circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.813W.3/7" class="indent">Not all change of circumstances will mean we need to change the amount of child maintenance due.

	<p pid="a.813W.3/8" class="indent">For cases assessed under the old scheme, we will, when notified, change the amount of child maintenance that must be paid, if it would change by &pound;10 a week or more, or if we included an amount of 'protected income' last time we worked out how much child maintenance must be paid, and the amount of maintenance the non-resident parent would have to pay would increase by &pound;5 a week or more, or reduce by &pound;1 a week or more.</p>

	<p pid="a.816W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many Benefit Delivery Centres and customer-facing Jobcentres operated by Jobcentre Plus there were in Essex and Castle Point in each of the last 24 months. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mel Groves as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. As Mel Groves is currently on annual leave, I am replying in his absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.816W.0/4" class="indent">There is currently one Benefit Delivery Centre in Essex, situated in Basildon. This situation has been unchanged for the last 24 months. There are currently 14 Jobcentres across Essex, of which one, Canvey Jobcentre, is situated in your constituency. Within the last 24 months we have closed two Jobcentres in Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.816W.0/5" class="indent">Customers are now using our Jobcentres differently. More of our face-to-face customer contact is on an appointment basis and information on job vacancies is readily available by telephone and the Internet. This enables staff in our offices to focus on those customers in greatest need of support to return to work. As part of this change in the way we work we decided that Stansted Airport Jobcentre should close on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase> and Tilbury Jobcentre on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.816W.0/6" class="indent">Stansted Jobcentre had always focussed on providing our customers with access to vacancies with employers at the airport and we never offered an advisory or benefit service from there. For several years we have provided our advisory and benefit services for customers in Tilbury through Grays Jobcentre. In short, the major purpose of both of these Jobcentres was overtaken by the change in the way we work.</p>

	<p pid="a.816W.6/1">The Department received numerous representations from a broad range of individuals and organisations in the last two years on the matter of extending the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance to people who become disabled after the age of 65. The cost of introducing such a measure cannot be established as there is no reliable data on which estimates could be made of the number of people over the age of 65 who might be entitled to the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance if they were to make a claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.816W.6/2">We have no plans to amend the entitlement conditions. It is normal for pensions and benefits schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives. Disability Living Allowance is intended to focus additional help with the extra costs of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life and who, in consequence, face limited opportunities to work, earn and save compared with non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.816W.6/3">Attendance Allowance provides help with the disability-related extra costs of people who experience the onset of disability after age 65. Based on the need for personal care, this help is part of the wide range of support that the Government make available to older people so that they can have a decent and secure income in retirement.</p>

Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> 4. Notified vacancies: monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br/> 5. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies) and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 6.

	<p pid="a.823W.5/1">The Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP), published in July 2008, set out the Government's plans for tackling offending by young people. It detailed our plans for a 'triple track' approach which involves early intervention and prevention, tough enforcement and non-negotiable help and support. It also states our ambition to reduce the rate of young people entering the criminal justice system by one fifth by 2020. This commitment is supported by close to &pound;100 million over three years, in addition to the existing significant investment in children's and youth services, to support local authorities in making inroads into youth crime locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.5/2">This Department has also invested in local projects to ensure that young people who are issued with antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) or Acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) are given follow-up support from a mentor to address the causes of their behaviour and prevent them entering the criminal justice system. Between September 2008 and April 2009 nearly 8,000 young people and families benefited from these Challenge and Support projects in 52 areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.5/3">As well as reducing antisocial behaviour, the interventions have improved family relationships, school attendance, and young people's involvement in youth activities and reduced homelessness and substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.5/4">In addition, the Youth Justice Board are investing &pound;32 million this year to deliver targeted prevention programmes such as youth inclusion programmes (YIPs), which are tailor-made programmes for eight to 17-year-olds, who are identified as being at high risk of involvement in offending or antisocial behaviour; multi-agency youth inclusion and support panels (YISPs) to prevent antisocial behaviour and offending by eight to 13-year-olds; and various parenting programmes which provide parents with opportunities to improve their skills in dealing with the behaviour that puts their child at risk of offending. All of these programmes build on the significant investment committed to other wider prevention programmes which make a contribution to preventing young people's involvement in criminal activity in deprived areas. Key examples of this are the work done to help young people take part in structured positive activities and to improve facilities in deprived areas through the Positive Activities for Young People and Myplace programmes and additional parenting support such as the Parenting Early Intervention Programme, Family Intervention Projects and expert parenting practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.5/5">In the three years to 2011, we will also have invested &pound;6 billion through Sure Start towards securing better services for children young people and their families, with an emphasis on the most disadvantaged communities. This includes co-locating services through Sure Start Children's Centres and extended schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.825W.0/2">The costs of implementing the Child Poverty Bill are set out in the impact assessment, which was published alongside the Bill on introduction. The impact assessment outlines the increase in public sector administrative costs expected to arise from the Bill, estimated at an annualised average of &pound;7,260,000 in 2008-09 prices.

	<p pid="a.828W.3/1">Since 1997, the Government's savings strategy has focused on developing better incentives for saving, ensuring people have the capability to make the right savings decisions for them, and that they have access to appropriate savings opportunities. To support this strategy, the Government have introduced a range of incentives to save, including ISAs. ISAs are extremely popular and are held by over 18 million people. The tax relief given through ISAs amounted to an estimated &pound;2.4 billion in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.3/2">The Government are also committed to supporting pensioners through the global economic downturn, providing support for all and more for those who need it most. To provide additional support, Budget 2009 announced a package of measures to support pensioners who receive income from savings. From October 2009 the annual ISA investment limits will rise for people aged 50 and over to &pound;10,200, of which up to &pound;5,100 can be held in cash. In November 2009 the capital disregard in pension credit and pensioner-related housing and council tax benefit will increase, meaning the first &pound;10,000 of capital will not be included when calculating someone's entitlement for these income-related benefits. Budget 2009 also announced a new &quot;tax back&quot; campaign to contact pension credit recipients to encourage them to claim back tax they may have overpaid on their savings income and, where possible, register to receive interest on their savings tax-free in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.3/3">The Government have taken a range of measures to strengthen financial stability and improve protection for savings. These include bringing in a new Banking Act, which provides for new arrangements for the resolution of banks in distress, and for a new insolvency procedure for winding up failed banks which focuses on ensuring the rapid payout of compensation to, or the speedy transfer of the deposits of, retail depositors.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.14/1">The disposal of used foundry sand to landfill is currently able to benefit from the lower rate of landfill tax. Used foundry sand, and other wastes, were established as &quot;lower rated&quot; in 1996 on the basis of the then understanding that they were not &quot;active&quot; and their landfilling results in a relatively lower level of environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.14/2">At Budget 2009, the Government published a consultation document, &quot;Modernising Landfill Tax Legislation&quot; which proposes, inter alia, that, in order to strengthen the environmental integrity of the tax, the benefit of the lower rate should be restricted to those wastes which are &quot;inert&quot; according to the tests provided for at a European level which post-date the establishment of lower rated wastes. The consultation document also seeks views on whether environmental criteria other than &quot;inertness&quot; should be taken into account when deciding whether a waste might be lower rated. It identified used foundry sand as a waste that would cease to be lower rated if inertness were the only criterion. Comments on the proposals are welcomed by the consultation deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-24">24 July 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.837W.8/1">The aim of Homeowners Mortgage Support is to prevent repossessions, where households suffer a temporary income shock. After taking money advice, homeowners apply to their lenders to join the scheme, which allows them to defer up to 70 per cent. of the interest due. The Government have published an impact assessment, which estimates the number of borrowers that could be eligible. Official figures on the number of households entering the scheme will be published later this year.</p>

The funding, announced in the 2009 budget, will allow councils to bid to deliver up to 900 new homes, building on their own land. Homes will be for social rent, built to high environmental standards. The first bidding round for this is currently under way and successful bidders will be announced in September. Tamworth could submit a bid for their funding if they so wished.</p>

	<p pid="a.846W.8/1">The pay of nursing staff in the national health service is covered by the independent NHS Pay Review Body. The review body takes evidence from the Government, trade unions and NHS Employers before making their recommendations about pay awards. Last year, the NHS Pay Review Body's recommendation of a 2.75 per cent. pay award for 2008-09 was accepted in full by the Government as part of a three-year pay deal which included headline awards of 2.4 per cent. for 2009-10 and 2.25 per cent. for 2010-11. In December 2008, the NHS Pay Review Body decided not to seek a remit to review this year's 2.4 per cent. headline pay uplift for nursing staff and others on the same NHS pay system.</p>

	<p pid="a.859W.6/1">The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), within their guidance, recommends that a registered nurse, midwife or specialist community public health nurse in advising, treating and caring for patients/clients, has professional indemnity insurance. This is in the interests of clients, patients and registrants in the event of claims and professional negligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.6/2">While employers have vicarious liability for the negligent acts and/or omissions of their employees, such cover does not normally extend to activities undertaken outside the registrant's employment. Independent practice would not be covered by vicarious liability. It is the individual registrant's responsibility to establish their insurance status and take appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.6/3">In situations where an employer does not have vicarious liability, the NMC recommends that registrants obtain adequate professional indemnity insurance. If unable to secure professional indemnity insurance, a registrant will need to demonstrate that all their clients/patients are fully informed of this fact and the implications this might have in the event of a claim for professional negligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.6/4">Although such standards are not binding, registrants breaching them risk being sanctioned under their regulator's fitness to practise procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.859W.6/5">The NMC have also been working closely with the Department, Devolved Administrations, employers, Trades Unions and patient representatives on draft proposals, which would require compulsory indemnity as a condition of registration. However, following concerns expressed by nursing and midwifery unions, the former Secretary of State has recently announced a review of policy on indemnity insurance. The NMC have been advised the proposals have been put on hold pending the outcome of the review.</p>

	<p pid="a.860W.8/2">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has recently carried out a small study on some of the injection powders that are used to retain added water in chicken preparations, evaluating the use of a novel method to identify the animal origin of the proteins used.

	<p pid="a.864W.5/1">The Government's target is to deliver a 25 per cent. annual net reduction in the administrative burdens on regulation affecting businesses and third sector organisations by May 2010, so reducing costs by an estimated &pound;3.4 billion. As at December 2008, Departments, regulators and agencies involved in the administrative burden reduction programme reported delivery of &pound;1,888 million of annual net administrative savings, i.e. a 14.4 per cent. reduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.864W.5/4">To ensure that the reduction efforts are felt on the ground, claimed savings are scrutinised by an External Validation Panel, made up of representatives from business organisations, before they are reported. The Government will report further progress in December 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.865W.5/1">Following successful Government lobbying at the Spring European Council in 2007 to secure agreement to a target to reduce administrative burdens stemming from EU law by 25 per cent. by 2012, Ministers from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and its predecessors have continued to push the European Commission to bring forward simplification proposals as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/2">This has already resulted in the Commission presenting a proposal to give member states the option to exempt micro-enterprises from the requirements of the accounting directives. In January, the Commission committed to making:</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;Every effort... to adopt these proposals before the end of this Commission mandate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/4">Ministers were instrumental in paving the way for the 2009 Spring European Council conclusions which urged the Commission to go one step further and:</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/5" class="indent">&quot;present all proposals in each of the 13 priority areas before the end of its mandate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/6">Ministers were also key in getting better regulation measures into the Small Business Act for Europe which was agreed in June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/7">As a result, the Act stresses the importance of reducing administrative burdens and includes a Commission commitment to assess the impact on SMEs of all forthcoming legislative and administrative initiatives and to use 'specific measures' such as transition periods, derogations and exemptions for small and micro firms, wherever appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.865W.5/8">EU member states endorsed the Small Business Act in December 2008, calling for action to be prioritised in areas where it will have most impact, including better regulation. Ministers pressed for this emphasis and continue to underline the importance of implementing better regulation commitments at the EU level at every opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.5/1">No estimate has been made because there is a lot of uncertainty as to what tariff and non-tariff barriers UK exporters to the EU would face if the UK were not a member. It is likely that even the UK was not a member, it would have some preferential access to EU markets, but this could be in several forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/2">In the extreme or worst case scenario UK businesses could be forced to pay the most favoured nation tariff (the tariff applied to countries with no preferential access) to export to the EU. Higher tariff and non tariff barriers in this scenario would decrease the competitiveness of UK exports in the EU, and therefore would likely reduce the volume of trade taking place&mdash;meaning a greater loss of jobs and business opportunities for UK companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/3">The UK would therefore have the incentive to enter some sort of free trade agreement with the EU. Such agreements remove tariffs for the majority of goods but vary greatly in the extent to which they remove non-tariff barriers. These include differences in regulations (health and safety regulations for example) which make exporting to the EU more costly. They vary also greatly in the extent to which they cover other areas of great economic importance like trade in services, investment, intellectual property matters, migration, competition issues as well as public procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/4">In the best case scenario, the UK would still enjoy full access to the single market like the members of the European free trade area. That would mean however that it would have to take on board all EU regulations linked to the single market now and in the future, with no influence on designing them. Just like Norway, the UK would probably also have to contribute financially to continue benefiting from this access.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.5/5">Calculating the costs imposed on UK businesses under all of these possible outcomes could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.869W.2/2">While figures specifically considering late payments are not available, among those companies entering compulsory liquidation in 2007/08 the most common causes of failure were a loss of market (22 per cent. of cases) and management failure (20.4 per cent.). Financial difficulties were identified as the primary cause of failure in 13.4 per cent. of compulsory liquidations and bad debts were cited in 11.1 per cent. of cases. The failure of a company was attributed to the knock on effect from the failure of another business in 4.1 per cent. of compulsory liquidations.</p>

	<p pid="a.878W.2/1">UK Trade and Investment aims to maximise international opportunities for UK businesses with low carbon products, services and solutions across the whole economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.2/2">UK Trade and Investment is leading on a UK Low Carbon International Marketing Strategy. This is a partnership between business and Government to build the UK's low carbon reputation and position the UK to take advantage of global business opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.2/3">The strategy's overarching messaging and case studies of UK low carbon solutions were launched at a partnership event on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-25">25 March 2009</phrase>. This was a joint event organised by UK Trade and Investment and the Carbon Trust. Approximately 70 representatives from UK business, professional bodies and organisations with low carbon solutions or interest in the low carbon economy attended, in addition to David Miliband, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and officials from UK Trade and Investment, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and Department for Energy and Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.2/4">Next steps are to develop specific marketing for a number of sectors and to use this in the UK and overseas to market the UK's low carbon offer to secure trade and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.878W.2/5">UK businesses will be able to showcase their low carbon solutions and meet international buyers at a number of events in the UK and overseas including the architecture seminar on sustainable buildings as part of the Singapore Design Festival in November 2009, BESAsia in Kuala Lumpur in November 2009, Technology World in November 2009, the NanoForum and Energising Technologies Conference in November 2009, <i> (e</i>) the World Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi in January 2010, Ecobuild in London in March 2010 and <i> (g) </i>the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.879W.2/1">Most calls for a ban have been around concerns about labour abuses, especially the use of child labour, in Uzbekistan. The UK remains concerned about allegations of the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan. The UK has raised its concerns through the EU and has discussed this issue with the Uzbek government. The EU welcomed Uzbekistan's signing of the International Labour Organisation Conventions on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and Minimum Age in 2008 and 2009 respectively and has urged Uzbekistan to implement effectively its international obligations in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.879W.2/2">The UK Government continue to call on businesses to look at their supply chains and take appropriate action if they find evidence that goods have been produced using child labour. Some companies have committed to not using Uzbek cotton in their products and monitor their direct supply chains to ensure that this is so.</p>
