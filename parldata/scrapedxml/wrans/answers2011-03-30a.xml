	<p pid="a.341W.2/1">Cattle vaccination is a potential long-term option for helping to control bovine TB and could have benefits in reducing the risk of infection and onward transmission of disease. However, a vaccine cannot guarantee that all cattle will be fully protected against TB and is therefore unlikely ever to be suitable for use as a sole eradication strategy. In addition, evidence suggests that without addressing the problem in the badger population, it will not be possible to eradicate TB in cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.2/2">DEFRA has invested around &#163;18 million into the development of a cattle vaccine and associated diagnostic tools. There are still significant technical and regulatory challenges to overcome before a cattle vaccine would be available for widespread use. This includes the need to change EU legislation. We therefore anticipate that a cattle TB vaccine could not be used in the field before 2015 at the earliest.</p>

This report finds that the water footprint of avoidable food waste in the UK is 6,200 million cubic metres per year, representing nearly 6% of the UK's water requirements. In per capita terms, this is 243 litres per person per day, approximately one and a half times the daily average household water use in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.349W.2/1">In the 2010-11 academic year we introduced increased freedoms for Further Education colleges and training organisations giving them increased flexibilities to determine the balance and mix of the provision they offer and the route through which this is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/2">Building on this, Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth (November 2010) confirmed that from the 2011/12 academic year there will be a single adult skills budget. This allocation can be used to support the delivery of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) provision, but there is no separate allocation of funding for ESOL.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/3">As part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas, FE has made its contribution. This has included reviewing the extent to which automatic fee remission for adult skills is provided, and in this context we have prioritised ESOL funding to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for other people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs to their communities and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/4">The equality impact assessment published alongside Skills for Sustainable Growth (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes may affect ESOL learners is currently being carried out by my Department, and I expect to be able to publish the assessment in due course. A review of informal, mainly unaccredited, adult and community learning (IACL) is also currently underway, with implementation of any changes beginning in the 12/13 academic year.</p>

An individual who thinks he or she has been discriminated against on the basis of a protected characteristic may bring a claim to a court or employment tribunal, depending on the nature of the claim.</p>

There is no restriction to the number of jurisdictional complaints that can be included in the claim; however, where a claim does contain more than one jurisdictional complaint, although treated as individual complaints, they tend to be heard together by one tribunal panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.0/4">No calculation of the average cost of Employment Tribunal appeals is available because of the significant variations which occur in the duration of hearings within jurisdictions and individual cases, and the consequent difficulty in producing an accurate overall figure.

	<p pid="a.373W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not work specifically on tackling tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in maternal care in Rwanda. DFID provides sector budget support to the health sector as a whole, to support the Government of Rwanda delivering results across the sector. The performance of the health sector is regularly reviewed jointly by the Government of Rwanda and donors. These reviews enable dialogue around best practice and agreement on how to disseminate lessons to the wider international health community. The Government of Rwanda themselves are very proactive in disseminating their best practice to other developing country governments and partners and have, for example, recently done so with respect to results-based health financing and community health insurance. The World Health Organisation and the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria also play a leading role, supported by the UK, in sharing best practice on tackling tuberculosis and HIV in maternal care.</p>

	<p pid="a.374W.2/1">According to Statistics on International Development (SID), published October 2010, Burundi is ranked as the poorest country to which the UK provides bilateral and multilateral aid. Burundi's gross national income per capita is $135. Following the Bilateral Aid Review, the UK Government are focusing future support exclusively on furthering Burundi's integration into the East African Community (EAC). We consider this to be the single most important contributing factor to Burundi's economic growth in the medium term. The UK Government's work on Trade Mark East Africa has supported the creation of a new Revenue Authority in Burundi, resulting in overall revenues rising by more than 30% and domestic tax revenues doubling. UK funding to Burundi will continue to be provided through the multilateral development organisations.</p>

We have strongly supported the Palestinian Authority's (PA) programme of reform of its institutions of state, including the security sector. The PA has made considerable progress in this regard, meaning a more effective government, an improved security situation, and the PA meeting its core commitments under the Quartet Roadmap. For this progress to be sustainable progress is needed towards a two-state solution; it is vital that obstacles to resuming negotiations are removed, including Israel's decision to continue building settlements, in direct contravention of its Roadmap commitments.</p>

	<p pid="a.383W.6/1">Feed-in tariff (FITs) levels were originally set to provide a target 5-8% return on investment across all technologies. Solar photovoltaic (PV) tariffs were set at the lower end of this range to reflect the ease of deployment; for example, solar PV installations up to 50kW do not require planning permission and are unlikely to require complex grid connections. In the fast-track review DECC is proposing revised tariffs in the light of emerging evidence that PV capital costs have fallen significantly since the start of the scheme and that large-scale projects are coming forward more quickly than originally expected. The aim is to target incentives towards smaller community and domestic installations, while keeping overall costs within the available budget.</p>

This represents a modest but useful contribution to our renewable energy and emission reduction targets.

These allow commanding officers to judge the situation facing their personnel and give them the opportunity to take remedial measures where possible. They do not provide an overall measure of manning. In addition, Harmony figures are unlikely to change significantly month on month as they are calculated against a rolling period ranging over years.</p>

	<p pid="a.385W.5/1">Less than 1% of the Royal Navy, 6% of the Army and 5% of RAF personnel are operating above Harmony guidelines. Operation Ellamy, the UK name for the NATO operation in Libya, is still in its early days and its duration remains unclear, as does the eventual number of personnel deployed to the operation. As a result of this, it is not yet possible to assess the effect on harmony of this operation. Nonetheless, the impact of all periods of deployment on the harmony guidelines remains under scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.11/1">Staff exits are categorised in different ways for military personnel and civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.11/2">For military personnel, early exits consist of voluntary outflows (VO) and medical discharges. VO is used to describe exits from trained UK regular forces which are voluntarily generated by the individual before the end of their agreed engagement or commission period. The costs of VO and medical discharges could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.11/3">Civil servants may leave or be dismissed on early retirement terms, with the financial consequences depending on the individual's circumstances. Where a pension is paid early, current rules generally require it to be actuarially reduced so that there is no extra cost to the Department. But arrangements may be put in place to buy out the actuarial reduction where voluntary exit schemes are required to enable the Department to reduce civilian staff numbers; and before the Civil Service Compensation Scheme was amended in 2010, some early retirements attracted an enhanced pension. Early payment of pension can be used for the purposes of medical retirement as well as for voluntary releases and redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.11/4">The numbers leaving on VO, medical discharge and early retirement are set out in the following table:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="a.388W.2/1">Project teams are responsible for ensuring that project proposals are tautly and realistically costed, drawing on expert advice. Their proposals are then subject to scrutiny by independent assurance teams. The Ministry of Defence Investment Approvals Board ensures that project approvals align with Defence priorities. The Defence Board and Ministers are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the equipment programme as a whole is affordable and deliverable, and for taking the decisions that are required to achieve this. In particular I have asked the Permanent Secretary and the Chief of Defence Materiel to examine our future programmes to ensure that their costs and risks are well understood and that the budget set aside for them is appropriate. In addition, I intend to chair a new Major Projects Review Board which will monitor major programmes on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are on time and within budget, to direct remedial action where necessary, and to hold those responsible to account.</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.2/2">HMS Ark Royal and the Harrier aircraft were withdrawn from service at the end of 2010 as a consequence of decisions taken during the Strategic Defence and Security Review. While there are no plans to retain these capabilities in operational service, the costs of doing so would have been broadly comparable to the savings we expect to achieve from withdrawing them. We estimate the savings from withdrawing Ark Royal to be &#163;10 million in 2011-12, &#163;25 million in 2012-13, &#163;35 million in 2013-14 and &#163;35 million in 2014-15. Savings from retiring the Harrier aircraft are estimated at around &#163;900 million between now and 2018.</p>

For 2011-12, we have announced allocations of &#163;81.5 million for local authorities and &#163;18.5 million for the voluntary sector. As part of our reforms to reduce the number of separate local authority grants, a further &#163;8.5 million to tackle fraud and under-occupation has been integrated to provide a single allocation of Preventing Homelessness Grant for local authorities in 2011-12 totalling &#163;90 million.</p>

We have also sought to maintain the level of grant for individual authorities, including rolling forward the additional &#163;10 million allocated to London authorities during 2010-11 to support implementation of welfare reform measures. Westminster council's allocation for 2011-12 is &#163;8.325 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.397W.6/3" class="indent">As Interim Chief Executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what estimate the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) has made of the financial benefit per month to a member of staff with two children under five working full time for an hon.

	<p pid="a.397W.6/4" class="indent">The financial benefit per month based on a salary supplement scheme would be &#163;336 per month for an employee who has two children under the age of 5 years. This &#163;336 would be subject to income tax and national insurance contribution and the exact amount will therefore vary per employee. The benefit for employees in receipt of childcare vouchers is the difference between the net and gross amount of the salary sacrifice, which can be up to &#163;243 per month, irrespective of the number of children they have.</p>
	<p pid="a.397W.6/5" class="indent">IPSA consulted in January 2010 on whether to provide childcare support but did not consult on what system of support to provide. Following this consultation, IPSA took the decision to retain the salary supplement system for staff already in receipt of this support, but to offer the staff of new MPs, and IPSA's own staff, a salary sacrifice scheme for childcare vouchers on the basis that such schemes are common across large parts of the public and private sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.401W.5/1">All foundation trusts and trusts are required to report via the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) dataset. Pressure sores (decubitus ulcer) should be recorded in HES under the ICD-10 code L89. Depth of coding varies significantly between trusts, and pressure sores are often a secondary diagnosis; measuring the incidence of pressure sores is complex, as it requires recording of whether or not a pressure sore was present on admission to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.5/2">The NHS Information Centre is currently developing a Safety Thermometer, which measures prevalence of pressure sores (and a number of other avoidable adverse events) more systematically in a group of foundation trusts and trusts who have volunteered to take part.</p>

	<p pid="a.413W.0/1">Up to the end of the 2010-11 financial year funding for Sure Start Children's Centres has been made through the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG). The base allocations for Sure Start Children's Centres for the financial year 2010-11 remain as announced at the start of the 2008-11 comprehensive spending review period. For Brighton and Hove city council and England those figures are as follows:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/10">The Department does not allocate funding at constituency level. It is for local authorities to determine how best to allocate available funding within their areas. The allocations for all local authorities can be found on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/11" class="indent"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/earlylearningandchildcare/a0071055/sure-start-early-years-and-childcare-grant-and-aiming-high-for-disabled-children-ahdc-grant-la-funding-allocations-for-2010-11">http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/earlylearningandchildcare/a0071055/sure-start-early-years-and-childcare-grant-and-aiming-high-for-disabled-children-ahdc-grant-la-funding-allocations-for-2010-11</a></p>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/12">Published allocations for Sure Start Children's Centres are not individually ring-fenced within the main revenue block of the SSEYCG and therefore are notional. Local authorities have the freedom to spend the available funding flexibly within that block to best meet local objectives and priorities, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Memorandum of Grant letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/13">In addition to the capital base allocation the Department had been able to offer some carry-forward of unspent SSEYCG capital funding from prior years. Given the unprecedented fiscal deficit the Department restricted carry-forward of SSEYCG capital (which includes Sure Start Children's Centres) to cases where funding was required for the completion of the children's centres programme, or where there was evidence of a contractual commitment either with a building contractor or for goods.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/14">The Department's calculations of carry-forward are predicated on levels of expenditure from prior years. We are awaiting audited financial returns from a number of local authorities, at which point carry-forward for all local authorities will be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.413W.0/15">From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>, funding for Sure Start Children's Centres will be within the Early Intervention Grant. This is a new un-ring-fenced and un-hypothecated funding stream which will give local authorities greater flexibility to target resources strategically and intervene early to improve outcomes for children, young people and families. The Government have ensured there is enough money within the Early Intervention Grant to maintain the network of Sure Start Children's Centres, accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need. To date only the EIG funding for the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 has been announced and is only available by local authority-the figures for Brighton and Hove city council and all other local authorities in England are available at:</p>

There will now be just three national funding streams to local authorities, namely the Dedicated Schools Grant and Pupil Premium which are used to fund education services, and the Early Intervention Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/3">The overall amount of the Dedicated Schools grant and the Pupil Premium for 2011-12 will be based on the number and characteristics of pupils in schools in January 2011. That information is provided to local authorities by schools and will not be available to the Department until June 2011 so it is not possible to do a comparison at this stage between the funding that authorities receive in 2010-11 and 2011-12. However overall funding per pupil will be maintained in cash terms and on top of this schools receive a pupil premium for the most disadvantaged pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.5/5">From 2011-12 the Department has also rationalised capital funding streams to local authorities. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-12-13.65"><i> Official Report, </i>columns 65-70WS</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced details of allocation of over &#163;2 billion of capital funding for 2011-12 to schools and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/6">The announcement included details of allocation of:</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/7" class="indent">&#163;800 million of basic need funding to local authorities to provide school places where needed in their area, in all categories of taxpayer-funded schools</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/8" class="indent">&#163;858 million of maintenance capital to local authorities to support the needs of the schools that they maintain and for the Sure Start children's centres in their area</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/9" class="indent">&#163;196 million of locally-coordinated VA programme capital to support the maintenance capital needs of voluntary-aided schools</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/10" class="indent">&#163;185 million of devolved formula capital for schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/11">The calculation of the change between years is only possible for the capital programmes that have been announced for 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/12">For the calculation of the change in real terms we have followed the Treasury's established method. The 2010-11 Devolved Schools Programmes figures have been increased by 2.5% to bring them to forecast 2011-12 prices using HM Treasury's published GDP deflators. The 2.5% deflator is derived from HM Treasury forecasts for GDP deflator increases at the June Budget Report 2010. This is not a measure of the change in construction tender prices during that period and it is not a reliable indicator of the change in local authorities' ability to procure construction works for school buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.421W.3/1">The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/2">Local authorities will also attract the looked after child pupil premium for 2011-12 which will be allocated to local authorities for pupils who at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> were looked after continuously for at least six months, and who were aged four to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August 2009</phrase> as recorded on the April 2010 local authority return. Each pupil will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the responsible local authority who will pass it to maintained schools for pupils who have been in care for six months or more in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.421W.3/3">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In the Nuneaton constituency in January 2010 there were 2,031 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;873,330. In addition to this there were 17 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, paid at a lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further &#163;3,400. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. It is not possible to determine the number of parliamentary constituency pupils recorded on the Alternative Provision census or recorded as looked after as they are both local authority, rather than establishment level, returns.</p>

	<p pid="a.422W.6/21">While this shows an increase on the amount of time pupils have spent doing PE and sport, the proportion of pupils doing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils (39%) play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only around one in five (21%) plays competitive sport regularly against other schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.2/1">The Schools White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', set out our commitment to raising the prestige and esteem of the teaching profession and driving up standards across the board. An independent review of teaching standards is currently under way to establish clear and unequivocal standards which all schools can use to promote the highest quality of teaching in all classrooms</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/2">Academies are required, through their funding agreement, to employ teachers who hold Qualified Teacher Status or are otherwise eligible to do specified work under the Education Regulations 2003 and will therefore be subject to the outcomes of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/3">Innovation and diversity are at the heart of free school policy and in this spirit we will not be setting overly prescriptive requirements in relation to qualifications of staff. But proposers will have to make clear how teaching standards will be maintained in their applications. We expect, however, that free schools will find the revised standards a helpful tool for performance management and staff development and will be free to adopt them if they wish.</p>

The document will provide the opportunity for those who have an interest in, or are directly involved with, the training of teachers to provide comments on our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.5/2">In the meantime, we hold regular discussions with key representatives of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) community and other subject associations which help inform policy development.
