We have been monitoring the lead up to the auctions of the legally stockpiled ivory, which took place at the end of October and beginning of November and will continue to keep in touch with the CITES Secretariat to assess its effects on the illegal trade in ivory.</p>

	<p pid="a.39W.10/1">Much of the work undertaken by Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA) HQ is of a specialised nature, and includes meeting EU obligations. For these reasons, an Marine Management Organisation (MMO) skeleton body will be set up to start running from autumn 2009 to run in parallel with the MFA until <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> to mitigate any risks to the current high standards of service, and provide the opportunity for knowledge transfer between new and existing staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.39W.10/2">To ensure there is no loss in knowledge and skills from the MFA between now and autumn 2009, I will be announcing a decision on the MMO HQ's location as soon as possible. This is to ensure we have sufficient staff to cover the business over the transition period. We will ensure that existing staff work closely with both the MFA's senior management team and the MMO implementation team to capture knowledge and pass it to MMO staff who will begin to populate the skeleton body.</p>

Each of the services has a slightly different metric that reflects the ethos and expectations of armed forces personnel. The guidelines are kept under regular review in order to ensure that they reflect the operational requirement of the Department but remain balanced with the requirement of training and recuperation, including leave. Part of recuperation considers retention issues and the assessment of the work/life dynamic is of particular concern. Harmony is split into two related but separate requirements: unit harmony, that primarily relates to force structures and commitments; and individual harmony, that relates to the effect of all separation on individual service personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.51W.5/2"><i> </i>We do not record separately the number of unsolicited parcels received from members of the public by personnel deployed on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/3">The British Forces Post Office (BFPO) policy is that unsolicited mail will be moved to operational theatres as and when there is sufficient spare capacity to move it without affecting the mail from family and friends. The recent MOD publicity campaign seeking to discourage unsolicited parcels has significantly reduced the volumes of unsolicited mail currently being processed by the BFPO and as a result the relatively small quantities of such mail are being processed with minimal delay. I should, however, emphasise that any return to the sorts of volumes of unsolicited mail witnessed last year could result in substantial delays to personal mail and we cannot allow that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.11/1">We have a responsibility to investigate all new research regarding the possibility of any harmful health effects of the nuclear tests we have carried out in the past. The Government have, therefore, studied the most recent scientific evidence from Massey University New Zealand on genetic damage in a group of Royal New Zealand Navy participants in the British nuclear tests. The study report expressly states that its findings throw no light on health effects. The Government's position remains the same, as previously stated, in relation to the common law claim brought by a group of veterans and deceased veterans' dependants or beneficiaries, of the UK's nuclear weapon testing programme. A preliminary trial on limitation is due to commence at the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.11/2">The wider published peer-reviewed epidemiological evidence to date has not demonstrated a general link between ill-health and participation in the tests. In the event, the vast majority of participants in the UK nuclear weapons trials did not receive any recorded dose of ionising radiation. Some participants received doses that were not significantly above zero. A very few individuals, because of their specialist roles, received higher dose levels, but within the safety limits appropriate at the time. Where the health of these participants has been affected by their service, we pay compensation under our no-fault compensation arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.11/3">I am determined to ensure that all avenues of research are looked at. I am therefore pleased to report that I had a constructive meeting with the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association (BNTVA) in late October to discuss the possibility of a new MOD study into health issues, particularly in relation to offspring. My officials are now in discussion with the BNTVA and scientific advisers on the scientific and ethical issues relevant to a further study. I am hopeful that I will be able to make an announcement early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.57W.5/1">Following the extensive floods during the summer of 2007 Sir Ken Knight, Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser conducted a review into the response of the fire and rescue service to the floods, and Sir Michael Pitt conducted a wide-ranging, independent review into floods. During the course of these two reviews and ensuing work, many representations were received from the fire and rescue service, including the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Fire Brigades Union. The two reviews were published earlier this year. The Government's response to Sir Michael's report is expected to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.60W.2/1">Out of 204 local authorities with a Housing Revenue Account, 178 have the servicing of a notional level of debt, the Subsidy Capital Financing Requirement (SCFR) supported by the HRA subsidy system. The remaining 26 are considered to be debt free and have a zero or negative SCFR. Of the 178 local authorities that have a level of debt supported by the HRA subsidy system 43 are in positive subsidy. In addition those authorities in Rounds 1 and 2 of the ALMO (Arms Length Management Organisation) programme receive an ALMO allowance to support the associated borrowing. For all other ALMOs the support for the associated borrowing is included within the SCFR. The support for debt servicing is then offset against other elements of the subsidy system to determine net subsidy entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.5/1">The CLG Committee report on coastal towns published in March 2007 defined 'transient populations' in the broadest sense to be composed of UK adults of working age (who may move with their children) and overseas migrant workers who move on a frequent basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.63W.5/2">There is, however, no consistent definition of transient populations and therefore no centrally produced measure of them. Given this, it is not possible to assess the needs of non-migrant transient populations in seaside towns or to include an explicit measure of such populations, as part of the formula distribution system.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.3/1">In 2007-08, 4,177,720 women were invited for cervical screening by the NHS Cervical Screening Programme in England, and 3,374,826 women were screened.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-02">2 December 2008</phrase>, the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) published a study showing that women living in more deprived areas were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than those living in more affluent areas. In the most deprived areas of England, there were 12 women per 100,000 diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2000 and 2004, compared to only six per 100,000 in the most affluent areas. The researchers mainly attributed this gap to the lower uptake of cervical screening in deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.3/3">The Cancer Reform Strategy, published in December 2007, (a copy of which has already been placed in the Library) said that we wished to reduce the variation of cervical screening coverage between primary care trusts. NHS Cancer Screening Programmes have commissioned the Improvement Foundation to work with six primary care trusts with deprived communities to develop and test initiatives that aim to improve the uptake of cervical screening in women aged 25 to 35. They are using social marketing techniques and, once the different possible initiatives have been evaluated, the results will be disseminated. The project begins in January 2009 and will run for one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.3/4">In addition, in order to provide services with an incentive to introduce higher coverage, the decision has been taken to have a tariff for cervical screening. This is being taken forward by the Department working closely with NHS Cancer Screening Programmes.</p>

Over the same period, the proportion of 12-year-old children with decayed missing, or filled (DMFT) permanent teeth has fallen from 93 per cent. to a historic low of 38 per cent.

	<p pid="a.78W.7/1">We do not collect information centrally on the number of schools providing wraparound care. We do, however, have information on the number of schools providing access to the full core offer of extended services in England. This includes access to a varied menu of activities, combined with child care in primary schools, from 8 am to 6 pm and during school holidays where there is demand. The list providing details of the number of schools in each local authority that are providing access to the core offer of extended services has been placed in both libraries. This shows that there are 14,750 extended schools which represents around 67 per cent. of all maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.7/2">There are many other schools which are already providing parts of the core offer, including child care and a varied menu of activities, and developing access to other services which are not yet included in these figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.7/3">We want all schools to offer access to extended services by 2010.</p>

However, the data did not show numbers of pupils taught in those buildings. Furthermore, checks indicated that the completeness and quality of the data was not good enough for accurate analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.8/2">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;6.7 billion in 2008-09 and will rise further to &pound;8.0 billion by 2010-11. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary buildings where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.5/12">Under the new Vetting and Barring Scheme a supervisory authority such as Ofsted will be required to inform the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) if it has information that a person poses a risk of harm. In return, ISA must inform them when it bars someone who is supervised or registered by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.5/13">Where employers (including independent schools) in the education sector have ceased to use the services of a person because they consider that person is unsuitable to work with children, or they would have ceased to use the person's services where the person has left their employment, they are required to refer information to the Department. In addition, the Police refer to the Department cautions and convictions for those who have been working in educational establishments in accordance with Home Office Circular 6/2006 (The Notifiable Occupations Scheme). Identifying how many referrals and letters of notification were received from (i) state maintained and (ii) independent schools would require detailed checks to be made of individual case records and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.93W.2/1">The Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives strategy sets out what the Government will do to reduce obesity but also calls on all parts of society to act. Schools have a vital part to play in helping children achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The Department has made available guidance and resources to help schools provide a healthy environment by providing nutritious school lunches, improving participation in high quality PE and sport opportunities, helping children learn about health through personal, social, health and economic education and practical activities such as cooking. Guidance and support is also provided to the 90 per cent. of schools that are currently participating in the national healthy schools programme, which promotes a whole-school approach to health, for example Guidance for Schools on Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity Guidance. Guidance from this Department and the Department of Health is issued to schools on how they can support the National Child Measurement Programme, which collects essential height and weight data on primary school pupils in Reception and Year 6.</p>
