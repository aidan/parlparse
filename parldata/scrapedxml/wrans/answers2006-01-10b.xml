	<p pid="b.441W.6/1">Guidance on biosecurity and on keeping birds separate from wild birds has been issued very widely to those who keep birds commercially, to veterinary practices and to many others including wildfowl trusts, the RSPCA and the Pet Care Trust. Further guidance on local risk assessments and contingency planning is on the DEFRA website. Advertisements have been placed in a variety of journals to bring the biosecurity guidance and the ban on shows, fairs and sales to the attention of keepers of backyard flocks and captive birds respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.441W.6/2">DEFRA is guided by the Department of Health in relation to advice on seasonal influenza vaccination. The current position is that routine vaccination of poultry workers, veterinarians or those dealing with wild birds with seasonal human flu vaccine is not recommended, but should be used in a confirmed outbreak of avian flu as a protection against the possibility of re-assortment with human flu virus for those people who might be exposed to the virus during disease control activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.442W.2/2">Live birds may be brought into the United Kingdom from poultry shows within the EU as long as the correct import procedures are followed. Rules on importing poultry are available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/animl-im/animl-im.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/int-trde/animl-im/animl-im.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.442W.2/3">The movement of birds within the EU is controlled by Community rules, which do not require birds to be quarantined. However, the UK's Salmonella controls require all fowl species (for example chicken, ducks and turkeys) arriving in the UK from other member states to be isolated for at least 112 days after arrival.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.2/4">Defra carries out qualitative veterinary risk assessments when officially notified of a disease outbreak in an EU-member state, a country on the border of the EU or one of the UK's trading partners worldwide. There are currently no cases of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza in EU member states. Based on veterinary risk assessments, we consider that the risk to birds in the UK is currently low.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.2/5">If an EU member state experiences an outbreak of serious disease such as Avian influenza, existing EU trade rules set out the measures that must be adopted by that member state to prevent the spread of the disease. If the situation demands it, the European Commission will propose additional safeguard measures. It is not open to other member states to take unilateral action which goes beyond Community trade rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.443W.2/1">The Government believe the best way for aviation to contribute to the long-term goal of climate stabilisation is through a well-designed emissions trading scheme. This work programme was a priority for the UK Presidency of the EU and under our Presidency, the European Council endorsed the inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS. The European Commission aims to bring forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006 and we are pressing for inclusion from 2008 or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/2">We are also encouraging industry to improve their operational practices; invest in research and development programmes; and to take voluntary action to control their greenhouse gas emissions. We have committed to offset carbon dioxide emissions from official air travel in central Government starting from April 2006 and continue to explore the use of other economic instruments, such as taxes and charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/3">On local air quality, local authorities have a statutory duty to review and assess the local air quality in their area for the purpose of local air quality management. Where it is likely that the air quality objectives will not be met by the relevant deadline, the local authority must designate an air quality management area and take action, along with others, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.443W.2/4">Air quality management areas in respect of the Nitrogen dioxide national air quality objective have been designated in the vicinities of Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The local authorities involved have drawn up or are working up air quality action plans, in partnership with the airport operators and other interested parties, setting out proposed measures to tackle the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.2/1">At the December 2005 Fisheries Council, the Government gave priority to addressing the small mesh fisheries which take cod as a by-catch. These include the beam trawl sector and the sector which catches nephrops. The measures adopted by the Council include a cut in the number of fishing days for these sectors and incentives for them to adopt more selective gear.</p>

The Department will have finished its review of all contractor accounts by the end of March 2006 but is dependent on judicial time scales and the work of the relevant investigating authorities in concluding all the commercial and valuer disputes. There have been delays in settlement because of the unwillingness of some contractors to engage in dispute resolution procedures and these have in come cases necessitated, and will necessitate, legal proceedings. The Department has spent to date &pound;30.341 million on professional services investigating close to &pound;1.3 billion of expenditure on goods, services and works arising out of the FMD outbreak. Direct savings of &pound;88.237 million have been achieved to date and, currently, five cases are the subject of High Court litigation.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.8/2">Clause 62 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill will extinguish certain unrecorded public rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles. For the very reason that these rights of way are unrecorded, it is difficult to give an accurate account of the number of vehicular rights that are likely to be affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.8/3">A study commissioned by the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales, which reported in March 2002, estimated that there are 2,700 km of rights of way (both unrecorded or recorded as other categories of rights of way) that, but for this legislation, would be likely to qualify as byways open to all traffic. It is likely that public rights for mechanically propelled vehicles will be extinguished over all of these routes under the new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.8/4">In addition, it is likely that public rights for mechanically propelled vehicles will be extinguished on most of the routes that are currently recorded as roads used as public paths. These extend to about 6,000 km in England and Wales, roughly 3 per cent. of the current rights of way network.

	<p pid="b.454W.5/1">We commissioned research into the opportunities and demand for water-based sport and recreation during the passage of the then Countryside and Rights of Way Bill through Parliament. The report, 'Water-Based Sport and Recreation: the facts', was published in December 2001. It concluded that there is some unmet demand for white water and long distance routes for canoeists, but that for most canoeists, as for most other water users, overall supply is roughly in balance with demand. We therefore concluded that the case for a statutory right of access had not been made and that we should pursue a voluntary approach instead.</p>

The feasibility study indicated that voluntary agreements can offer a means of increasing access to water and we asked the Environment Agency to complete agreements in all four pilot areas. In addition we have agreed to the development of a strategic approach to recreational access to water inland waters, led by the Environment Agency but in collaboration with other key stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="b.456W.0/1">DEFRA continues to have regular discussions with a number of ornithological organizations in Great Britain for assistance in implementing a surveillance programme for avian influenza in wild birds. This comprises three strands:</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/2" class="indent">Reporting and sampling unusual mortality events in wild bird species</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/3" class="indent">sampling by cloacal swabbing of live caught birds at Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust sites at several locations across the UK</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/4" class="indent">taking faecal samples by cloacal swabbing from freshly shot birds submitted by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) from various sites across the UK</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/5">Stewardship of the network of ringing groups lies with the ornithological organisations, including the BTO, and they have been working with DEFRA to identify the key issues concerning bird migration and behaviour, habitats, distribution of species of interest and issues around sensible measures for the protection of both employees and volunteers who may come into contact with wild birds through ringing and other activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/6">Following consultation with the Department of Health, advice is available on the DEFRA website regarding submission of bird carcasses from unusually high mortality events. DEFRA has also issued advice cleared by the health authorities to those that are conducting sampling of birds for wild bird surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="b.456W.0/7">Further information can be found on DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.456W.0/9">DEFRA is guided by the Department of Health in relation to advice on seasonal influenza vaccination. The current position is that routine vaccination of poultry workers, veterinarians or those dealing with wild birds with seasonal human flu vaccine is not recommended, but should be used in a confirmed outbreak of avian flu as a protection against the possibility of re-assortment with human flu virus for those people who might be exposed to the virus during disease control activities.</p>

Since 2004 we have committed over &pound;17 million to programmes to help build civil society capacity. While we have built a strong relationship with the State Ministry for Civil Society the majority of our funding is targeted directly at civil society organisations. Projects have focused included protection of minority rights, trade unions, justice and the rule of law, inter-faith dialogue and media development.</p>

	<p pid="b.458W.5/1">In 2003, Iran was forced to admit that for many years it has been operating secret facilities to enrich uranium, in clear contravention of its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. Other breaches relating to plutonium have been ascertained. We also know of Iranian contact with the Pakistani nuclear weapons expert A. Q. Khan, who admitted working with clandestine nuclear weapons programmes in Libya and North Korea.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.5/2">Since 2003, the United Kingdom, French and German Governments, with Javier Solana, the EU high representative, have worked tirelessly to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation by Iran through ensuring that it complies fully with its international obligations. As part of this, I ran agreed towards the end of 2003 to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.5/3">This morning, I regret to say, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran had broken seals at nuclear facilities, including its uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, with a view to resuming research and development, including the introduction of uranium hexafluoride into the centrifuges. That is enrichment. This is a profound concern. It is a further rejection by Iran of IAEA board requests and a violation of the commitments that Iran made in the Paris agreement in November 2004. In view of all that, I shall be meeting my French and German colleagues and Javier Solana as soon as this can be arranged, to discuss our joint and firm response.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.0/1">The Government remain concerned about freedom of religion in China. Progress was made in advancing the European Parliament's resolution on this matter in a number of respects during the UK presidency. Freedom of religion was a focus of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in October 2005. The UK presidency led a follow-up EU demarche in Beijing in December 2005. Several individual cases were raised at the Dialogue and in the demarche, including that of Pastor Zhang, whose case we continue to follow closely. An EU-China seminar on the ratification of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights was held in December 2005; and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture visited China in November 2005. We will continue to raise religious freedom with the Chinese Government, and urge further progress on points raised in the resolution.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.9/1">EU Heads of State and Government agreed in December a proposal from the UK presidency for the Union's budget over 2007&ndash;13, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). That proposal included a provision allowing member states to transfer up to 20 per cent. of their funding for CAP market support and direct payments to rural development. This Government have always supported moving funds in this direction, and will continue to do so. The agreement in December also contained a commitment to review all EU expenditure, including the CAP, in 2008&ndash;09. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-02">2 December</phrase>, the Government published a paper setting out the UK's vision for reform of the CAP, which we hope will inform that debate. This is available at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov/uk/media/E76/04/a_Vision_for_the_CAP.pdf">http://www.hm-treasury.gov/uk/media/E76/04/a_Vision_for_the_CAP.pdf</a>. The Government are in on-going discussions with other member states and other stakeholders about their views on that vision, and their own ideas for the future of the CAP. The UK presidency also managed to secure agreement with other member states in November on a historic liberalising reform of the EU sugar regime.</p>

The European Neighbourhood Policy, through its country-specific Action Plans, links the development of relations with the EU to economic and political reform, including human rights and democracy. The Partnership Agreement with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (the Cotonou Agreement) provides under its Article 8 for a systematic dialogue on the three essential elements of human rights, democratic principles and rule of law, with formal consultation procedures which have already been invoked on a number of occasions.

	<p pid="b.467W.13/1">A range of measures are being taken to improve energy efficiency on the Parliamentary Estate. A new Energy and Water Saving Policy which contains targets for energy consumption, water consumption and carbon emissions was adopted in late 2005 by both Houses. These targets mirror those set by most Government Departments as proposed in the 'Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate', published by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.13/2">Consultants have been recently appointed to advise on the renewal of the current basement heating and cooling systems and the Carbon Trust has been working with the Parliamentary Estate since 2004 to advise on methods to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Recently consultants have advised on heating controls, kitchen energy use and heating, ventilation and air conditioning plant and have identified scope for energy consumption reduction in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.467W.13/3">To raise staff awareness of the importance of energy efficiency the Parliamentary Estates Directorate is embarking on an awareness campaign. The December 2005 issue of 'inHouse', the staff magazine for the House of Commons and the House of Lords, contained an article on the Parliamentary Estate's Energy Savers Group. Guest speakers are to be invited to make presentations on environmental issues to staff every few months. The first presentation was made by Professor David Bellamy on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-21">21 November 2005</phrase>, entitled Sustainability and governance&quot; and was very well received. A second speaker, Dave Hampton has been asked to make a presentation during February 2006 on reducing carbon emissions.</p>

The UK has attracted and retained several businesses with interests in data storage. Notable examples are, Hewlett Packard, which conducts storage research within its laboratories in Bristol, Seagate Technologies which manufactures key magnetic components in Northern Ireland and an Atlanta based company called Iron Mountain who recently established a data storage centre in Scotland, providing 100 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.6/4">The Government recognises that information technology more widely is a key source of business competitiveness and productivity and is backing a coherent strategy and action plan for IT skills, spearheaded by e-Skills UK, the Sector Skills Council for IT, Telecoms and Contact centres.

ICSTIS can order service providers to pay redress if they breach the Code, with the threat of automatic barring from providing any premium rate service if they default. The number of complaints has fallen dramatically since the scheme was introduced in August 2004. Complaints to ICSTIS fell to a low of about 50 per month in recent months, down from 10,000 per month when this problem was at its peak in 2004.

This will keep money in the system, which can then be used to pay redress to consumers who have been the victims of a scam. New rules on compensation for consumers who have been subject to a scam are being implemented. This change will mean that not only will ICSTIS be able to order refunds from service providers but also to collect the money from the telecoms companies to compensate consumers if it is not forthcoming from the service provider.</p>

	<p pid="b.477W.3/2">Retirement age is not the same as the normal pension age but simply the age at which workers leave the labour market. The normal pension age is the age at which scheme members can draw an unreduced pension from the scheme&mdash;this has been the subject of recent negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.477W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase> the Government reached agreement with unions on a set of principles underpinning reform in the civil service, NHS and teachers pension schemes. The main focus of that agreement was the proposed increase in the normal pension age from 60 to 65. The TUC accepted that new schemes for new entrants would have a normal pension age of 65, and that these schemes would be launched as soon as practicable following a period of scheme-specific consultation to be completed by June 2006. Existing staff are not being compelled to move to a normal pension age of 65. Other aspects of scheme reform, apart from the normal pension age issue, will be considered in scheme specific negotiations to be completed as soon as practicable.</p>

	<p pid="b.478W.5/1">While the Home Office has lead responsibility for migration policy, my officials are working closely with their Home Office colleagues to ensure that the needs of business for migrant workers are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/2">The UK needs migration&mdash;tourists, students and migrant workers make a vital contribution to the UK economy. We need to ensure, however, that while we let in migrants with the skills and talents to benefit Britain we stop those who are trying to abuse our hospitality and place a burden on our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/3">The aim is to ensure that those who can contribute most to the UK are selected for entry and that the country takes in only as many people as our economy needs at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/4">The 5-year strategy on Immigration and asylum published in February 2005 set out the next stage of the Government's comprehensive reform of the UK's immigration and asylum system of which the points-based selective migration system was a part. It puts the interests of Britain first with strict controls that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/5">The main aims of the new points-based system will be, to:</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/6">improve public confidence in the system;</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/7">fill skills gaps;</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/8">attract highly productive and highly skilled workers and students;</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/9">attract investment and increase productivity and flexibility in the labour market; and</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/10">ensure people leave at the end of their stay.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/11">The new system will be clearer and more transparent and easier for applicants and employers to understand and use and there will be more objective and easily verifiable criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/12">The consultation period on the consultation document Making Migration Work for Britain&quot; closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase>. The Home Office are now analysing all the responses received. We anticipate the Government response to the consultation exercise will be published in the new year, together with a clearer timetable for the next steps. We will continue to consult with key stakeholders on specific issues as we formulate our response and during future stages of the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/13">We are also aware that migrant workers may face difficulties in understanding and asserting their rights. We have offered to work with the Governments of all the new member states, to prepare bi-lingual know before you go&quot; leaflets, giving advice on questions to ask before leaving the country and on legal protections offered to workers including agency workers. It is particularly important to reach workers in the host country before they leave as it is often much harder to help workers, who may not speak English and have no accommodation arranged, once they arrive.</p>
	<p pid="b.478W.5/14">To date we have produced leaflets in partnership with the Polish and Lithuanian Governments. These followed a similar leaflet we produced in partnership with the Portuguese Government, and benefited from input from the TUC, the CBI and other stakeholders. These have been distributed widely in both the workers' home country and the UK. In Poland, for example, they have been publicised on television and our embassy and the Polish authorities have worked hard to distribute them via job centres, recruitment fairs and other channels. The text of the leaflets is also available on the DTI website&mdash;ttp://<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/migrant_workers.htm</a></p>

	<p pid="b.479W.3/1">Provisions for disabled people and the elderly are based on the successful 'Games Mobility' model used at the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002. This will operate throughout both the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games and covers every spectator service from disability awareness training for staff, inclusive ticketing processes, special transport and drop-off systems. Among other things, the service will include pre-booking of various forms of wheelchair; bookable access to individual electric buggies for transfers to competition venues; provision of personalised travel plans at the point of event ticket purchase; provision of wide access at airport-style security screening; appropriate signposting; audio-visual information provision; and induction loops at stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.479W.3/2">Transport plans for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will provide excellent access for all spectators and all competition venues will be served by fully accessible transport options. Mobility impaired spectators travelling by car will either be able to park close to venues or at spectator transport malls, and use Games Mobility facilities to transfer to public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.479W.3/3">The interim Olympic Delivery Authority is developing its approach to the design of the Olympic Park and venues to ensure they are accessible environments, the principles for which will be contained in the 'Access for All1 strategy which is currently being prepared as part of the planning process. This strategy is expected to be ready later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.484W.2/2">DFID worked to ensure that helicopters were available as quickly as was possible. It was important however to ensure that only those helicopters that were suitable to the task were sent. Once DFID identified two available PUMA helicopters, it tasked the Ministry of Defence to airlift them from Spain to Islamabad for use by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). These arrived on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase>. In addition, DFID committed &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) and &pound;2.5 million to the ICRC, both of which included support to helicopter provision, and &pound;1.7 million to United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) specifically for helicopters. Three Chinook helicopters were also provided through the Ministry of Defence from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November</phrase> to transport relief items and carry out medical evacuations.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.2/3">The priority now is to ensure that there is enough helicopter capacity to continue delivery of assistance to remote areas throughout the winter period which lasts until March.

	<p pid="b.485W.5/2">DFID has funded 22 energy projects since 1997 through our knowledge and research (KaR) programme. These had a total value of just under &pound;3.4 million giving an average project value of &pound;154,000.

The following table shows a breakdown by year, location, nature of project and cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.5/3">The projects typically covered a period of two or three years.

Most of the projects were carried out in developing countries, working with local organisations and community groups.</p>

This was part of a wider (electricity) generation and load management project carried out at a capital cost of approximately &pound;625,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.5/5">Our overriding interest in energy is to improve access in developing countries to affordable and reliable energy services, especially to the poor and in support of pro-poor growth and social development. We are encouraging the World Bank, through our support to the energy sector management assistance programme (ESMAP), to give greater attention to renewable energy as part of their efforts to improve access to energy. The World Bank is scaling up its financial support for renewable energy and energy efficiency and has recently announced a rise to $748 million for the year to June 2005, compared to $339 million the previous year. This exceeds the commitment they made in 2004 to increase by 20 percent. per annum their renewable energy and energy efficiency investments over the next five years. We very much welcome this increased focus by the World Bank on clean energy investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.5/6">We continue to work with various UK-based and international organisations and partnerships working towards the greater use of renewable energy as part of the effort to improve access to energy services.</p>

	<p pid="b.489W.9/1">The Department does not keep a record of returned correspondence and is therefore unable to provide the information requested. The only exception is for vehicle registration documents transactions carried out by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, where all Post Office returned registration documents were analysed. This showed that, over the five years ending December 2005, a total of 533,864 (0.6 per cent.) of the 86,505,364 registration documents issued were undelivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.9/2">Of these 84 were returned because the intended recipient had died and 71,812 because the intended recipient had gone away&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.9/3">A further 174,042 were returned because the intended recipient was not known at the address given, 277,626 because of application error by the licensing dealer or customer and 10,330 without a specific reason being given.</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.2/1">A variety of means are used to ensure that the Department keeps the personal data it holds up to date including:</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/2" class="indent">Internal cross checking across business units;</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/3" class="indent">Customer helpdesk/inquiry unit;</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.2/6" class="indent">Where it is appropriate and lawful, sharing personal data between government departments and other parts of the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/7">Specific details for the Department's Agencies are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/8" class="italic">DVLA</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/9">It is a legal requirement for drivers and vehicle keepers to notify DVLA of a change of name, address or vehicle details. DVLA is dependent on the motoring public to inform the Agency of new information as soon as the change occurs. Until a change is notified, DVLA remains unaware that the record is out of date. Because of legislative constraints, DVLA is unable to use third party information to update its records.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/10">DVLA has introduced several initiatives aimed at improving the accuracy, traceability and up to dateness of its records. These initiatives include the introduction of the new vehicle taxation rules (continuous registration), rollout of the new vehicle registration certificate to all vehicle keepers, and an intensive accuracy publicity campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/11">DVLA marks the record of those who have died on the basis of information received from the Office of National Statistics to prevent further correspondence being sent out which may cause distress to the bereaved's family.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/12">The results of DVLA's 2005 Accuracy Survey indicate that 97.4 per cent. of vehicle keepers are able to be traced from the information on the vehicle record. The equivalent figure for 2003 was 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/13" class="italic">DSA</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/14">The Driving Standards Agency keeps registers of approved trainers and instructors, including Approved Car Driving Instructors (ADIs) and LGV Driving Instructors. Instructors are encouraged to inform the Agency of any change of name or address within 10 days. All ADIs are provided with a change of address card when they register. The four yearly renewal of instructors' registration and periodic testing of ADIs' continued fitness and ability to give instruction, require up to date information. Otherwise an instructor could face removal.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/15">DSA is introducing an Integrated Register of Driver Trainers. To ensure information on the new Register is as current as possible DSA wrote to all instructors last year. The details requested included their email address for possible future communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/16">DSA is establishing an Internet service that will enable instructors to update their own records electronically.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/17">Details are checked when instructors contact DSA. In addition, DSA sends a quarterly magazine Despatch and ad hoc updates to instructors. Any returns are checked against DSA and DVLA records to see if a more up to date address is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/18" class="italic">MCA</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/19">Customers are encouraged to provide up-to-date information to validate our records whenever they require the services of the agency. Re-validation of certificates, which occur on a regular basis, for both ships and seafarers require up-to-date information.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/20" class="italic">VOSA</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/21">The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) does not hold data on the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/22">Users of the computerised MOT system are responsible for updating their records on the system. Site Managers annually receive a reminder to confirm or amend information about their site including personnel details. When VOSA receive notification of a person's death their record is amended accordingly. Instructions on these processes are included in the system user guide and internal VOSA Operating Instructions.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.2/1">The Defence Training Review (DTR) Programme is currently evaluating the bidding consortia's proposals. The impact on manufacturing and engineering companies and the extent to which they are drawn into training design, delivery and support and the exploitation of third party opportunities and revenue depends on Bidders' training and estates solutions. Until the evaluation phase is complete and a decision has been taken to select a preferred training partner, currently expected in summer 2006, I am not in a position to make any detailed comment on the wider impact of the DTR solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.502W.2/1">When the Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) ships are accepted off contract from the shipbuilders they will enter their Part II sea trials programme in preparation for formal entry into operational service. In line with normal practice, the Ministry of Defence has invited companies to declare expressions of interest to undertake work during the Part II trials phase to bring the ships to completion for operational service. The value of this work is yet to be determined as much of the activity results from experience in operation in the Part II trials. A number of companies have expressed an interest in undertaking such work. There are currently no plans to enhance the key capabilities of the ships.</p>

The Z Berth in Southampton docks will, in common with others around the UK, enable our nuclear submarines to visit.

The Royal Navy will support the Council and facilitate the opportunity to demonstrate that the Council's plans will dovetail with the Navy's own 'operator's emergency plan'. Responsibility for the production and test of the 'off-site' plan rests with the Southampton City Council.

	<p pid="b.505W.5/1">There are currently no restrictions placed on the resale of surplus military aircraft to private individuals. The Ministry of Defence ensures that the aircraft is prepared for disposal by reducing its security status to unclassified. There are, however, a number of terms and conditions, which limit the use of any aircraft sold. These include, for example, the responsibility of the purchaser to obtain a Certificate of Airworthiness, if the intention is to fly the aircraft and to apply for an export licence if it is transferred outside the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.5/2">Drop tanks, fitted to a military aircraft, are considered to be an integral part of the whole aircraft and are subject to the normal terms and conditions that ensure that the MOD takes all reasonable steps to inform purchasers of hazards.

	<p pid="b.506W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.8/2">The European Commission has not adopted any new proposals to harmonise the rates of duty for commercial diesel. The Government see no reason for harmonised excise duty rates on hydrocarbon oils and believe that tax policy is the responsibility of individual member states. It is for member states to decide what policies they should pursue through the use of fiscal instruments and, subject to minimum rates in some areas, what rates of duty they should apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.506W.8/3">The UK has a number of exemptions from the Energy Products Directive which enable duty to be charged at a reduced rate on oils that are put to certain uses, including use in leisure boats for private use. The Government are minded to apply for an extension these derogations and will issue an initial regulatory impact assessment on the effects of ending the derogation. This document will analyse the costs and benefits of the derogation, and be used as the basis for further information gathering and discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.3/1">The Learning and Skills Development Agency's (LSDA) report into the funding gap between schools sixth forms and further education (FE) colleges for like-for-like 16&ndash;19 provision was commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) as part of the agenda for change development programme. The report was the first attempt at a comprehensive assessment of all the factors that contribute to the total funding gap and estimated it to be in the region of 13 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.3/2">We recognise that closing the funding gap will not be easy but we have taken some important steps towards doing this. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November</phrase> the progress that we have made and our future plans for addressing the gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.3/3">The LSDA report was based on 2003/04 figures and since then we have increased FE funding rates relative to school sixth forms. In both 2004/05 and 2005/06 LSC funding rates for FE were increased by 5 per cent. compared to 4 per cent. for schools sixth forms. We have committed to matching the schools' Minimum Funding Guarantee for 16&ndash;19 FE. We are also addressing a number of technical anomalies between the two funding system through removal of the in-year adjustment and by beginning a phased removal of the Real Terms Guarantee for school sixth forms. We estimate that these measures will together reduce the funding gap to 8 per cent. by 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.3/4">We will follow this with further work and our next steps will be to bring greater consistency to the treatment of student retention and achievement between the school and college sectors from 2008. That should narrow the gap by a further 3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.3/5">Beyond that, we will work to establish a common funding approach across the two sectors through the LSC's agenda for change programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.514W.2/1">Sir Andrew has produced an excellent report which recognises the current strengths of the FE sector and sets out a compelling set of arguments for reform. There are challenges for all parts of the FE system with a clear and convincing set of priorities which we must address. The report is full of significant material which we need to take time to consider, and we want to do this in discussion with colleges and other stakeholders. In the light of that debate, the Government intend to set out in the spring the next stage of reform and how this will be implemented. The purpose of the Government's response will be to set out a coherent programme of reform which draws together Sir Andrew's report, Agenda for Change and other existing reform strategies to show how this sector can achieve its potential for economic and social impact.</p>

	<p pid="b.514W.5/2">My Department's policy on provision for young people is outlined in the Learning and Skills Act, 2000 which details our commitment, and the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) duty, to secure the provision of education and training for all those aged 16&ndash;19 years. Colleges may enrol students above the numbers they have agreed with the LSC and can do so if they wish, and have the capacity. I would expect colleges to respond positively to learner demand where they are able to do so. I would also expect that any unplanned growth in student numbers will be reflected in the plans colleges agree with local LSCs for the following year. Where individual colleges cannot respond to increased demand local LSCs will ensure there is appropriate alternative provision.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for Schools announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December</phrase> the schools funding settlement for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. We intend that school 6th form funding for 2006/07 and 2007/08 should align with these new arrangements. The allocations for school 6th forms for 2006/07 made by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) last month, and based on the September 2005 pupil count, therefore are fixed. For 2006/07 there will be no adjustment made, upwards or downwards, for extra or fewer pupils enrolled in school 6th forms in September 2006. The LSC have special arrangements for new and closing schools and will on an exceptional basis look at school 6th forms where provision is planned to increase significantly. In line with our announcement on multi-year budgets for schools, the LSC has also provided indicative allocations for 2007/08 which will be adjusted on the basis of school enrolment data for September 2006. These arrangements notified to the sector through Priorities for Success&mdash;School 6th Form Funding, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>, will ensure better consistency of approach in funding 16 to 19-year-olds in schools and further education colleges and provide more stability of funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.517W.5/1">Two national surveys of children's mental health have been conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the first (&quot;Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in Great Britain) in 1999, and the second in 2004. The data is not presented according to the educational establishment which children attend but the 2004 survey report shows that, among five to 10 year-olds as a whole, 10 percent. of boys and 5 percent. of girls had a clinically diagnosable mental health disorder. The survey found that the prevalence of mental disorders is greater among vulnerable groups, such as children and young people from more deprived socio-economic backgrounds. Children with a mental disorder were also found to have higher rates of special educational need and to be further behind in their scholastic development than those without disorders. In the five year period between the surveys, prevalence rates overall were unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="b.517W.5/2">The surveys have not explored the links to minor learning difficulties, though the 1999 survey did touch on the prevalence of mental disorder in relation to associated and specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. The figures showed that the percentage prevalence rate for mental disorders among those with a specific learning difficulty was 22 percent., compared to 8 percent. among those with no specific learning disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.518W.2/2">Under the proposals in the Schools White Paper 'Higher Standards, Better Schools For All', local authorities will be expected to help all schools improve their standards, through the support and challenge of School Improvement Partners, and drawing on the resources of the National Strategies. Local authorities will be expected to intervene decisively in schools that are falling below expectations, including coasting schools whose performance is not as good as parents have a right to expect, by issuing warning notices and taking radical action where necessary. In addition, Ofsted will be consulting on moving to a more proportionate inspection system, under which high-performing schools might receive minimal inspection, while under-performing schools could be monitored more frequently, with a focus on those issues of concern in the school. This would reinforce the drive for improvement in such schools.</p>

The amount of support for living costs that is available via grants and loans to higher education students is related to the number of weeks of full-time study in the academic year. Students on sandwich course placements are eligible for lower rates of support because they are normally expected to receive a salary from the firm or organisation with whom they have been placed.

	<p pid="b.524W.2/1">HM Treasury continually monitors the stability of financial systems around the world and their effects on the UK economy. The outlook for UK economy was set out in the PBR. A recent IMF report provides an authoritative up-to-date assessment of the banking system in China (see the Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation) and concludes that progress has been made in reform, but that considerable work remains to be done to improve the efficiency of banking intermediation. UK banks are playing a leading role in modernising China's financial sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.526W.8/1">On the <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December 2005</phrase>, the IMF Executive Board confirmed 19 countries as qualifying for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Qualifying countries will get irrevocable debt relief with immediate effect, once final administrative matters have been completed. The UK fully supports and welcomes the IMF's implementation plans for debt relief for Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Guyana, Ghana, Honduras, Mali, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Tajikistan, Uganda and Zambia.</p>
	<p pid="b.526W.8/2">The IMF Board also concluded that at this stage, while Mauritania is eligible for debt relief, it will not qualify immediately due to issues regarding macro-economic performance and public expenditure management since it reached completion point in the HIPC initiative in 2002. The IMF will work closely with the authorities in the coming months to help Mauritania qualify for MDRI debt relief. The UK welcomes efforts by the IMF and Mauritanian authorities to establish a track record, and we hope that Mauritania will qualify for debt relief in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="b.530W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the distribution of gross earnings was for those earning <i>(a)</i> under the point below which 10 per cent. of earners fall and <i>(b)</i> the point above which 10 per cent. of earners exceed, for the categories: (i) male, (ii) female and (iii) all workers in (A) Scotland and (B) each of the unitary local authority areas in Scotland. (40446)</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/5" class="indent">I attach a table showing the points above and below which 10% of earners fall for Gross Weekly Earnings for all, male and female workers, by local authority by place of work for Scotland and unitary authorities for 2005. These statistics are also available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101</a></p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.538W.8/1">The European Commission has not adopted any new proposals to harmonise the rates of duty for commercial diesel. The Government see no reason for harmonised excise duty rates on hydrocarbon oils and believe that tax policy is the responsibility of individual member states. It is for member states to decide what policies they should pursue through the use of fiscal instruments and, subject to minimum rates in some areas, what rates of duty they should apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.8/2">The UK has a number of exemptions from the Energy Products Directive which enable duty to be charged at a reduced rate on oils that are put to certain uses, including use in leisure boats for private use. The Government are minded to apply for an extension these derogations and will issue an initial regulatory impact assessment on the effects of ending the derogation. This document will analyse the costs and benefits of the derogation, and be used as the basis for further information gathering and discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.545W.0/6" class="indent">taxable income has a broader base and is paid by all companies and individuals regardless of age. For individuals, income tax is payable on both earned income from employment, unearned income and pension income. Unearned income includes property income, interest from bank accounts, share dividends and many state benefits. Unearned and pension income is subject to income tax, but not national insurance contributions.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.8/2">HMRC assesses all tax credits claims for compliance risk whether they are made through the e-portal or on paper. As with any area in which the Government are distributing large amounts of money, there will be some people intent on defrauding the system and HMRC therefore has a number of sophisticated measures to help it detect fraudulent claims.</p>
	<p pid="b.550W.8/3">Over the last 12 months HMRC has detected an increase in the number of organised attacks on the tax credits system, predominantly via the internet. HMRC continued to monitor the situation closely and updated me in June 2005. A decision was taken to suspend the internet service from <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-02">2 December</phrase> following an assessment by HMRC that the nature of the threat had changed, which in turn changed the balance of judgment between maintaining the service for genuine customers and the need to protect revenues.</p>
	<p pid="b.550W.8/4">HMRC is currently undertaking a programme of work on finalised 2003&ndash;04 awards&mdash;the first year of working tax credit and child tax credit&mdash;to provide more comprehensive information on the level of claimant error and fraud. This is due to be completed in spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.552W.9/1">No tolerance level is applied to on-going tax credits awards as the IT system automatically adjusts payments to recover overpayments. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) does have tolerances which influence whether or not it collects overpayments from ceased tax credits awards. But HMRC believes that disclosing the level of those tolerances might prejudice its ability to enforce the law and recover monies properly payable in respect of tax credit overpayments.</p>

	<p pid="b.553W.0/1">In my statement to the Treasury Sub Committee of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October</phrase> I explained that, subject to testing, HMRC would be introducing interim procedures to prevent the automatic recovery of a disputed overpayment until the case had been examined. Final testing was completed successfully in early November and the Chief Secretary informed the House at Treasury Orals on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-10">10 November</phrase> that the new procedures had been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.0/2">The interim procedures rely on a manual intervention to the existing computer system, which was not designed to enable automatic recovery of an overpayment to be suspended. HMRC is working to develop bespoke computer functionality to suspend recovery, but as I explained to the Treasury Sub Committee, having established the integrity of the IT system and significantly improved its performance, the priority must be to ensure that progress to a more flexible IT system is made in a measured and orderly way.</p>

For cases where there is an ongoing award, reduced rates of recovery apply for those claimants on lower incomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.3/4">Where there is an ongoing award reduced rates of recovery apply for those claimants on lower incomes. The maximum amounts by which HMRC would reduce payments to recover overpaid tax credit from the previous year are:</p>

	<p pid="b.558W.0/1">HMRC uses a number of sophisticated tools to help detect claims, which are fraudulent or wrong and wherever possible, this compliance activity is aimed at preventing these claims from being paid. HMRC are aware of persistent attempts by organised criminals to obtain tax credits by using stolen or fictitious identities and it monitors payments to detect organised fraud so that any payments can be stopped and followed up with those responsible. Figures relating specifically to such instances are only available from 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.0/2">In 2004&ndash;05 HMRC intervened on 17164 incorrect claims before the tax credit payments were made where fraud or error was suspected. Between April to end of November 2005 HMRC have made 38,924 such interventions, of which HMRC estimate over half have been as a result of organised attacks. From October 2004 to end of November 2005 HMRC also identified and stopped 22,284 tax credit claims in payment, where organised fraud was suspected.</p>
	<p pid="b.558W.0/3">Where fraud is detected HMRC may use its powers to charge a financial penalty or&mdash;in the most serious cases&mdash;investigate with a view to securing a criminal prosecution under the new criminal offence of tax credit fraud. HMRC prosecuted 153 individuals in 2004&ndash;05 and has prosecuted 159 in the current financial year to the end of November. Around 97 other cases are currently awaiting verdict.</p>

	<p pid="b.563W.11/1">Prosecution data is not readily available broken down by Northern Ireland constituency. The statistics provided in the table are for the years 2000 to 2003 and are based on the PSNI district command unit in which an offender's address falls. Due to the incomparability of 1999 data, (available only by the police division to which an offence was reported) 1999 figures are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.11/2">Data are collated on the principal offence rule, thus only the most serious offence for which an offender is charged is included. Statistics beyond 2003 will become available in early 2006.</p>

The MAPPA reports include statistics on the number of offenders who are subject to the notification requirements.

	<p pid="b.571W.9/1">We take the issue of eating disorders, especially among young people, very seriously. Anorexia nervosa in particular can have serious consequences for general health, and has high rates of mortality. This is why we asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to publish guidelines on core interventions for these disorders as part of its second programme of work. NICE published clinical guidelines on eating disorders in January 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.9/2">We envisage that services for people with eating disorders will improve, along with the whole spectrum of mental health services, as a result both of the Government's prioritisation of mental health services through the implementation of the 1999 national service framework for mental health and our increased spending on mental health from &pound;4.07 billion in 1999&ndash;2000 to &pound;5.09 billion in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

Operating standards for the centres also exist, including for healthcare, and the centres are required to audit compliance with them and submit their findings to the Director of Detention Services. In addition, initial discussions have taken place with the Healthcare Commission with a view to the possible registration of the private contractors who provide services at removal centres, which would bring them within the Healthcare Commission's oversight and inspection programme. While primary care trusts are not part of the formal monitoring process, they are being encouraged to work together with the removal centres to develop local protocols to improve the interface between healthcare services within the centres and the local national health service.</p>

	<p pid="b.583W.5/1">In 2004&ndash;05, the Department allocated &pound;1.3 million to the North and East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire strategic health authority (SHA) to improve access, choice and quality in national health service dentistry. In 2004&ndash;05, the East Yorkshire primary care trust (PCT) and the Yorkshire Wolds and Coast PCT, received &pound;147,000 and &pound;160,000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/2">The SHA advises that these funds were used to assist the development of new dental practices at Bridlington, Driffield, Pocklington and Beverley together with expansion of existing practices at Brough and South Cave. The new practices will allow 17,500 new national health service patient registrations and 2,000 additional NHS patients to access NHS care at the expanded practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/3">In addition, a new practice is due to open in early February at Beverley, providing care for 3,000 NHS patients, under a personal dental service (PDS) contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/4">There are access centres at Bridlington, Pocklington, Driffield, Goole, Cottingham, Withernsea and also at Hull. The access service provides care for over 40,000 patients annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/5">Two Polish dentists have been recruited through the Department's overseas recruitment programme and are now working within a practice in the Yorkshire Wolds and Coast PCT area.</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/6">Both PCTs have been working with dental practices to support them in moving over to the new PDS contract. The number of dental practices which have converted to PDS within each of the PCTs is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.583W.5/7" class="indent">East Yorkshire PCT: six practices, 15 whole-time equivalent (wte) practitioners, 40,602 patients,</p>

	<p pid="b.584W.2/1">No estimates have been made by the Department of dispensing patient packs if reimbursement is based on the quantity of medicine prescribed. Work undertaken by the Prescription Pricing Authority has shown that the quantity prescribed matches that of an available pack size in the majority of cases. For example, sample statistics show that drugs available in a pack size of 28 is prescribed in multiples of 28 nearly 78 per cent. of the time. In these cases the cost to the pharmacist of providing full patient packs is nil.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.2/2">It is not possible to ascertain whether pharmacists would incur cost by providing patient packs when reimbursement is based on the quantity prescribed as providing a full pack could mean that the amount dispensed is varied both upwards and downwards in comparison to the amount prescribed on different occasions, therefore the times more is dispensed may be balanced by the times less is dispensed.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.2/3">Furthermore, if pharmacists are not obligated to dispense a quantity other than that which is prescribed, they would retain the option of dispensing exactly as prescribed, thereby incurring no costs or losses.</p>

	<p pid="b.588W.5/1">Qualitative research of hepatitis C awareness among general practitioners and practice nurses has been carried out this year. This research, which repeats a baseline study carried out in 2001, indicates that awareness of hepatitis C is much improved compared to 2001 and that hepatitis C testing is being offered to those known to be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/2">The Health Protection Agency has been monitoring the number of reported laboratory diagnoses of hepatitis C, which is a national outcome indicator for implementation of the Hepatitis C Action Plan for England&quot;. There has been a noticeable upward trend in hepatitis C diagnoses since 2000 from just under 5,000 reports to around 8,000 in 2004. Injecting drug users are the group currently at greatest risk of hepatitis C infection in this country. The unlinked anonymous prevalence monitoring programme's survey of injecting drug users in contact with specialist services <sup>1</sup> showed that 67 per cent. had had a voluntary confidential test for hepatitis C in 2004 compared to 49 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/3">There has also been qualitative research this year into format and design of the hepatitis C Face Your Past&quot; leaflet, which is being widely distributed as the hepatitis C awareness photography exhibition tours regional cities. This research suggested that the design, content and tone were effective at gaining attention and giving a clear message without causing panic.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/4">Research into public awareness of hepatitis C will be carried out in 2006. This will repeat a survey of awareness among the general public and groups at increased risk of infection in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="b.589W.2/2" class="indent">The Government has set a national standard that all genito urinary medicine (GUM) services should offer an HIV test to clinic attendees on their first screening for sexually transmitted infections. Uptake of voluntary confidential testing (VCT) for HIV at GUM clinics among gay men has increased from 64 per cent. in 2003 to 79 per cent. in 2004.

While NHS trusts can innovate new approaches to patient care in much the same way as NHSFTs can, we know that freedoms conferred by foundation status are allowing NHSFTs to do this more quickly and efficiently.

	<p pid="b.595W.3/1">The first tranche of topics for the single technology appraisal (STA) was arrived at in consultation with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE reviewed the topics on its existing technology appraisal programme, considering when they were licensed, the potential impact on length and quality of life and the demand for guidance. The suitability of future topics for the STA process will be assessed in discussion with NICE. The STA process will only be able to appraise single technologies for single indications.</p>
	<p pid="b.595W.3/2">The existing multiple technology appraisal process will sit alongside the new process and will be available for use where an STA is not appropriate, for example where there is a need to look at two or more technologies together, or where the evidence base is particularly complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.595W.3/3">The Department and NICE are reviewing the process for selecting topics for the Institute's work programme, and a consultation document will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.601W.5/1">The national service framework (NSF) for children, young people and maternity services recommends that a family is visited at home by the health visitor or midwife when a child is around 12 days old, to assess the health of the child and family. It also recommends that a child receives a physical examination when they are between six and eight weeks old. This should concentrate on the child's eyes, heart and hips and is normally carried out by the general practitioner or the health visitor. Where a family requires more support or has complex needs the health visitor should offer further visits.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions: how many non-resident parents were paying the flat rate of &pound;5 child support per week in the latest period for which figures are available; and in how many cases these payments are being deducted from social security payments by the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/5" class="indent">You also asked how many and what proportion of non-resident parents have a net income such that they pay child support maintenance <i>(a)</i> at the &pound;5 flat rate and <i>(b)</i> on the taper for net income between &pound;100 and &pound;200.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/6" class="indent">Due to the limitations of currently available new scheme management information, it is not possible to provide the number or proportion of non-resident parents with net income between &pound;100 and &pound;200. However, information can be provided about the number of parents paying child support maintenance at the &pound;5 rate through analysis of maintenance calculations. This is presented below.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/7" class="indent">Under the new scheme, in most circumstances the minimum allowable calculation for a non-resident parent is &pound;5.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/8" class="indent">However, if the non-resident parent (NRP) or their partner is on Income Support or Income Based Jobseekers Allowance, where their partner is also an NRP, then the total liability for them both is &pound;5, split equally across both cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/9" class="indent">The NRP can also have a liability of less than &pound;5 a week if they have children with more than one parent with care (PWC), but they do not share care with all of them. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/10" class="indent">NRP X receives Incapacity Benefit, so is liable to pay the flat rate of &pound;5.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/11" class="indent">They have two children cared for by PWC A and also one child with PWC B. Care is shared with PWC B only.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/12" class="indent">The &pound;5 liability is apportioned according to the number of children so 2/3 (&pound;3.33) goes to PWC A and 1/3 (&pound;1.67) to PWC B.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/13" class="indent">But, because care is shared with PWC B, liability in this case is reduced to nil, meaning the NRP has a total liability of &pound;3.33 in respect of PWC A.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/14" class="indent">Additionally, if the NRP had a nil assessment under the old scheme, has been reactively converted to the new scheme because of relevant links to a new scheme application, and received a new scheme assessment of &pound;5 then, under phasing rules, the NRP would be liable to pay &pound;2.50 for the first year rising to &pound;5 thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/15" class="indent">It is therefore possible to have NRPs who are liable to pay &pound;5 flat rate, but whose current liability is less than &pound;5. For this reason, the figures quoted in the table below also include those NRPs who are liable to pay the flat rate of maintenance, but whose current liability is less than &pound;5.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.2/16" class="indent">Figures relating to the total number and proportion of NRPs assessed to pay maintenance at a level of &pound;5 or less and whether or not this is scheduled to be collected via a deduction from benefit are presented below.</p>

Of this latter group, 236,000 cases were closed and 40,000 identified as either claiming good cause, being subject to a reduced benefit decision or a change of circumstances in relation to an existing case (as opposed to a new calculation).</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.3/7" class="indent">It should be noted that an application is defined as cleared if the case is closed, a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a payment arrangement between the parent with care (PWC) and the non-resident parent is in place. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the PWC is identified as claiming Good Cause, the PWC is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case as opposed to a new application.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.3/1">Young people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) who are interested in further education and training can receive advice and guidance from Jobcentre Plus Advisers on education and training opportunities, including details of educational establishments that provide A Level courses. A condition of claiming JSA is that recipients continue to make themselves available for and actively seek work, so any education or training undertaken must comply with conditions for continuing to receive JSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/2">Young people aged 18&ndash;24 who have been claiming JSA for six months are required to participate in the mandatory new deal for young people (NDYP) programme. The primary aim of NDYP is to help move people into sustainable work as quickly as possible, however, participants on the programme may access education and training opportunities through the full-time education and training (FTET) option.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/3">FTET courses assist new deal participants in achieving vocational qualifications at or equivalent to S/NVQ level 2. They are not designed to compete with qualification courses run by further education establishments, for example GCSE or A level courses. FTET provision is delivered across a wide range of employment sectors for varying lengths of time and is tailored to the needs of the individual and local employers. People aged 25 and over who have been claiming JSA for 18 out of the last 21 months are required to join the mandatory new deal 25 plus (ND25 plus) programme. The employment and training option (ETO) within new deal 25 plus provides participants with the opportunity to acquire the formal qualifications, generally up to and including S/NVQ Level 3, that may be necessary for them to their particular jobs or occupational sectors. Personal advisers can approve early entry to both NDYP and ND25 plus for some people if this is appropriate to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/4">Some eligible young people may also participate on other new deal programmes. People on new deal for lone parents (NDLP), which is a voluntary programme, have access to a range of new deal training opportunities, including the NDYP FTET option, or may participate in other approved training. They can have access to this help from the first day of joining the programme. Normally NDLP funding can only be used for education and training courses up to NVQ/SNVQ Level 2 or equivalent. However, where it is clear that a lone parent can achieve an NVQ/SNVQ Level 3 in a year (for example where they have the appropriate qualification levels in the subject) funding could be considered. In all cases Advisers must consider whether the training will lead to sustainable employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/5">New deal for disabled people (NDDP), which is also a voluntary programme, is designed to support people in receipt of disability or health-related benefits in finding and sustaining paid employment. Although NDDP Job Brokers work closely with providers of training, they usually focus on vocational training which would not normally incorporate further education qualifications such as A-level courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/6">Finally, young people may also participate on the voluntary new deal for partners programme which offers partners of people claiming certain benefits support in tackling barriers to work. Partners are eligible to join the programme from the first day of the claim and can be referred to the FTET option of NDYP or the ETO Option of ND25 plus, or other suitable training which will improve their job readiness.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.3/7">People aged 18&ndash;24 are also eligible for LSC modern apprenticeship training where the young person is employed, paid a wage and given the training needed to gain a qualification.</p>
