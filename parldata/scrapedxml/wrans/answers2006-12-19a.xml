This has been the case since VAT was introduced. As such, no estimate has been made.

The guidance is aimed at minimising risks for all road users and does not segregate needs by vehicle types.</p>

	<p pid="a.1756W.9/2">Substantial research was completed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s on the use of non-slip road surfaces. This has been used to establish the Agency's current standards and policy on their use on trunk roads. At present, the Agency is carrying out research to establish whether the condition of non-slip road surface sites can be assessed by survey machines travelling at traffic speed. This research is expected to be completed in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1776W.16/1">The duty will not introduce any additional monitoring. However, local authorities' performance on biodiversity can be monitored using existing mechanisms. This includes the biodiversity action reporting system, the library of voluntary performance indicators and other performance indicators under development with the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Audit Commission and local government partners. Information on indicators under development can be found on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1776W.16/3">Guidance being published in 2007, to support local authorities in implementing the duty, will also promote biodiversity indicators as a way to measure progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1776W.16/4">It is intended that the biodiversity duty will encourage a culture change so that biodiversity is taken into account across the functions of local authorities, rather than being prescriptive. Due to the diverse nature of local authorities, the Government are keen to allow them flexibility in the approaches used to implement the duty. Therefore it is not feasible to ensure that local authorities use the exact same approach across the board.</p>

The data on emissions from all sources are the average of the central cases in the 2006 Energy Review, including the effect of emissions trading and the policies included in the UK Climate Change Programme. Projections for all sources on this basis are not available beyond 2020. The data for total emissions from all sources include emissions from domestic flights, which currently account for about 7 per cent. of emissions from aviation at UK airports.

Instead capital budgets are allocated and reported upon along functional lines to Directorates that oversee the policy area and to executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies to sustain their asset base. For example, capital budgets are allocated to the DEFRA units responsible for the Departmental estate; IT; flood defence and waste management. Many of these individual projects are then carried out by third parties such as local authorities. Because capital expenditure is captured in this format the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.0/25">The increase in emissions from deforestation is largely due to the delayed effect of soil disturbance in earlier years of the period since 1990, rather than a proportionate increase in the deforestation rate. Afforestation results in a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere and is therefore represented as a negative emission. There is a small initial emission from new planting due to the disturbance of the soil.</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.3/2">Since DEFRA's inception in June 2001, we have provided significant funding for a wide range of schemes that aim to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/3">Headline programmes include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/4" class="indent">(i) those governed by the Carbon Trust, which leads in encouraging business and public sector energy efficiency and low carbon innovation</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/5" class="indent">(ii) the Energy Saving Trust, whose activities are aimed at increasing demand for household sector energy efficiency</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/6" class="indent">(iii) the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which reduces carbon emissions at least cost to industry</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/7" class="indent">(iv) the Climate Change Communications Initiative, which aims to change attitudes toward climate change within the general public, with a central focus on local, grass roots and regional engagement</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.3/9">DEFRA is also active in the international arena, especially in relation to emerging economies including China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally, DEFRA contributes funding to a variety of research programmes, including the flagship Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/10">DEFRA is currently spending more than &pound;180 million each year on these headline activities to combat climate change and over twice as much as this on peripheral activities. Full and detailed historic figures for DEFRA's expenditure on all programmes that directly or indirectly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The table also shows the length of each contract over which the repayments will take place and the estimated total unitary charge payments for each scheme. The repayment of the capital value is an element of this unitary charge but it is not the only cost covered. Other elements of the unitary charge can include inflation and service provision. We are not able to specify the exact breakdown of the unitary charge payments into these different elements, but have indicated for each scheme the type of costs that are covered by the charge. In each case, the unitary charge payments are projections to the end of the contract and are conditional on the performance of the private sector contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1782W.2/2">As well as schemes undertaken by the core Department and its agencies, Defra also provides support in the form of PFI credits to allow local authorities to enter into PFI contracts to provide waste treatment facilities, and we have therefore included details of these schemes.</p>

This will not necessarily involve additional resources, as in many cases the delivery of support under the new Programme will use those resources that are currently delivering the existing Programme. The formal transfer to the Regional Development Agencies of responsibility for delivery of the socio-economic elements of the current and successor Rural Development Programmes in England involved a transfer of 65.5 full time equivalent posts from the Rural Development Service</p>

This commitment applies equally in rural and urban areas. The majority of my Department's programmes benefit both rural and urban areas. However, the cost of these programmes in rural areas alone could not be identified without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1786W.2/15">DEFRA also contributes &pound;74 million to the Regional Development Agencies' (RDA) Single Pot in 2007-08, for delivery against three of it's Public Service Agreement targets: sustainable development, rural productivity, and sustainable farming and food. While RDAs are required to address the needs of their regions' rural areas, they recognise there is considerable interdependence between cities, towns and rural areas. Rural needs are best secured by tailoring mainstream policy, with rurally specific programmes only being developed where market failure cannot be addressed through mainstream provision. As the majority of expenditure in rural areas is therefore likely to be through an RDA's mainstream activities (such as regional business support and skills development) it is difficult to identify precise rural spend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.2/16">The England LEADER+ programme, which assists rural communities in improving the quality of life and economic prosperity in their local area, will contribute around &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to the 25 local action groups selected to deliver the Programme in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1786W.2/17">In addition, Objective 1 European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Funding, (EAGGF) administered by DEFRA, will provide around &pound;22 million in 2007-08 for the three areas (Cornwall and The Isles of Scilly, South Yorkshire and Merseyside) designated under the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1788W.0/1">The evacuation of staff from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme, and other humanitarian agencies due to insecurity has the potential to affect the protection of both refugees and internally displaced and the provision of life-saving assistance. In response to the situation, the World Food Programme has already distributed food rations to cover needs in December, and agencies have put in place measures to allow most basic services to be continued if there was a full evacuation. Maintaining water supply is a major concern, due to the depth of the groundwater. If systems in the camps were to break down and agencies were unable to repair them, refugee and IDP populations would be forced to seek water elsewhere. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will consider providing further support to the humanitarian operation if required.

	<p pid="a.1788W.6/1">For development, all states need to fulfil certain basic functions, such as protecting their people and providing an economic framework to enable people to support themselves. In fragile states, our approach is to provide support for basic government administrative capacity building such that we do not overburden already weak state structures by attempting governance improvements on all fronts. Alongside this fundamental support, we also prioritise security, access to justice, conflict prevention, peace-building, the protection of human rights and basic service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1788W.6/2">For example in Sierra Leone, DFID assistance in building up civilian policing has helped reduce instability and increased the safety of citizens. Human development indicators are improving because citizens are better able to earn a living safely. In DRC DFID has supported the first democratic elections there for 40 years. And in Afghanistan DFID has helped the Government to collect revenue and plan their budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1788W.6/3">In our 2006 White Paper, we set out our commitment to use a new 'quality of governance' assessment which will be done as part of our published Country Assessment Plans. We will use this assessment along with others to make choices about the way in which we provide UK aid and help improve the capability of state institutions and strengthen their accountability to the poor.</p>

	<p pid="a.1790W.3/1">Over the last few months, attacks on humanitarian agencies have led to the evacuation of staff and the suspension of their operations in a number of locations throughout the Darfur states. This has reduced the area in which humanitarian assistance can be delivered, and poses a severe threat to an already fragile situation. The ability of agencies to return to these areas is contingent upon an improvement in security, which in turn requires finding a political solution to this crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1790W.3/2">The UK remains at the forefront of efforts by the international community to achieve this. Recent meetings in Addis Ababa mapped out a way forward, including the need for an immediate and strengthened ceasefire; a renewed political process to bring in the non-signatory rebel groups to the Darfur Peace Agreement; and a hybrid Africa Union&mdash;United Nations (AU-UN) peacekeeping force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1790W.3/3">We welcome the fact that the African Union Peace and Security Council extended the mandate of the AU force and endorsed the Addis Ababa conclusions. The staged deployment of UN support packages to the AU force leading to a joint operation needs to happen without delay in order to restore security, protect civilians, ensure humanitarian access and implement security aspects of the Darfur Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1790W.3/4">The UK Government has been in regular discussion with the Government of Sudan on the requirements to end the conflict. We are pressing them to take forward these agreed steps in full co-operation with the AU and UN and, in doing so, proving that it is taking its responsibilities seriously.</p>

The changes were originally introduced on a trial basis from the return of the House in October. The Committee again considered the operation of the rules earlier this month, and Mr. Speaker has agreed to the Committee's recommendation that the changes should be made permanent.

A reporter voice-over is also now permitted during divisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791W.3/4">Two new interview points have been identified within the precincts: in the south west corner of Westminster Hall once the current works there have been completed, and on the Green in New Palace Yard, subject in the latter case to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms. Filming pieces to camera of a presenter walking across Central Lobby are also permitted before 9 a.m. on non-sitting days, similarly subject to a permit from the Serjeant at Arms.</p>

Friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Ian McCartney, visited Bangladesh on 22-<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November</phrase> and met the head of the caretaker government and leaders of the main political parties. In his meetings, my right hon. Friend urged the caretaker government to act in a non-partisan manner to deliver free, fair, peaceful and accepted elections. He emphasised the need for responsible leadership and restraint from the parties in Bangladesh.

However, in some circumstances, such persons may also be subject to the laws of other states, particularly their state of nationality.

	<p pid="a.1797W.5/1">It is a condition of employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have the legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) provisions for children's education are intended to help staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1797W.5/2">We expect children who accompany their parents on postings overseas to use free state schooling if it is available locally and suitable. If suitable schooling is not available free of charge locally, but is available at fee-charging schools, we refund fees to enable children to receive the education they would be entitled to in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1797W.5/3">With staff and their families having to move at regular intervals, sometimes at short notice and at times which may disrupt schooling for their children, and education facilities at posts overseas varying, continuity of education can be problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO's continuity of education allowance addresses this problem by enabling children to board at schools in the UK while their parents remain subject to the world-wide mobility obligation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1799W.2/1">The election in May 2005 marked a step change in the democratisation process in Ethiopia. The degree of political freedom and debate in the run up to the election was unprecedented. We were disturbed that subsequent disputes over the election results led to civil unrest and violence which resulted in the tragic death of many people. There were also widespread arrests and allegations of human rights abuses. The main Opposition leaders and some civil society representatives remain in detention facing serious charges including genocide and treason. Since the election there has been a closing down of political space for the Opposition, the independent media and civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1799W.2/2">We continue to encourage both the Government of Ethiopia and Opposition to move forward with the democratisation process and to work towards political reconciliation. We have a regular dialogue with the Government on governance and human rights issues and the Government are now beginning to take steps to create space for opposition parties to contribute and participate in the House of Peoples' Representatives. We continue to urge the Government to open up political space and encourage open debate with all parts of society.</p>

The ODA committed to identifying, sourcing and using environmentally and socially responsible materials in its draft Sustainability and Progress Report published in July 2006.
