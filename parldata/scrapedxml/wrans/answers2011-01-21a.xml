	<p pid="a.984W.10/2">The Government's view is that there needs to be greater local democratic accountability and transparency over senior remuneration arrangements and policies in local government. To achieve this, we have introduced provisions in the Localism Bill to ensure that councillors are better able to be held to account for their decisions on senior pay by requiring full council to agree and publish a senior pay policy statement. This will form the framework within which decisions on senior remuneration can be made transparently by the authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.4/1">Low level waste (LLW) is currently managed in near-surface facilities, principally at the low level waste repository (LLWR) in West Cumbria.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.4/2">A near-surface facility is also being developed at the Dounreay site in Scotland. Some lower hazard radioactive wastes are also disposed of to conventional landfills.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.4/3">Near-surface disposal is further being considered for certain intermediate level wastes subject to a facility achieving an Environmental Safety Case and other relevant permissioning. The requirements for a safety case are set out in guidance from the environment agencies. At the current time, such considerations are at an early feasibility stage and no such facilities currently operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.4/4">It is Government policy that higher activity wastes, such as high-level waste (HLW) from reprocessing, intermediate level waste and long-lived LLW and unreprocessed spent nuclear fuel will be disposed of in a geological disposal facility. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) spent more than two and a half years considering and evaluating all the options (including near-surface disposal) for managing higher activity radioactive waste on the basis of wide engagement with the expert community including international experience, stakeholders and members of the public. CoRWM recommended that geological disposal was the best available approach as part of a package of recommendations in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.4/5">By definition, disposal of radioactive wastes to near surface or geological facilities is undertaken with no intent to retrieve. There are a small number of examples in the UK where historic waste disposals have been retrieved and the waste repackaged and disposed of to modern standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.4/6">It should also be noted that the UK has a strong and effective nuclear safety and environmental regulatory regimes that ensure the safe disposal and management of radioactive waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.988W.3/1">The Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF) was established at the same time as the Aggregates Levy, in 2002, complementing the Levy's objectives by targeting the environmental impacts directly. There is no direct financial link between the Fund and Levy; the Fund is managed by DEFRA and the Levy by HMRC. The Fund does not raise money whereas the Levy does and contributes to the general taxation pot. HMRC figures show that the following was raised over the last four financial years:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.988W.3/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Total receipts (&#163; million)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.988W.3/5"> <td>2007-07</td> <td>321</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.988W.3/11">DEFRA's administrative costs to run the ALSF have been approximately &#163;472,000 (or approx &#163;118,000 on average for each year) for the last four years. This cost was in addition to the fund itself. The funds are allocated to a number of primary delivery partners, many of which subsequently distribute on to others, so it is not possible to compile a complete breakdown of costs. However delivery partners are required to ensure that their administrative costs did not exceed 7% of their own ALSF budget allocation without prior approval. This was only sanctioned in one case.</p>

The total cost of these proposals for Great Britain is estimated to be &#163;29.41 million, and using a working assumption, which originates from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, slaughterhouses would absorb one third of the cost and livestock producers the other two thirds; it is estimated the proposals would cost slaughterhouses &#163;9.80 million, and livestock producers &#163;19.61 million.

The letter advised that, with agreement of Ministers in all four UK countries, the FSA had decided to proceed with the introduction of a new system of calculating charges for meat hygiene and animal welfare at slaughter official controls. The letter explained the new system would base charges on the time cost of official controls in meat businesses and would continue to comply with Article 27 and Annex IV, Chapters I to III of Regulation 882/2004.

	<p pid="a.995W.6/1">The Government's policy on influenza vaccination is informed by the expert advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The policy focuses on offering the vaccine to those at greatest risk from the effects of flu. JCVI does not recommend that children under the age of five outside the at-risk groups should be vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-30">30 December</phrase>, JCVI met to review its advice on seasonal flu vaccination. It issued the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/3" class="indent">&quot;JCVI was presented with data on the current seasonal influenza epidemiology, seroepidemological data collected during the 2009/10 pandemic, modelling of the impact of vaccination strategies during the pandemic, data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the young and vaccine uptake and safety data.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/4" class="indent">JCVI noted that a large proportion of those individuals with severe disease are in recognised risk groups for influenza but unfortunately were not vaccinated. It strongly re-iterated its previous advice that all individuals in risk groups should be vaccinated as soon as possible, particularly those aged less than 65 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/5" class="indent">The committee considered the issue of offering vaccination to healthy children either 0-4 years and/or 5-15 years of age. However, although there is a high incidence of influenza-like illness currently in these age groups, a significant proportion of this is due to other viruses such Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In addition, only a very small proportion of those with severe disease are in these age groups. Based on previous seasonal influenza epidemiology it would be hoped that influenza circulation will have subsided within a month. We do not believe that seasonal or pandemic vaccine should be used for these or other healthy person groups. The greatest gain will be achieved in increasing vaccine uptake in the clinical risk groups.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.995W.6/6">As with all vaccination programmes, JCVI will keep this matter under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.9/1">The Humanitarian Emergency Response Review (HERR) is an independent review of the UK Government's emergency humanitarian assistance, which is being led by Lord Ashdown. As stated in the Department for International Development's (DFID's) business plan 2011-15, the HERR aims to publish its final report by the end of March 2011. However, at the request of its Advisory Board, it has built in a four-week deadline extension (until the end of April 2011), to allow for possible delays that would then mean having to wait until after Parliament's Easter recess to publish the report.</p>

This figure includes sentenced male and female prisoners, adults, young offenders and juveniles. The figure does not include those held on remand.</p>
	<p pid="a.997W.3/3">Information on a prisoner's residence is provided by prisoners on reception into prison and recorded on a central IT system. Addresses include a prisoner's home address, an address to which they intend to return on discharge and next of kin and these figures are included in the answer. If no address is given, a prisoner's committal court address is used as a proxy for the area in which a prisoner is resident. This is required for about 40% of the prison population. As there is no committal court in the West Derby constituency area, no prisoners have been included in the figures provided on this basis. However, there may be some under counting in respect of prisoners from the West Derby constituency who have not provided an address and for whom a proxy address elsewhere is used. No address has been recorded and no court information is available for around 3% of prisoners, these figures are also excluded from the answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001W.2/1">Delivering the spending plans announced in the Government's 2010 spending review will require a robust framework to control spending. The End Year Flexibility (EYF) system which allows Departments and the devolved Administrations to carry forward unspent budget provisions into future years to discourage wasteful end-year spending has, in practice, led to accumulated stocks that would further increase the deficit if they were spent. The Government plans to abolish the existing EYF system at the end of 2010-11 and replace it with a new system from 2011-12 which will retain an incentive to avoid wasteful end-year spending and strengthen spending control.</p>

Neither charities nor businesses can recover VAT that relates to exempt sales or non-business activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.11/2">Unlike businesses, charities benefit from a range of tax reliefs which for 2009-10 the Government estimate are worth approximately &#163;3 billion per annum. These include reliefs from VAT, for example: VAT zero-rating on the sale of donated goods, medical and scientific equipment and, for qualifying charities, goods for use by disabled people. All zero rates are derogations from the normal EU VAT rules, and represent benefits not enjoyed by charities elsewhere in Europe.</p>

We launched our formal public consultation on our proposed reforms to DLA on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December 2010</phrase>. We will have ongoing discussions with more disabled people and disability organisations to ensure that our reforms will assess more accurately and consistently who would benefit most from additional support, while continuing to tackle the inequalities faced by disabled people to lead full and active independent lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022W.12/2">A training year runs from April to March. In 2010-11, the gains to trained strength (ie fully trained status) target for Royal Marines Other Ranks was set at 695: we currently forecast achieving 730, from a total of 1,200 recruits entering the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM). For the same period, the target for Royal Marines Officers was set at 39: we are forecasting achievement of 45, from a total of 50 Officer recruits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.12/3">We have assessed the gains to trained strength requirement for the 2011-12 training year to be 550 Other Ranks and 40 Officers. We anticipate that this will be achieved by an intake in the region of 840 Other Ranks and 50 Officer recruits to CTCRM.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.12/4">In the period July to December 2010, the Department spent &#163;260,000 on recruitment advertising for the Royal Marines.</p>

These figures represent intake from civilian life and not all of them will have completed their training successfully. They do not therefore include promotions from Ranks to Officers or transfers in from another Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022W.12/6">Other than the gains to trained strength targets, all figures have been rounded to the nearest five or 10.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023W.2/2">The decision not to bring Nimrod MRA4 into service followed careful consideration of the aircraft's broader utility, and was taken as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. My officials then assessed a variety of alternative uses for the aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023W.2/3">The Government are satisfied that we considered all realistic uses, and that once the decision not to bring the aircraft in to service was made, the most cost-effective option was to cancel the project immediately.
