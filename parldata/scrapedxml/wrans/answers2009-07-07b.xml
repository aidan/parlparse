	<p pid="b.623W.4/1">We, along with other international partners, made our concerns about the Shia Personal Status Law clear to the Afghan Government at a senior level. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister raised the issue with President Karzai. We welcomed President Karzai's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase> that the law would be changed to bring it in line with the Afghan Constitution, which guarantees equal rights for women, and the international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-20">20 June 2009</phrase>, the Minister of Justice met with female representatives of the Afghan Parliament and civil society and told them that his Ministry has now amended the Law. The amendments were made following written recommendations by Afghan civil society (the Afghan Women's Network), Katib university and moderate Ulema (religious scholars).</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/3">We understand the amendments made by the Afghan Ministry of Justice have added around 60 articles and removed around 10 from the Law. Language was also added to clarify the meaning of certain articles. The amended draft was viewed by the above female representatives as broadly 'pro women', and contentious articles, including the provision appearing to legalise rape, had been removed. The Law is also being reviewed by the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/4">President Karzai has indicated that the Law will next be sent back to the Afghan Parliament for approval (in time for the new session of Parliament, beginning <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-20">20 July 2009</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/5">The Law continues to cause controversy on both sides&mdash;some religiously conservative Ulema are still lobbying the President to pass the original draft, parts of which the international community and many Afghans deemed unacceptable. The outcome is still uncertain, therefore we, along with our international partners and Afghan civil society, will continue to follow the passage of the Law closely. We will lobby the Afghan Government whenever appropriate, to help ensure the final Law respects women's rights and does not undo progress made since 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.627W.5/1">Since 1999, we have actively supported the development of East Timor and played a part in ensuring that appropriate assistance was provided by the UN. The UN Mission in East Timor continues to provide peacekeeping support and capacity building to the East Timorese Government and Administration. The UK helps to fund this through our assessed contributions to the UN, and we will continue to offer strong support for multilateral efforts in East Timor. Additionally, the EU is assisting East Timor in promoting its justice sector and reinforcing the rule of law. The UK contributes both technical and financial assistance to the EU programmes in East Timor, currently worth around 18 million euros.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.5/2">We believe it is for the governments of Indonesia and East Timor to consider how best to deal with their past history, reflecting the concerns of their citizens. We have raised the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) and the Commission on Truth and Friendship (CTF) with East Timor and expressed the UK's view that it was important for the East Timorese parliament to debate the reports of the CTF and the CAVR as part of the process of establishing accountability. We hope that the adoption of the CTF report by President Yudhoyono of Indonesia and President Ramos Horta of East Timor will be a step forward in cementing the relationship between the two governments and enabling them to move forward in peaceful co-operation.</p>

For example, Ministers colleagues from the Department for Transport are members of the recently established Cross-Government Ministerial Group on Tourism, which was set up to promote and support the industry in Westminster and Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.5/2">In addition, our recently published sustainable tourism framework takes account of the Department for Transport's &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Transport System&quot; which sets out the Government's aim of building up a transport system which supports quality of life and a healthy natural environment. This is one of the Department for Transport's five strategic goals and is underpinned by a number of challenges which will be used to inform future transport spending priorities and could be used by transport planners for transport schemes that would support tourism.</p>

	<p pid="b.659W.9/1">It has been the policy of successive governments not to implement changes to pensions and similar benefits retrospectively. This policy has been applied across the public sector in the United Kingdom, not just to Gurkha veterans. To do so now would not only be counter to this policy but would also lead to potential claims from other groups in public sector schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.9/2">The Gurkha pension scheme pays pensions earlier than the armed forces pension scheme. This is because Gurkhas are unlikely to work again in Nepal unlike their British counterparts, in the UK. For example, a Gurkha Rifleman or Corporal with 15 years service (approximately 85 per cent. of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60. Like any pension scheme, the earlier the benefits are paid the lower the annual payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.9/3">It has been estimated that the cost of increasing the annual pension payments for Gurkhas who served prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> to the amount received by their UK equivalents would be &pound;1.5 billion over 20 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.665W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>, the Access to Justice Act 1999 came into force and established the community legal service (CLS) in place of the previous civil legal aid scheme. The financial eligibility criteria for legal help and for legal representation through the CLS were set out in the Community Legal Service (Financial) Regulations 2000, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>. The financial criteria were substantially amended by the Community Legal Service (Financial) (Amendment No.3) Regulations 2001, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-03">3 December 2001</phrase>. This brought about the simplification of the means test, with the introduction of a gross income limit and disposable income calculation based on a small number of targeted allowances. The financial eligibility limits are increased from time to time in line with inflation. From April 2005, the income limits for legal help and legal representation were aligned. At the same time the disposable capital limit for legal help was increased from &pound;3,000 to &pound;8,000, and we allowed the disposable income limit to be waived for victims of domestic violence seeking protection from harm. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-09">9 April 2007</phrase> we extended this so that both income and capital limits could be waived for these domestic violence victims. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> we increased the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid by 5 per cent.</p>

Differences in the size of the electorate in each constituency may occur since the Boundary Commission may depart from strict application of the rules in specified circumstances, for example, where special geographical considerations apply or to take account of any local ties which would be broken by boundary changes. The rules require the Boundary Commission when carrying out a review to use the number of electors whose names appear on the register of parliamentary electors in force on the date on which the notice of the start of the review is published.</p>

	<p pid="b.668W.3/1">The UK Government must be satisfied that its laws are compatible with the provisions of the Convention before it can make any decision to sign and then ratify the Convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June 2009</phrase>, the Prime Minister announced that the UK Government intended to reduce the time taken to open official records to the public from 30 to 20 years, and to make two amendments to the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to ensure that information access arrangements allow essential constitutional relationships and conventions to be preserved. These proposed amendments would have an impact upon our freedom of information legislation and so must first be carefully assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.3/3">The UK's freedom of information regime is among the most open and rigorous in the world. It already goes further than the standards of the Convention in a number of areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.683W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government collect statistics on renewable heat generation in total (c.f. Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) 2008, table 7.6 &quot;renewable sources used to generate electricity and heat and for transport fuels&quot;) but these figures are not broken down across industrial sectors. This table shows that the total amount of renewable heat generated across the UK economy was 8.48 TWh in 2007 (most recent year available), 7.51 TWh in 2006 and 6.97 TWh in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/3">Renewable heat is also produced by combined heat and power (CHP) plants that use renewable fuels, and the data on these&mdash;on a whole-economy basis&mdash;are presented in table 6.6 of DUKES. This shows that in 2007 out of a total of 53,050 GWh of heat generated by CHP plants in the UK 992 GWh came from those using renewable fuels i.e. almost 2 per cent. A significant percentage of these plants will be within the industrial sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/4">The September 2008 edition of BERR's 'Energy Trends' publication had a special feature &quot;Estimates of Heat Use in the UK&quot; focussing on 2006. The figure for heat consumption by manufacturing industry<sup>(1)</sup> for that year was given (table 4) as 216 TWh [or 18,577 ktoe<sup>(2)</sup>], and it was noted that this did not include '2.3 TWh [198 ktoe] of renewable fuels (predominantly used for renewable heat)'. This would equate (assuming 100 per cent. heat use) to around 1.0 per cent. of total heat demand for this sector being met from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/5" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The definition of manufacturing industry used did not include mining and quarrying, recycling, the collection, purification and distribution of water, and construction.</p>
	<p pid="b.683W.2/6" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> Kilotonnes of oil equivalent. DUKES uses this unit; 1 tonne oil equivalent = 11.63 MWh.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.2/2">In 2001 guidance was issued to councils regarding the recording of deafblind registration. Where a person had a number of additional disabilities including deaf or hard of hearing, councils were advised to count these under the category of deaf and hard of hearing. Therefore in 1997, there may have been some people with multiple disabilities who may have been categorised as having a mental illness, learning or physical disabilities rather than in the categories &quot;deaf&quot; or &quot;hard of hearing&quot;.</p>

			<tr pid="b.696W.2/11"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. The high proportion of deliveries with an unknown length of gestation recorded needs to be taken into account when interpreting the rates of deliveries for each gestation group.<br/> 2. <i> Length of gestation:</i> This field shows the number of completed weeks of gestation according to the World Health Organisation definition, which specifies time from the first day of the last menstrual period. If this date is not reliable, an estimate is provided. This item appears for each baby on multiple birth delivery records; 0-36 weeks premature birth; 37+ weeks (includes post term births); and unknown.<br/> 3. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE):</i> An FCE is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. However, the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. Maternity events taking place in either NHS hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary 'delivery' or 'birth' episodes. 'Other delivery events' are delivery events other than those resulting in delivery or birth episodes under NHS funding or in any other facility supplied under a service agreement with the NHS.<br/> 4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 5. <i> Data quality:</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. <i> Hospital providers: </i>A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). TCs (also known as diagnostic centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some TCs are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per trust, 'T1', 'T2', 'T3' etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an 'X'. <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.</td> </tr>

We have recently introduced two innovative products into the HomeBuy range in response to the current difficulties which potential buyers are experiencing as a result of the restrictions on the global supply of credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.3/2">Our Rent to HomeBuy product allows households to rent a home from a housing association at below market rent for up to five years, enabling them to save for a deposit. The HomeBuy Direct scheme provides purchasers with an equity loan of up to 30 per cent. to purchase a newly built home from participating developers on specific sites. The loan is funded jointly by the developer and Government.</p>

(The Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004, requires local authorities to assess the risk of emergencies occurring and to maintain plans for managing these risks.)</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.5/3">The Audit Commission works with partner inspectorates (i.e. HM Inspectorate for Constabularies, the Care Quality Inspectorate, HM Inspectorate of Prisons; HM Inspectorate of Probation and Ofsted) to assess the performance of local services in England through the Comprehensive Area Assessment. For those organisations that are inspected both sector specific and multi-agency performance is assessed. This includes assessment against National Indicator 37, which assesses how aware the general public are of what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.709W.5/4">The CCA Implementation team, within the Civil Contingencies Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, is responsible for running a CCA performance development and compliance work stream. An 'Expectation and Indicators of Good Practice Set for Category 1 and 2 Responders' has been published which sets out what is expected of those responsible for preparing for emergencies (including local authorities) and outlines mandatory requirements.

	<p pid="b.722W.2/1">The Home Office allocated &pound;25,000 a year from 2003-04 to each crime disorder and reduction partnership (CDRP) in West Midlands which includes Tamworth and Staffordshire, as a contribution towards funding ASB co-ordinator posts. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supported the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs). As of 2008-09, Home Office funding for local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour now form part of the general area-based grant (ABG) paid by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This funding has been renewed for the period 2008-11 and it is for local partnerships to agree how the grants received should be allocated against locally determined priorities, including tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/2">Respect Programmes in the West Midlands have also had an impact on antisocial behaviour. These programmes, now the responsibility of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, were designed to kick-start a change in the way the area worked to tackle antisocial behaviour. Other Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example, the introduction of community support officers in the West Midlands, including Staffordshire but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.2/3">Similarly, other programmes and services contribute, sometimes indirectly, to tackling antisocial behaviour, including diversionary activities for young people, neighbourhood wardens, as well as neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood management.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated July 2009:</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question asking what estimate has been made of the Muslim population of Britain in each year since 1979. (284443)</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/5" class="indent">The Census is the most commonly used source for statistics on religion by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with more recent information on religious affiliation (that is the identification with a religion irrespective of actual practice or belief) from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The way people respond to questions on religion is sensitive to what question is asked and how it is asked. Therefore because of differences between the Census and LFS in terms of question design and also coverage of the type of establishments in which people reside, data from these two sources cannot be compared.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/6" class="indent">The 2001 Census was the first time that a religion question had been asked in the England and Wales (and Scotland) census, and revealed that 1,589,000 people in Great Britain identified as Muslim in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/7" class="indent">A question on religious affiliation was introduced into the LFS in Great Britain in Spring 2002 using an extended version of the wording used in the England and Wales Census, but was not asked of people aged 16 and under until 2004. Consequently the earliest suitable estimates are from 2004 which cover people of all ages, and are shown in Table 1 attached.</p>
	<p pid="b.736W.2/8" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is included at Table 1.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.0/1">We intend to tackle the issues raised in the question as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/2"><i> </i><i> (a)</i> Section 15 of the Children and Young Persons Act places a duty on local authorities to arrange for all looked after children to be visited by a representative of theirs and for all looked-after-children to have available to them advice, support and assistance when they seek it. We shall be issuing regulations about how local authorities should discharge its duties under this section. We intend to impose a general minimum requirement setting the frequency of social work visits to looked-after-children and we will specify in addition that visits should also take place at the request of the child or their carer. We will be consulting on draft regulations and guidance including the frequency of visits in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/3"><i> (b)</i> We will also be using new regulations to broaden the categories of children who could be provided with an independent visitor. Care experienced adults might well make very suitable independent visitors for looked-after-children and we will consider them alongside other options.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/4"><i> </i><i> (c)</i> Section 8 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 sets out the considerations that local authorities must have regard to when they are considering making a placement for a looked-after-child. We will be strengthening regulations and guidance so that all placement decisions must be based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the individual child concerned which, for some children is likely to result in a placement away from their home community and out of their local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/5"><i> </i><i> (d)</i> Our strengthened regulations and guidance will say that every looked-after-child must have a care plan based on thorough detailed assessment setting out how the local authority intends to respond to their needs. All care plans must take into account the child's wishes and feelings. Plans to re-unify looked-after-children with their families must take account of children's safety and include an assessment of how the child and their family's circumstances have changed so that their parents are able to resume the child's care.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/6"><i> </i><i> (e)</i> Section 10 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 specifically strengthens the role of the independent reviewing officer (IRO) by:</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/7" class="indent">Making it clear that one of the IRO's core responsibilities is to ensure that children and young people are able to contribute meaningfully to their care plan and its reviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/8" class="indent">Imposing a new legal duty on IROs to ensure that due consideration is given by the local authority to the child's wishes and feelings.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/9" class="indent">Ensure that each child will have a named IRO, so that a child can be confident that one person will offer continuity and have oversight of their case.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.0/10">Through new regulations and guidance, we intend to specify that every child must have their own named IRO and that IROs must meet with the young person in advance of the review meeting. This is to ensure that they understand the purpose of the review and are given the opportunity to fully contribute to the discussion about the plan for their future care. Every review should provide a real opportunity to scrutinise the child's care plan to ensure that it continues to offer an appropriate response to the full range of their needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.758W.5/2">The Quality Protects Management Information project was the responsibility of the then Secretary of State for Health when the original Integrated Children's System (ICS) requirements were developed between 2001 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/3">10 consultation events were held in 2000 with over 500 representatives from organisations responsible for child welfare in England and Wales, including local authority social services departments, private and voluntary agencies, the then Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, pilot post-qualifying child care courses, software houses, and a number of other interested individuals. Two additional events in Wales drew together an inter-agency audience in the context of the Children First programme. As part of the consultation exercise, specific groups consulted included foster carers, children, young people, families with disabled children and families from ethnic minority groups. Information on exactly how many meetings were held with either local authorities or frontline social workers or on how many local authority officers and frontline social workers were consulted at each stage of development is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/4">Following this exercise, the Department of Health (DH) published the conceptual framework for ICS as a consultation document (&quot;Integrated Children's System: Working with Children in Need and Their Families&quot;) addressed to Councils with Social Services Responsibilities (CSSRs) in December 2002. DH and the Welsh Assembly Government addressed a further consultation document (&quot;Information Outputs for Children's Social Services A Conceptual Framework&quot;) to CSSRs in March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/5">The commercial systems suppliers consulted by DH were OLM, Anite, Careworks, and TCO. Anite's ICS interests were purchased in 2008 by Northgate; TCO was acquired in 2005 by CACI.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/6">Following machinery of Government changes in 2003, the Department for Children, Schools and Families took responsibility for ICS. Capgemini consultants were contracted by DCSF to conduct a readiness review of local authorities' ICS preparedness in 2006. These consultants were then retained to prepare industry-standard requirements documentation, in response to feedback from local authorities during the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.5/7">Correspondence with IT suppliers contracting for ICS systems is the responsibility of those individual local authorities which either are, or might wish to become, their customers. The Department's direct relations with these suppliers concern product assessment activities undertaken to assist local authorities in light of the readiness review. The results of these assessments have all been published on the Department's website at</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.2/1">We do not hold a definitive list of field forces focused on school standards. One of the principal field forces in this area is the national strategies, which has a wide remit for raising standards of achievement and rates of progression for children and young people in all phases of schools and early years settings. Its principal remit is to support both schools and local authorities to improve teaching and learning, and to develop strategies for whole school improvement. The cost of this field force is given within our answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-24">24 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/2">In our answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April</phrase> we estimated a figure of around &pound;90 milliom in 2008-09 to cover all field force advisers that work directly with LAs and Children's Trust partners. It is difficult to provide a precise breakdown of expenditure on each of these, since they are delivered through a range of mechanisms&mdash;some are directly contracted (so the cost of advisors is incorporated within a larger contract), some are located in Government Offices as secondees, and some are employed directly by DCSF or its NDPBs. However, based on the information available, our estimate of the largest (in terms of 2008-09 expenditure) 10 field forces working directly with LAs and Children's Trust partners are listed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/3" class="indent">National Strategies Regional and Local Advisers, &pound;30 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/4" class="indent">Partnership for Schools Employed and Contracted Advisers c&pound;10 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/5" class="indent">Sure Start Children's Centres Advisers, c&pound;8 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/6" class="indent">Extended Services Support Advisers, c&pound;6 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/7" class="indent">TDA Regional Advisers, c&pound;5 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/8" class="indent">Children's Services Advisers (in Government Offices), c&pound;4 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/9" class="indent">Together for Disabled Children, advising on short-breaks and parent forums for disabled children and their families, c&pound;3 million</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.2/10" class="indent">14-19 Regional Field Workers, c&pound;3 million</p>
