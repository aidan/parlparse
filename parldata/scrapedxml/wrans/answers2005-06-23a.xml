	<p pid="a.1119W.3/1">During 2002&ndash;03 the Environment Agency carried out a desk based ranking exercise on the 500 pharmaceuticals most commonly used in England and Wales in order to prioritise those of environmental significance. This exercise included fluoxetine, more commonly known under the trade name Prozac. A short, targeted monitoring programme was then set up for 12 pharmaceuticals. Fluoxetine was not included because no analytical method suitable for use on environmental samples existed and development of one would be difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.3/2">The top ranked antidepressant was lofepramine and this was included in the monitoring survey. Lofepramine was not detected in any of the five sewage works effluents or receiving watercourses monitored. However, it does not necessarily follow that the same would be true for fluoxetine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.3/3">The Environment Agency have developed a Position Statement on Pharmaceuticals&mdash;which can be found on the agency's website, <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a> (search-pharmaceuticals). This elaborates further on the work done and includes a recommendation to the pharmaceutical industry to do more on the development of analytical methods for environmental monitoring. I am pleased that the Environment Agency is in discussion with the industry on the development of a work programme to cover the recommendations to industry listed in the Position Statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124W.0/1">The objective of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges. The directive does not however set specific standards for the condition of inland and coastal waters into which waste water is discharged. Rather, it includes requirements to put in place sewage collecting systems, and sets standards for the treatment of sewage at sewage treatment works. Treatment standards and deadlines are set according to the size of the population served and the sensitivity of waters receiving the discharges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/2">The sewage collection system serving London is a combined system which collects both domestic and industrial waste water, and rainwater run-off. The directive acknowledges that it is not possible in practice to construct combined collecting systems and treatment plants to deal with all waste water during situations such as unusually heavy rainfall. Consequently the directive requires the limitation of pollution of receiving waters due to storm water overflows according to best technical knowledge not entailing excessive cost. The system along the tidal Thames has combined sewer overflows which operate to prevent flooding and sewage treatment works from becoming overloaded during wet weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/3">The estimated volumes of sewage pumped to the river during some wet weather conditions in the following table are taken from pumping station records from the five largest pumping stations that discharge to the Thames Tideway. These are the only &quot;overflow&quot; points that have records of discharge volumes and are considered to be responsible for approximately 60 per cent. of the overflow discharges to the tideway in wet weather. The remaining 40 per cent. come from other pumping stations and gravity sewers. These percentages will vary considerably depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall across London as well as other factors such as tidal state.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124W.0/26">The pollution of the tidal Thames by storm water overflows and compliance with the standards of legislation for continuous discharges is of considerable concern to this Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/27">Since 2000 Thames Water, the Environment Agency, Defra, the Greater London Authority and the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) have been involved in a strategic study of the environmental impact of intermittent storm sewage (sewage and rainwater run-off) discharges to the Thames Tideway. The remit of the study was to identify objectives for improvement, and to propose potential solutions, having regard to costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/28">Since June 2004 five meetings of the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Steering Group have been held with my officials in attendance. The Greater London Authority representative did not attend one of the five meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/29">The strategic study has developed three principal objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/30" class="indent">to protect the ecology of the tideway;</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/31" class="indent">to reduce the aesthetic pollution due to sewage-derived litter; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/32" class="indent">to protect the health of recreational water users.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/33">With regard to the assessment of the River Thames against these objectives the information can be found in the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Steering Group Report at <a href="http://www.thamestidewavstrategicstudy.co.uk">www.thamestidewavstrategicstudy.co.uk</a>. Defra has not made a separate assessment of the level of pollution of the Thames.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/34">We consider that the proposal arising from the interim report of the group for a large 35 km interceptor tunnel needs further investigation&mdash;it would take about 15 years to implement and cost in the order of &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124W.0/35">My officials and the Thames Tideway Strategic Study Steering Group are carrying out further consideration of the issues and possible appropriate smaller-scale measures which may be able to deliver needed improvements sooner than could be delivered by the proposed tunnel. The report of the further findings and options presented, which is expected soon, will be carefully considered by Ministers and a decision will be taken on an appropriate course of action to be taken to meet our obligations to protect the environment in a cost effective way. No options including the interceptor tunnel are being ruled out at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.1131W.3/1">The Government are negotiating with our EU partners to achieve a reduced rate of VAT for repairs to listed places of worship. The Listed Places of Worship Grant scheme is due to continue until March 2008, unless a reduced rate is achieved earlier. The Government recognises the importance of these buildings within their communities and that the need to use specialist craftsmen and costly materials means that their upkeep can be a heavy burden, particularly on small congregations. The same considerations do not apply to all listed buildings. Approved alterations to certain charity, or residential, listed buildings are VAT zero-rated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.9/2">The modelling and analysis supporting the White Paper was based on DTI's May 2004 long-term modelling assumptions for crude oil of $23 a barrel (2003 prices) in 2010 rising to almost $28 a barrel by 2020. This was consistent with assumptions used by the International Energy Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.9/3">A good deal of uncertainty surrounds all transport projections. At present, developments in the oil market are injecting a major element of uncertainty. Sustained higher oil prices would imply lower traffic growth. If crude oil prices were to end up around US$5 a barrel higher in real terms in 2010 than assumed, we expect traffic projections would fall by around 1 per cent.</p>

Unsurprisingly, given this, the UN's 2004 chart shows that this region is not on track to meet the universal primary education Millennium Development Goal (MDG) by 2015 without dramatically scaled up efforts.

	<p pid="a.1138W.5/1">At their meeting on 10/<phrase class="date" code="">11 June</phrase>, the G8 Finance Ministers re-affirmed their commitment to the full implementation and financing of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. They also agreed a new proposal to cancel 100 per cent. of qualifying HIPCs' debts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank and the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank (AfDB).</p>
	<p pid="a.1138W.5/2">The proposal, to be presented to the Boards of the World Bank, IMF and AfDB, would cancel up to $55 billion worth of debt for 38 countries. Eighteen countries, 14 of which are in Africa, would immediately be eligible for this relief, as they have completed the HIPC process. They would benefit from up to $40 billion worth of debt cancellation. The G8 proposal will therefore free up substantial additional resources for spending on health, education and infrastructure and to help countries meet the Millennium Development Goals. The mechanism by which qualifying HIPC countries would receive this new multilateral debt relief would be by adjusting these countries' gross assistance flows by the amounts forgiven. Details of the proposal are still being worked out, so it is not yet possible to give precise figures of the net benefits to individual countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138W.5/3">An additional nine African HIPCs are expected to complete the HIPC process over the next year or two. They would then also qualify for assistance under the new proposal. A further nine African countries have been identified as eligible for HIPC. However, conflict and governance concerns are hampering their progress through the HIPC process. As and when they complete the HIPC initiative, they would also qualify for assistance under this new deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138W.5/4">The G8 Finance Ministers have agreed that G8 countries will provide their share of the finances needed to cover the cost of this debt relief. Therefore in addition to the proposed debt stock cancellation, the additional resources donors provide as compensation to the World Bank and AfDB would be channelled through IDA and the African Development Fund to benefit all recipient countries.</p>

HPSS employers have been instructed to take measures to minimise the risk of violent attacks against staff. Figures reported for the six months from October 2004 to March 2005 indicate a reduction in the number of reported incidents; 149 fewer than in the previous six months. This indicates that the steps taken by HPSS employers are having a positive effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.1173W.0/1">The Skills Strategy clearly set out the need to rebalance the contributions of employers, individuals and the public purse towards the costs of learning. We have been clear about our priorities of a place in school, college or an apprenticeship for all young people, and a focus on adults without a solid foundation of employability skills. Within an overall increased budget, these will be the focus for public funding. We will continue to provide fee concessions arrangements for learners on means tested benefits to access FE but we expect colleges to increase their total fee income, including collecting the income they currently chose to waive at their own discretion. These are not just technical funding changes. They are the first step in a necessary change of culture and expectations, where the value of learning and the benefits it brings to learners and to employers is properly recognised as a worthwhile and necessary investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176W.6/1">In 2005&ndash;06 recurrent funding through the schools formula spending share has increased in Lancashire by 7.0 per cent. per pupil and its total SFSS has risen to &pound;555.1 million. The funding that individual schools receive is a matter for the local authority through its locally agreed funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176W.6/2">As far as schools capital funding is concerned, &pound;31.2 million has been allocated to Lancashire local authority and schools for the year 2005&ndash;06. Indicative allocations of &pound;35.6 million and &pound;37.2 million have been made for the years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 respectively. These allocations will be utilised in accordance with the local authority and schools' asset management plans, taking account of changes in school population within the local authority area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1179W.2/41">Figures are not available before 1999&ndash;2000. Borrowers enter repayment status in the April following graduation or otherwise leaving their course. Data are not available centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.2/42">The introduction of loans for variable fees of up to &pound;3,000 will increase the amount the average student is able to borrow but not all will take up their full loan entitlement. Those receiving the new maintenance grants and university bursaries can use them if they wish to reduce their overall debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.2/43">Changes to maintenance loans levels could reduce rather than increase student indebtedness for many poorer students. Although maintenance loans will rise in 2006/07 to reflect the median of essential living costs expenditure recorded in the SIES 2002/03, a bigger change will be the substitution of a significant part of the new &pound;2,700 maintenance grant for maintenance loans for lower income students, reducing the need to borrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.2/44">We will be monitoring changes in borrowing patterns as the new student support arrangements come in. Whatever a student's circumstances, no student from 2006/07 has to pay fees upfront and the arrangements for repayment of maintenance and fee loans are fair and equitable. The graduate's repayments are at zero real rate of interest, related directly to earnings and only required when earnings are greater than &pound;15,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.2/45">DfES does not hold information on borrowers in repayment status at an individual student level; therefore we are unable to calculate a median amount of debt.</p>
