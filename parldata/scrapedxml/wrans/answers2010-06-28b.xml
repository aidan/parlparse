	<p pid="b.354W.7/1">The Government are committed to increasing the amount of renewable heat in the UK; this is a crucial part of ensuring we meet our renewables targets, cutting carbon and ensuring energy security. We are currently looking at the renewable heat incentive (RHI) proposals. Clearly there are benefits to the scheme, but we must also consider the impact of the costs, particularly given the financial constraints we must work within and the potential impact that funding options could have on vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="b.354W.7/2">However, I can confirm that renewable heat installations supported now by energy supplier subsidy under CERT would not be precluded from any future support scheme for renewable heat, though will of course have to meet its requirements.

	<p pid="b.355W.2/1">Any public body which in 2008 had at least one half-hourly electricity meter settled on the half hourly market is required to register for the scheme. Of those that register, those that meet the 6,000MWh qualification threshold will be required to participate in the scheme. In addition all UK Government Departments, the Scottish Administration, the Welsh Assembly Government and Northern Ireland Departments must all participate in the CRC scheme regardless of electricity usage. The precise number of public bodies which meet these criteria will not be known until the close of the registration period on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase>. The Environment Agency estimates that 1,100 public bodies will be participants in the scheme. Other registered public sector bodies must make a simple information disclosure at registration at the start of each phase of the scheme</p>
	<p pid="b.355W.2/2">Participants meeting the qualification threshold must pay a one-off registration fee of &#163;950 and an annual subsistence fee of &#163;1,290. Organisations which make a simple information disclosure are not required to pay these fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.355W.2/3">The annual cost to a participant from allowance purchases will depend on their total emissions, as well as their position in the league table. Their emissions will depend among other things on the organisation's size and measures introduced to improve their energy efficiency. All of the revenues raised from the Government sale of allowances will be returned to participants, so that those whose energy efficiency scores are highest will receive a bonus. Because of these uncertainties, Government have not estimated the cost to the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.359W.0/1">The newest strand of Environmental Stewardship is Uplands Entry Level Stewardship. This was launched in February and welcomed by a number of farming groups. Some representations have recently been made about the requirement for tenant farmers with lets of less than five years to have their application countersigned by their landlord. However, this requirement is necessary to meet European Union rules governing land management under agri-environment, and to ensure sufficient time for the accrual of environmental benefits and make the scheme effective. DEFRA has worked closely with industry and environmental groups throughout the scheme development, and guidance has been published jointly with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to support tenants and landlords considering joining Uplands ELS.</p>

	<p pid="b.371W.8/1">Lottery distributors' administration costs can be found in their annual reports and accounts but, for the convenience of the right hon. Member's researchers, are reproduced as follows. However, they are not recorded on a consistent basis making direct comparison between distributors difficult. Reducing these costs and ensuring more money gets to the good causes is a priority for the Government. The first step will be working with the lottery distributors over the coming months to develop a uniform and transparent measure of administrative costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.372W.2/2">The Creative Partnerships programme is delivered by Creativity, Culture and Education (CCE). Following the &#163;19 million post-election cut to Arts Council England's 2010-11 grant in aid by DCMS, the Arts Council has reduced 2010-11 funding to CCE by 4%. This is in line with its own budget reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.372W.2/3">CCE has stated that it will absorb the cut within the organisation without impacting on the schools and children involved in the Creative Partnerships creative learning programme. Therefore this should not have any impact on the National Museum of Liverpool.</p>

Figures are available on the number of new build starts that took place under the National Affordable Housing Programme (NAHP), Local Authority New Build (LANB), Kickstart and the Property and Regeneration (PR) programmes. However, it is not possible to assess whether some of these housing starts would have been delivered by the private sector anyway if funding were not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.377W.0/3">Data underlying the official statistics published by the Homes and Communities Agency have been analysed to identify new build starts on site with public funding under the programmes identified above. This shows there were 45,600 housing starts in 2009 with grant funding under NAHP, LANB and PR programmes. In addition a further 840 units were started with assistance from the Kickstart programme. These estimates cannot be directly compared with figures on the total number of house building starts collected by CLG as they are from different sources.</p>

However, the Department has estimated that, in 2009, every &#163;1 million of investment in home refurbishment supported 17 net jobs for a year. This figure takes account of direct jobs supported in the industry and indirect (supply chain) jobs. It also takes account of displacement effects, where increased investment in housing refurbishment takes investment (and associated jobs) away from other parts of the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.387W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what policies and practices are in place to ensure vulnerable people who apply for Employment and Support Allowance and are found fit for work receive benefits to which they are entitled. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/4" class="indent">People of working age who are found fit for work receive a letter telling them that they are no longer entitled to Employment and Support Allowance. The letter also explains that the decision can be looked at again, and that Employment and Support Allowance may continue pending an appeal to an independent tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/5" class="indent">They are also advised that they may be able to claim Jobseeker's Allowance if they are unemployed and are given information on how to make a claim. Claims for Jobseeker's Allowance are normally made by telephone through our contact centre network or on-line through the Directgov Internet site. For those who are unable to use a telephone or computer Jobcentre Plus has arrangements in place to provide a face-to-face claim service at the nearest Jobcentre.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/6" class="indent">To be eligible for Jobseeker's Allowance people generally have to be available immediately for work for 40 hours per week and take steps each week to actively seek work. However, easements within the Jobseeker's Allowance rules allow our advisers to take account of physical or mental health conditions when considering whether the steps taken to seek work in any week are reasonable. Similarly, they can consider reasonable limitations in availability for work, taking account of physical or mental condition. This could affect the type of work which a customer could undertake, the number of hours they could work each week or the distance they are able to travel to take work. As you would expect, our advisors will discuss all the available options with each person on an individual basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/7" class="indent">We also have specialist Disability Employment Advisers in each district who have in-depth knowledge of the locally available programmes and services for those with disabilities.

For 2012-13 and in subsequent years decisions about rates of benefit and pensions will be decided in light of actual earnings and price growth as part of the normal budget process. There is a statutory requirement that the pension credit standard minimum guarantee will be uprated in least in line with earnings.</p>

	<p pid="b.397W.0/1">In the coming months the Department for International Development (DFID) will be reviewing its aid programme to determine how we can achieve better value for money for the taxpayer and accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="b.397W.0/2">Maternal health and women's rights are major priorities for the UK Government and an area which the Prime Minister has personally championed. We want to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to modern family planning methods and promoting women's choice in the developing world. The recent G8 Summit, which the Prime Minister attended, has delivered a significant boost to efforts to improve maternal and child health. It is estimated that the G8 Muskoka Initiative will prevent 1.3 million under five child deaths, 64,000 maternal deaths and enable an additional 12 million women to have access to modern family planning in the period 2010-15.</p>

Transitional HIV care should be provided as part of an HIV clinical network and take account of guidance produced by the British HIV Association and the Children's HIV Association.

	<p pid="b.406W.5/1">The Government's review of spending decisions taken since <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year was to ensure that all the schemes considered were affordable, good value for money and consistent with the Government's priorities. The proposed hospital building scheme for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS foundation trust was assessed against a number of other such NHS build projects at the same stage of development. The announcement of its cancellation formed part of the statement given by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/2">Where major NHS service changes are proposed, they must meet the strengthened criteria for such decisions as set out in a letter from the NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson of <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-20">20 May</phrase> to Monitor and all NHS chief executives. This is to ensure that, in future, all service changes must be led by clinicians and patients and not be driven from the top down.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/3">In these harder economic times it is essential that all major hospital building projects must be affordable and provide value for money for the taxpayer. For foundation trusts in particular, all proposals must be consistent with their independent status in terms of their reduced reliance on departmental support. As a foundation trust, North Tees and Hartlepool has borrowing powers and other mechanisms available to it to fund alternative capital investment plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/4">The trust will have incurred costs in working up the proposals, in developing the business case and in performing the feasibility studies behind it. As an independent foundation trust this information is a matter for Monitor (the statutory name for the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) and may be obtained by writing to the chairman of Monitor.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/5">The business case approved in March 2010 anticipated a request from the trust to the Department for &#163;8 million to buy the land on the Wynyard Park site for the new hospital. This request was received and met by the Department. If the trust acquired land for which it has no further use than it can be sold to recover the funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/6">The local strategic health authority and primary care trust have both pledged to continue working closely with all local NHS organisations to plan and develop the best possible health services for the population of Hartlepool and North Tees and to ensure that the wider 'Momentum Project7-involving bringing health care services closer to communities-will continue.</p>

This advice formed the basis of the 'Momentum: Pathways to Healthcare programme' which was developed by the local national health service to provide a new health care system for the people of Stockton, Hartlepool, Easington and Sedgefield. We understand that NHS Hartlepool and NHS Stockton-on-Tees will continue to work closely with North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust on delivering the wider Momentum programme, and will be discussing the options available with the trust.</p>

Access to this speed would be dependent on distance from the exchange, peak time use and wiring in the home. There is also wireless provision in this constituency, which would potentially enable more households and businesses to have access to a 2 Mbps service. Only a physical test of a line would determine its actual service performance in each case.</p>

It is for the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to make decisions on the future allocation of student numbers in line with their established criteria. A range of higher education courses are available in Hartlepool. Cleveland College of Art and Design has a site in Hartlepool dedicated to higher education provision which is validated by Teesside University. In addition, Hartlepool Sixth Form College and Hartlepool College of FE have seen significant growth in higher education numbers over the last few years. Hartlepool Sixth Form College delivers provision franchised from the University of Sunderland, while Hartlepool College of FE works with both the University of Sunderland and the Teesside University. Hartlepool College of FE is also in the process of building a new state-of-the-art college on the existing town centre site. I look forward to the completion of this new college and welcome the contribution made by all three colleges in Hartlepool.</p>

	<p pid="b.423W.2/2">Local Government, like the rest of the public sector is being asked to make a contribution to the &#163;6.2 billion of cross Government savings in 2010-11. This will enable the Government to take immediate action to tackle the UK's unprecedented deficit inherited from the previous. Where revenue grants have been reduced, no local authority will face a reduction of more than 2%. Sheffield will see a reduction of 1%in their overall funding from Central Government in 2010-11. The Government have also announced further removal from ring fencing of central government revenue and capital grants. This gives councils extra flexibility to make decisions about where savings are found. It is for local authorities to manage the reduction across all their funding sources to protect frontline services. This flexibility means that reductions in spending could be managed without a reduction in jobs or frontline services.</p>

Member on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-07">7 June</phrase>, which is now in the Libraries, confirms that we are committed to ensuring that the Department does not make unaffordable promises for the future, and that spending is focused on priorities that best support the coalition Government's two primary educational objectives-raising standards for all and narrowing the gap between rich and poor. Having examined the options in depth, The Secretary of State has decided that we will not be able to proceed with the free school meal pilots that were due to start in September this year, nor the extension of free school meals to some primary school children this year. We will continue the existing pilots in Durham, Newham and Wolverhampton so as to assess better the case for increasing eligibility in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.424W.3/1">Proprietors of academies and independent schools are subject to a vetting process at the initial application stage which examines whether they are a fit and proper person to run a school. This includes an enhanced CRB check and background suitability checks which includes the activities of the organisation/individuals. Individuals may be prohibited from taking part in the management of an independent school on grounds relating to misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="b.424W.3/2">State-funded independent schools will be established as academies, and all proposals to establish such schools will be subject to similar rigorous checks. Generally, the Secretary of State would expect that all proposals will comply with all aspects of the rigorous suitability and vetting tests throughout the application process, including due diligence and CRB checks and will reject any proposers who advocate violence, intolerance, hatred or whose ideology runs counter to the UK's democratic values. Where there are serious concerns about the quality of leadership and management provided by a governing body in maintained schools, local authorities currently have statutory powers to intervene in certain circumstances. These powers can include appointing additional governors to a school or applying to the Secretary of State for permission to replace the governing body with an Interim Executive Board to lead the changes required in the school.</p>

	<p pid="b.440W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the average income of an individual was in each parliamentary constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber in each of the last five years (4359).</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.2/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the estimated average net weekly equivalised household income in each parliamentary constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber, both before and after housing costs, in 2007/08, the latest year for which data are available and for 2004/05, the year previous to 2007/08 for which data are available. Incomes are presented net of income tax payments, National Insurance contributions and Council tax. The incomes are equivalised to take account of each household's size and composition, in recognition of how these affect their standard of living. Data for individuals are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.440W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates provided are based on small area statistics published by the ONS. They are classed as experimental statistics which means they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but have yet to be fully accredited as National Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.2/2">The Budget announced a package of measures to promote work, tackle welfare dependency and support the most vulnerable. The Budget will have a statistically insignificant impact, on child poverty over the next two years. For example, while child benefit was frozen for three years, the child element of the child tax credit will be increased by &#163;150 in 2011-12, and a further &#163;60 in 2012-13. These increases will happen above indexation.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.2/4">To ensure that pensioners on the lowest incomes benefit from the triple guarantee, the standard minimum income guarantee in pension credit will increase in April 2011 by the cash rise in a full basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/5">At Budget, we also announced a &#163;1,000 cash terms increase in the income tax personal allowance for those aged under 65, taking it from &#163;6,475 in 2010-11 to &#163;7,475 in 2011-12. It is estimated that this will remove 880,000 of the lowest income taxpayers from tax altogether and will benefit around 23 million basic rate taxpayers by up to &#163;170 per year compared to the previous Government's plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.2/1">To ensure support is better targeted at low-income families with children, the Government will freeze Child Benefit for three years and recycle the savings into significant increases to the Child Tax Credit. The Child Element of the Child Tax Credit will be increased by &#163;150 above indexation in 2011-12 and &#163;60 above indexation in 2012-13. As a result of this, the Budget will have no measurable negative impact on child poverty over the next two years.</p>
