Each proposal for a new technology group is considered and prioritised based on the potential to save carbon dioxide emissions and ease of incorporation within the scheme. To date we have not received any detailed or quantitative proposals to include kilns on the ETL from the relevant industry representatives and our own market assessment indicates that kilns offer relatively low EGA accessible abatement potential compared to other technologies not yet listed. Therefore we have no plans to undertake a detailed evaluation of kilns for the ETL at the moment.</p>

Current estimates for all types of wood waste vary from 1.9 to 7.5 million tonnes per annum. This includes municipal, commercial and industrial waste as well as that from construction and demolition. A significant proportion currently goes to landfill, which could be used instead as a valuable energy source. As part of the current review of the renewables obligation, the Government has just consulted on options for incentivising a broader range of mixed waste energy projects. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, is looking at the barriers to developing biomass energy and will recommend ways to overcome the problems. The use of wood waste as an energy source is one of the areas they are looking at and we will consider the way forward in the light of their recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1544W.2/4">A further table shows the number of defendants proceeded against for sexual offences in the Crown court by each of the relevant CPS units. The table also shows the proportion of cases resulting in an unsuccessful outcome and in a conviction. In total, 72 defendants were convicted for sexual offences: (59.5 per cent. of the total proceeded against).</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.2/5">All of the cases shown in the tables for crown court proceedings may be regarded as having been brought to court, with the exception of two cases in which a bench warrant for the arrest of the defendant remained unexecuted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.2/6">While CPS records provide an analysis of the number and the outcome of proceedings for sexual offences, these figures cannot be further disaggregated to show the outcome of proceedings for rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544W.2/7">Information from the Home Office Court Proceedings Database shows that in 2003, in the Teesside Crown Court, 28 defendants were proceeded against for rape of a male and rape of a female, of which nine were found guilty. Data for 2004 will be available in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1547W.0/1">The number of appeals which may be received following a revaluation are dependent upon a number of issues, which include the characteristics of the banding scheme, the extent of information provided to individual taxpayers about how their assessment has been arrived at, and also the level of payments to be made including whether any transitional relief scheme will apply. A number of these issues are currently under consideration by the Inquiry being undertaken by Sir Michael Lyons which is due to report in December 2005. It is therefore too speculative to provide estimates of appeal rates at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.1560W.2/1">One of the aims of the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) is to promote personal responsibility and financial inclusion. As such the majority of customers will receive their LHA direct, and make their own arrangements to pay their rent to their landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/2">However, in recognition of the risk that some tenants may struggle with this responsibility, safeguards have been put in place. Pathfinder authorities have the discretion to make the payment to the landlord in certain circumstances, where there is a history of vulnerability or failure to pay their rent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/3">The local authorities implementing LHA have received guidance on when paying LHA to the tenant is likely to be inappropriate, but have the discretion to decide each case on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.2/4">In addition, current regulations allow for housing benefit to be paid directly to the landlord where a tenant accrues at least eight weeks rent arrears; this provision is extended to the LHA scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1563W.5/1">There are no current plans to change the housing benefit single room rent restriction. However, under the local housing allowance, young people who would otherwise have been subject to the single room rent are entitled to the new shared room rate. This is based on a more generous definition than the existing single room rent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1565W.6/1">The development of Jobcentre Plus is building on the high quality service already provided by social security offices and Jobcentres. The new offices deliver a single, integrated service with a clear focus on work to all people of working age. As a result of a strong economy and our active labour market policies, we have record levels of employment and the lowest sustained levels of unemployment for 30 years. The new deal has helped well over a million people to find jobs, and is giving people in all areas of the country the help and support they need to move off benefits and into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1565W.6/2">The Jobcentre Plus client base has changed considerably over the past few years. Since May 1997 claimant unemployment has roughly halved and, as at April 2005, the UK claimant count stands at 839,400, down 782,200 (48 per cent.) since the 1997 election.

	<p pid="a.1565W.6/4">The number of lone parents on benefit is down 20 per cent. to 763,000. Youth claimant unemployment has fallen by two-fifths, to its lowest level for 30 years; the number of 18 to 24-year-old claimants unemployed for more than a year has fallen by over 90 per cent.; and long-term adult unemployment (two year plus) has been cut by three quarters to its lowest level for 30 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1566W.3/1">The Parliamentary Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service (OHSWS) have been recording cases of work-related stress as a separate category from other cases of stress only since the latter part of 2003; therefore accurate statistics are only available for 2004. In that year six cases were dealt with, representing approximately 0.38 per cent. of the House work force. Subsequent benchmarking has confirmed this to be a relatively low figure. Departments of the House and the OHSWS have proactively sought to support such staff, and consequent absence from work has been low. Long-term absence has been the exception rather than the rule. In most cases of reported stress, work is one of a number of contributory factors, including personal problems. No cases have resulted in civil action and resultant compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566W.3/2">Over the past year OHSWS have been leading a review of how the House manages and supports staff concerning issues of stress and wellbeing. Extensive research, benchmarking and gap analysis shows that appropriate support mechanisms are in place for staff. The House is committed to continuous improvement and implementing best practice, and the arrangements for minimising, recognising and managing stress at work are currently under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1566W.3/3">No estimate has been made of the cost of days lost as a result of work-related stress, or of the measures to deal with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1566W.7/1">Bullying is not a criminal offence, nor a clearly defined form of behaviour; there are various definitions that cover all forms of harassment, abuse or intimidation. Furthermore, complainants do not use a standard form of words and cases are recorded using the wording adopted by those making a complaint or seeking redress. Consequently, we are unable to identify every allegation, complaint or investigation that involves bullying without conducting a trawl of individual case records and archives, held in various databases and paper files. Our records do not lend themselves to the kind of analysis which these questions demand. Essentially, we would need to examine every case considered by the Army Board and make a judgment as to whether bullying or harassment were significant factors in the complaint. This would be extremely time consuming and it may not be immediately apparent whether this is the case or not. The scope for interpretation may also be quite wide. However, we have undertaken a rudimentary electronic search of our databases and spreadsheets to ascertain which complaints record allegations of bullying or harassment. This has highlighted eight cases, none of which relate to complaints upheld or partially upheld, by the Army Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.1568W.8/1">An Officers' Outfit Allowance is awarded on commissioning to allow officers to purchase their first uniform. Officers joining the majority of English and Welsh infantry regiments receive the standard allowance of &pound;2,122.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568W.8/2">For those joining certain regiments the allowance is adjusted in line with the type, and therefore cost, of their uniform, which varies across the Infantry. Those English, Welsh and Scottish infantry regiments where the Officers' Outfit Allowance differs from the standard rate are the Foot Guards (&pound;2,774), the Lowland Regiments (&pound;2,057), the Highland Regiments (&pound;2,510), the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Parachute Regiment (both &pound;2,032).</p>
	<p pid="a.1568W.8/3">The Officers' Outfit Allowance was raised to its current level in 1994.

	<p pid="a.1568W.8/4">Officers' uniforms do not have a specific life expectancy as such. All uniforms are chosen on the basis that they are hard wearing and suitable for the tasks demanded of them. Officers are expected to keep their uniform in good order and maintain and replace accordingly. To do this an annual tax credit is awarded, based on the initial Outfit Allowance. This allows officers to purchase a new Service uniform approximately every five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1569W.2/1">It is an essential, mandatory and routine requirement to operate a Royal Navy nuclear submarine, that a safety justification is maintained which demonstrates it is safe to do so. This requires any issues potentially affecting the safe operation of the submarine, including theoretical ones, to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569W.2/2">The theoretical safety concern on HMS Torbay and HMS Tireless centred on the potential effect of a number of small manufacturing imperfections in their nuclear reactor plant. A previous analysis had indicated that these imperfections were acceptable but a more modern analysis, using the latest information on material properties and component stress values, showed an increased theoretical risk of failure in some of these components. While there was no new defect, as part of the Royal Navy's commitment to safety, the decision was taken that the two submarines should not be operated further until the technical aspects had been fully examined and their continued safe operation could be justified. For HMS Torbay a safety justification is now in place to allow the operation of her nuclear reactor plant. The safety justification work required for HMS Tireless will be undertaken during her programmed maintenance and upgrade period, which is under way at Devonport.</p>

	<p pid="a.1572W.3/1">As biometric technology is constantly evolving and improving, it is not possible to give a precise estimate until technology performance requirements are established and equipment is procured for the Identity Card Scheme. The most recent research figures are from the UKPS biometric trial. However, this was not intended as a test of technology and the equipment used will have evolved significantly by the time the Identity Cards Scheme is introduced. Nevertheless, the trial did demonstrate that the number unable to record any biometric information is statistically small and special arrangements, including improved enrolment facilities are being considered for this group. Specifically, the result of this trial demonstrated that, of the total sample, 99.954 per cent. of participants could successfully record at least one biometric successfully. 0.29 per cent. of the entire sample were only able to record the facial biometric on its own. The following tables show the enrolment rates broken down by ethnicity, age and socio-economic group. References in the tables to the face failure rate refers only to the first attempt&mdash;virtually all individuals were successful after multiple attempts but these figures are not available in the report. The iris and fingerprint figures were for multiple attempts. In addition, the trial results provided some breakdowns for successful enrolment of each individual biometric by ethnicity, socio-economic group and age, although no breakdown provided for the provision of all three and there is no breakdown by occupation. Nor were there breakdowns for the requested groups for those who could provide no biometric information other than face. The relevant information which was recorded during the trial is shown in the following tables. Reference to face failure rate refers to only the first attempt&mdash;virtually all were successful after multiple attempts but no figures were provided in the evaluation report.</p>

	<p pid="a.1576W.5/1">According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) figures, the rate of return of displaced persons to their pre-war homes has dropped in the last five years, as most of those willing to return have now done so. The overall number of returns has. however, continued to increase slowly. By September last year, a million refugees and displaced people had returned to their homes, from an estimated 2.2 million displaced by the conflict of the 1990s.</p>

	<p pid="a.1576W.8/1">Of the approximately one million refugees and displaced people who had returned to their pre-war homes by January 2005, over 450,000 had returned to areas where they were not the ethnic majority. But there is more work to be done. Some minority returnees still face discrimination in access to jobs in public services and private employment and to education, health and social security. The failure to bring to justice all war crimes indictees has also reduced confidence in the return process. Economic development remains a priority to ensure the sustainable return of minority returnees.</p>

	<p pid="a.1579W.6/2">Strasbourg was chosen as a site for the European Parliament (EP) in 1958, well before the UK joined the EU. It was chosen as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation. While the Government believe that the splitting of the EP's sites is far from ideal, any change to the status quo would need the unanimous agreement of all 25 member states. That looks unlikely for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1582W.8/2">The first was on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-18">18 May</phrase>. when he accompanied a group of diplomats, members of international organisations and the media. Mr. Moran's lobbying had been instrumental in prompting the Uzbek authorities to organise this visit. The event was tightly controlled, and Mr. Moran was unable to engage members of the public. Having pressed Uzbek Deputy Foreign Minister Nematov on these restrictions. Mr. Moran secured agreement that he and EU colleagues could return unaccompanied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582W.8/3">On 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-27">27 May</phrase>, Mr. Moran returned to Andizhan. He visited the central Yangi bazaar, and the city's central square. There was a high security service presence, and members of the public appeared afraid to approach Mr. Moran. He had a similar experience at the Kyrgyz border near Pakhtaabad. and at the border town of Karasu. This represented a distinct change from public behaviour in early May. when people had gathered around the visiting Defence Attache&quot;'s car. and asked him to pass news of events in Andizhan outside Uzbekistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1583W.2/1">We were extremely disturbed by reports of Uzbek troops firing on demonstrators in Andizhan (Andijan). When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary first heard these reports, he urged the Uzbek Government to allow an independent, international investigation. We are pleased that the US, the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and NATO have all done the same. The UK was at the forefront in condemning the indiscriminate and disproportionate use offeree by the Uzbek Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.2/2">Islam Karimov, Uzbek President, responded to our repeated calls for an inquiry by creating a Parliamentary Committee to investigate the unrest. We, and our European Union (EU) partners, have made clear that we consider this an insufficient response. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June</phrase>, the General Affairs External Relations Council (GAERC) called on the Uzbek Government to reconsider its position, giving a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>. Failure to do so will lead to punitive EU measures, including partial suspension of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement (PCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.2/3">It is not possible to say how many people died during the unrest in Andizhan, but the recent OCSE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights' (ODIHR) report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-20">20 June</phrase>, estimated that between 300 and 500 were killed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585W.2/1">Change in the level of reporting of crime in Northern Ireland is most frequently measured by the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS), the most recent published results for which relate to the 1998, 2001 and 2003&ndash;04 sweeps. In addition, the 2000 International Crime Victim Survey (ICVS) compared crime reporting rates across 17 industrialised countries or regions, including Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585W.2/2">Although, typically, less than half of crime is reported to the police, Northern Ireland tends to have a higher reporting rate than England and Wales and it had the highest rate of all countries participating in the 2000 ICVS. Reporting rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including, changes in the level or mix of crime occurring or in the level of confidence in the police and the wider criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585W.2/3">Information from the NICS and ICVS on the levels of crime reported to the police is contained within the Northern Ireland Office Research and Statistical Bulletins 1/2001 International Crime Victimisation Survey 2000: Key Findings for Northern Ireland&quot; and 4/2005 Crime Victimisation in Northern Ireland: Findings from the 2003/04 Northern Ireland Crime Survey&quot;, copies of which are available from the House of Commons library.

	<p pid="a.1591W.2/2">Builders are not required to use particular details but the guidance in Approved Document L offers the use of robust details as a way of showing compliance. These were developed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with expert assistance and published by The Stationery Office. A new edition is planned to accompany the next amendment to Part L later this year. The new edition will include additional robust details, and the aim is to revise all the details to include more information and to facilitate their electronic transfer into builders' drawings. The accompanying design and construction guidance will also be improved and checklists added to assist compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1594W.6/1">The Government do not anticipate that there will be any significant switches in use of domestic fuel resulting directly from the proposed HIP energy reports. The energy reports will primarily provide information to a potential buyer on the energy efficiency of the home in question. The reports will also include recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of the energy performance of the building which if carried out, would have environmental benefits.</p>

The vial presentation of Actrapid insulin will remain available. We have not sought an alternative supplier for the items being discontinued as there remains a number of different insulins and delivery devices available from various manufacturers. It is up to the clinician, in consultation with the patient, to decide which is most suitable. We are in discussion with Novo Nordisk to ensure a smooth transfer for patients to alternative products. We have no plans to consult with other European governments on Novo Novalisk's intention to discontinue the supply of Actrapid insulin.</p>

All applications for asylum are considered individually and on their own merits by the Home Office in line with the United Kingdom's obligations under the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, any individual of any nationality who is found by the Home Office and the independent Immigration Appellate Authority not to be in need of asylum or international protection is expected to leave the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597W.5/2">Anyone is entitled to receive emergency or immediately necessary treatment to save life or to prevent a condition from becoming life-threatening, where in the clinical opinion of a health professional this is required. In the case of hospital treatment, however, they may be asked to pay for it if they are no longer eligible to receive it free of charge. A failed asylum seeker, who is receiving hospital treatment at the time their status was determined, will continue to receive that course of treatment free of charge until that course of treatment has been completed, or until they leave the country. Failed asylum seekers seeking routine elective hospital treatment will be expected to pay for it in the same way as any other chargeable overseas visitor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597W.5/3">General practices currently have the same discretion to accept or refuse applications from failed asylum seekers to join their lists of national health service patients as they have for applications from other people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606W.2/3">The national health service (charges to overseas visitors) regulations 1989, as amended, specify that anyone who is not ordinarily resident in the UK must be treated as an overseas visitor, and is liable to pay for any NHS hospital treatment received unless they meet one of the exemption criteria in the regulations. One such exemption covers the initial diagnostic testing for HIV/AIDS and any associated counselling, so that these are free to all irrespective of residency status. Subsequent treatment, however, should the test prove positive, is not free to all and an overseas visitor who is not otherwise exempt under one of the other criteria is expected to pay for any HIV/AIDS treatment they receive. This has been the case since these regulations first came into force.</p>

	<p pid="a.1607W.8/1">All national health service organisations, including ambulance trusts, should have systems in place to minimise the risk to patients from health care associated infections as required by Standards for Better Health (July 2004). Infection control policies and any particular precautions for reducing the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a matter for individual trusts. Advice on appropriate precautions to reduce the spread of infection has been published by the Department in the Health Service Circular 2000&ndash;02 and in Winning Ways&mdash;Working together to reduce Hospital Acquired Infection in England&quot; (December 2003).</p>
	<p pid="a.1607W.8/2">The Ambulance Service Association published Infection Prevention and Control: Managing Healthcare Associated Infection and Control of Serious Communicable Diseases&quot;, in June 2004. The guidance was reviewed recently by the Health Protection Agency, the National Patient Safety Agency and the Department's inspector of microbiology and is deemed to be suitable and sufficient, if used with robust auditing, to control MRSA and other health care associated infections. Additionally, the training and common core syllabus for ambulance personnel covers infection control, including reference to MRSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1614W.0/2">The funding formula provides the best available measure of health need in all areas. In calculating health need in rural areas, it takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614W.0/3">The advisory committee on resource allocation (ACRA), which is made up of national health service managers, academics and general practitioners, oversees the weighted capitation formula. ACRA has looked at the issue of rurality on many occasions and has recommended that no further adjustment is needed to reflect rural areas. ACRA will continue to oversee the development of the formula, and look to ensure equity in resource allocation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1615W.3/1">Improved sexual health performance management has been introduced to ensure that the new investment of &pound;300 million over three years, provided through the Public Health White Paper, achieves the desired outcomes. In addition to the public service agreement target to reduce the under-18 conception rate by 50 per cent., by 2010 as a part of a broader strategy to improve sexual health, primary care trusts must now include sexual health in their local delivery plans. These plans must include measures to achieve improved genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic waiting times, reduced gonorrhoea rates and improved uptake of Chlamydia screening. In addition, the Department has commissioned the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health to undertake a national review of GUM services, which is now under way. A national audit of contraceptive services is also in preparation and we are working to strengthen the monitoring role of strategic health authorities. Data collection is being improved, to provide information against which performance can be measured, including the Health Protection Agency's published data on GUM waiting times.</p>

The latest data in the 50 and over age group show that this rate has fallen from the baseline rate of 10.6 deaths per 100,000 population to 10.1 deaths, a fall of 5 per cent. over the period. For the 65 and over age group the rate has fallen from the baseline rate of 10.1 deaths per 100,000 population to 8.91 deaths, a fall of 11.4 per cent. over the period.</p>

In addition to these sums, the Government make available specific funding&mdash;through the Standards Fund or through direct grant support, earmarked for behaviour and attendance related activities. In the 2005&ndash;06 financial year, this funding is expected to amount to about &pound;310 million through the Behaviour Improvement Programme, the Learning Mentor and Learning Support Unit strands of Excellence in Cities, and the Behaviour and Attendance strands of the Primary and Secondary National Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1633W.2/1">The Student Loans Company will have the power to recover loans which are not recoverable through income tax in the UK, as a debt through litigation in the courts, if there is a breach of the terms. We anticipate relying on European Council regulation 44/2001 in support of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.2/2">We estimate that the annual resource cost of fee loans issued to EU students who would work outside the UK on graduation could be around &pound;25 million <sup>1</sup> (steady state at 2006/07 terms). This assumes that 91 per cent. of EU students are charged the full &pound;3,000 fee, 9 per cent. charged &pound;2,000, 80 per cent. of them take out a fee loan and around 75 per cent. of EU students work outside the UK after graduation. The latter assumption has been derived from data on the first destination of EU students on graduation. These data indicate that a large proportion of EU students do not go into work on graduation, the majority of these undertaking further study. In the absence of any data about the eventual employment of this group of students, we have assumed that they all enter employment outside the UK and hence, the &pound;25 million figure could be an over-estimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.2/3">The estimate presented here is in resource terms. This is the resource cost to the Department of loans&mdash;specifically of providing an interest subsidy and of writing-off some loans. It is on a different basis to (Commons Written) PQ 3057, which concerned the cost to the Department of issuing loans for fees to all EU students, not just those who move outside the UK after graduation, and uses an updated discount rate to calculate resource costs <sup>2</sup> .</p>

	<p pid="a.1636W.2/1">Provision of Counselling Services is a matter for individual higher education institutions. Counselling Services in UK universities have responded positively to the changes in student populations resulting from the HE Widening Participation agenda. The Government have supported a number of initiatives to improve all core support services to students, such as the Developing Modern Higher Education Careers Services&quot;, report in 2001. A key focus of Developing Modern Higher Education Careers Services&quot; was the need to ensure greater and more targeted access to those students and graduates who might be disadvantaged and/or in need of support. The follow-up report Modernising HE Careers Education&mdash;a framework for good practice&quot; showed that universities had reviewed their provision of support services, and recognised the need to improve their standards of service.</p>
