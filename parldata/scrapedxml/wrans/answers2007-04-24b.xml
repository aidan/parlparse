Up to 2005, the responsibility for delivering Holocaust Memorial Day lay with the Home Office, working in conjunction with the Department for Education and Skills and a wide range of individuals and organisations involved in Holocaust remembrance and education and other related issues. The approximate spending for 2002-04 was &pound;280,000</p>
	<p pid="b.1004W.2/2">In 2005 the responsibility for organising the Holocaust Memorial Day was passed over to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT). The HMDT receives a &pound;500,000 annual grant from Communities and Local Government. This grant enables the HMDT to deliver the Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration event, on behalf of the Government, and also a year long programme with local communities on the lessons learnt from the Holocaust and its continuing relevance today.</p>

	<p pid="b.1005W.6/1">Under the Human Rights Act 1998 it is unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with the Convention rights. For these purposes a &quot;public authority&quot; includes any person or body who is exercising functions of a public nature. Local authorities have a statutory duty to make arrangements for the provision of care and accommodation to those in need of it by reason of age, illness or disability. Individuals who are assessed to be in need of care may be placed in a care home run by the local authority itself, but many are placed in homes run by private providers. Those who are placed in care homes by local authorities (including homes that are privately run) can enforce their rights against the local authority because the authority is clearly a &quot;public authority&quot; for the purposes of the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.6/2">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs is planning to intervene in a case which will be heard by the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April 2007</phrase> to clarify whether a private care home provider is also a &quot;public authority&quot; for the purposes of the Human Rights Act when it provides accommodation and care to residents who have been placed there by a local authority. If that is found to be the case, then residents who are placed by local authorities in private care homes will be able directly to enforce their rights against a private care home provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.6/3">The Government have no plans to extend the coverage of the Human Rights Act to self-funded residents of care homes, since the Act does not apply to relationships which do not engage public functions.</p>

If he fails to do so, without reasonable excuse, the defendant commits an offence under the Act and on conviction, he would be liable to a fine of up to &pound;500. This offence is also a &quot;relevant offence&quot; under Schedule 4 to the Act and therefore, on conviction, the court would be able to consider either suspension or forfeiture of the personal licence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1019W.2/2">The National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services sets standards for children's health and social services and the interface of those services with education. Sure Start local programmes had discretion on how to allocate funds to meet local needs. Some chose to add to the resources for health services in their areas by employing midwives and health visitors. The roll-out of children's centres since 2003 across England reflects the change from this pilot initiative, testing out new ways of working, to an integrated common approach to delivering mainstream children's services. Local authorities and their partners in Children's Trusts are working together to plan and deliver their children's centres services, reconfiguring services where necessary. The Department cannot give a detailed estimate of the costs of funding commitments under the National Service Framework, as these are funded from a variety of sources to provide children's health and social care services. Between 2002-03 and 2005-06 the Department has spent an estimated &pound;1.9 billion on Sure Start local programmes and children's centres. There are now 1,258 children's centres up and running reaching over 1 million children under the age of five.</p>

	<p pid="b.1020W.2/2">The Government do not believe that it would be in the best interests of children to require separating parents to undertake mediation in all cases, nor do the Government plan to enshrine in law the principle of shared parenting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.2/3">The Government are committed to the principle that mediation is beneficial, where it is in the child's best interests and there are no concerns for the safety of any member of the family. Provisions in the Children and Adoption Act 2006 will empower the court to direct parties, where appropriate, to attend a meeting to receive information about mediation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.2/4">To enshrine shared parenting in legislation could, in effect, introduce a legal presumption of contact. This would shift the focus of family law away from the paramount interests of the child and prioritise the rights of parents above the interests of the child. The assumption that both parents have equal status and value as parents is already enshrined in current law. The Family Courts are already able to make shared residence orders, where such orders are in the best interests of the child, based on the circumstances of the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1020W.5/3">The Department has not made an assessment of the resource centre at Fulford School. Ofsted's last inspection of the school in December 2003, before the resource centre opened two years ago, noted that</p>

	<p pid="b.1020W.5/5">Since the resource centre opened, City of York LA has conducted a review which found that the centre was making high quality provision which is greatly appreciated by parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.5/6">Decisions on opening resourced provision are taken locally. The Department's team of SEN advisers reported in October 2006 that</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.5/7" class="indent">&quot;many [local authorities] reported on the development of specialist resourced provision within mainstream schools. Most new provision was designed to meet the needs of pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders or Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.5/8">The Ofsted report 'Inclusion: does it matter where pupils are taught? (2006)' stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.5/9" class="indent">&quot;there was little difference in the quality of provision and outcomes for pupils [with SEN] across primary, secondary and special schools. However, mainstream schools with additionally resourced provision were particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils academically, socially and personally&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1020W.5/10">Through guidance, the Government promote a range of provision, including resourced provision, for children with SEN in general and those with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) in particular. The ASDs 'Good Practice Guidance' (DfES/DH, 2002) advised local authorities to aim for &quot;a spectrum of provision for the spectrum of need&quot;. The Department is currently considering responses to a consultation on draft guidance on 'Planning and Developing Special Educational Provision' which includes advice on developing a range of provision. The guidance will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1022W.5/2">There are currently seven Sure Start local programmes in Cornwall. The programmes opened on a rolling basis between 2000 and 2003 and aimed to reach over 4,800 children. In their first two to three years, programmes were building up their services and did not generally operate at peak levels until the third or fourth year. The average expenditure per child for every year for which the grant was paid or allocated is in the following table. From 2006-07, the earliest programme's grants start to taper to a level consistent with delivering the children's centres offer. We expect that local authorities will be in a position to make savings through economies of scale, for example on administration, finance and evaluation, now that the grant for the programmes is paid directly to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1023W.6/2">The North Sea Regional Advisory Council (RAC) was consulted directly by the European Commission on their proposals for the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quota arrangements for 2007 when they were released on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. This included the proposal on the bycatch limit for skates and rays. I am not aware that the RAC raised any concerns about this provision at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1023W.6/3">Because of the late arrival of the proposals, it was not possible for my Department to consult all interested parties. A number of discussions took place with the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO) and the English producer organisations (POs)&mdash;who are represented on the Kent and Essex Sea Fisheries Committee&mdash;as well as their counterparts in other parts of the UK. On the basis of these discussions, we identified that the original Commission proposal for a 5 per cent. bycatch limit was too low and likely to lead to increased discarding. The Commission accepted this argument to some extent, and we succeeded in having the figure increased to 25 per cent. We also succeeded in reducing the scale of their proposed cut in the TAC to 20 per cent. (from 45 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid="b.1033W.5/1">The national screening chlamydia programme (NSCP) is an important part of the Government's sexual health strategy. Screening volumes have already increased from just over 18,000 in year one (2003-04) to nearly 104,000 in year three (2005-06). No estimate has been made of the number of 16 to 24-year-olds who have not been screened but are infected with chlamydia but positivity rates in year three for both males and females is very similar (10.1 per cent. and 10.2 per cent. respectively). Screening was undertaken in 26 programme areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/2">We expect to see all primary care trusts commence screening during 2007. For the first time a local delivery plan target has been introduced for 2007-08. Strategic health authorities have submitted plans to screen at least 15 per cent. of their population aged 15-24 by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/3">In addition, the Department, has contracted Boots to pilot the potential of retail pharmacies as chlamydia screening venues. Screening started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase> in all of the Boots stores in London. This two-year pilot is being independently evaluated by TNS Healthcare. To date, nearly 18,000 people have been tested between the ages of 16-24.</p>

These grants will enable a wide range of improvements for patients and their families, such as more single rooms which offer greater privacy and dignity, additional facilities to allow families to stay overnight with their relatives and more therapeutic and social spaces.</p>

This grant is to be used by local authorities to improve CAMHS, in accordance with local needs and priorities, as set out in local CAMHS development strategies. In 2006-07, &pound;50 million was made available to strategic health authorities for CAMHS as part of a larger bundle of revenue funding for the national health service. The annual CAMHS mapping exercise shows that overall expenditure on specialist CAMHS increased from &pound;431million in 2004-05 to a projected &pound;513 million in 2005-06, an increase of 19 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.5/2">I understand the Healthcare Commission (HC) has decided not to publish an interim report on the quality of clinical care provided by the independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) because of problems with the quality and coverage of the initial ISTC data. They took the view that publishing an interim report would present only a partial and confusing picture of the findings of the review. As a result of the improvement in the data quality and completeness of the ISTC submissions, the HC felt that the review would be best serviced by focusing efforts on producing the final report, not an interim publication.</p>

	<p pid="b.1048W.0/2">Proof of solution testing before the system went live in 2004 demonstrated that the choose and book system would be able to perform satisfactorily when dealing with the design target for bookings during the peak hour, that is some 8,400 bookings per hour, which is equivalent to 15.8 million bookings per year. This test was repeated in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1048W.0/3">In addition, as part of the 2004 tests a scalability test was conducted to demonstrate that the system could scale beyond the peak hour rate (8,400). The system was tested up to 280 per cent. of the peak hour level (up to 23,000 bookings per hour).</p>

	<p pid="b.1050W.5/1">Managing obesity is a complex issue with no simple solution as it is both a cause and consequence of many physiological and psychological health problems. In addition, it requires partnership working at a national and local level, primary care trusts and local authorities are the key delivery organisations in preventing and managing obesity. It is up to these organisations, as local commissioners and providers of services, to determine the most appropriate methods to deliver health care to their populations, including interventions on obesity. Decisions are based on clinical need and effectiveness, as well as local circumstances, drawing on the available evidence. As these services are commissioned locally and are likely to range from clinical interventions to community based services, it is difficult to make any assessment of overall spending in this area, as we do not have detailed breakdown of funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1052W.6/1">There has been increasing concern from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine can be extracted from over the counter (OTC) remedies relatively easily and used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Methylamphetamine was reclassified on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January 2007</phrase> by the Home Office as a Class A controlled drug, based on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD).</p>
	<p pid="b.1052W.6/2">Although the prevalence of misuse of methylamphetamine is believed to be currently low in the United Kingdom, ACPO are receiving increasing levels of intelligence about the prevalence of methylamphetamine. If methylamphetamine did secure a hold in the UK, the consequences would undoubtedly be very serious. The international experience shows that misuse can spread rapidly when certain conditions prevail and the advice of UK enforcement authorities is that most of these conditions now prevail in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1052W.6/3">In January 2007 the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) considered the evidence of a risk to public health from OTC availability of the precursors to methylamphetamine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. The evidence to date centres on advice from ACPO and SOCA that the availability of methylamphetamine is increasing, evidenced in part by the increase in the number of illicit laboratories manufacturing methylamphetamine found by the police in the UK. The police have identified in specific cases that multiple packs of particular pharmacy pseudoephedrine containing products had been purchased and used in the illicit manufacture of methylamphetamine. They have also identified that, in part, these packs were obtained from numerous pharmacies to obtain adequate quantities for manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1052W.6/4">The CHM recommended that changing the legal status of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine together with restricting the pack size was necessary to protect public health in the UK and that a consultation exercise should be conducted on these proposals. Ministers accepted this advice and a full public consultation exercise commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase> and can be accessed via the MHRA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1053W.2/2">The Department and Home Office have discussed the issue at official level. It is not expected that the rise in the age of sale will result in serious intimidation or violence against shopkeepers. This has not been the experience in other countries for example like Ireland where the minimum age for tobacco sale has been changed recently. Trading Standards guidance for retailers will include advice on handling intimidation by customers refused sale because they cannot prove that they meet the minimum age.</p>

	<p pid="b.1056W.2/1">There are two main sources of information on alcohol-related crime: the British crime survey and the offending, crime and justice survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/2">The BCS provides information on the proportion of violent incidents in England and Wales where the offender was thought to be under the influence of alcohol. According to the latest BCS (2005-06) the offender was thought to be under the influence of alcohol in 44 per cent. of violent incidents, which is approximately the same as the figure for the previous year (48 per cent.). The estimated number of violent incidents where the offender was thought to be under the influence of alcohol was 1,029,000 based on the BCS interviews in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/3">The OCJS asks questions about people's participation in alcohol-related crime and disorder. The 2005 OCJS found that being drunk once a month or more was a risk factor for offending among 10 to 25-year-olds. Further analysis of the 2003 survey revealed that, among 18 to 24-year-olds, those respondents identified as 'binge drinkers' (defined as those who drank alcohol and felt very drunk at least once a month in the last 12 months) were more likely to offend than other regular drinkers and non-drinkers. Young male binge drinkers were twice as likely to commit a violent offence than other young male regular drinkers. Binge drinkers were also more likely to commit criminal or disorderly behaviour (such as getting into a fight or damaging something) during or after drinking than other regular drinkers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.2/4">The 2004 OCJS found that among those aged between 10 and 17 years old, those who drank once a week or more committed more offences than those who drank less frequently or not at all. Again, a higher proportion of those who drank alcohol once a week or more reported committing criminal damage and theft offences during or after drinking than those who drank less frequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1061W.2/1">DFID is intensifying action on tackling mother to child transmission of HIV at country level. In Zimbabwe, DFID has initiated a &pound;25 million project specifically to address maternal and newborn health and HIV. In Malawi, where DFID is the major donor in the health sector, with an investment of &pound;100 million over the period 2004-10, a rapid scale-up in preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services is taking place. During 2005, 5,000 of 7,000 HIV positive pregnant women received a complete course of antiretroviral prophylaxis. In Zambia, we support UNICEF's expansion of PMTCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1061W.2/2">In 2006 DFID supported research in the Republic of Congo and Uganda which demonstrated that pregnant women with HIV are between four to five times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth than non-infected women. DFID is tackling stigma and discrimination that prevents women accessing PMTCT by funding education and mass-media campaigns in Angola, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1061W.2/3">In addition to core funding to UNICEF, DFID has provided over $1.5 million to an 'Accelerating Action for Children Affected by HIV and AIDS' programme. This gives focus to the &quot;4 Ps&mdash;Protection, Prevention, PMTCT and Paediatric AIDS&quot;. DFID is also participating in a US-led HIV and AIDS paediatric public-private partnership which seeks to develop formulations of HIV drugs suitable for children in developing countries together with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.1089W.2/1">Real-terms expenditure on working age incapacity benefits has fallen by around 10 per cent. since 1995-96.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.2/2">A key reason for the decline in expenditure over this period is the continued reduction (since April 1995) in the number of claimants who receive protected and higher amounts of contributory invalidity benefit, the predecessor to incapacity benefit. This is an ongoing and gradual process, occurring as people have flowed off the benefit, for example through retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.2/3">In 1995-96, 85 per cent. of expenditure on incapacity benefits was on the protected ex-invalidity benefit. This proportion had fallen to around 50 per cent. in 2001-02 and was around a third in 2005-06.</p>
