	<p pid="b.481W.0/1">Sport in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including Commonwealth Games teams is a devolved matter. However, with regard to the funding provided to athletes from Northern Ireland competing in the Commonwealth Games, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him by my hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-01-09.317W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 317W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/2">Funding to our elite and aspiring athletes to help them train and compete at international sporting events, including the Commonwealth Games, is provided through the World Class Programmes administered by UK Sport and Sport England, as well as the Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS).</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/3">The World Class Programme administered by UK Sport supports UK governing bodies and includes athletes from all parts of the UK. It targets funding at the UK's top athletes&mdash;both able bodied and disabled&mdash;to help them achieve consistent success in international competition and ultimately to bring home medals, usually in major competitions at European, World and Olympic/Paralympic level.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/4">Sport England's World Class Programme is for English athletes primarily within English governing bodies and aims to assist the development of talented athletes with the potential to win medals, or equivalent, in significant future international competitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/5">TASS funding is primarily used to support UK athletes aged between 18 and 25 studying in English educational institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/6">The total world class programme investment from 2002 until March 2006 in the 116 sports comprising the Commonwealth Games is in the region of &pound;36 million by UK Sport and &pound;70 million by Sport England. TASS investment across over 40 sports (including Commonwealth Games sports) during this period totals &pound;7 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.481W.0/7">Additionally Sport England has invested &pound;1.5 million in five sports (basketball, bowls, shooting, table tennis and weightlifting) specifically to support their preparation and attendance at the Games. Furthermore, Sport England has invested &pound;1.8 million into this Commonwealth Games cycle through the Commonwealth Games Council for England which will have helped the preparation and attendance of athletes and officials in Melbourne.</p>

This figure is drawn from the most recent authoritative research: Kerry Sproston, Bob Erens and Jim Orford (2000): Gambling Behaviour in Britain: Results from the British Gambling Prevalence Study&quot; (National Centre for Social Research, June 2000). This research was conducted using a sample of addresses selected at random. As such, it is not possible to provide results on a geographical basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.482W.6/2" class="indent">English Heritage has taken over the administration of the listed building system from DCMS;</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/3" class="indent">DCMS and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have issued a public consultation on new listing criteria. Responses to that consultation are now being analysed;</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/4" class="indent">For each new listing, English Heritage has introduced a new 'summary of significance' that sets out the reason for listing, and a map that shows the extent of the listing;</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/5" class="indent">English Heritage now notifies owners and local authorities on applications to list buildings;</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/6" class="indent">English Heritage has begun to design an information pack for owners to be introduced during 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/7">These changes are intended to simplify and streamline the system and make the listing process more open and understandable.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/8">As part of its modernisation programme, English Heritage restructured its staff dealing with listing, scheduling and registration into a new Heritage Protection Department in 2005. In 2005&ndash;06 there were 56 full time staff in the Heritage Protection Department on a budget of &pound;2.3 million. Within DCMS a team of 9.5 staff work on administration of listed building applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.482W.6/9">Resources for listing in 2007&ndash;08 will be determined in the light of further changes to the listing process and levels of applications.</p>

	<p pid="b.483W.0/1">Virtually every aspect of my Department's work is focussed on maximising participation in all areas of cultural and sporting activity. Particular efforts are devoted to reaching out to people who are socially excluded or for whatever reason may not feel they can participate. This ambition is underpinned by our PSA targets by which we monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.483W.0/2">These targets drive cultural and sports programmes which play a key role in tackling the risks and causes of social exclusion including unemployment, poor educational attainment, poor physical and mental health and crime. For example, 80 per cent. of the &pound;151 million funding for Creative Partnerships is delivered in Neighbourhood Renewal Areas. Next year, over &pound;10 million will be allocated towards funding 3,000 Community Sports Coaches, many of whom work directly with young people to tackle social exclusion. Through the Respect Action Plan, my Department will provide &pound;1 million over three years to develop and expand the Sports Champion mentoring programme through which world class athletes inspire and motivate disaffected young people. I have also directed national lottery distributors to take account of the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation in designing the arts, sports and heritage grant programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.486W.2/1">In line with the Government's commitment to sustainable development, the Government's policy on waste minimisation seeks to break the link between economic growth and the amount of waste produced and to drive the management of waste up the waste hierarchy of reduction, re-use, recycling and composting, and energy recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/2">The Government's main driver for achieving waste minimisation is the waste implementation programme (WIP). The waste and resources action programme (WRAP) leads on delivering this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/3">WRAP'S waste minimisation programme aims to reduce the growth of household waste from 3 percent to 2 percent by the end of the 2005&ndash;6 financial year. So far in the 2005&ndash;6 financial year, the programme has received around &pound;20 million of funding for three initiatives:</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/4" class="indent">the Home Composting scheme, which promotes home composting.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/5" class="indent">WRAP'S target is to divert 400,000 tonnes of waste from landfill by the end of April 2006;</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/6" class="indent">the real nappy programme, which promotes the use of re-usable nappies; and the retailer initiative, through which WRAP is working with retailers to reduce the amount of-waste from supermarkets. A related Innovation Fund provides funding for research and development into waste minimisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/7">The retailer initiative will be important for delivering the Courtauld Commitment on minimising packaging and food waste from the thirteen top UK grocery retailers. Environment Secretary launched the agreement between WRAP and the retailers in July 2005. Next year, an additional element of WRAP'S work will be communications with consumers, with the aim of reducing household food waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/8">The Government's business resource efficiency and waste (BREW) programme funds resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/9">Various BREW delivery bodies are charged with returning &pound;284 million, from additional landfill tax receipts, to business over three years. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/10" class="indent">Envirowise, which provides resource efficiency advice and funds waste minimisation clubs;</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/11" class="indent">the market transformation programme, which helps improve the resource efficiency of products and product information for consumers;</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/12" class="indent">the national industrial symbiosis programme (NISP), which helps minimise waste by linking businesses that produce and use waste; and</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/13" class="indent">the DTI technology programme, which facilitates research and development into resource efficiency, including in the area of waste management.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/14">The Government's food industry sustainability strategy, which will be published shortly, challenges the food manufacturing industry to reduce the quantity of waste that it produces by between 15 and 20 percent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/15">Through its research and data programmes, the Government are investing in developing a sound evidence base on waste minimisation practices and opportunities. So far in the 2005&ndash;6 financial year, DEFRA has committed over &pound;2 million to waste minimisation related research and development projects under its waste research and resources programme. Although research so far has largely centred on household waste prevention the programme is also funding some minimisation projects related to commercial and industrial waste (including a &pound;225,000 project, Understanding and Predicting Construction Waste&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="b.486W.2/16">DEFRA is currently reviewing its waste strategy, which it published in 2000. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-14">14 February</phrase> DEFRA published a consultation document on the review, which proposed a greater focus on waste prevention and resource efficiency to further decouple waste creation from economic growth. DEFRA's work to establish evidence bases on sustainable consumption and production and waste, including research and review work on the flows of resources through the economy, are important linked programmes in underpinning this strategic priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.489W.3/21">1. The above includes those old-scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new-scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old-scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency's target definition, as are new-scheme cases being processed clerically.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.3/22">2. The Child Support Agency's PSA target was to double the proportion of parents with care on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who receive maintenance for their children to 60 per cent. by March 2006&quot;. This target has been rolled forward under SR2004 and increased to 65 per cent. by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.3/23">3. A parent with care is deemed to be on income support or jobseeker's allowance (income based) if they or their partner are in receipt of either benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.489W.3/24">4. Old-scheme data from the old computer system (CSCS) are matched with administrative data from the benefits system to obtain the current benefit status of the parent with care. Those parents with care who are not themselves on benefit, but whose partner is, are excluded from this analysis due to lack of available data. It is not possible to match old and new scheme data from the new IT system (CS2) with administrative data from the benefits system, so this information is recorded as that held on the CSA system.</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.2/1">Although accuracy is not as high as we would want there are some signs of improvement. The Agency's Operational Improvement Plan outlines how changes in processes will drive up accuracy standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/2">Accuracy levels can be found in table 17 of the CSA's Quarterly Summary Statistics (QSS) document, a copy of which is available in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.2/16">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/17">1. The Agency target for accuracy in 2005&ndash;06 is that by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> accuracy on the last decision made for all maintenance calculations (new scheme) and assessments (old scheme) checked in the year to be correct to the nearest penny in at least 90 per cent. of new scheme cases and 82 per cent. of old scheme cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/18">2. Measurement of Agency performance against this target is based on checks carried out on a sample of cases that grows cumulatively throughout the year, and is designed to provide an optimal level of precision for the estimate of Agency accuracy at any financial year end.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/19">3. While it is possible to derive year to date performance at any point within the reporting period in order to provide an indicative guide as to current (cumulative) performance, comparisons between individual months (particularly towards the beginning of the reporting period) are subject to sampling variation, meaning that any time series may not be wholly reflective of actual trends in performance. For this reason, figures have been provided for financial years for the period April 2003 to March 2005, and year to date for the current reporting year.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/20">4. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percent.</p>
	<p pid="b.490W.2/21">5. The figures included in this table do not themselves have national statistics status, but are included in this publication in order to give a fuller picture of CSA performance.</p>

They were also asked to consider the case for smaller scale bypasses to the villages of Middleton and East Winch and to review the case later in the decade for upgrades between A1 and Sutton and between North Tuddenham and Easton. The Department recently received advice from the region on priorities for transport investment. We are currently considering this advice and expect to make announcements, including announcements relevant to the A47 corridor, later in the spring.</p>

In doing this we recognised there could be different factors at play in different regions, and so did not prescribe the exact approach which regions should follow in preparing their advice. However, guidance issued to the regions last July made clear that advice should, as far as possible, represent wide agreement across each region on what the region's priorities were and that it would be more credible to Government if it was the product of a wide consensus.</p>

	<p pid="b.509W.5/1">The national minimum wage has benefited around one million people each year since its introduction in 1999, and around two-thirds of those benefiting are low-paid women. The national minimum wage plays a part in narrowing the gender pay gap, as women are more likely to work in lower paid and often part-time jobs than men. The DTI estimates that two-thirds of the 1.3 million low-paid workers set to benefit from the October 2006 uprating will be women.</p>

	<p pid="b.509W.8/1">The NHS has made great strides in recent years towards becoming a model employer. The NHS plan established the Improving Working Lives (IWL) standard, which states that every member of staff in the NHS is entitled to work for an organisation which provides a range of flexible working conditions and access to good quality, affordable child care. The increased provision of flexible working and child care has been an important incentive in encouraging former NHS staff back to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/2">Flexible working arrangements for medical staff were encouraged through the national flexible career and returner schemes for doctors, which provided incentives to employers to establish more part-time posts. In addition, between 1999 and 2004, the Department of Health co-ordinated a national return to practice scheme for other health care professionals, including nurses and midwives. Returners were eligible for financial support and help with child care, travel and books. Over 18,500 staff returned as a result of this national programme. All returner schemes are now operated by NHS employers depending on local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/3">Returning to Teach Courses run across England in eight out of nine Government office (GO) regions. Course providers are allocated a number of courses based on the GO's requirements in terms of teacher vacancies in that GO. Approximately 1,200 to 1,400 former teachers attend these 10-week long courses annually to update their skills, knowledge and to increase their confidence levels. 61 per cent. of course completers go on to return to teaching employment according to a recent February survey of 1,011 course completers. Course participants are supported with a &pound;150 a week bursary, with additional support of up to &pound;150 a week for each child or dependent incurring care costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/4">In addition to course provision to support former teachers in returning to teach, there is a Return to Teach support service commissioned and managed by the Training and Development Agency for Schools, The Return to Teach service supports former teachers by:</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/5" class="indent">1. Registering former teachers interested in returning to teaching employment</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/6" class="indent">2. Distributing welcome packs to former teachers newly registered with the Return to Teach service (which includes details of a magazine targeted specifically at former teachers hoping to Return to Teach; details of courses in their area and lists of useful contacts)</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/7" class="indent">3. A telephone support service with consultants who are themselves former teachers, to take inbound calling and to run outbound calling campaigns to target certain GO areas or teachers qualified in shortage subjects</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.8/8" class="indent">4. The 'Return to Teaching' magazine is sent to everyone on the database termly to keep former teachers in touch with curriculum changes and school organisational changes such as the additional support provided by support staff, to encourage them to make a timely return to the profession</p>

We are aware that this creates tough trading conditions, especially for energy intensive users. Prices have risen over the past year mainly as a result of increasing oil prices, leading to higher wholesale gas prices, and higher international coal prices. Recent periods of high gas prices during this winter reflect the supply-demand balance in the UK. We are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to find solutions and to reduce the impact on those most affected.</p>

	<p pid="b.519W.5/1">The increased penalty relates to persistent misuse of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services and is directed particularly at silent calls and does not concern breaches of the telephone preference service rules, which are dealt with by the Information Commissioner's Office. Last summer the Office of Communications (Ofcom) requested DTI to consider raising the maximum penalty, which could be levied by Ofcom from &pound;5,000 to &pound;50,000 against those that make nuisance silent calls, in view of mounting public and parliamentary concern. It was felt that the current maximum penalty was not sufficient for the level of consumer harm and worry that silent calls caused and that it was not a real sanction or deterrent. Ofcom proposed that the maximum penalty should be increased to &pound;50,000. I agreed with Ofcom's proposal and launched a consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>. In response to the consultation there was overwhelming support for raising the maximum penalty and on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase> I announced our intention to increase the maximum penalty to &pound;50,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.523W.2/1">DFID has recently assessed a proposal from the International Children's Trust (ICT) for a programme with child domestic workers in the Philippines. Based on our assessment, we have agreed to provide approximately &pound;320,000 to support the Trust's proposal. The ICT will work through a local partner, the Visayan Forum Foundation, where our support will meet the cost of operations for two years from April 2006. This is the first activity we have financed in the Philippines that will address this important issue and we will monitor and review the impact of the programme carefully.</p>

	<p pid="b.523W.5/1">DFID's primary involvement with mineral and natural resource extraction projects in developing countries is an indirect one, as a 'shareholder' in multilateral financial institutions, such as the World Bank group and the Regional Development Banks, which invest in projects in this sector. However, DFID monitors developments in the minerals and natural resources sector as part of a commitment to sustainable development and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.5/2">DFID's main focus is on the general principles adopted in the environmental and social policies and procedures of the multilateral banks because these provide the framework within which the environmental and social impacts of specific projects are managed 'on the ground'. For example, DFID has been actively engaged in the Extractive Industries Review, which assessed the compatibility of World Bank's investments in the extractive sector with their missions of poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.5/3">More recently, DFID has also contributed to the International Finance Corporation's review of its environmental and social safeguards policies and procedures. These safeguards are a key tool to ensure the prudent management of the exploitation of natural resources in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.523W.5/4">DFID also provides support to the newly established Inter-Governmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development. The primary role of this Forum is to assist developing countries to manage their mineral wealth as a key component in their development strategies.</p>

	<p pid="b.524W.3/1">I visited Sudan 20&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February 2006</phrase>. I spent a day in El Fasher, North Darfur where I met with the Acting Governor (Wali) of the state and the new AMIS Force Commander, General Ihekire. I also visited two Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps on the outskirts of El Fasher where I met with IDPs and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. In Khartoum, I met with Vice Presidents Taha and Kiir, Foreign Minister Lam Akol, representatives of the AU, the UN Special Representative Jan Pronk as well as UN Agency and non-governmental organisation (NGO) heads.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/2">The humanitarian situation in Darfur has stabilised and is much better than in 2004 largely due to the enormous international effort. Huge problems remain, however, with 1.8 million people still in camps unable to go home and 3.4 million people dependent on humanitarian aid. This progress has, however, to be set against a serious deterioration in security. In addition to the clashes between rebels and Government forces and tension along the border with Chad, increasing lawlessness and banditry is becoming a major concern. The insecurity is severely hampering the delivery of humanitarian assistance, leaving many people intensely vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/3">In my meetings with Government representatives, I reinforced the message delivered by the Foreign Secretary at the Abuja talks on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-14">14 February</phrase>, namely that the lack of progress on Darfur is unacceptable. The parties to the Abuja peace talks must negotiate urgently and in good faith. Both sides need to show by their actions on the ground that they are serious about a peace deal; both must co-operate with, and neither hinder nor threaten, AMIS and the international community in Darfur; and all must end the climate of impunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/4">I discussed the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). The AU have done a good job in deterring violence in the region in very difficult circumstances, but the AU force was not designed or configured for long-term operation. We need to strengthen the international operation in Darfur, which means handing over from the AU to a bigger UN force with a stronger mandate. I welcome the decision taken by the AU Peace and Security Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-10">10 March</phrase>, to support, in principle, transition to a UN force in Darfur. The new AMIS Force Commander briefed me on the current unpredictable security situation and his plans for addressing the challenges facing AMIS. To help ensure AMIS maintains its effectiveness, I announced a further &pound;20 million in UK support to the mission.</p>
	<p pid="b.524W.3/5">I also took the opportunity to announce a &pound;40 million contribution to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), a pioneering multi-donor fund, administered by the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator. This will help enable the UN to react more quickly and more flexibly to both identified and unforeseen needs, not only in Darfur but across all of Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="b.525W.2/1">DFID takes the issue of climate change very seriously. We are working with others, in particular the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, to increase investment in low carbon energy, particularly in developing countries. This is in line with the Gleneagles Plan of Action for Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, which the G8 signed up to in July 2005. This included commitments to encourage increased investment in cleaner and more efficient energy technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/2">Specifically, the World Bank and Regional Development Banks are developing the Energy Investment Framework to address obstacles to investment in low carbon development and encourage both public and private sectors to invest more in clean energy in developing countries. The Framework will also look to improve the effectiveness of existing strategies in developing world countries, for example, by integrating climate change into transport sector strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/3">In addition to this, the Government have been supporting EU efforts to promote low carbon energy in developing countries. At the EU-India Summit in September 2005, both parties agreed to launch an EU-India Initiative on Clean Development and Climate Change. One aim of the Initiative will be to increase funding and promote public-private partnerships for research and development of cleaner technologies. It will also look to reduce the price gap between cleaner&quot; and less efficient&quot; technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.525W.2/4">Similarly, an EU-China Partnership was signed in September 2005. As a focal part of this, the UK is supporting a new initiative on near-Zero Emissions Coal with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to address the challenge of tackling increasing greenhouse gas emissions from the use of coal in China. The aim is to bring forward the time when new Chinese coal plants are built with CCS. Near-Zero Emissions Coal and large-scale deployment of CCS in China could halve their projected emissions by 2030. This will be a significant achievement as on current levels China is set to overtake the United States as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the next 20 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.527W.0/1">The World Food Programme's (WFP) pilot drought insurance project was launched in Ethiopia earlier this year, for one year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not had discussions with the WFP on this issue, but DFID officials have followed the project's evolution closely and, with other WFP members, have provided detailed feedback in the WFP executive board meetings and privately to the secretariat. The Government are not contributing to this pilot, which has received the funding it needs from other sources. The key criterion we will use in deciding whether or not to contribute to any future schemes will be the extent to which we believe they can ensure timely and reliable delivery of assistance to those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.0/2">The current pilot in Ethiopia is designed to benefit farmers whose livelihoods are threatened by drought of the severity experienced on average once every 10 years in Ethiopia. It does not target all those whose lives are threatened by insufficient food. They would depend on other mechanisms, including emergency food aid operations and the existing Productive Safety Nets Programme in Ethiopia; DFID contributes resources to both.</p>
	<p pid="b.527W.0/3">Over the past 15 months, the UK Government have proposed a number of reforms aimed at making the humanitarian system more effective. These include investing 10 per cent. of emergency response funds in measures to prevent, or reduce the impact of, future disasters, and reforming and expanding the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, to enable the UN to launch an immediate response wherever it is needed. DFID will continue to monitor the WFP's scheme and other developments in the area of disaster insurance.</p>

Additional Learning Support (ALS) allows further education (FE) providers to meet the extra costs to enable learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities or other needs to fully access learning provision to achieve their learning aims. ALS can be claimed by colleges and other FE providers to cover the extra costs of learning required by an individual&mdash;for example, additional support, learning aids, materials etc. The LSC allocates ALS funds to colleges and other FE providers as part of their overall FE funding allocation. In 2004/05 the ALS spend was &pound;333.3 million. Spend for 2005/06 is not yet available but the LSC allocated &pound;340.3 million to colleges and other FE providers in 2005/06. The LSC is still in discussion with learning providers for 2006/07 allocations. The provisional allocation for 2006/07 is &pound;366.2 million and this will be confirmed when the LSC agrees final budgets with providers in May.</p>

	<p pid="b.541W.0/1">This Government have given an unprecedentedly high profile to tackling and preventing bullying, as well as supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti bullying work, including the anti bullying charter for action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&mdash;for example prejudice&mdash;and to helping those who are bullied.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/2">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice 'Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens' as the first of this suite of materials. There is a major emphasis within this advice on prevention. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/3">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti Bullying Alliance (ABA) signing up to our anti bullying charter for action. The charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools so that they can learn from this best practice. The charter contains a significant emphasis on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/4">Through our work with the ABA, an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying, including prevention. The National Strategies' behaviour materials provide schools with support in preventing and responding to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/5">We have put more adults than ever in our schools&mdash;teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, behaviour and education support teams and police officers&mdash;so that a wide range of people are available to help prevent and tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/6">Anti bullying week continues to be a successful event with a large number of schools taking part in November 2005's activities through a wide variety of national and local events. There was a considerable amount of positive press coverage and this year over 325,000 anti bullying wristbands were distributed.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/7">Our anti bullying resource pack for schools Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, updated in 2000 and September 2002 will be revised and re-issued in the summer term 2006 to ensure schools have the most up-to-date information available on preventing and tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/8">In addition the Department has recently launched the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from foundation stage to year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally. It is an important arm of the Department's longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance and prevent bullying. The Department is hoping to build on the work carried out in primary schools by providing a similar whole school curriculum based resource for secondary schools (SEBS). At present the programme is in a very early pilot stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/9">In England, local authorities have a duty to provide a suitable education at school or otherwise for each child of compulsory school age who, for reasons of illness, exclusion or otherwise, would not receive it unless such arrangements were made. It is, therefore, for local authorities, in consultation with parents, to decide the most appropriate educational provision for a child that cannot attend school as a result of bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/10">The Department has issued guidance for local authorities and schools on PRUs and alternative provision, and on the commissioning of alternative provision; all local authorities and schools should have regard to this guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/11">National statistics on incidents of bullying are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.0/12">Our departmental guidance suggests that schools and local authorities should use all the data available to them, through behaviour audits, self evaluation and pupil surveys, to assist them in monitoring bullying incidents within their schools and to assess the impact of their own anti bullying initiatives.</p>

Local participation figures for 2004/05 are not due to be published until the end of March 2006. When these become available, the DfES and LSC will be doing further analyses to try to get a better estimate of the increase in participation which might be due to EMA. However, it will not be possible to attribute any changes to EMA alone, since there will have been other factors which will have influenced participation. It will not be possible to make any reasonable assessment of the impact for individual local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.546W.2/1">There has been no formal research regarding a possible correlation either between ergonomic desks (or school furniture as a whole) and osteopathic health or students' learning ability but the Department is aware of the importance as a whole of a pupils learning environment, both to their performance and feeling of well being. Informal discussions, however, have been held with the National Back Pain Association in the recent past and we are aware of that organisation's concerns in this regard. Schools are now free to purchase their own furniture and equipment and to determine their own spending priorities. Advice in the Department's 'Furniture and Equipment Purchasing Guide', is therefore given on economically adjustable furniture and it's pro's and con's.</p>
	<p pid="b.546W.2/2">As part of our awareness of ergonomics the Department have developed an ergonomics website which allows teachers, building professionals and even children themselves to determine the correct size of furniture for a particular pupil. The site offers solutions to size mis-match&mdash;a major cause of discomfort among pupils. This site has utilised child size data gathered in a 2001 survey jointly funded by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.546W.5/1">Spending on exam fees is 0.7 percent. of school spending in England. The responsibility for monitoring examination fees lies with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), as part of its responsibility for overseeing the examinations system in England. Changes to total spending on examination fees may reflect a number of factors, including increases in the number of candidates taking examinations, or payment of penalty fees for late entries.</p>
	<p pid="b.546W.5/2">It is important that the examinations system has the investment necessary to ensure it remains robust and secure. However, we also need to be confident that the significant levels of public funding spent on examination fees, by secondary schools and others, provide good value for money. We have therefore asked the QCA to consider what further work it should do in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.548W.8/2">The Department takes all form of fraud seriously. In terms of relative risk, identity fraud is not the highest risk in the Department's direct relationships with the public but does figure significantly in relationships with key partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.548W.8/3">The Department's partner organisations are primarily responsible for the distribution of funding and will implement processes that safeguard against fraud risks including identity theft. Guidance issued to partners includes steers on validating identity details. My Department is currently undertaking a review of NDPB partner organisations fraud response plans. This review will ensure identity fraud has been reflected appropriately in their respective fraud strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.548W.8/4">The Department does provide training for front desk staff (receptionists and security guards) dealing with the public face to face. The induction training includes validating whether a person is who they say they are and whether they are allowed on site in their own right or whether they need to be escorted. After the induction, appointees must sign a declaration that they understand what they have been taught, that they know where the assignment instructions are kept should they need to refer to them and that they know who to contact for further guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.548W.8/5">In respect of administration staff, dealing with verifying identity is part of the Department's work in administering vetting cases and, in HR, when recruiting new members of staff. The Department's Special Investigations Unit also provides fraud awareness training to Divisions on request.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.0/1">Swindon local authority will receive &pound;111,219 for each of the next two years from the Youth Opportunity Fund. This funding is to be used at young people's discretion to give them choice and influence over things to do and places to go in their area. In addition to this Swindon will receive &pound;96,196 for each of the next two years from the Youth Capital Fund. This funding is to improve facilities and to provide equipment which young people want in their neighbourhood. The two funds are designed to work in tandem. The combined funding for each year is &pound;207,415 which amounts to a total of &pound;404,830.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.3/2">The School Food Trust's advice on standards for school food other than lunch was informed by evidence from companies selling foods in schools, people providing food in schools and others including researchers and academics. This included evidence from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey: young people aged four-20 years, which showed that sugars comprise about 17 percent. of food energy in children compared to a recommended average of 11 percent. and the main source is soft drinks and confectionery. The full advice, including a list of those who gave evidence, is published on schoolfoodtrust.org.uk.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.6/1">The standards for school toilet provision are given in the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 for maintained schools and in the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2003 for Independent Schools. It is our view that in principle there is little difference between the health, safety and welfare needs of children and adults as regards such things as hygiene and therefore the majority of the requirements concerning toilets set out in the Code of Practice published to inform the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 are equally applicable in the case of accommodation for children or adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.550W.6/2">The Department has not made an assessment of the number of school toilets in England and Wales in need of refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid="b.550W.6/3">The Department is not planning to undertake a review of toilet facilities in schools in England. Local education authorities and schools should already be reviewing both the condition and suitability of the toilets in schools as part of the asset management plan condition and suitability surveys and prioritising work to upgrade the toilets where necessary. Schools themselves are responsible for keeping the toilets in a clean and orderly condition.</p>

We are committed to the principle of inclusion and are providing mainstream schools with the necessary resources to enable them to make suitable provision for children with severe BESD, where possible. Overall total revenue funding per pupil is now &pound;1,070 higher in real terms than in 1997&ndash;98 and is set to rise by a further &pound;400 per pupil in real terms by 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.552W.2/2">Within a rising total of overall funding, the funding currently provided by Excellence in Cities and the Behaviour Improvement Programme that can be used for more specialised behaviour provision like learning mentors, learning support units and multi-agency behaviour support teams will continue. The Government have also made available an additional &pound;300 million over the last three years to support the general expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), helping to improve access to more specialist mental health support and advice. These additional resources alongside the new, integrated, multi-agency children services, mean that schools will be better able to support pupils with a wide variety of needs, including those with severe BESD, within mainstream education.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.2/1">The Repayment of Teachers' Loans (RTL) scheme repays the student loans of eligible teachers of priority subjects who have been accepted onto the scheme. Under the scheme, the Government reduce the loan balance annually, writing off the student loans of eligible teachers over a period of up to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.2/2">There are safeguards in the RTL process which mean that there should be no cases where public funds could be assessed as irretrievable and to date, none have been. The balance on the student loan is reduced once the teacher has confirmed their eligibility to remain on the scheme for the preceding year. This is part of an annual review process. If a teacher fails to confirm their eligibility or to return the annual review form, no further loan reductions are made under the RTL scheme. This should mean that teachers do not benefit from RTL in advance of entitlement as loans are not paid off without confirmation of entitlement. If a teacher notifies a change in circumstances which affects their entitlement, the SLC adjusts the repayment account to reflect the date of the change.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/2">&quot;Creating sustainable communities: Delivering the Thames Gateway&quot;, published in March 2005, set out progress to date and outlined the Government's plans for the future development of the Thames Gateway.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/3">Later this year, we will publish a Strategic Framework for the Gateway, which will cover latest progress and form the basis of a delivery plan for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/4">As an early indicator of progress, however, recently published data from the Learning Skills Council show Level 3 attainment by young people in the Thames Gateway. The data shows that the number of 19-year-olds achieving a Level 3 qualification increased from 13,608 in 2004 to 15,143 in 2005. This equates to a 3 per cent. increase, and contributes to the overall raising of qualification levels of the Thames Gateway population.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/5">On the point of work-based training opportunities, according to the Learning and Skills Council's Thames Gateway Directorate, the substantial increase in learner achievements of apprenticeships and the associated costs has meant that the number of starts on apprenticeships in the Thames Gateway have decreased from 2004/05 to 2005/06. This concurs with the national picture. The increase in achievements is very good news as we committed ourselves to improving the quality of work-based learning in Creating Sustainable Communities: Delivering the Thames Gateway. The success rates on apprenticeships in the Thames Gateway have risen from 43 per cent. in 2003/04 to 47.4 per cent. in 2004/05.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/6">As referenced in Creating Sustainable Communities: Delivering the Thames Gateway, for example, the ODPM has also contributed &pound;4 million to the expansion of Prospects College in Southend, also part-funded by the LSC. Prospects College delivers work-based learning in engineering and construction. The expansion will increase the capacity of the college and the number of learner places.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/7">Further work-based learning places have also been created through the 14&ndash;19 sector pilots running in parts of the Thames Gateway. Through this programme, support has also been given in order to build capacity for increased delivery of work-based learning. The pilots establish stepping-stone vocational pathways all the way from Key Stage 4 to higher education in the key local sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.5/8">The Government have also been supporting employers and employees in the Thames Gateway with work-related training through Profit from Learning, the local Treasury-funded Employer Training Pilot. To date, 50,280 employees in 6,730 companies have benefited from the programme across the three LSC areas covering the Thames Gateway.</p>

Friend, the Home Secretary, the proposal in the Police and Justice Bill to enable chief officers, where appropriate, to allow community support officers to remove truants from public places. Section 16 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 allows local authorities to designate areas from which truants may be removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/3">Currently the power to remove truants can only be exercised by police officers. We believe that the proposal to extend this to community support officers will make it easier for local authorities and the police to mount truancy sweeps. It is also an important item in this Government's respect action.</p>

	<p pid="b.570W.5/2">IRMO has a project under way which aims to increase the amount of liquefied petroleum gas produced in southern Iraq from 1,000 to 3,000 tonnes per day.

Measures to reduce the amount of gas flared are likely to be a key component of this policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.5/4">Approximately 1.28 million tonnes of gas was flared in Kuwait in 2004&ndash;05. There are no published figures for 2005&ndash;06. No representations have been made to the Government of Kuwait on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.571W.2/1">The Palestinian Authority had consistently failed to meet its obligations under the Ramallah Agreement, despite frequent requests from UK and US officials. There was no evidence that the incoming government planned to rectify this situation. On the contrary, since the <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January</phrase> Palestinian Legislative Council elections, Hamas officials had called for the release of Ahmad Sa'adat. Other factions, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), of which Sa'adat is the General Secretary, had also repeatedly called for his release. President Abbas had offered to release Sa'adat on condition that the PFLP absolve him of responsibility for the consequences. We therefore had no reason to believe that the incoming Palestinian government would deal with the issue of non-compliance with the agreement, and we had good reason to believe that the incoming government intended to release one or more of the prisoners in contravention of the agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.573W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.2/2">The UK Government absolutely condemn all acts of terrorism and takes concerns over the use of UK and European Community (EC) aid very seriously. We have not and would not allow taxpayers' money to be used to fund terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.2/3">Since 2004, UK and European Community financial support to the budget of the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been provided through a Reform Trust Fund, managed by the World Bank. Funding is conditional on the achievement of benchmarks for reform, progress against which is carefully monitored. The benchmarks cover the PA's audit and accounting processes as well as issues such as pension reform, the wage bill and the PA's budget process. The benchmarks require that the PA submit its annual financial statements to the Palestinian Legislative Council and be independently audited. This is intended to ensure the legitimate use of PA resources and that UK taxpayers' funds achieve value for money. The terms governing the Trust Fund are set out accordingly in signed memoranda of understanding between DFID and the World Bank and between the World Bank and the PA. There is no evidence to suggest that Reform Trust Fund money has been diverted to private bank accounts, or been used to support terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.2/4">Other assistance to the Palestinians is provided though the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for refugees and a number of smaller projects. Where projects involve the transfer of funds to a Palestinian agency, there is always a signed agreement with that agency on what funding may be used for. Furthermore, financial reports are submitted as part of a careful monitoring process designed to ensure the legitimate use of taxpayers' money. The UK government will not allow development aid to be used for anything other than poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.574W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Prism posts communicate using landlines (67 posts) or satellite links (112 posts). Changes to the FCO's IT infrastructure improved the speed and consistency of performance at most landline posts in September 2005. These changes did not improve the performance at posts using satellite communications to the same degree. Therefore other measures are being considered. Following successful tests at a small number of posts we are considering:</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.5/2" class="indent">transferring posts to landlines, where possible. Initial pilots have been conducted successfully at two posts, Warsaw and Budapest. Further pilots are planned at another seven posts this month: Ankara, Brasilia, Bucharest, Islamabad, Nairobi, New Delhi, Nicosia and Santiago. This change could be applied to 56 posts;</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.5/3" class="indent">installing hardware to accelerate communications over satellite links, where it is not possible for a post to migrate to a landline. Pilots are underway at five posts: Abuja, Accra, Pretoria, Lagos and Tehran.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.5/4">In parallel, ways of improving the speed of the Prism system itself are being pursued. System memory has recently been increased, allowing more users to use the system concurrently. Changes to balance the processing load across the system have also been implemented. And more powerful servers will be installed shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.5/5">Prism performance, and that of the underpinning IT infrastructure remains a high priority for the FCO Board and an area where continuous improvement is being sought.</p>

	<p pid="b.575W.3/1">All changes to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) organisation must be reflected in the Prism software. Data defining how the posts in South Asia and Russia/Central Asia Directorates should operate were originally programmed incorrectly in Prism. This was revealed when the posts went 'live' on Prism between 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">9 February</phrase>. The posts could not access their suppliers or approve purchases, so they could not buy goods or services using Prism. Software 'rules' granting access to some accounting processes were also wrong. These problems stopped posts using Prism: it took until <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> to resolve them fully.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/2">The posts affected were Chennai, Colombo, Dhaka, Islamabad, Kabul, Karachi, Kathmandu, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, Almaty, Ashgabat, Baku, Dushanbe, Ekaterinburg, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tashkent, Tblisi and Yerevan.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/3">To protect the FCO's financial year 2005&ndash;06 account closure and alleviate pressure on staff at these posts, they were asked to return their accounts on spreadsheets, rather than on Prism, until <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March</phrase>. These spreadsheets are loaded into Prism in the UK. Most of the posts will now go live on Prism in April.</p>

	<p pid="b.577W.6/1">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January 2006</phrase> that all trusts would need to confirm their capital investment plans through a reappraisal process, including where applicable private finance initiative (PFI) schemes. The aim of this process is to ensure that all schemes properly take account of the current reforms to the national health service such as choice, a movement of services into primary and community settings, the new financial regime as well as long-term affordability, assumptions on efficiency gains and income growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.6/2">The PFI scheme at Barts and the London NHS Trust was very close to financial close when this announcement was made, and indeed had already been the subject of close scrutiny in the weeks before the announcement. As a result of further discussions between the Department and the trust and their private sector partners the original plans were revised and have formed an addendum to the full business case (FBC).</p>
	<p pid="b.577W.6/3">Departmental officials will shortly be writing to all trusts with PFI schemes letting them know how the reappraisal process will work. Schemes such as the one at the Mid-Essex Hospital Trust, which are closer to financial close, will be focused on first. The trust may incur some additional costs in carrying out this work, but this will be more than offset by the savings which will be realised by the reappraisal exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.579W.5/1">There have been three reported incidents of counterfeit medicines having reached patients through the United Kingdom pharmaceutical supply chain via prescription since 1994. Over 650 million prescriptions are written annually in the UK. Therefore the risk of receiving a counterfeit medicine through the regulated pharmaceutical supply chain in the UK is low.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.5/2">However, there is evidence of counterfeit medicines being obtained by customers in the UK via the internet, by mail order or on a personal basis. The vast majority of these instances are from websites or organisations based in other countries and are mainly lifestyle products used to treat erectile dysfunction, obesity and hair-loss. Products purchased in this way cannot be guaranteed for their safety, quality and efficacy. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) investigates such websites or related persons/organisations based in the UK and refers details of overseas equivalents to respective international counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.5/3">Following the detection of counterfeit Lipitor tablets (20milligram Lot 004405K1) in the legitimate UK pharmaceutical supply chain in July 2005, the counterfeit tablets were analysed by the manufacturer (Pfizer) and the MHRA laboratory. The analysed tablets contained Lovastatin which is a different active ingredient to Lipitor's Atorvastatin but has similar actions in vivo. The medical risks and benefits were reviewed by physicians in the MHRA and Pfizer who both independently agreed that a class two recall was appropriate because there was assessed to be no immediate danger to patients. The MHRA issued the recall for this medicine on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July 2005</phrase> which covered both counterfeit material and genuine material which shared a common batch number.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.5/4">Counterfeit medicines which are discovered in the legitimate UK pharmaceutical supply chain are analysed to establish the identity and amount of any active ingredients present. A medical evaluation of the risks to patients is undertaken which determines the level of recall to be conducted for the medicine. The absence of active ingredient, reduced potency, hyperpotency and/or incorrect active ingredient in suspected and determined counterfeits as well as an analysis of the length and type of treatment contribute to this risk assessment process.</p>

	<p pid="b.580W.5/2">Most dentists who provide national health service primary dental care services are not paid on a salaried basis, but through a system of NHS fees and other payments that go towards the costs of running a dental practice as well as the dentist's net income.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/3">These estimates of average net income and expenses for a committed NHS dentist are based on data for dentists in the general dental services (GDS).

	<p pid="b.580W.5/4">DPB payment data show that on average, a dentist with a reasonable NHS commitment in 2004&ndash;05 in the GDS received gross GDS income of about &pound;154,350.

	<p pid="b.580W.5/5">HM Revenue and Customs information from dentists' tax returns show that the average ratio of expenses to gross earnings for a highly committed NHS dentist is around 52 per cent. (2003&ndash;04 tax year). The same source gives average net income of a highly committed NHS dentist from all sources as &pound;78,600 in the tax year 2003&ndash;04. Average expenses were about &pound;85,200. This information is taken from the tax returns of 392 GDS principal dentists who were in non-associate business arrangements for whom the tax year ended between January and March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/6">Based on the data from these sources, the Department estimates that a highly committed GDS dentist earns an average NHS income of around &pound;80,000 in 2005&ndash;06. We do not have equivalent data for personal dental services (PDS) dentists, but there are no reasons for supposing any significant difference in average earnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/7">GDS dentists are being offered new contracts which guarantee their earnings in the reference period, October 2004 to September 2005, provided their activity as expressed in units of dental activity (UDAs) is 95 per cent. of its level during this reference period. PDS providers are entitled to new PDS agreements (or GDS contracts) based on their current contract values.</p>

	<p pid="b.582W.2/1">The main element of national health service dental services are the primary dental care services provided by dentists working within the general dental service (GDS), or personal dental service (PDS) pilots. The following tables display the readily available data on expenditure on these services for primary care trusts in the Lancashire area and for the Cumbria and Lancashire strategic health authority (SHA). The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients. Note that data on PDS expenditure are only available for the financial year 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="b.588W.0/3" class="indent">'ensure their registration status is not used in the promotion of commercial products or services and ensure professional judgment is not influenced by any commercial considerations'.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.0/4">In 2003, the Department issued a medicines management framework to the NHS trusts to support the development of good practice standards in medicines management. The framework specifically addresses the need for trusts to have written policies for all relevant staff members to ensure high standards of probity and business conduct, including working with pharmaceutical industry representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.0/5">The Healthcare Commission is currently carrying out an acute hospital portfolio medicines management review. The review will consider a number of aspects of medicines management and investigate the corporate governance structures that are supporting medicines management which will include management of budgets and expenditure. The outcome of this review is expected to be available in summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.593W.10/1">Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda. A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling anti-social behaviour. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; DFES through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need; DEFRA and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and DCMS who provide the opportunity to divert young people from destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour. The DCA also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.10/2">In 2005&ndash;06 the Home Office has allocated25,000 to every Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) in both England and Wales, including West Lancashire to tackle antisocial behaviour. This amounts to &pound;9.4 million per annum and forms part of the Safer, Stronger Communities Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.10/3">The Government are determined to target those individuals involved in alcohol related disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) to crack down on such behaviour. Southern Lancashire Basic Command Unit which covers West Lancashire received an extra &pound;10,000 of Home Office funding as part of this campaign. Overall during the campaign police and trading standard officers carried out over 6,000 test purchase operations, dealt with more than 30,000 offences and made over 25,000 arrests. The police work that led to the success of AMEC will now continue on a daily basis as part of everyday mainstream police activities. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order- a Drinking Banning Order, which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.596W.0/1">These details are already recorded, for example in the trainee's ASSET form, but are not collated centrally. Individual information is needed in relation to each trainee; but an overall picture can be obtained from research studies based on samples of trainees. Mental health data obtained by this method is included in the Youth Justice Board's 2005 publication Mental health needs and provision&quot; and data on literacy and school attendance in its 2001 survey An audit of education provision within the juvenile secure estate&quot;. These studies are available on the Board's website (<a href="http://www.youth-justice-board.gov.uk">www.youth-justice-board.gov.uk</a>). New research on school attendance is currently in hand. The development of electronic systems within the youth justice system should make it possible to collate a larger amount of information than can readily be done at present.</p>

	<p pid="b.603W.2/2">We work hard to distribute the guidelines on dealing with cases of forced marriage as widely as possible to police, education professionals and social workers. This year, the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) will also be producing guidelines for health professionals and registrars. As part of its core work, the FMU conducts an extensive programme of outreach work with statutory agencies. One of the objectives of this programme is to contribute to training on handling forced marriage cases and to support the implementation of the guidance documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.2/3">We are working with our colleagues from the Association of Chief Police Officers and the National Centre for Policing Excellence to look at how we monitor the implementation of the guidelines for police. Forced marriage is already built into the risk assessment framework for police. This is being supported by training and adopted by police forces around the country, within the domestic violence portfolio.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.6/1">It remains the Government's policy that the police service will promote equality, fairness and respect and provide a working environment where diversity is recognised to enable it to achieve a greater level of trust and confidence from all communities, which can also be achieved through better engagement with communities through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Policing.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.6/2">The Home Office and Police Service response to the Commission for Racial Equality Investigation into racism in the police is also a key element in improving the environment within the service and to making the service a more attractive option to those wishing to join.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.6/3">The Police Service continues to make progress against the Home Secretary's recruitment targets for 2009, and forces are committed to recruit from minority ethnic groups in proportion to, or at a level above, their representation in the local economically active population. Performance against this objective is a key performance indicator in the Policing Performance Assessment Framework. Since 1999, the percentage of police officers from minority ethnic communities has risen from 2 per cent. to 3.5 per cent., an increase of 2,497 minority ethnic officers. The latest figures show that minority ethnic staff make up 6.5 per cent. of the police staff total.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.6/4">The Home Office is working with the Police Service to accelerate the pace of change. The measures currently in hand include outreach programmes in police forces, engagement with student faith societies and black students' unions to encourage applications from minority ethnic graduates. We are also investigating the possibility of introducing weighted appointment criteria rewarding skills such as appropriate second languages. As part of the National Assessment Centre process we aim to ensure that assessment and selection panels include representatives from minority ethnic communities wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.6/5">Internally, measures are in place to increase female and minority ethnic applications to the High Potential Development Scheme. A learning and development strategy to improve performance in race and diversity was published in November 2004 which introduced the Police Race and Diversity Learning Programme which will ensure improvements in race and diversity through delivery of effective development.</p>
	<p pid="b.606W.6/6">In addition, a national exit interview questionnaire has been developed to encourage forces to capture the reasons for staff leaving the service, with the aim of further work being done to improve the overall retention rate and reduce the disparity in wastage rates for female and minority ethnic staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.2/1">The Government are determined to target those individuals involved in alcohol disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) to crack down on such behaviour. West Midlands police received &pound;192,000 from the Home Office and overall during the campaign police and trading standard officers carried out over 6,000 test purchase operations, dealt with more than 30,000 offences and made over 25,000 arrests. The police work that led to the success of AMEC will now continue on a daily basis as part of everyday mainstream police activities. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order&mdash;a Drinking Banning Order&mdash;which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.615W.2/1">In any given case, whether a prosecution can be brought will depend on the particular circumstances that pertain in that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/2">A person of any nationality who takes up arms against UK or allied forces in the United Kingdom is likely to commit an offence and the penalty will depend on the precise nature of the conduct the person has undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/3">As a general rule, the UK courts only have jurisdiction in respect of offences committed within the UK but there are a number of exceptions.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/4">Section 9 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 provides that if a subject of Her Majesty commits murder or manslaughter outside the UK, regardless of the nationality of the victim, he can be tried in the English courts. Section 10 provides that if a person is fatally injured outside England but dies in England, or vice versa, any offences associated with the death can be tried in the English courts. Although section 10 does not expressly limit its application to British subjects such a limitation has been implied in decided cases. These offences carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/5">Under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 the offence of torture can be tried by the English courts, regardless of the nationality of the offender and where the acts took place. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/6">Section 51 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 makes genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes offences under the law of England and Wales. The offence applies to acts in England and Wales, and to acts outside the UK by a UK national, a UK resident or a person subject to UK service jurisdiction. The maximum penalty is 30 years' imprisonment, unless the offence is the commission of murder, or an offence ancillary to murder, in which case the penalty is as for murder (life imprisonment) or, as the case may be, the penalty for the ancillary offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/7">The Geneva Conventions Act 1957 makes it an offence under UK law for any person, whatever his nationality and whether in or outside the UK to commit, aid, abet or procure a grave breach of any of the Conventions in the Schedules to the Act or the First Protocol (as set in Schedule five to the Act). The maximum penalty is 30 years' imprisonment, unless the offence is the commission of murder in which case the penalty is as for murder (life imprisonment).</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/8">Under section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883 (once it has been amended by the Terrorism Bill) it will be an offence to carry out certain acts preparatory to causing an explosion anywhere in the world. The preparatory acts must take place in the UK, a dependency or, in the case of a person who is a citizen of the UK and colonies, elsewhere. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/9">It is an element of the offences of high treason to levy war against the Queen in her realm or to be an adherent of the Queen's enemies in her realm giving them aid or comfort in the realm or elsewhere. To levy war against Her Majesty is also an element of treason felony.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/10">Enemies are subjects of all states against which Her Majesty has declared or proclaimed war, and the subjects of all states with which there are hostilities, whether or not war has been declared.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/11">Alien friends can be convicted of treason but alien enemies cannot. An alien who is resident within British territory owes allegiance to the Crown and can be liable for treason. An alien who has been resident but has left can be guilty of treason if he still enjoys the protection of the Crown, for example, by continuing to hold a passport. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/12">Sections 63A to 63D of the Terrorism Act 2000 make provision in relation to extra-territorial application of terrorist offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/13">Under section 63A, if a UK national or a UK resident does anything outside the UK which, if it had been done in the UK, would have been an offence under section 54 (weapons training) (section 54 will be removed from section 63A by the Terrorism Bill) or 56 to 61 (directing terrorist organisation, possession for terrorist purposes, collection of information and inciting terrorism overseas) he shall be guilty of that offence in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/14">The penalties are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/15" class="indent">Sections 54, 57 and 58: indictment, 10 years, a fine or both; summary, six months, fine up to the statutory maximum or both.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/16" class="indent">Section 56: life</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/17" class="indent">Section 59 to 61: The same as the penalty for the offences listed in subsections (2) of those sections.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/18">Under section 63B, if a UK national or UK resident does anything outside the UK as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism which, if it had been done in the UK would have amounted to one of the offences in section 63B(2), he shall be guilty of that offence. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 63B(2), of which the person is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/19">Under section 63C, if any person does anything outside the UK, as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism, to, or in relation to, a UK national, a UK resident or a protected person (as defined in section 63C(3)) and his action, if done in the UK would have constituted one of the offences in section 63C(2), he shall be guilty of that offence. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 63C(2), of which he is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/20">Section 63D relates to attacks on UK diplomatic and other premises. Under section 63D(1), if any person (1) does anything outside the UK, as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism; (2) his action is done in connection with an attack on relevant premises or a vehicle ordinarily used by protected persons; (3) the attack is made when a protected person is on or in the premises or vehicle; and (4) his action, if done in the UK, would amount to one of the offences listed in section 63D(2), he shall be guilty of that offence. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 63D(2), of which he is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/21">Under section 63D(3), if any person (1) does anything outside the UK, as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism; (2) his action consists of a threat of an attack on relevant premises or a vehicle ordinarily used by protected persons; (3) the attack is threatened to be made when a protected person is, or is likely to be, on or in the premises or vehicle; and (4) his action, if done in the UK, would amount to one of the offences listed in section 63D(4), he shall be guilty of that offence. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 63D(4), of which the person is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/22">The United Nations Personnel Act 1997 creates various offences of doing things against UN workers and vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/23">Section 1 provides that if any person, outside the UK, commit any of the offences listed in subsection (2), to or in relation to a UN worker, he is guilty of that offence in the UK. Those offences are murder, manslaughter, culpable homicide, rape, assault causing injury, kidnapping, abduction, false imprisonment, the offences under sections 18, 20 to 24, 28, 29, 30 and 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, and section two of the Explosive Substances Act 1883. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 1(2), of which the person is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/24">Section 2 outlaws attacks on UN premises and vehicles. A person will be guilty of the offences under section two of the Explosive Substances Act 1883, section one of the Criminal Damage Act 1971, article 3 of the Criminal Damage (Nl) Order 1977 or wilful fire-raising. The penalty is the penalty for the offence, listed in section 2(2), of which he is convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/25">Section 3 outlaws threats of attacks on UN workers. The penalty is a term not exceeding 10 years and not exceeding the penalty for the offence threatened.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/26">A UN worker is defined in section four. It includes those deployed as part of the military component of a UN operation. UN operation does not include action authorised by the Security Council as an enforcement action under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, in which UN workers are engaged as combatants against organised armed forces and to which the law of international armed conflict applies.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/27">Under section 4 of the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 it is an offence for a British subject to enlist in the service of a foreign state which is at war with another foreign state which is a friendly state&quot;. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.615W.2/28">As noted previously, Section 63A of the Terrorism Act extends the jurisdiction of Section 54 of that Act which relates to weapons training. The Terrorism Bill will remove section 54 from section 63A and provide instead that any person who does an act outside the UK which, if committed within the UK, would amount to an offence under section 54 shall be guilty of that offence. The Terrorism Bill creates further offences of training for terrorism (maximum penalty on indictment of ten years' imprisonment, a fine or both) and attendance at a place used for terrorist training (maximum penalty on indictment of ten years' imprisonment, a fine or both). In either case the nationality of the offender is not material. A person can be liable for action occurring outside the UK in both cases, but in relation to the offence of training for terrorism the extension of jurisdiction is limited to offences committed by reference to the commission, preparation or instigation of Convention offences (as defined in Schedule one to the Bill).</p>
