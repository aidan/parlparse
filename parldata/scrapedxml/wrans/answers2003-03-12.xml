	<p pid=".254W.0/36">The figures reflect provisional funds allocated to DVLA for 2002&ndash;03 to 2005&ndash;06 from the Department of Transport's spending review settlements and other agreed changes. Income includes revenue from sale of registration marks and other income paid over to the Exchequer as Consolidated Fund Extra Receipts but excludes Vehicle Excise Duty collected by DVLA.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.0/37">DVLA's annual report shows unit cost efficiency gains in core activities averaging 3.4 per cent. a year. Transaction volumes have grown by an average of some 3 per cent. a year. From 1998 the Agency's core operations were extended by a number of major policy changes and business delivery improvements like photocard driving licences and graduated vehicle excise duty, which resulted in significant cost increases.</p>
	<p pid=".254W.0/38">In addition, 1998&ndash;99 saw the introduction of a fee for vehicle first registrations and an increase in demand for personalised registration marks.</p>

	<p pid=".254W.3/4" class="indent">(c) increased workload involving initiatives to improve customer service delivery such as the introduction of extended hours in the Agency's call centre and growth in business volumes (23 per cent. higher than in 1998&ndash;99).

	<p pid=".254W.6/2">London Underground (LU) are currently implementing a programme of work to modify all trains in the Central Line fleet. LU is working with the independent Health and Safety Executive to implement a robust and safe solution. Services will be phased back in as soon as possible, starting with a shuttle service on the eastern end of the line. This will be followed by a limited service on the western end of the line. Finally, when LU has modified enough trains, a full service will resume.</p>

The company envisages only a handful of extra vehicles will be needed after MailRail is taken out of service, as a high proportion of the mail carried will be transported on existing vehicle routes.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.2/2">Royal Mail is continually striving to reduce the impact of its vehicular traffic in London by contributing to reductions in congestion and CO2 emissions. The company has already seen a dramatic reduction in the number of miles and journeys undertaken by Royal Mail vehicles in the capital. For example, the switch of sorting NW postcode mail to Greenford from the London North Mail Centre, in Almeida Street, N1, cut the maximum journey time from 45 to just 25 minutes.</p>

	<p pid=".261W.6/2">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".261W.6/3"><i>(a)</i> Analysis of Wetland Bird Survey count data for 32 wetland bird species by the British Trust for Ornithology shows that for all 32 species, population trends had either increased or stabilised for the five winters to 1999&ndash;2000. Therefore, in the non-breeding season at least, these birds are not suffering decline in Great Britain. This is evidence of the effectiveness of the UK network of 243 Special Protection Areas (SPA) classified under the EC Wild Birds Directive; the UK series of 144 Ramsar sites; and the many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) notified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, for their wetland bird interests.</p>
	<p pid=".261W.6/4"><i>(b)</i> and<i> (c)</i> A high proportion, in some cases all, of the national and international populations of wintering and migrating wetland birds utilise the protected sites of the UK SPA network. In winter it holds an average of over 2,186,000 non-breeding waterbirds. The habitat protection provided for these birds is a major contribution to their international conservation. Many of the same sites are additionally designated as Ramsar sites and all (on land in England and the great majority elsewhere) are notified as SSSIs.</p>
	<p pid=".261W.6/5"><i>(d)</i> The principal form of protection for rare plants is through the designation of their habitat&mdash;either as Special Areas of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as Ramsar sites, or as SSSI. The Government Biodiversity Action Plan has identified a number of water plants for priority action. A programme of active management for these species and those listed in the 1992 Directive is being funded, mainly through English Nature's Species Recovery Programmes. Results for some species, such as floating water plantain, are very encouraging.</p>

	<p pid=".263W.5/2">Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, those service providers who provide services to the public have since 1999 been required to make reasonable adjustments to allow disabled people to access their services. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> they will also be required to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of their premises that would otherwise make access impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.5/3">Those managing village halls or running activities there are subject to the Act in the same way as other service providers; but the test of reasonableness takes account of the provider's financial resources, and there should be no question of village halls being forced to close. However, it is very much in the public interest that activities taking place in village halls should be accessible to disabled people living in rural communities.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.5/4">Lead responsibility for funding renovation of village halls lies with the local community, with help from local authorities, national funding agencies, and charitable sources. No earmarked funds are available to help meet any costs resulting from the Disability Discrimination Act. However, very substantial public funds are available to help village halls: around &pound;17 million last year from the Community Fund, and a similar amount in total from other sources.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.5/5">A draft Government position paper on the funding and regulation of village halls was produced by my Department for a meeting last week of the stakeholder group I mentioned above: once this has been revised I will place a copy in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".268W.8/2">When planning their satellite system, service providers take steps to overcome the effect that normally expected variations in weather conditions may have through careful system design and the use of appropriately sized satellite dishes.

	<p pid=".269W.2/2">The provision of information on credit card statements is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974, and in particular by the Consumer (Running-Account Credit Information) Regulations 1983 (SI No. 1570/83). These require statements provided for running-account credit agreements, such as credit cards, to contain the following information:</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/3" class="indent">any opening balance on the account;</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/4" class="indent">the date of any movement on the account;</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/5" class="indent">the amount of any payment on the account;</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/6" class="indent">the amount of any drawing on the account; and</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/7" class="indent">the amount of any interest or other charges on the account.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/8">Where a statement shows that interest has been applied to the account, it must contain either sufficient information for the customer to be able to check the calculation of that interest; details of the rate of interest that has been applied; or a statement indicating that the rate of interest applied will be provided upon request.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/9">The form and content of consumer credit advertising is governed by the Consumer Credit (Advertisements) Regulations 1989 (SI 1989/1125). These are enforced by the Office of Fair Trading, and I understand that the OFT has investigated a number of credit providers who have advertised interest-bearing agreements as being interest-free.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/10">The practice of some credit card providers of reducing the minimum required monthly repayment is one that I highlighted in my response in January this year to the Second Report of the Governments' Task Force on Tackling Overindebtedness. I stated then that I was worried about the effects that this practice can have on consumers, and in particular that it can only lead to an escalation of the total amount owed and the time required to repay it. I stated that the Government would therefore be considering how consumers might be given better information about the effects of a low minimum payment.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/11">To that end, and as part of the review of the Consumer Credit Act that I launched in July 2001, I shall be publishing a consultation document on the simplification of the credit advertising regulations in the summer. As well as inviting comments on minimum payments, this will also look at how consumers can get better information in general about credit cards that will enable them to compare offers from different providers. In advance of this consultation, the DTI is in regular discussion with the credit industry and consumer bodies on the scope for a common format for the provision of key information, including details of interest-free periods and the calculation and advertising of APRs.</p>

If a tour operator offers and charges for a service which guarantees the seating arrangements, then this is a commercial matter for that operator.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.5/1">Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare disease and the Ministry of Defence has not specifically commissioned scientific research into the prevalence of it among United Kingdom veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict. However, through the independent Medical Research Council (MRC), the Ministry of Defence has funded a controlled study of neuromuscular symptoms experienced by United Kingdom Servicemen. Some findings were published by the researchers in a paper entitled: &quot;Neurophysiologic analysis of neuromuscular symptoms in UK Gulf war veterans&quot; in the journal <i>Neurology</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-26">26 November 2002</phrase>. The researchers reported that they had found no neurophysiologic evidence for a specific neuromuscular disorder that could be linked to previous deployment to the Gulf. At the Ministry of Defence's request, the MRC will shortly provide advice on appropriate areas for future research in the field of Gulf veterans illnesses. The MRC's advice will be published. The MRC is aware of the suggestion that United States Gulf veterans are at greater risk of developing MND than those who did not deploy but the underlying research has not yet been published in the scientific literature. The Ministry of Defence's future Gulf veterans' illnesses research programme will be firmly based on the MRC's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.6/3">While not an abatement to service pay, in formulating its recommendations the review body would have applied an adjustment, where appropriate, to the comparator salaries used as the basis for officers' and warrant officers' pay during this period to take account of the relative benefits of the armed forces pension scheme. No similar adjustment was required to be made at that time in respect of comparator salaries for other ranks because most service personnel at this level did not complete the necessary 22 years' service then required to qualify for a pension.</p>

	<p pid=".277W.9/1">The Ministry of Defence's aim, in line with wider Government policy, is to create a non-smoking working environment in so far as it reflects the wishes of staff. This requires surveys to be undertaken and the wishes of staff to be established, unless smoking is prohibited, for operational reasons, in specific areas. Detailed guidance on this policy is promulgated in the Department's Health and Safety Handbook Joint Service Publication 375, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".277W.9/2">The policy is under constant review to reflect current Health and Safety Commission/Executive guidance.</p>

	<p pid=".279W.6/3">In December 2002 the Court of Appeal reviewed the sentences imposed on two defendants convicted for the manslaughter of their partners by reason of provocation. The Law Officers referred the sentences to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that they appeared to be unduly lenient and that the existing sentencing guidelines did not appear to reflect adequately the seriousness of the offence. Among the other observations in its judgment, in declining to increase the sentences imposed on these defendants the Court of Appeal held that it could not consider whether new guidelines were justified in this difficult area without advice from the Sentencing Advisory Panel.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.6/1">The UK takes a strong lead in the international debate on debt relief. The issue is discussed at most major international meetings, including the Annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World bank, which are attended by representatives from all member countries, including developing countries. The UK will use the forthcoming spring meetings of the IMF and World bank to push for increased efforts on debt relief.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/2">The staffs of the IMF and World bank have prepared a paper on the options for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries to obtain technical assistance to facilitate the resolution of disputes, including those with commercial creditors. The UK will press for a full discussion of this issue at the spring meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/3">The UK also believes that where countries have to contend with external shocks, such as sharp falls in the price of key export commodities, we must form a broad consensus on the need for topping-up at completion point to ensure a lasting exit from unsustainable debt. We will work with our international partners to develop more realistic and generous rules for its provision, including agreement that the calculation of topping-up should exclude voluntary bilateral provision of additional 100 per cent. relief, to ensure that this functions as truly additional relief.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/4">The UK has also been leading the debate on how to raise additional finance for development, including debt relief. The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that will double the amount of development assistance in the years to 2015 from US$50 billion to $100 billion. This money will be disbursed mainly in the form of grants, including debt relief. This proposal is being worked up through the G7 and other forums in the run up to the G8 heads of state summit in June.</p>
	<p pid=".280W.6/5">Officials meet regularly with their counterparts in other developed countries, and in a variety of international organizations, to discuss a wide range of issues.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.2/1">The UK always goes further than is required under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC) and provides 100 per cent. debt relief. Under the HIPC initiative a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches Decision Point and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at Completion Point. To reach Decision Point and demonstrate their commitment to poverty reduction, a country must prepare an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), to get to Completion Point they need to develop a full PRSP, and usually make progress in implementing it for one year.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/2">Of the 42 countries classified as HIPCs four are currently expected to have a sustainable burden of debt after traditional debt relief. Of the remaining 38 countries, 26 have now reached Decision Point with US$62 billion in debt relief committed compared with the $100 billion total. Six of these countries have reached Completion Point and have had the totality of their debts owed to the UK irrevocably cancelled. For the 20 countries still at Decision Point the UK provides 100 per cent. relief on debt service payments, and stands ready to irrevocably cancel their stock of debt at Completion Point. Out of 12 countries yet to reach Decision Point, eight are currently affected by conflict and this makes their progress in the HIPC initiative difficult. For these countries yet to reach Decision Point the UK holds in trust any debt service payments made until they can be returned to fund poverty reduction. The UK is the only creditor to operate this policy and has called on others to follow its lead.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/3">The HIPCs that have reached completion point are: Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/4">The HIPCs that have reached decision point are: Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, The Republic of the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tom&eacute; et Pr&iacute;ncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.2/5">The HIPCs yet to reach completion point are: Burma*, Burundi*, Central African Republic*, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo*, Republic of the Congo*, C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire, Lao PDR, Liberia*, Somalia*, Sudan* and Togo.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.0/1">Diplomatic links with Libya were re-established in July 1999, and since then, our embassy has been active in developing links with various human rights organisations in the country. However, access for international human rights NGOs to visit has been rare, and it is difficult to obtain detailed information on the various human rights issues raised by the hon. Member. There have been some positive signs: in September 2002, the Libyan Government announced the release of all political prisoners other than those it has linked to al-Qaeda; in January 2003, they commuted the death sentence on three Ghanaians and one Nigerian; and earlier this year, the Qadhafi Foundation for Charitable Associations launched an anti-torture campaign. We are also encouraged by Colonel Qadhafi's reference, in a speech on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-31">31 August 2002</phrase>, to the need to discuss abolition of the political &quot;People's&quot; courts. However, we remain concerned about the overall human rights situation in Libya and encourage the Libyans to show they are committed to improving their record during their high-profile chairmanship of the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights (CHR). In the meantime, we are discussing with EU partners whether to make reference to Libya at this year's CHR.</p>

The EU has agreed that the EU-Africa summit will be held at the earliest possible date; Portugal has renewed its offer to host it. We are committed to the EU-Africa dialogue and discussions with African partners are being taken forward by the EU troika. African countries recognise that the summit could not be held in April 2003 because it would not have been possible to achieve the broadest participation at the highest level. They also acknowledge the commitment of this Government towards Africa, as shown by our significant development programme, which will rise to &pound;1 billion per annum by 2006, and our support to Africa in a number of multilateral fora, including as one of the prime movers behind the G8 Africa Action Plan announced at Kananaskis in June last year.</p>

	<p pid=".293W.7/1">The Government appreciate that the cost of child care can be high, especially for parents with babies or young children needing full day care and that there are regional differences in the cost.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.7/2">Working parents, subject to the level of their income, may receive support through the child care tax credit element of the Working Families Tax Credit or the Disabled Person's Tax Credit (Working Tax Credit from April 2003). Tax credit is rightly targeted at lower and middle income families who may use a range of types of child care.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.7/3">The cost of child care reported in the Department for Education and Skills 2001&ndash;02 audit shows an England average of &pound;101.01 a week for full day care and &pound;132.49 for London&mdash;the region with the highest child care costs. The child care tax credit provides for up to 70 per cent. of costs of eligible child care. It can pay up to &pound;94.50 a week for one child (where the child care cost is &pound;135), and up to &pound;140 a week for two or more children (where the cost is &pound;200). No Government have provided the kind of direct support for the costs of child care that is delivered by the child care tax credit. &pound;1 million a day is now spent on supporting parents with child care costs.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.7/4">In addition, support is also available through various grants and access funds for parents undertaking further and higher education, for participants on the New Deals and those receiving Jobseeker's Allowance. Lone Parents participating in the New Deal for Lone Parents programme, can receive assistance with the costs of registered child care while attending job interviews, approved training and meetings with their Personal Advisors.</p>
	<p pid=".293W.7/5">The DfES and the Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the cost of child care to ensure good quality affordable and accessible child care is available for all those who need it.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.2/1">No targets are set to measure educational aspiration. However, this Department has strategies that are aimed at helping to raise educational attainment in coalfield and other areas. In &quot;14&ndash;19: opportunity and excellence&quot; (published <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-21">21 January 2003</phrase>), we outlined our plans to transform the learning experience between 14 and 19 so that young people have a greater choice and flexibility to follow coherent learning pathways that reflect their individual strengths and aspirations. We believe that increased choice and flexibility, and improved coherence and quality of programmes, will help to raise young people's aspirations and those of their parents and wider communities. To support delivery and give focus to our proposals for 14&ndash;19 reform, we have set ourselves targets to increase young people's participation and attainment in education. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".294W.2/2" class="indent">compared with 2002, the proportion of 19-year-olds achieving 5 GCSE grades A* to C, or the equivalent vocational qualifications, will rise by 3 percentage points by 2004, and a further 3 percentage points by 2006;</p>

	<p pid=".300W.2/1">For English and Welsh domiciled students the maximum means tested loan in 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;3,090 for a student residing at their parent's home; and otherwise &pound;3,905, unless for studying in London, where it is &pound;4,815. Eligible medical students from lower income families on a six year course will be entitled to these levels of loan, increased for inflation, for four years. Many will also be entitled to a further Higher Education Grant of &pound;1,000 for four years from October 2004. In year five medical students are entitled to a non means tested reduced rate loan (at 2002&ndash;03 prices) of &pound;1,465 if they are living with a parent, &pound;1,915 otherwise, and &pound;2,365 if they are studying in London. In the final year these figures reduce to &pound;1,075, &pound;1,400 and &pound;1,725 respectively. In addition, in years five and six English domiciled medical students may receive non repayable annual means tested bursaries from the Department of Health, or if Welsh domiciled from the Welsh Assembly Government, of up to &pound;1,758 (living with parent), &pound;2,148 (otherwise) or &pound;2,640 (living in London).</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/2">After implementation of the White Paper proposals, the annual fee contribution for four years will vary from &pound;0-&pound;3,000 per year but the upfront cost to students and parents would be reduced from the current maximum of &pound;1,100 since fees would start to be repaid only after graduation (and achievement of an income threshold of &pound;15,000 per year). Students on lower incomes would continue as now to receive a grant for fees of &pound;1,100 (increased annually for inflation) and their loan for fees would not exceed &pound;1,900 a year. In cases where the Access Regulator agrees higher fee levels than &pound;1,100, university bursary schemes will further reduce the cost of fees to some students on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.2/3">Fee support for English domiciled medical students in years five and six is the responsibility of the Department of Health. Currently students pay no contributions to fees. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that, whatever the future levels of tuition fees, they will take measures to ensure that any increase in the cost of university courses will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.</p>

	<p pid=".302W.2/1">My Department recently completed a consultation on developing the role of school support staff, which included proposals for enhancing the role of support staff. These proposals included the development of a 'higher-level teaching assistant' role, for individuals who would have the skills and training to work with whole classes of pupils in the absence of, but under the supervision of, a qualified teacher. We have also recently completed a consultation on draft regulations and guidance under Section 133 of the Education Act 2002. These regulations outline the role of the qualified teacher and set out conditions under which individuals without qualified teacher status can undertake aspects of that role. This area was previously unregulated so the new regulations will strengthen the safeguards in place to protect the quality of pupils' education. My officials are currently considering the responses to the two consultations and the Department will be issuing revised regulations and further guidance in the near future, taking into account the consultation responses and the details set out in the recent National Agreement between the Government, school work force unions and the local government employers.</p>

	<p pid=".303W.0/2">Enhanced disclosures differ from standard disclosures in that in addition to information about convictions, which is obtained from the Police National Computer, they may also contain information provided by a local police force. Most often, this will be a police force in whose area an applicant has lived for the five years preceding the date of application. This information is commonly referred to as &quot;local information&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.0/3">The Police Act 1997, which established the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), sets out when such information should be released. Essentially, a local police force may release local information if it thinks it may be relevant to the position sought. The question of whether information is or may be relevant is solely a matter for the local police force, and over which the CRB has no control.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.0/4">Local information can be released in two forms&mdash;approved information and additional information. Decisions about the form in which information is released are again solely a matter for the local police force and over which the CRB has no control. The local police force decisions are based upon the nature of the information and the circumstances of particular cases. Approved and additional information have previously been termed 'soft' or 'non-conviction' information respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.0/5">Approved information is local police force information released under section 115 (7) of the Police Act and is information that has been approved to be included on an enhanced disclosure. This is printed on both copies of the disclosure, (i.e. which go to the employer and the employee). The applicant will normally be aware of the information already, which might for example be information about an impending prosecution. At present only some three in every 1,000 enhanced disclosures contain approved information.</p>
	<p pid=".303W.0/6">Additional information is released under section 115 (8) of the Police Act and is information that has been authorised to be released to the registered body only in the interests of the prevention or detection of crime. This is released in the form of a separate letter sent to the registered body and arrives in a different envelope from the disclosure. The information is not made available to the applicant and does not appear on the disclosure. The disclosure issued to the registered body contains a box on the top right-hand side referring to the letter sent under separate cover. This warns the registered body that they should wait for the letter before reaching a recruitment decision. The information released by the police in these circumstances is highly confidential. Although CRB will know when such letters are released, they do not see the contents and are not sent a copy. At present only some four in every 10,000 enhanced disclosure applications end with the release of additional information.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.0/2">All disclosure applications are processed at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) sites at Liverpool and Darwen, Blackburn. The work being undertaken at, Chennai (Madras) involves manual inputting of personal information such as name, date of birth and addresses during the past five years, provided by individuals on their application forms. This work is undertaken at the beginning of the process, and no information drawn from police sources or other data sources is involved.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.0/3">This arrangement was introduced as part of a package of measures to improve the performance of the CRB. It has proved highly effective in enabling large numbers of paper application forms to be processed, with timely, cost effective and accurate data capture, and eliminating backlogs from this critical stage of the CRB process.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.0/4">Due to the fact that the CRB is still receiving around 78 per cent. of applications on paper and that the current data entry system works well the CRB will continue to capture the information from hand-written forms in Chennai. When the CRB introduces an electronic application channel this situation will be reviewed. There is no additional cost to this Department in the work being carried out in Chennai for data inputting. The costs are borne entirely by Capita as part of their contractual arrangements with the CRB.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.0/5">To ensure the data processed by Hays in India would be secure, senior members of CRB staff have conducted two extensive site inspections. The inspections were carried out in accordance with the Information Commissioners (1C) guidance relating to overseas transfer. On inspection, the site satisfied both the IC's and the CRB stringent requirements for security, data protection and data integrity.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.0/6">The data transferred is that contained on the disclosure application form. The form is scanned, encrypted and then transferred via a secure link to the site in Chennai. On receipt of the scanned image, the data are entered on to a system compatible with those used by the CRB to process disclosure applications. On completion the data is again encrypted and transferred back to the United Kingdom via the secure link. Hays only retain the data for the duration of time taken to input and transfer to the United Kingdom. Thereafter, the data are destroyed.</p>

	<p pid=".305W.3/1">In his statement, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said it would be inappropriate to launch basic disclosures until higher priority categories of applicant for higher level disclosures are seeing their needs fully accommodated. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is concentrating its resources on the standard and enhanced disclosures until the demand for higher level disclosures is fully met and that applicants for such disclosures receive a satisfactory service. Basic disclosures will not be introduced until these objectives have been achieved. In light of the operational difficulties that the CRB has experienced since the launch of the higher level disclosure service, the decision was taken to re-assess the anticipated demand for basic disclosures in conjunction with a review of the business process model. No additional resources have been directed towards Capita for standard and enhanced disclosures, following the decision to postpone the launch of basic disclosures.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.2/1">The research undertaken enabled a baseline demand figure to be agreed and confirmed and assumptions validated from a number of different sources. An assessment of the research indicates that the baseline figure produced for the first year of operations is reasonably close to actual demand. However, it now seems less certain that much higher levels of forecast future demand will be achieved, although this has yet to be proven.</p>

	<p pid=".306W.5/1">During the early part of 2001, as a major part of the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB's) publicity campaign to raise awareness of the disclosure service and to encourage registration, the CRB held 22 seminars in nine venues throughout England and Wales. In all, over 8,000 organisations were invited to attend, including users of the existing police based arrangements. Around 4,687 delegates attended and the overall satisfaction rating was &quot;very informative&quot;. The events proved very successful in raising awareness of the new service with over 3,557 organisations registered from the start. The total cost of this campaign was &pound;694,000. It was during the registration seminars that many organisations with significant stature and strong relevance to the CRB voiced their concerns over the proposed telephone only application channel. The CRB did not carry out a formal paper consultation exercise on this matter.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.2/1">Illegal immigrants cannot apply for work permits, and it is an offence knowingly to employ an illegal entrant to the United Kingdom. Where an employer applies for a work permit for an overseas national who is already in the United Kingdom, Work Permits (UK) will first consider whether the application meets the criteria of the work permit arrangements before considering whether, under the Immigration Rules, the overseas national may be granted leave to remain for the purpose of work permit employment. Under the Immigration Rules, only those who were admitted to the United Kingdom as a work permit holder, as a student or student nurse or as a postgraduate doctor or dentist may be granted an extension of stay for the purpose of work permit employment. Granting such leave in any other circumstance can only be considered on a discretionary basis. Such discretion will not normally be exercised where the overseas national has had an adverse Immigration history.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.2/1">The risk that Iraqi forces may deploy chemical or biological weapons is a very grave one. Advice from the Department of Health and Ministry of Defence is that, given the unpredictable range of weapons that Saddam might use, only sophisticated protective suits and training would provide adequate protection to the threat. It is not possible for my Department to provide this training and protection to large numbers of Iraqi people.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/2">In terms of response to any use of chemical or biological weapons, only highly skilled and well-equipped parts of the military or specialised agencies, who have been trained for such environments and on the use of protective suits, would have the capacity to operate. My Department is in continuing discussions with the Ministry of Defence about the provision of humanitarian response under a range of eventualities. DFID has a contingency reserve on which we are ready to draw for any emergency situation in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.5/1">60 per cent. of the Iraqi people are totally dependent on the UN Oil For Food Programme for essential supplies, including food. We are working to try to minimise the impact of any military action on this programme and, in the event of disruption to it, to helping re-establishing it as quickly as possible. We are also drawing up contingency plans to support the provision of relief by those best placed to do so, to cover any period during which the programme would not be able to function. We have so far committed &pound;10 million to support contingency planning by UN agencies and NGOs, which includes some prepositioning of supplies. There might be a phase when only military forces are fully able to operate in Iraq and thus would have primary responsibility for the initial delivery of humanitarian relief. My Department has been advising the Ministry of Defence on these issues for some time.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.5/1">Registered social landlords can apply for Housing Corporation funding to provide housing for people fleeing domestic violence. Bids for funds must meet local and regional priorities for housing. Revenue support for these schemes is currently available from the supported housing management grant administered by the Housing Corporation. From April 2003 this becomes part of the Supporting People budget administered by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.5/2">Both local authorities and registered social landlords are encouraged in the Relationship Breakdown Guidance* to have clauses against domestic violence in their tenancy agreements. Increased safety measures and effective multi-agency working with the police are suggested as alternatives. Where a victim of domestic violence is a tenant of a local authority or registered social landlord it is possible for that person to be transferred to alternative accommodation via a management transfer, although there may be issues of tenancy rights to resolve. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to improve the opportunities for mobility for all social tenants, particularly from high pressure areas to those where the demand for social rented accommodation is less. People who experience domestic violence could benefit from the opportunities for mobility for all social tenants.</p>

This will form part of the single regional housing pot. A further announcement will be made shortly about the detailed allocation procedures for this additional funding.</p>

	<p pid=".327W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not collect social housing rents data at ward level. Therefore no such assessment has been made. However, at a national average level, local authority and housing association rents are expected to go up over the 10 year rent restructuring period much more slowly than over the preceding 10 years. 30 per cent. of the Government's national rents formula is based on January 1999 relative property values, with the remaining 70 per cent. taking account of local earnings for affordability. The formula rent is therefore not affected by house price inflation since January 1999. In addition, absolute caps on formula rents, and limits on individual rent rises were introduced in autumn 2001 to address the concerns that formula rents would otherwise cause affordability problems for a small number of tenants. The housing benefit system forms an additional safeguard for those on the lowest incomes.</p>

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly be issuing guidance to local authorities on preparing their five-year strategies, and this will emphasise the importance of making these strategic links to ensuring that service users' needs are properly met.</p>

One of the key announcements is the establishment of a Regional Housing Board.

The Board will advise Ministers on the allocation of this new single pot so that investment is targeted more effectively on regional and local priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.8/3">The national plan also identifies tools and actions to tackle low demand more widely, including: building on existing regeneration programmes such as Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and New Deal for Communities; proposals to speed up compulsory purchase of land and property; increasing the minimum payments made to people whose homes are compulsorily purchased under the 'Home Loss' scheme from &pound;1,500 to &pound;2,600; legislating to allow local authorities to license private landlords in low demand areas; and launching a new EU approved 'Gap Funding' housing scheme to pump prime regeneration in deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid=".330W.2/1">The bulk of Government support for local authorities housing capital spend is provided through the Major Repairs Allowance (MRA), which is ring-fenced for use on council housing, and the housing Annual Capital Guideline (ACG). The housing ACG, which is allocated as part of the Single Capital Pot, provides support for either improvements to existing housing (council or private sector) or provision of new affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.2/2">Redcar and Cleveland's housing ACG for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;2 million; the total for the five Tees Valley authorities (Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Darlington and Stockton on Tees) for 2003&ndash;04 amounts to &pound;10.6 million. These figures are not directly comparable with allocations for 2002&ndash;03 as they no longer include an element assumed to be funded from authorities useable capital receipts. After taking account of this change, resources going to Tees Valley are estimated to have increased by 5&ndash;10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.2/3">Redcar and Cleveland no longer receives an MRA as the council housing stock transferred to Coast and County Housing in July 2002. The 2003&ndash;04 MRA allocations for other Tees Valley authorities total &pound;21.3 million. These are formula-based allocations that depend on the number and type of dwellings owned by the council.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.2/4">It should also be noted that the provisions of the Regulatory Reform Order on Housing Renewal, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-06">6 June 2002</phrase>, gave local authorities much greater discretion on how they can provide assistance for housing renewal.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.2/5">Lastly, HIP resources are only a part of the resources made available by Government to tackle issues of deprivation, including housing. Most notably &pound;35.3 million is available to Tees Valley authorities under the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (including &pound;7.8 million for Redcar and Cleveland) and Hartlepool and Middlesbrough both benefit from New Deal for Communities moneys. The latter amounts to &pound;52 million in West Middlesbrough and &pound;54 million in Hartlepool, of which &pound;12.5 million and &pound;10.5 million respectively are earmarked for housing and environment spend.</p>

	<p pid=".333W.3/1">We have not conducted a comparative evaluation of outcomes between the New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus. The client groups for the programmes have very different characteristics and the programmes themselves are not identical. People aged between 18 and 24 can join the New Deal for Young People at six months of unemployment. In contrast, individuals are eligible for New Deal 25 plus following a period of 18 months or 18 out of 21 months of unemployment. As New Deal 25 plus participants have faced longer terms of unemployment, and hence greater barriers to work, fewer job outcomes through subsidised employment are likely.</p>

In addition, a person may work for less than 16 hours a week and earn up to and including &pound;67.50 from a week for 26 weeks. This can be extended for a further 26 weeks where a job broker, disability employment advisor, or personal adviser supports the extension.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.0/1">Acrylamide has been found to occur in a wide range of home-cooked and processed foods, including chips and crisps. It has not been found in uncooked or boiled foods, and appears to be formed during cooking by methods such as frying and baking.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.0/2">Acrylamide has been shown to cause various types of cancer in laboratory animals, although not of the bowel, bladder and kidney. It is considered to have the potential to cause cancer in humans, but a link has not been proven.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.0/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) considers that exposure to acrylamide should be kept as low as reasonably practicable and is commissioning research and surveillance that will minimise the amounts occurring in food. Meanwhile the FSA advice remains that on the basis of current evidence people should eat a balanced diet including a variety of fruit and vegetables, and that as part of a balanced diet people should moderate their consumption of fried and fatty foods.</p>

	<p pid=".340W.2/1">Influenza is a serious disease that can be fatal, particularly in the elderly, and influenza vaccines have a significant benefit in helping to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease. As with any vaccine or medicine, influenza vaccines are not without possible side-effects in some recipients. The known side-effects of influenza vaccines are listed in the product information available to general practitioners and other health professionals and available in the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries compendium of data sheets and summaries of product characteristics and the electronic medicines compendium.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.2/2">The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee of Safety of Medicines keeps the safety of all vaccines under continual review. The MCA is not aware of any evidence to support reported claims that immunisation with influenza vaccines may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease or other related mental health disorders.</p>
	<p pid=".340W.2/3">Some neurological conditions have been rarely reported in association with influenza vaccines and these are listed in the product information. These are neuralgia, convulsions, encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. These rare risks are far outweighed by the benefits of influenza vaccine in protecting against influenza virus infection and its complications.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.0/1">The Department does not collect data from individual mental health trusts on the number of investigations that take place into patient deaths or on staff who are suspended regarding patient deaths. All serious untoward incidents are investigated by the relevant trust and the suspension of staff is a disciplinary issue dealt with at local level. If there is a homicide by a person in the care of a mental health trust, it is obligatory to hold an independent inquiry under HSG(94)27.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/2">The Department is not aware of any problem in the reporting of serious untoward incidents by mental health trusts. All trusts are required to report serious incidents to strategic health authorities and to the relevant Directorate of Health and Social Care/Regional Director of Public Health and the Department of Health. In such cases, the Department works closely with all relevant organisations to ensure that advice and support is provided to enable the service to learn lessons, which can prevent further incidents occurring. The development of the new Commission for Health Audit and Inspection, and the integration within it of the Mental Health Act Commission, will ensure an even stronger focus on mental health issues for the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/3">The Department funds the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness to ensure that everyone involved with mental health services learns and implements lessons from the factors associated with serious incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.0/4">The Government have also established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to improve the safety of NHS patient care by introducing a national reporting and learning system for adverse events. Guidance on the introduction of new arrangements will be issued when the system is rolled out, from summer 2003. In future, all serious service failures or dysfunction will be subject to a full root cause analysis to establish what went wrong, to learn lessons and to take appropriate action. Reports of all incidents, including those subject to a root cause analysis, will be made to the NPSA. This overview will enable the NPSA to identify trends and patterns of avoidable adverse events, learn lessons that can be fed back to the service and produce solutions to prevent further harm occurring.</p>

The general practitioner remains the first port of call for anyone suffering from mental health problems. The Department published guidance to help GPs know more about the most effective treatments in the mental health national service framework and in specific guidance on psychological therapies and counselling. These are available on our website at <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/mentalhealth">www.doh.qov.uk/mentalhealth</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.2/1">Patients with muscular dystrophy (MD) can take advantage of a range of primary, secondary and tertiary services available. Children with MD form a considerable part of the caseload for children's community nursing services and many receive services from children's hospices. The children's national service framework will develop new national standards across the National Health Service and social services for children, including those with MD. The new standards will help to ensure better access and smoother progression in the provision of services for children, from initial contact with the NHS, via a general practitioner's surgery or NHS hospital, through to social services support.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.2/2">Clinical and laboratory services for the diagnosis of MD are available through existing networks of regional genetics centres. In January 2002, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health, announced the spending of &pound;11 million to boost capacity in NHS genetics services. This should help patients with muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.2/3">There is no specific treatment for any of the forms of MD. Physical therapy and corrective orthopaedic surgery may be needed to improve the quality of life in some cases.</p>

	<p pid=".346W.5/2">Arthritis and rheumatism together account for one quarter of visits to general practitioners. A general practitioner will decide if to refer a patient to a specialist team of rheumatologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. They will provide the most effective care and treatment for arthritic patients especially those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.5/3">Hydrotherapy is one form of treatment that a physiotherapist might choose for a patient's condition and access is through this route. However, hydrotherapy pools do not exist in all areas, so access could be limited for this reason. Referral to physiotherapy is usually through the GP, consultant or, in some cases, through direct referral from the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.5/4">Access to orthopaedic services for elective care is through referral to an orthopaedic consultant by the patient's general practitioner. The Modernisation Agency is running two programmes, which aim to improve patient access to orthopaedic care. The &quot;Action on Orthopaedics&quot; programme has a number of pilot sites across the country and is gathering information on best practice with the objective of showing the improvements in patients' access that can be achieved through an integrated approach within health communities. The orthopaedic services collaborative is a quality improvement initiative and has the participation of nearly two thirds of the 177 orthopaedic services departments in England examining potential changes that might be made in their processes and systems to bring about optimal outcomes and improved patient care.</p>
	<p pid=".346W.5/5">Through improvements in general hospital care and especially through the new single assessment process, older people's health care needs will be properly targeted, ensuring that the services that are provided are most appropriate to their needs, including people with arthritis.</p>

	<p pid=".349W.2/2">There are no current plans to set up a specialist centre of excellence within the national health service for dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. Health authorities have a responsibility to provide services to meet the mental health needs of all those who are eligible. Decisions about treatment and care are taken on the basis of an individualised assessment of needs, the patients wishes, the evidence base for effective treatment and available resources.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.2/3">The general practitioner remains the first port of call for anyone suffering from mental health problems. The Department published guidance to help GPs know more about the most effective treatments in the mental health national service framework and in specific guidance on psychological therapies and counselling. These are available on our website at <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/mentalhealth">www.doh.qov.uk/mentalhealth</a>.</p>

NICE issued its guidance on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-22">22 March 2002</phrase>, which recommended the use of etanercept for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and etanercept and infliximab for adult rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.8/3">NICE issued guidance on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-26">26 July 2001</phrase> on the use of four drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis to the national health service in England and Wales. The four drugs, celecoxib, etodolac, rofecoxib and meloxicam, are Cox II selective inhibitors and are a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for short-term treatment of acute inflammation in joints caused by arthritis. They recommended they be considered in preference to standard treatments only when there is a high risk of patients suffering from gastrointestinal problems as a side effect of treatment.</p>

They recommended that metal on metal hip resurfacing be considered as an option for people with advanced hip disease who would otherwise receive conventional primary total hip replacements and are likely to live longer than the device is likely to last. It also recommended that information be collected on the long-term effectiveness of the technique.</p>

As for part <i>(b)</i>, expenditure of &pound;40,407 was incurred against the departmental taxi service contract between <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February 2003</phrase>. This figure excludes any amounts spent on taxi hire outside of the departmental contract and reclaimed by officials as travel and subsistence expenditure. That information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.0/1">I understand that work is ongoing between Commission officials and member states to finalise the details of the revision to the Sixth Directive. The aim is to get sufficient agreement in the Council for the 'Recast' Directive to be formally adopted before the next enlargement of the EU, scheduled for May-June 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.3/1">Clergy in office receive a stipend and are housed. When they retire they make their own housing provision, but they receive a pension from the State as well as that provided by the Church's clergy pension scheme. The basis for determining the benefits provided by the latter&mdash;a lump sum at retirement plus a pension&mdash;was designed to take into account all of these factors. The full service pension (payable after 37 years of service) has since April 2002 been &pound;10,693 per annum and will increase by 3 per cent. from April 2003. The retirement lump sum is &pound;32,079.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.3/2">Following a thorough consultation with interested parties in the Church, culminating in a General Synod debate last November, it was decided to retain the defined benefit scheme. The Church has resisted the increasingly common alternative of moving to money purchase schemes, thereby shifting risk onto the employee, in a demonstration of its commitment to adequate provision for the clergy in their retirement.</p>
