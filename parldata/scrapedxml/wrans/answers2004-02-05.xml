The remit of each Surveillance Commissioner covers the whole of the United Kingdom so that any Surveillance Commissioner can act in jurisdictions other than his own.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.4/2">The right hon. Sir John MacDermott has served as a Surveillance Commissioner since 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".998W.4/3">The Commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the Commissioners' remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that Sir John has accepted his re-appointment. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.2/1">The child care tax credit was part of the working families and disabled person's tax credits (WFTC and DPTC), which were available between October 1999 and April 2003. It contributed to the cost of eligible child care for working families. It was replaced in April 2003 by the child care element of working tax credit (WTC).</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/2">Applications for WFTC and DPTC could be investigated for a number of reasons, including where there were concerns about claims for the child care tax credit within the applications. However, this was only one component part of the award. An inquiry may involve more than one element of non-compliance, and it is not possible to say how many investigations related only to this particular aspect. However, the Inland Revenue successfully prosecuted and convicted 14 cases where child care was a consideration. Of these, six were solely concerning child care.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/3">For WTC, the Inland Revenue will be able to arrive at an error rate for the tax credit population when it is in a position to carry out a full random inquiry programme on a complete set of finalised awards for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/4">A dedicated telephone line was set up in February 2000 for child care providers as a result of consultation with the National Child Minders Association. This gave child care providers the opportunity to tell the Inland Revenue about any concerns regarding claims for child care costs. Up until 31 March 2003, over 2,100 allegations were received in respect of WFTC and DPTC.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/5">With the introduction of working tax credit (WTC) in April 2003, a new service, the Childcare Provider Helpline, was set up to deal with queries about the scheme and receive information about specific concerns relating to claims to child care costs. Between then and the end of January the helpline has handled over 3,800 calls. It is run as a very small part of the tax credits helpline and it is therefore not possible to isolate the number of staff handling these calls, or the cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.2/6">It is not possible to identify the number of allegations that have been reported outside of the Childcare Provider Helpline. Every allegation received is given careful consideration and, where there is sufficient reason, steps are taken to examine the circumstances more closely.</p>

	<p pid=".1004W.2/1">The objectives of the Child Trust Fund are to:</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/2" class="indent">ensure that in future all children have a financial asset at the start of adult life to invest in their futures;</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/3" class="indent">help people understand the benefits of saving and investing;</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/4" class="indent">encourage parents and children to develop the savings habit and engage with financial institutions; and</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/5" class="indent">build on financial education to help people make better financial choices throughout their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/6">All children will receive a Government endowment of &pound;250 when their Child Trust Fund account is opened. Families on child tax credit, with an income below the threshold (currently &pound;13,230) will receive an additional &pound;250. The additional endowment for children in low income families will help give their Child Trust Fund accounts a good start and ensures that the Child Trust Fund is both a universal and progressive policy&mdash;helping to extend opportunity to all, while targeting support to those that are most in need. The Government have confirmed that there will be a further progressive payment at age seven. This structure provides a foundation on which the Government will build in future.</p>
	<p pid=".1004W.2/7">Financial information and education are key to helping people make better financial choices throughout their lives. The Government view Child Trust Fund holders as the best judge of what most meets their future needs. By enabling children to interact with their own savings and investment account, and accompanying this with financial education in schools, the Child Trust Fund will help young people to understand the advantages of saving. The Government will commission a range of teaching and learning materials to meet children's needs at different ages, moving towards guidance on possible uses of financial assets, including continuing to save, as the child grows into adulthood.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.2/1">The performance of the UK labour market over recent years has been strong by both international and historical standards. In 2002 the standardised inactivity rate for persons aged 15&ndash;64 was 23.4 per cent. for the United Kingdom, well below the EU average of 30.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/2">Sharp declines in the unemployment rate have boosted UK GDP growth, and a falling inactivity rate would increase labour supply and add further to the growth rate of the UK economy. That is why this Government attach priority to reducing the inactivity rate. In addition to helping the unemployed back to work, and increasing the skills of the lowest skilled workers, Government policies aim to encourage inactive people who are able to work back into the labour market.</p>

However, the bidding process for Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning has been designed by HEFCE to keep additional costs to a minimum, while ensuring a rigorous selection process. At stage one, institutions will be able to draw on existing practice and readily available information. At stage two, institutions will be provided with additional funding as a contribution to their costs.</p>

This indicates the importance that the Council attaches to quality enhancement and the valuable role that the Academy will play. Institutional subscription will enable the HE sector to support the Academy in its set up phase and give institutions a direct stake in the new organisation. It will also provide much-needed financial stability for the Academy during its crucial early period. It is anticipated that after this initial three year start up period, the Academy will be self sustainable through membership subscriptions and other marketable services.</p>

	<p pid=".1032W.8/1">Information on the costs associated with the proposal in the Higher Education Bill to allow universities to set their own tuition fees is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8 January alongside the Bill. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the costs vary greatly according to the decisions that higher education institutions take, and they cannot be estimated precisely at this stage. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 29 January 2004</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/2">In estimating the 13 years figure as the average time for loan repayment&mdash;22 January 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.1405W"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 1405&ndash;07W</phrase>&mdash;the modelling was undertaken across all students rather than being a figure for an 'average student'. The estimate is based on the whole distribution of borrowers rather than on an 'average student' or a student with average debt&mdash;there is therefore no one level of debt on which the estimate is based. Factors that were taken into account in developing the model include:</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/3" class="indent">(i) The future pattern of demand for Higher Education by parental income;</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/4" class="indent">(ii) The proportion of students studying in London, at home or elsewhere;</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/5" class="indent">(iii) The propensity of students to take out loans;</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/6" class="indent">(iv) The distribution of fees actually charged by Higher Education institutions from 2006/07;</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/7" class="indent">(v) The distribution of lengths of courses (based on internal modelling); and</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/8" class="indent">(vi) The pattern of withdrawals from HE courses (based on internal modelling).</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/9">The model was applied on the basis of a separate fee grant and HE grant as set out as follows. Once the grants are combined, as announced by the Secretary of State to the House on 27 January 2004, the balance between maintenance loan and fee loan will be slightly different, though the overall impact is likely to be small.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/10" class="indent">(a) We currently expect that in 2006/07 around 50 per cent. to 55 per cent. of students will be eligible for the full value of the means-tested maintenance loan of&mdash;on average&mdash;around &pound;4,000. The remaining students are expected to be eligible for at least the non means-tested element of the loan&mdash;an average of around &pound;3,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/11" class="indent">(b) For fee loans, our estimates have been prepared using an assumption that 75 per cent. of students could be charged &pound;3,000 and 25 per cent. of students &pound;1,200 (an average fee of &pound;2,550). We expect around 50 per cent. to 55 per cent. of students will receive some fee remission. Under these assumptions, the 40 per cent. to 45 per cent. of students who receive no fee support would be eligible for an average fee loan of &pound;2,550.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/12">As noted above, this is on the basis of a separate fee grant and HE grant. Under the combined grant scheme, we expect that 50 per cent. to 55 per cent. of students would receive all or part of the HE grant of &pound;2,700.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/13">We then assume that 85 per cent. of students will take up maintenance loans and 80 per cent. of students take up fee loans. Loan take-up is assumed to be independent of parental income.</p>

	<p pid=".1037W.0/3" class="indent">The activities of police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership to tackle local crime problems&mdash;for instance through making homes more secure, using local authority warden to warn car owners who leave valuables in their vehicles of the risks involved and tackling city centre hooliganism.</p>

	<p pid=".1037W.0/10" class="indent">Introducing new legislation and other powers such as minimum sentences for third time convictions for burglary; strengthening the law on rape; increasing the powers of courts to impose restraining orders in domestic violence cases; and regulation of the motor salvage industry.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.0/11">There is still more that we can do and, for example:</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.0/12" class="indent">We are starting some new work on reducing the market for stolen goods&mdash;i.e. making the disposal of stolen property more difficult, riskier and less profitable.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.0/13" class="indent">The Prime Minister's Strategy Unit will be publishing an alcohol harm reduction strategy for England which will set out how to address the problems associated with alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid=".1037W.0/14" class="indent">We are further improving vehicle registration procedures and working more closely with local authorities suffering the highest levels of crime and voluntary and community groups to get across vehicle crime prevention messages.</p>

	<p pid=".1039W.0/15">We now have record police numbers of 136,386 as at 31 August 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1039W.0/16">We do not currently collate the number of graduates recruited into the police service centrally and cannot therefore say how many graduates have been recruited. However, we have reason to believe that the Police Service continues to be an attractive career option for graduates. Since April 2003 we have been rolling out a new police assessment centre. So far 4,244 candidates have gone through this of which just under 25 per cent. were graduates or post graduates. The Accelerated Promotion Scheme for Graduates was replaced in April 2002 by the High Potential Development (HPD) scheme which recruits both graduates and non graduates, externally and from within forces, with the potential to reach at least superintendent rank and ensures that they are equipped with the necessary skills to become highly effective in middle management, command and leadership roles. The scheme provides a structured yet flexible career framework which can lead to the most senior positions in the police service. A high proportion of graduates are recruited onto the scheme which is actively marketed via university careers fairs, other graduate events and targeted marketing in graduate publications and literature placed in universities. Latest statistics show that 50 (67 per cent.) of those successful in gaining a place on the scheme are graduates on application.</p>

	<p pid=".1050W.6/3">The Stewart Report on &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot; in May 2000 (<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk">www.iegmp.org.uk</a>) included the following conclusions on base stations:</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/4" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/5">Further reduction of guidelines was considered by the Stewart Group but this was rejected, as there was &quot;no scientific basis&quot; for it.</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/6">A review of recent research, entitled, &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, published in January 2004 by the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation, came to similar conclusions:</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/7" class="indent">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/8">In the last three years the Radiocommunications Agency (RA), now part of Ofcom, has carried out and published radio frequency exposure level measurements near base station sites. The data show that exposure to signals from masts at locations accessible to the general public is very low compared with guideline levels advised by the ICNIRP (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/9">The NRPB has the statutory responsibility for advising the Government on exposure guidelines for electromagnetic fields (EMFs). They issued a consultation document last year, in which they proposed new advice on exposure guidelines for all EMFs comparable with the international guidelines. Publication of the new NRPB guidelines is expected this spring.</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.6/10">I wrote to all right hon. and hon. Members on 21 January with a summary of the current position relating to mobile phone technology and health concerns.</p>

A disabled person is defined in section 1 of the Act as a person who has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.3/2">In the particular case of people with progressive conditions (such as HIV, cancer or multiple sclerosis), the current definition treats them as disabled if their impairment has some effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, even if not substantial, provided that it is eventually likely to have that effect.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.3/3">We propose through the definition of disability clause in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill to extend the current definition of disability in the Act for the progressive conditions of HIV infection, cancer and multiple sclerosis to anyone who has that condition whether or not it has an effect on normal day-to-day activities; although there is a power which could be used to exclude cancers which do not require substantial treatment. The provisions relating to HIV infection and cancer follow recommendations by the Disability Rights Task Force. The extension for multiple sclerosis followed consideration of case law. No conditions already covered by the 1995 Act would be excluded by means of the draft Disability Discrimination Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".1066W.0/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) event, &quot;Defusing the Diet Time Bomb&quot;, on the promotion of food to children, was held on the evening of Tuesday 27 January at the QEII centre in Westminster.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/2">The event was part of a series of activities organised by the FSA to promote public debate on the issue of the promotion of food to children, following the publication of the research review commissioned from Professor Gerard Hastings of Strathclyde University in September 2003. In October 2003, the FSA published a paper setting out a range of possible policy options that might be considered as a result of the Hastings findings.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/3">The purpose of the event on 27 January was to provide members of the public with an opportunity to debate the issues publicly with each other and with stakeholders drawn from consumer organisations, the food and advertising industries, public health and children's organisations. A report of the event, along with views gathered at other stakeholder events, will be used to inform the FSA board decisions on what advice to offer to Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/4">The chair was chosen on the basis that he was independent and fair. The six main panellists were selected to provide a balance of views and a range of expertise and experience to reflect the range of issues under discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/5">Over 450 people attended in person at the QEII centre. 439 viewed the debate online via the FSA's web-site and an estimated 1,000 watched on digital television.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/6">One noble Member of another place attended. A number of apologies were received from hon. Members but no representations were made by any right hon. or hon. Members to change the date.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/7">The total cost of the event was &pound;147,000, of which &pound;143,500 was allocated to production and a further &pound;3,500 for planning and preparation. Staffing at the event was provided by FSA staff.</p>

We have appointed an external reference group and working groups to make recommendations and consider areas and issues for proposed standards. We currently plan to publish the NSF in December 2004 for implementation from 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1071W.12/1">Vaccination has been one of the most effective interventions along with improvements in clean water supplies and nutrition in reducing infectious diseases throughout the world. The introduction of vaccines in the United Kingdom against a number of childhood diseases, including whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and diphtheria has lead to significant reductions or elimination (in the case of smallpox) of these diseases.</p>
	<p pid=".1071W.12/2">There are a number of good examples where the level of a disease has fallen following the introduction of an effective vaccine. Following the introduction of Hib in 1992, there was a 98 per cent. fall in the number of laboratory confirmed cases in children under five years of age. Similarly, the meningococcal C vaccine, introduced in November 1999, resulted in a reduction in the number of laboratory confirmed cases of meningococcal group C disease by around 95 per cent. in babies under 12 months of age. Oral polio vaccine has been extremely effective in eliminating poliomyelitis from the UK. Excellent progress towards worldwide eradication is being made, and the World Health Organisation hopes to have interrupted wild polio transmission by the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1077W.6/1">The written ministerial statement made in this House on 6 November 2003, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/.43WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 43&ndash;44WS</phrase>, on the National Strategy for the Recruitment of Lay Magistrates announces the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor's decision to remove the lower age limit for applicants to the magistracy who can show that they have the key qualities needed for appointment. This is intended to help in achieving a more diverse and better-balanced bench. The National Strategy itself contains proposals to encourage younger people, including advertising in a range of media, local radio and cinemas. A bus advertising campaign began on 1 November 2003. As a direct result of this 2,283 inquiries have been received of which 1,224 (54 per cent.) were from those aged between 18&ndash;40. Advisory Committees in rural areas regularly review the make-up of their benches at the outset of their recruitment campaigns with the intention of attracting the right range of people, using their local knowledge and ideas developed through the National Strategy.</p>
