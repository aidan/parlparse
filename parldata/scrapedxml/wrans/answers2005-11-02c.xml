	<p pid="c.1036W.6/1">The spokesman of the UN, Secretary General Kofi Annan gave a briefing in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">Monday 31 October</phrase>, expressing the deep concern about the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. The UN continues to receive reports that tens of thousands of people are still homeless and in need of assistance, months after the eviction campaign, called 'Operation Drive Out Rubbish' began in May 2005. DFID has already provided &pound;1 million to UN agencies to provide emergency food, blankets, medical assistance and other non-food items to the victims. The Government of Zimbabwe have now formally rejected offers of UN assistance to provide temporary shelter for these victims, stating publicly that there is no humanitarian crisis. The Secretary-General made a strong public appeal to the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that those who are out in the open, without shelter and without means of sustaining their livelihoods, are provided with humanitarian assistance in collaboration with the United Nations and the humanitarian community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.6/2">In terms of the broader humanitarian situation, despite compelling evidence of a very low grain harvest earlier this year, the Government of Zimbabwe similarly denies that the country needs international assistance to address food insecurity. Independent surveys indicate that between three and five million people will face food shortages in the coming months. The UN, through the World Food Programme, has secured agreement from the Government of Zimbabwe to distribute 300,000 tonnes of food to the most poor and vulnerable households. DFID has already pledged &pound;10 million for this programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.6/3">The UK fully supports the UN position on the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. We strongly condemn the cynical and callous attitude of the Zimbabwe Government towards the well-being of its own citizens.</p>

	<p pid="c.1037W.6/2">The Executive's current entry criteria for administrative grades require a minimum of two SCE standard or ordinary grades, including English and a subject that clearly indicates competency in figure work. Tests may sometimes be offered to give candidates the opportunity to display an equivalent level of numeracy and literacy. Where posts require a higher level of literacy or numeracy skills, the minimum criteria will be adjusted accordingly and the level of skill may be tested during the assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1037W.6/3">In the DCA, there is no formal requirement for all new recruits to be assessed in literacy and numeracy skills. General recruitment asks for administration experience or a minimum of five GCSEs for administrative grades or two A levels for executive grades; both minima require English. The DCA uses competence and job specification based recruitment which assesses candidates against the criteria in both the application form and at interview.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.5/1">The Government have a two-strand approach to tackling the problem. The first strand is to seek reductions of noise at source through international negotiation and agreement, implemented by national regulation. The second strand is to provide for controls on operational noise and the mitigation of its worst effects. Stansted is designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, making the Secretary of State directly responsible for those controls.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.5/2">The 2004 annual noise exposure contours for Stansted were published in August 2005 and are on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a> together with ERCD Report 0503 which provides data on the areas and populations within the contours and comparisons with earlier years. Between 1988 and 1998 areas and populations within the contours generally rose in line with movements but in 1999, despite the high traffic growth, the area within the 57 dBA Leq contour fell by 19 per cent. and this improvement has been maintained so far despite further significant growth in traffic.</p>

	<p pid="c.1045W.8/2">A recent Defra publication, 'Charting a new course' explains how we intend to develop with stakeholders work on protected areas to increase fish stocks. We will develop criteria for the selection of Marine Protected Areas and then use those criteria to contribute to the development of an integrated approach to the selection of multi purpose MPAs, including for wider nature conservation. We are also considering how many additional protected areas might be needed to protect marine ecosystems and biodiversity and fulfil the international commitments we have made in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.8/3">In relation to fisheries protected areas, we would need to consider the nature and degree of protection required within an identified area for a specific stock or stocks. Current scientific advice is, however, that a total ban on fishing within a defined area (a no take zone) may not inevitably benefit stocks, particularly mobile species such as cod and that we might better achieve our objectives through seasonal or gear restrictions rather than total closure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.8/4">In parallel the Government are committed to a Marine Bill to introduce a new framework based on marine spatial planning, that balances conservation, energy and resource needs, to obtain best value from different uses of our valuable marine resources by maintaining and protecting the ecosystems on which they depend.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.2/1">Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England. The Environment Agency is the principal authority responsible for operational flood risk management. Defra funds most of the agency's flood related work and grant aids individual projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/2">More than three hundred kilometres of coastal and tidal flood defences are maintained by the Environment Agency around the Kent coastline. The agency's future capital programme envisages substantial investment in the county of Kent for projects in the next three to five years. Current projects include &pound;9.8 million spend this year on a sea defence project at High Knocke to Dymchurch and smaller flood alleviation schemes in East Peckham, Aylesford, Jury's gap and the Romney and Stour Marshlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/3">The agency is developing the Medway Estuary and Swale flood risk management plan, the North Kent shoreline management plan, Thames Estuary 2100 strategy, and the Stour and North Kent rivers catchment flood management plans. These high level planning documents will inform and influence planning and investment for the next one hundred years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/4">The agency also provides advice (typically on ninety applications per month in Kent) to planning authorities to help with the Government's aim of avoiding inappropriate development in areas of flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/5">In addition to the Environment Agency's work, Tonbridge and Mailing borough council is currently promoting the East Peckham flood defence scheme with Defra grant aid at an estimated cost of some &pound;928,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.1047W.2/1">The Government set each local authority a statutory target for recycling and composting for 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 and is now consulting on proposals for targets for 2007&ndash;08. Provisional figures show more than a fifth (approaching 23 percent.) of household waste in England was recycled, in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.2/2">To support the attainment of these targets, Defra introduced the Household Waste Recycling Act in 2003 which provides that English waste collection authorities shall ensure, except in certain circumstances, that by the end of 2010 they collect at least two recyclable materials from doorsteps separate from the remainder of the waste. About two thirds of households in England now receive a kerbside collection of recyclable materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.2/3">In the spending review 2004 the Government announced an increase in the environmental, protective and cultural services block of &pound;888 million over 2004&ndash;05, by 2007&ndash;08 and over the three-year period to 2005&ndash;06, authorities are also benefiting from a total of &pound;294 million invested through the waste minimisation and recycling fund. Its successor, the waste performance and efficiency grant, will run in parallel for the first year and provide a further &pound;260 million over the three years to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.2/4">Since 2002, local authorities have also been assisted by targeted support and advice available through the waste and resources action programme and Defra's waste implementation programme&mdash;which will continue to provide targeted assistance to authorities for a further two years and an announcement of its new programme will be made in December 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1048W.2/1">We remain on course comfortably to achieve the UK's Kyoto target of a 12.5 percent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during the first commitment period, 2008&ndash;12. Provisional 2004 figures released in March show that emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) methane (CH <sub>4</sub> ), nitrous oxide (N <sub>2</sub> O), the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF <sub>6</sub> )) were about 12 &frac12; percent. below the base year, and that the policies already in place would achieve significant further reductions to ensure compliance. We are currently reviewing UK climate change programme and are looking at how existing policies are performing and the range of policies that might be put in place in future, in order to assess the policies needed to put us back on track towards our much more ambitious domestic goal of a 20 percent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. Achieving this would correspond to a reduction of well over 20 percent. in the Kyoto basket.</p>

	<p pid="c.1049W.8/1">The concentration of the animal deterrent Bitrex in slug pellet products sold in the UK varies, depending on the product concerned. For all these products, including Doff Slugoids, the range is 100&ndash;300mg for each 100g of product.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.8/2">All pesticide products sold in the UK are subject to an approval. The regulatory authority is the Pesticide Safety Directorate (PSD). Approvals, such as that held by Doff Slugoids, are issued on the basis of PSD's assessment of experimental safety and efficacy data. This assessment includes an evaluation of the need for a deterrent in the product under consideration and at what level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1070W.8/1">This is a matter for the parties to the contract, BAE Systems and the Government of Brunei. The United Kingdom Government have been encouraging the parties to reach agreement, but it would be inappropriate to comment on the progress of the discussions. For commercial reasons, it is the Government's practice not to comment on whether it has underwritten any such contract. The Royal Navy, with the agreement of both parties, last year undertook an independent study of the progress of the programme. The costs of the short study were met by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

CASC has been worth &pound;7.5 million to sports clubs in total; so, an estimated &pound;1.5 million has been put back into grassroots cricket through tax reliefs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.0/2">The UK has provided the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) with funding to support its field security co-ordination structure in Darfur. Following pressure from the UK, the UNDSS has deployed eight field security co-ordination officers in Darfur. The UNDSS has worked closely with NGOs and established reporting mechanisms in each Darfur state to relay timely security information. It provides a dedicated 24-hour VHF radio channel to receive and respond to emergency calls from NGOs operating in Darfur and also holds regular security briefings. Given the current security situation, we are working closely with the UNDSS to improve the effectiveness of their operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.0/3">In addition, we have provided funding to the NGO Red-R to train humanitarian NGOs in Darfur in security skills, procedures and practice. Red-R is providing Darfur specific programmes, including pre-deployment training, in-country safety workshops and driver training.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.0/4">The African Union (AU) Mission also has a vital role to play and we have provided &pound;32 million towards its expansion. There is no doubt that where it is deployed it is having a positive impact on security and it has also offered to escort humanitarian convoys. However, the situation remains difficult.</p>

	<p pid="c.1093W.3/1">The Government's long established policy has been to remove itself from substantive decisions about the application of competition law. It is for the relevant independent competition authorities to consider individual competition cases. This policy is reflected in the UK's competition legislation. Where Ministers do retain statutory powers and responsibilities, these may be used in accordance with the relevant applicable law.

	<p pid="c.1095W.5/1">The Government take alcohol-related crime and disorder extremely seriously. That is why we introduced the Violent Crime Reduction Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-08">8 June 2005</phrase> which proposes a new package of measures to reduce alcohol-fuelled violence. The proposals, which are based on those outlined in the consultation document 'Drinking Responsibly' which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-21">21 January 2005</phrase>, include: a new power for the police and local authorities to designate alcohol disorder zones in areas with a significant problem; a new drinking banning order which would exclude individuals responsible for alcohol-related disorder from certain areas and licensed premises; a new power for the police to ban the sale of alcohol at licensed premises for up to 48 hours if they persistently sell to under 18s; and a new power for the police to exclude individuals at risk of carrying out alcohol-related disorder from a specific area for up to 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/2">These new powers build on the range of measures already available to the police and licensing authorities to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder. They seek to balance a recognition of the collective responsibility that the alcohol trade should take for addressing some of these problems with a continued emphasis on the responsibility of the individual drinker or premise.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/3">The Home Office collates National Statistics on recorded crime including offences of violence. These statistics are available for police force area and crime and disorder partnership (CDRP). Wansbeck CDRP covers the parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck but respective boundaries may not be coterminous. Statistics are also available at basic command unit level but are not comparable for the years specified due to boundary changes in Northumbria police force. In the last three years, the number of violent offences recorded by the police are set out in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/4">It is not possible to determine from these National Statistics whether these offences are alcohol related. However a national estimate is provided by the British Crime Survey of the proportion of violent offences where the victim perceived the offender to be under the influence of alcohol. This is also detailed in the table.</p>

The proposal that the Commission should have powers to compel disclosure to solicitors and others raises the question of whether it's powers should extend to cover private bodies and individuals. It has been decided to take this forward as part of the Government's wider consideration of a possible new statutory third party disclosure scheme, as recommended by Sir Robin Auld in his Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales. An interdepartmental working party has recently been established to undertake this work, which is concerned with the disclosure of material by any person or body other than the defendant for the purposes of criminal investigations and proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1104W.3/3"><i>(b)</i> Agreement has been reached in principal to extend the powers of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to seek assistance from foreign authorities by amending the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003. The Home Secretary is waiting for a suitable legislative vehicle in which to include the amendment to bring about this change.</p>

	<p pid="c.1106W.6/1">The Government's approach to dealing with this problem focuses on three main areas. First the legislative framework where we have taken steps to strengthen the laws governing the possession of firearms which are already among the toughest in the world. We have introduced a mandatory five year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of possession of an illegal firearm, made it an offence to carry an imitation or air gun in public without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, banned the sale, manufacture and import of guns that use self contained gas cartridge systems, and strengthened the law on airguns. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill builds on these measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.6/2">Secondly, we have worked closely with law enforcement agencies to strengthen enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1106W.6/3">Thirdly, we recognise the key part played by communities in addressing the wider issue of this underlying gun culture. We have put &pound;2 million from recycled criminal assets into anti-gun crime projects across the country this year. In addition, the Connected Fund launched last year, provides grants to small voluntary groups working on gun crime, knife crime and gang-related issues. This has proved very successful, supporting over 150 community groups across the country to date.</p>

	<p pid="c.1119W.2/2">The information requested is not collected. It is for chief officers of police and their police authorities to determine the mix of staff employed by a police force. The police service efficiency strategy expects the service to work towards increasing the amount of police officer time spent on front-line policing to around 72 per cent. by March 2008, from nearly 64 per cent. in March 2004. This equates to an extra 12,000 police officers being freed up from back-office tasks over the next three years.</p>

However, records collated centrally do not indicate whether these 17 prisoners were accommodated in cells certified for one.</p>

	<p pid="c.1132W.3/1">Under the Children and Young Person's Act 1933, section 49, automatic reporting restrictions apply in all youth courts. It has been an established principle in British law since 1933 that juvenile defendants should not have their identity made public in criminal cases unless the court feels that the public interest requires it. The courts do not routinely grant such applications and each case is considered on its own merits.</p>
	<p pid="c.1132W.3/2">There are no automatic reporting restrictions on antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) as they are civil orders. However, courts do have the power to impose reporting restrictions in ASBO cases and where they are imposed, they must be adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="c.1132W.3/3">Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence and until recently young people who breached their ASBOs were protected by the automatic reporting restrictions of the youth court. However, provisions in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 removed these automatic restrictions which means ASBO breaches by young people can now be reported. Reporting restrictions have only been lifted on cases of Breach of ASBOs in the youth court, they remain in place for other youth court matters.</p>

Only those tests offered and taken in GUM clinics are recorded in the KC60 return, testing undertaken in other clinical settings, such as general practice, are not recorded in the dataset. Data was only shown for 2003 and 2004, as the KC60 code that records sexual health screen with a HIV test (S2) was only introduced in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1142W.2/2">The data do not represent the number of HIV tests offered and taken up by the population resident within each SHA, as many patients cross health boundaries to access GUM clinics. In addition, the gender and sexual orientation mix varies between clinics. Some clinics are attended by a high number of men who have sex with men and consequently this influences the number of HIV tests offered and taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1148W.2/2">The NHS Redress Scheme is a completely new approach to the handling of clinical negligence cases. Its aims are three-fold:</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/3" class="indent">to provide a real alternative to litigation for the cases that fall within the scheme, including addressing the delays and legal costs that are part and parcel of the current system,</p>

	<p pid="c.1148W.2/6">For the first time, the patient is at the heart of the process of responding when things go wrong. An NHS Redress Scheme will ensure a simpler and more effective approach to making things right for patients and ensuring that where there has been clinical negligence, the approach supports proper resolution. To be eligible under the scheme, the incident must arise out of a negligent clinical act or omission in connection with the diagnosis of illness, the care or the treatment of a patient, by a healthcare professional. The liability must arise out of hospital services provided as part of the NHS in England or Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.1156W.5/2">These products tend to be found on sale in markets and in small retail outlets in inner-city areas where there is a higher density of Afro Caribbean and Asian population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1156W.5/3">Prescription-only medicines are potent by nature, and for this reason, their supply is restricted to patients who have been issued with a prescription from a doctor or another appropriate practitioner. In this way, their condition may be monitored. Sale and supply of these medicines outwith specified conditions can be a criminal offence and the MHRA will investigate all potential breaches of medicines law.</p>
	<p pid="c.1156W.5/4">In April 2000, the Medicines Control Agency&mdash;this was prior to the merger with the Medical Devices Agency and emergence of the MHRA&mdash;conducted an initiative whereby a number of wholesalers/retailers of these products were identified and enforcement action was taken. In 95 per cent. of the visits, compliance was achieved and products withdrawn from the market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1156W.5/5">Intelligence suggested that, following MHRA action, large scale wholesale operations ceased but suitcase trade&quot; persisted. This situation has been monitored in the intervening period and action has been taken in a number of instances, with reports from both trading standards and Her Majesty's Customs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1163W.9/2">In criminal law, where matters fall outside the ordinary knowledge of the court, the court may allow the opinions of an expert witness to be admitted as evidence. The decision whether or not to allow the evidence of an expert witness to be admitted rests with the court, which must be satisfied that the material comes within a recognised field of expertise and that the witness is properly qualified in the subject calling for expertise. The appropriate competence may be the result of formal study or training, experience, or both. It is for the jury to decide what weight ought to be placed on any expert evidence that has been admitted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.9/3">One exception to these general rules is that, under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991, a defendant shall not be acquitted on the grounds of insanity, or found unfit to plead, except on the evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners, at least one of whom is approved by the Secretary of State as having special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorder.</p>

However, Policy Development Grants are currently exempt from this provision. This measure will therefore achieve consistency in the reporting of public funds received by political parties, ensuring that Policy Development Grants, like the money received by opposition parties in Parliament and the devolved legislatures to assist them in carrying out their duties as opposition parties, are reported to the Electoral Commission and recorded on the register of donations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1167W.5/1">The Education (Pupil Registration) Regulations 1995 set out when a pupil's absence from school shall be treated as authorised or unauthorised. Authorised absence includes those occasions where the pupil has been granted leave of absence by the school. Schools have discretion as to whether or not to grant leave of absence to allow pupils to go away on holiday.</p>
	<p pid="c.1167W.5/2">The Government's view is that holidays in term time should be discouraged. There is evidence which indicates that absence from school can have a detrimental effect on a child's education and their attainment. The Government's view, therefore, is that all unnecessary absences from school, for reasons such as family holidays, should be avoided wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1168W.5/1">We attach a high priority to helping teachers and school staff to reduce and respond to bullying, to encouraging pupils to report bullying and to helping staff respond when bullying has been reported: bullying is a serious problem which puts the emotional well-being and educational achievement of pupils at risk. Our guidance pack Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter for Action and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> all offer advice to teachers on preventing and reporting bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.5/2">The Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot; pack was updated in September 2002. Its key message is for children to report bullying to someone they trust and not to suffer in silence. It offers valuable guidance to teachers on preventing and tackling bullying, the effects of bullying, how to respond to parents, and how to monitor bullying incidents. The Department is currently reviewing the material to provide teachers with the most up-to-date information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.5/3">In addition to the written resources we provide we have also held a number of workshops and conferences at which best practice in reducing and responding to bullying has been discussed and shared. In particular our Make the Difference&quot; conferences, held between November 2003 to June 2004, attracted over 5,000 heads and education staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.5/4">The Department has also recently launched the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from foundation stage to year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally.</p>

	<p pid="c.1169W.2/1">As data on bullying are not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to incidents of bullying at secondary level in the Leeds North West area. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than before but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.2/2">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.2/2">Changes to the distribution of the Ethnic Minority Achievement (EMAG) element of the Standards Fund were from introduced from 2004&ndash;05 to bring a better targeted, fairer and more sensible distribution to this grant. These changes were endorsed by the DfES Aiming High: Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils&quot; consultation of 2003. Between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08, EMAG total funding will have increased by almost &pound;10 million. In spite of these increases the reforms to the distribution of EMAG were not possible without losses to some authorities. No authority has been worse off as a result of these changes than 0.05 per cent. of their overall Education Formula Spending Share.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/3">The allocations laid out here indicate the DfES contribution to EMAG for Windsor and Maidenhead and Wokingham. Allocations beyond 2007&ndash;08 have not been made.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.2/30"><sup>(59)</sup> Provisional DfES contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/31">In 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 the DfES contribution was matched funded by local authorities at 50 per cent. grant rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/32">The criteria for the distribution of EMAG are laid out in the Standards Fund Circular each year. For:</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/33" class="italic">2003&ndash;04 Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG)</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/34" class="indent">The criteria for allocations for each authority remained the same as for 2002&ndash;03. The 2002&ndash;03 grant reflected historic allocations to authorities dating from the evolvement in 1999&ndash;2000 of EMAG from the Home Office Section 11. (Section 11 had been based on a bidding process and did not necessarily reflect pupil numbers).</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/35" class="italic">2004&ndash;05 Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG)</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/36" class="indent">For 2004&ndash;05, the national total for EMAG was increased by 4 per cent. For 2004&ndash;05 the DfES introduced a phased move towards a new, needs based formula for allocating EMAG. This formula is based on the numbers of pupils from nationally underachieving ethnic groups and the numbers of pupils with a first language other than English, with a weighting for free school meals. Pupils are only counted once in the formula.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/37" class="indent">For some authorities the formula warranted a reduction in grant. Instead of increasing every authority's allocation by 4 per cent., the DfES froze the allocation at the 2003&ndash;04 level for those authorities who would otherwise have lost under the new formula. This was for one year only. Other authorities who were to gain began a move towards their new formula amount. All authorities, except the Isles of Scilly, received a total allocation of at least &pound;35,000, including the local authority contribution. EMAG remained a ring-fenced grant to be spent only on raising the attainment of pupils from minority ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/38" class="italic">2005&ndash;06 Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/39" class="indent">For 2005&ndash;06, the national total for EMAG was increased by 4 per cent. The DfES continued to move towards the new, needs based, formula for allocating EMAG. This was again based on the numbers of pupils from nationally underachieving ethnic groups and the numbers of pupils with a first language other than English with a weighting for free school meals. Once again pupils are only counted once in the formula.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.2/40" class="indent">For some authorities this resulted in a reduction in grant. The DfES ensured that the allocation for those LEAs who would otherwise lose under the new formula was not reduced by more than 0.05 per cent. of their overall School Formula Funding Share. Other authorities continued to move towards their new formula amount. EMAG remained ring-fenced to be spent only on raising the attainment of pupils from minority ethnic groups.</p>

Taking an average figure of 650,000 per year group nationally, we estimate that 65,000 in every year group fall potentially within the scope of the programme: perhaps 700,000 to 800,000 in total.</p>

	<p pid="c.1176W.9/1">The national curriculum is designed to be suitable and accessible for all young people. The changes the Government made in 2004 to key stage 4 of the national curriculum were introduced so that all young people would have access to a broad and balanced curriculum as well as greater flexibility and choice, including the option to pursue more vocational courses. Similarly, reforms at advanced level provided for broader post-16 study including vocational options. Our 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills and the recently published Schools White Paper explain how we will further extend parental and pupil choice. In addition, London Challenge, with the London Learning and Skills Councils and Government Office for London, has consulted on a London 14&ndash;19 learner offer, which will be published this autumn. This creates a common framework across London to ensure that all learners have access to a core offer, building on the proposals in the 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills White Paper.</p>

Each local authority makes its own decision about the information it requires from parents, but it should be sufficient to demonstrate that home educated children are making progress in line with their age, aptitude, ability, and any special needs they may have.</p>

Where there is a need for a new or replacement school in an area the local authority will draw up a specification for the school and invite promoters to submit proposals.

	<p pid="c.1179W.3/2">The LSC collects data by academic year. In 2003/04 10,430 left E2E for employment. In 2004/05 11,226 left E2E for employment. Drop out information is not collected by the LSC. In 2004/05, 43 per cent. of E2E leavers went into a positive destination (Jobs, Further Education or Work Based Learning). This has risen from 35 per cent. in 2003/04. The number of places made available in England, in 2004/05 was 49,523. Of these 47,702 were taken up based on provisional 2004/05 data.</p>

We have always said that contractual changes, such as planning, preparation and assessment (PPA), would require reform as well as investment and we firmly believe that much can be achieved within schools from redeploying existing resources to introduce and sustain the changes. Schools will need to consider their own circumstances and the opportunities available to them&mdash;some strategies may be easier to implement than others.

We will announce details of authorities1 funding allocations in the late autumn together with the level of the guarantee.</p>

	<p pid="c.1181W.11/1">Parent councils are intended to act as a formal channel for parental representation.

	<p pid="c.1181W.11/2">In the broader context of the new duty on governing bodies to have regard to parents' views, parent councils are a means to strengthen the voice of parents, and to enable more parents to express their opinions and influence decisions, rather than a fundamental change in how decisions are taken within a school. Governing bodies will be expected to use the parent council (where there is one) as a means to seek views, as well as to listen if it raises its own issues and ideas. The new Ofsted self-assessment and inspection arrangements require schools to assess and demonstrate how well they listen to and act on parents' views.</p>

	<p pid="c.1182W.2/2">Every secondary school in the country is eligible for Building Schools for the Future (BSF) investment. It is a strategic programme that aims to rebuild or renew all secondary schools that need it over 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions. Local authorities and schools are being prioritised in accordance with the published criteria of relative educational and social need, based on the geographical groupings of schools proposed by local authorities. Prince Henry's Grammar School is currently prioritised to receive BSF investment in waves 13 to 15 of this programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1182W.2/3">Building Schools for the Future, however, is a long-term programme that represents around only 40 per cent. of our annual capital investment in schools. The majority of our remaining support is allocated directly to both authorities and schools to enable them to address their most pressing needs; including those schools which require refurbishment but are not prioritised for investment in the early years of BSF. Local authorities and schools prioritise the use of this funding in accordance with their locally prepared asset management plans. Leeds and its schools have been allocated over &pound;70 million over the following three years to prioritise, and Prince Henry's Grammar School has been directly allocated &pound;412,000 in devolved formula capital over the following three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1182W.2/4">With regard to Leeds' unsuccessful application for Targeted Capital Fund support for this school, our funding decisions are final, and my officials have already provided direct feedback to the authority as to why this particular application did not succeed in what is always a highly competitive bidding process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1183W.5/1">It is for each head teacher to decide when it is appropriate to exclude a pupil from school permanently, taking account of all the circumstances of the situation including the need to balance the interests of the pupil against those of the whole school community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1183W.5/2">Head teachers must also have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, which is applicable equally to all maintained schools, regardless of phase. The guidance states that a decision to exclude a pupil should be taken only in response to serious breaches of the school's behaviour policy and if allowing the pupil to remain in school would seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others in the school. Permanent exclusion will usually be the final step following a wide range of other strategies that have been tried without success. There are, however, some exceptional cases, which are listed in the guidance, where it is appropriate for a head teacher to exclude a pupil permanently for a first or one-off offence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.2/1">Teacher numbers are now at their highest level since 1981. Improved pay and conditions and an attractive package of incentives for newly qualified teachers, supported by the recruitment activities of the Training and Development Agency for Schools, have raised the status of the profession and contributed to these record numbers. In primary schools, there was a drop in the number of pupils per qualified teacher between 2004 and 2005, from 22.7 to 22.5. In secondary schools, the number of pupils per qualified teacher decreased from 17.0 in 2004 to 16.7 in 2005. The overall PTR in maintained schools fell from 17.7 to 17.4.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/2">It is for schools to decide their strategies and priorities for workforce deployment and many schools are employing staff other than teachers to support teachers and pupils as part of a professional school team. There are more support staff than ever before working in our schools, 268,600 (FTE), more than 25,000 more than there were a year ago. The number of FTE teaching assistants in particular has risen by over 11 per cent. this year&mdash;and the figure has more than doubled since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/3">The large rise in support staff has led to an improvement in the pupil:adult ratio (PAR) in both the primary and secondary phases and, hence, overall. The primary PAR fell from 17.9 in 1997 to 13.4 in 2005, and in secondary from 14.5 to 12.2.</p>

	<p pid="c.1187W.0/1">The information is provided in the tables. The figures include closures of mainstream schools maintained by local authorities and maintained special schools but exclude independent schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.1187W.0/2">The figures include schools that have closed as a result of an amalgamation or local reorganisation of schools and also those where a new school has opened in their place e.g. a school with a religious character, an Academy or a fresh start school. Figures relate to calendar years. Proposed school closures for <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> are shown separately and included in the total.</p>
	<p pid="c.1187W.0/3">Since September 1999 decisions on school closures have been determined locally by the LA (for proposals they published where there were no objections), the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or, where the SOC have been unable to agree a unanimous decision, the independent schools adjudicator. Ministers have no role in the process.</p>

It is preferable if the kitchens are on the school premises, but this may not be sensible in all circumstances. These decisions are, rightly, made locally, and my Department does not generally approve school designs individually, which are procured by local authorities or schools. We expect all schools and authorities to consider carefully and seriously our ambitions when building or refurbishing schools, whether they were started before or after our announcements on raising the standards of school food.</p>

However, from September 2002 all local authorities (LAs) have been committed to providing suitable full-time education for permanently excluded pupils from the sixteenth school day of their exclusion. Since then all but a handful of LAs have met this commitment and the Department works with any that are not meeting it to help them achieve it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1195W.2/1">Until October 1998, only grant-maintained schools needed to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of any land, including playing fields. Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of school playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the sale proceeds as it wished.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.2/2">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Since October 1998 we have ensured that only sports pitches that are surplus to the needs of local schools and their communities are sold and all the money is ploughed back into improving sports or educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1195W.2/3">Since 1997, two applications involving the loss of an area of school playing field capable of forming at least a small sports pitch have been approved in Gravesham. An application to sell an off-site playing field at Chantry Primary School in Gravesend was approved in November 2000. The money raised from the sale has been used to improve the school's on-site sports provision. More recently, in October 2005, we approved an application to dispose of the site, including the playing fields, of the former Southfields School in Gravesend. As part of the proposed development of this site, the purchaser has agreed that the playing fields will be retained, and improved, for use by local schools and the community.</p>

	<p pid="c.1199W.2/1">Schools' admission arrangements are determined locally. Admission authorities for schools are already required to ensure that their admission arrangements comply with Equal Opportunities legislation. They are also required to have regard to the School Admissions Code Of Practice when determining their admission policies, to ensure that admission criteria and information published for parents are sufficiently clear, fair and objective to give applicants a reasonable indication of their chances of securing a place. The code recommends that criteria should be, as far as possible, inclusive of all elements of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1199W.2/2">We recognise that no one approach to ensuring fair access for children will work in all circumstances, and admission arrangements should be determined in light of local needs and circumstances. However, the White Paper proposes making it easier to introduce pupil banding. This provides a means of ensuring that a school's intake is representative of the full ability range of either applicants for a particular school, of children in the area as a whole, or of the national ability profile&mdash;depending on the type of banding adopted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1199W.2/3">All proposals for new schools must set out their proposed admission arrangements, and indicate how these will promote community and social integration and choice. Successful schools will also be allowed to expand if they can show their admission arrangements are in line with the Admissions Code. In both instances the agreed admission arrangements will be set for three years, after which they will be subject to annual consultation locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1199W.2/4">We have also recently amended legislation to ensure that priority is given to looked after children, as one of the most vulnerable groups in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1199W.2/5">Furthermore, we propose to extend entitlement to free transport for disadvantaged children, so that parental choice is not restricted by concerns about the cost and availability of transport.</p>

	<p pid="c.1201W.5/31">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) is now funding nine enhancement courses to increase the number of people able to start initial teacher training. As a result of the pilot courses, this year 74 additional people who were previously unable to train as science teachers will begin initial teacher training with a specialism in either physics or chemistry. Enhancement courses will be made available nationally from January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.5/32">In 2004, 2,711 science trainees successfully completed initial teacher training and gained qualified teacher status; this is 41.9 per cent. (801) more newly qualified science teachers than in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.5/33">Over the last three years, in order to attract more science undergraduates into teaching we have been running the very successful Student Associate Scheme in partnership with the TDA. The scheme places high quality undergraduates in schools for up to 20 days to provide curriculum support for teachers and to carry out project work with pupils. From the academic year 2003/04 to 2004/05, the scheme has placed around 4,500 science undergraduates in schools and we expect that figure to rise by more than 3,000 in the current 2005/06 academic year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1214W.5/1">Schools and local authorities have considerable resources available to them: since 1997/98, funding per pupil has increased in real terms by 36 per cent. The Department's strategy to improve school attendance is proving successful: absences from school have fallen for four consecutive years to record low levels. There are 50,000 more pupils in school each day than would be the case if absence rates were still at 2000/01 levels. Tackling truancy, particularly persistent truancy, requires carefully focused work by schools working in partnership with their local authorities and other agencies, as set out in Every Child Matters&quot; and Youth Matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/2">In 2005/06, 450 secondary schools are receiving additional funding for measures to improve pupils' behaviour and attendance through the Behaviour Improvement Programme. In addition, we continue to support work in all parts of the country to improve attendance through funding for behaviour and attendance consultants in every local authority and the provision of expert advisers within the national strategies.</p>

In future local authorities will decide proposals for new schools, including trust schools, having regard to guidance from the Secretary of State.

	<p pid="c.1218W.9/1">DARD has an avian influenza (AI) contingency plan which is available for use in the event of an outbreak. This contingency plan takes account of experiences of dealing with the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. DARD is committed to delivering an ongoing cycle of simulation and desktop exercises as part of epizootic disease preparedness. In June 2004, the Department tested the efficacy of its generic epizootic disease contingency plan for epizootic disease (CPED), on which the AI plan is based. In addition, over the past months DARD has tested several aspects of its avian influenza plan. In December 2004, an operational partners seminar was held to discuss the AI plan with partner organisations and stakeholder representative bodies. In June 2005, an exercise was carried out over two days to test the adequacy of Health and Safety guidance and the health services procedures to be used in the event of an outbreak. A desktop exercise was also carried out in conjunction to test the emergency procurement arrangements set out in call-off contracts. Tests were also carried out on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March 2005</phrase> and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-20">20 September 2005</phrase> on humane slaughter techniques. This involved a broiler flock and caged layer flock respectively. In October 2005, an exercise was carried out to test communication arrangements and how the command structures operate. The plan is subject to an ongoing process of review and updating.</p>

	<p pid="c.1228W.14/50">Since 2001, there has been a decline in the number of patrols by 50, 35 and 6 in the Belfast, South Eastern and North Eastern boards respectively. Similar information is not available for the Southern and Western Board areas. The decline in numbers is due to a number of factors, including: the replacement of patrols with light-controlled crossings; recruitment difficulties; and, changes in the nature of hazards. In the case of the latter, Boards employ a set of guidelines adapted from those developed by the Local Authorities Road Safety Officers Association (LARSOA). These guidelines permit Boards to make an objective assessment of dangers and hazards, and to determine whether a patrol should be provided, retained, or removed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1230W.5/1">In the 2000&ndash;01 school year, there were an estimated 12,200 surplus places in controlled primary schools and 12,900 surplus places in maintained primary schools. In the 2004&ndash;05 school year these figures increased to an estimated 15,800 in both sectors. In 2000&ndash;01 in post-primary schools, there were an estimated 6,500 surplus places in controlled schools and 6,900 in maintained schools. In 2004&ndash;05 these figures increased to an estimated 7,500 and 8,200 respectively. I append a table that shows the breakdown of the figures by management type and education and library board area. Figures for the 2005&ndash;06 school year are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1230W.5/2">The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency projections indicate that the number of children of compulsory school age is set to decline by a farther 30,000 over the next 10 years to 2015. From 2004&ndash;05 the Department's pupil projection figures indicate that primary school numbers will fall from an estimated 162,200 to 150,900 in 2009&ndash;10 (a reduction of 11,300 pupils) and that post-primary school enrolments will fall from an estimated 152,600 to 143,000 (a reduction of 9,600 pupils) in that same period. The figures are not available by management type and projected figures are not currently available to 2015. The projected fall in pupil numbers will not however necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in surplus places&mdash;changes to the schools' estate in the intervening period, through the major capital works programme and as a result of proposals from school authorities for closures or amalgamations, should remove a considerable number of surplus places.</p>
