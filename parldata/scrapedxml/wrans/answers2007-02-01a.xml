As previously reported, the Smith Institute held 27 seminars in the last 12 months.

	<p pid="a.412W.7/1">The actual expenditure for 2004-05 filings was higher than the initial estimate for online filing incentives because substantially more small employers than anticipated filed online.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.7/2">The assumption was that online filing take-up by small employers (fewer than 50 employees) for 2004-05 would be 10 per cent., which equates to a costs of &pound;37 million. These figures reflected the hesitation and reluctance expressed by small employers over the introduction of electronic filing.

	<p pid="a.414W.6/2">The Committee approved the Electoral Commission's 2006-07 estimate and its five-year plan for 2006-07 to 2010-11 on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.417W.2/1">DFID is encouraging transparency in mining activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Support to this way of improving revenue transparency is a major part DFID's planned support in the minerals sector in DRC. The Government of DRC signed up to the EITI in March 2005. Since then important progress has been made in implementing EITI. A multi-stakeholder national EITI Committee was established by Presidential Decree in November 2005 charged with ensuring the DRC implementation process complies with EITI criteria. In February 2006, the DRC Government named members of the EITI Committee and allocated a budget for its operations from the Government's finances. In addition, an EITI baseline study for the exploitation of copper, cobalt and diamonds is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/2">However, a lot more work will be needed before EITI is fully implemented in the DRC. Continued political commitment from the newly-elected DRC Government as well as capacity building and improved co-ordination within relevant DRC Government institutions will be crucial. Strong engagement from civil society, the private sector and wider international community stakeholders will also be required. When the new Government is in place, we will press them to take early action to improve transparency in natural resource management.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/3">DFID is also developing plans for public-private partnerships with a select group of international mining companies to support local development priorities in mining areas and to encourage responsible business behaviour.</p>

Communities and Local Government is not being charged for the space occupied. In place of 26 Whitehall the Department took 1,981 sq m on two floors in Stockley House from the beginning of November. These are unoccupied but will be occupied temporarily in 2007 as decant space to enable the reorganisation of Eland House to full open plan standard. The move to open plan in Eland House is part of the Department's plan to rationalise its central London buildings by March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.426W.9/1">The Department provides funding for cycling through the integrated block of the Local Transport Plan (LTP) settlement. English local highway authorities outside London have informed the Department that their investment in cycle friendly infrastructure on or around the road network for each of the last two years is &pound;39 million in 2004-05 and &pound;34.1 million in 2005-06. The Department does not require local authorities to provide an estimate of future spend on cycling so no data are yet available for 2006-07 and 2007-08. The integrated block element of the LTP settlement was worth &pound;547 million in 2006-07.</p>

TfL estimate they have invested &pound;8.49 million in 2004-05 and &pound;12.1 million in 2005-06 on cycle schemes on or around the road network with the majority of expenditure coming from this source. TfL forecast spend will be &pound;15.4 million in 2006-07 and 20.5 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.9/3">In addition, the Department set up Cycling England in 2005 with a budget of &pound;5 million for 2005-06 to fund their work to encourage more cycling of which &pound;3.1 million was invested in cycle friendly infrastructure. The Secretary of State has since doubled Cycling England's budget to &pound;10 million a year of which &pound;5.7 million has been allocated in 2006-07 on cycle infrastructure and forecast that in 2007-08 will spend a further &pound;3.5 million. The Department also made a one-off investment of &pound;10 million to extend the National Cycle Network to 305 schools in 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="a.433W.6/1">No DWP Ministers have had meetings with members of the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) to discuss these matters during the last five years. Ministers do however meet regularly with the Chair of HSC to discuss workplace health and safety issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/2" class="italic"> Background</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/3" class="indent">1. In marshalling HSE's inspection resource, HSE seeks to target poor performers. The key criteria in establishing the frequency of inspections are the risks presented by particular duty holders, premises or industries and the ability and willingness of duty holders to manage those risks. Where the risk is low and duty holders' ability high, visits are less frequent than where the risk is high and duty holders are failing to manage those risks. In targeting the inspection resource in this way, HSE believes it has the greatest impact on reducing work-related deaths, injuries and ill health.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/4" class="indent">2. In 2003, HSE ceased to set targets for the number of inspection contacts. Such targets encouraged short visits to low risk places, whereas the Health and Safety Commission's strategy for workplace health and safety 2010 sought a sharper focus on injury and ill health priorities, and more substantial contacts with a carefully selected range of duty holders. Over the last five years or so, the actual time HSE inspectors have spent interacting with and encouraging duty holders has increased by 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/5" class="indent">3. Important as inspection is, the frequency of inspections is not a particularly useful metric. The Health and Safety Commission's strategy fully recognises the importance of inspection, and the threat of enforcement, as a powerful motivator for improved standards. But to be most effective, they need to sit alongside other interventions, such as encouraging partnership working, communications, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/6" class="italic"> Inspection in Higher Education</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/7" class="indent">1. HSE sees higher education as a mature sector. The risks are for the most part well known (including those associated with laboratory work with hazardous chemicals), well understood, well managed and there are well-established networks and institutions for their management. In line with the approach set out in the aforementioned paragraphs 1-3, HSE has therefore no general proactive inspection programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/8" class="indent">4. However, this year, some proactive inspection will take place examining higher education institution's management of work-related stress&mdash;HSE inspectors will visit about 120 universities. Work-related stress is one of the priority topics identified in the Commissions strategy for workplace health and safety 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/9" class="indent">5. This inspection activity follows a series of seminars in the autumn of 2006, to which all higher education institutions were invited&mdash;and which nearly 50 per cent. of all institutions attended&mdash;designed to equip institutions with knowledge and skills to tackle work-related stress through the use of HSE's Stress Management Standards. This programme of inspection will look at whether the Management Standards (or any equivalent approach) is being used, or if it is, assist in ensuring action is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.433W.6/10" class="indent">6. A second programme of inspection activity will look at the management of slipping and tripping hazards&mdash;a hazard the sector recognises as a particular issue&mdash;another of the Commission's priority topics. These inspections will follow a series of nationwide seminars run by HSE, in partnership with the sector, which will equip attendees with the knowledge and skills to manage slips and trips.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.5/1">Details on the how the DWP's estimate of seven million undersavers was derived were published in annex A to the White Paper Security in retirement: towards a new pension system in May 2006. The DWP estimates are based on a new data source, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), which was not available to the Pensions Commission, but the same benchmark replacement rates. ELSA collects information on pension wealth accrued to date, and is the best data source available at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.5/2">The annex also outlines two major reasons for differences between the two estimates. The DWP estimate is based on household level data, while the Pensions Commission's figures are based on individual level data. (This means that an individual with a low pension themselves but whose spouse has enough for both would be counted by the Pensions Commission as an undersaver but not in the DWP's estimates.) The Pensions Commission looked just at pension wealth, while the DWP estimates include other financial assets, non-owner occupied housing wealth and business assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.5/3">Estimates of the current level of undersaving for retirement are difficult to construct due to: difficulties identifying appropriate saving targets; uncertainties about which kinds of wealth and asset to take into account; difficulties projecting individuals' future saving and working patterns, particularly around choice of retirement age; and reliance on a range of other uncertain assumptions, including the impact of future macro-economic developments. Consequently such estimates should be treated cautiously.</p>

They are available from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan website. The targets are shared among members of the UK Biodiversity Partnership.

	<p pid="a.442W.9/4">The three countries most likely to make payments to bulls kept for bullfighting (Spain, Portugal and France) did not take up the option to retain the BSPS and it therefore closed in those countries at the end of 2005. Only Denmark, Finland and Sweden have retained the BSPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.9/5">Payments under the BSPS are made to eligible bulls and steers and are subject to regional ceilings in each member state.

The regional ceilings applied to Spain, France and Portugal for the five years before the scheme's closure were:</p>

	<p pid="a.449W.8/1">All elements of the additional income support made available to farmers must be incorporated into the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and, specifically, the model of the scheme that member states have already adopted. This falls under the terms of the November 2005 agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.8/2">In England, the SPS is administered by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA), which is the accredited Paying Agency which makes Common Agricultural Policy payments to English farmers. Given the impracticality of two paying agencies administering different, but closely inter-related, aspects of the same scheme for the same farmers, the RPA was the natural choice to administer the additional income support.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.8/3">Even if this had not been the case, it is highly unlikely that British Sugar would have been considered as a candidate. The EU has regulatory requirements that member states must restrict paying agency numbers to the minimum necessary and that such agencies must be public rather than private bodies.</p>

At the planning application stage, PPS25 requires appropriate site specific Flood Risk Assessments to be provided by developers to describe how flood risk will be managed in detail.

	<p pid="a.454W.5/1">The Nitrates Directive requires member states to designate as nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) any land draining to waters identified as polluted, or likely to be polluted, by nitrates from agricultural sources. These designations must be reviewed at least every four years. Nearly 55 per cent. of land in England is currently designated as NVZs.</p>
	<p pid="a.454W.5/2">The directive further requires an action programme to be established and implemented within the designated NVZs to protect the identified waters .The directive offers member states the option of applying action programme measures across the whole of its national territory. The four-yearly review of designations is not required where this option is followed. The Government have opted to take a discrete area approach to implementing the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.454W.5/3">A review of NVZ designations, as required by the directive, is nearing completion. Depending on the outcome, consideration may be given to adopting a whole territory approach and to applying action programme measures throughout England.

	<p pid="a.460W.0/17">The successful reform of the EU tobacco regime in 2004 introduced &quot;decoupling&quot;, which means that the direct link between production and support is broken. This applies progressively from 2006 until 2010 when direct support for tobacco production will cease altogether.</p>

	<p pid="a.461W.5/1">The 2004 UK Woodfuel Resource Study looked at the potential supply from sources including coniferous and broadleaved woodland, sawmill co-products, arboricultural arisings and short rotation coppice. In England it estimated that there was a potential resource of over 0.5 million tonnes of arboricultural arisings.

Based on our forecasts of production and knowledge extrapolated from past information on consumption we believe that it is unlikely there will be a significant change in demand in the short term. With less than 20 per cent. of UK wood and wood product consumption coming from trees grown in the UK, any changes in demand may have more impact on imports than on UK production.</p>

However, in addition we have already allocated &pound;35 million for the demonstration of carbon abatement technologies, which includes both cleaner coal and carbon capture and storage technologies.</p>

Defra, the Department for Trade and Industry, and associated agencies and non-departmental public bodies currently run a number of different climate change-related communications activities focused on specific issues and target audiences. These include campaigns to address business and household energy efficiency, renewable power generation, low-carbon transport and climate change impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.469W.5/3">The Energy Saving Trust (EEST), which is funded by Defra to promote energy efficiency in the household sector, runs campaigns to encourage consumers to take energy saving action. EST's &quot;Save Your 20 per cent.&quot; marketing campaign is a key source of information and a call to action for consumers to reduce their energy use and install energy efficient measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.469W.5/4">In addition, Defra is developing a CO2 calculator. This will be launched in the spring and promoted with an advertising campaign. It will help individuals to calculate their CO2 footprint enable them to make more informed choices about how to save energy.</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.5/2">Since 2000 around &pound;20 million has been committed to support research and development of tidal-stream energy technologies under the DTI Technology Programme, and a further &pound;50 million has been made available under the DTI's Marine Renewables Deployment Fund to support the first larger-scale pre-commercial grid- connected wave and tidal-stream demonstration projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.474W.5/4">The Government's main mechanism for supporting renewable energy is the renewables obligation (RO). The RO is a market-based mechanism, which requires electricity suppliers to source an increasing percentage of their electricity sales from eligible sources of renewable energy providing a substantial market incentive for renewable energy, including tidal power. The Government recently announced, in the Energy Review Report, their intention to consider 'banding' the RO, so as to give more support to emerging energy technologies including tidal power.</p>
	<p pid="a.474W.5/5">It also announced that the DTI, together with the Welsh Assembly Government, are working with the Sustainable Development Commission, the South West Regional Development Agency and other key interested parties to explore the issues arising on the tidal resource in the UK, including the Severn estuary, including potential costs and benefits of development using a range of tidal technologies and their public acceptability.

	<p pid="a.487W.2/1">The evidence taken into account in this situation came predominantly from the levels of activity in the Further Education (FE) sector as recorded through the Learning and Skills Councils (LSC's) Individualised Learner Record (ILR). ESOL provision in England is growing at an unsustainable level and there are waiting lists for courses in most key regions, particularly in London. Although it is not possible to have wholly disaggregated information beyond getting a view of the total levels, it is clear that something needs to be done to ensure that we prioritise provision on those who most need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.2/2">As a result a range of measures have been introduced including new ESOL for Work qualifications. These will be shorter, simpler and more work focused, to better meet the needs of employers and those who need English for the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.2/1">There are two categories of ESOL qualifications presently available; ESOL Skills for Life and ESOL International.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/2">ESOL Skills for Life qualifications were designed to meet the needs of those people who are resident, or at least on long term stays in this country. On that basis they are comprehensive in nature, covering the broad range of skills and cultural contexts, and often delivered through quite long courses. They do not best meet the needs of those people wishing to acquire language skills for the specific purpose of getting a job, either in terms of the way they are delivered and their content. It these qualifications provide verification that learners have evenly balanced skills in each of the main skill areas of reading, writing, speaking and listening, the work environment may not require all of these skills to be present at the same levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/3">ESOL International qualifications have been developed by Awarding Bodies, predominantly, to meet the needs of an international market with a more academic focus. It is recognised that these make a significant contribution to the economy but this is a fee paying market and the qualifications are geared to this. These qualifications tend to be graded, have the same assumptions about the balance of skills as their Skills for Life cousins and carry quite heavy assessment burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.2/4">The new ESOL for Work qualifications will better provide for the needs of those people and employers requiring language purely for employment purposes by providing an easy to understand pass/fail qualification with slimmed down assessment processes, but most importantly recognising achievement of a balance of skills at the range of levels necessary for work. For instance, it may be that reading, speaking and listening are required at a higher level than writing.</p>

	<p pid="a.488W.5/1">The quality of provision of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) is critically important to their chances of success and progression. The Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) has a clear remit to improve the quality of all Skills for Life through the Skills for Life Improvement Programme and its related projects which are being funded for the 2007/08 period with over &pound;16 million. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has also been asked to work with Awarding Bodies to extend the range of qualifications presently on offer to include a new ESOL for Work qualification. The combination of these actions should work to improve quality and extend provision by ensuring that there are qualifications which meet the needs of employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.5/2">The new ESOL for Work qualifications will better provide for the needs of those people and employers requiring language purely for employment purposes by providing an easy to understand pass/fail qualification with slimmed down assessment processes.

For instance, it may be that reading, speaking and listening are required at a higher level than writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.5/3">Importantly the opportunity has been taken to strengthen connections between the quality of ESOL teaching and the requirement of ESOL qualifications. These reforms will be implemented from September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.488W.5/4">The breadth of provision and quality are key aims and although significant improvements have been made since the launch of Skills for Life in 2001, the drive for excellence will continue to be supported.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.2/1">To answer the question with a degree of accuracy requires a combination of information from the pupil data submitted to the DfES by schools and the learner data that is submitted to the LSC by FE colleges. The two datasets have not been combined for all adult learners to match the learner information together, so an analysis of retention rates in further education provision based on post-16 pupils' special educational needs (SEN) status during their time in compulsory education is not possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.2/2">However, learner self-assessment of whether they have learning difficulty, disability and/or health problem is recorded on the LSC's learner data. In 2004-05 the national success rate for these learners was 73 per cent., compared to 74 per cent. for those without learning difficulty, disability and/or health problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.2/3">In the future it will be possible for information about the SEN status of pupils in schools to be matched to information about individuals in the FE sector as the education and training sector adopts Unique Learner Numbers (ULNs) as part of the portfolio of work within the Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) programme. This will enable the progress of learners with SEN to be monitored in terms of the schools local authority legal definition, enabling local areas to understand better how they are supporting their local communities and what changes they may need to make to improve services.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.5/1">The P scales are for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) working below level 1 of the National Curriculum. For children working at levels P1 to P3, we would expect teachers to assess the type and range of performance that a child working at this level might demonstrate across a range of subjects. The guidance issued by my Department, &quot;Supporting the target setting process&quot;, provides the same descriptors of performance across all subjects at P levels 1 to 3, with some subject specific examples to help teachers with assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.5/2">The P scales were first published to assist schools in setting targets for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and were further developed following a review in 2003. The review sought the views of a range of respondents including staff in mainstream and special schools, Ofsted inspectors and members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. There was endorsement for the use of P scales in all settings and for the collection of national data.</p>

	<p pid="a.494W.3/1">In our regular assessments of the overall human rights situation in Colombia we take into account the actions of the Colombian Government, including the Department of Administrative Security (DAS). As in other areas of Government, there have been allegations of irregularities on the part of the DAS, such as links with paramilitaries (according to the 2005 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Annual Report). While we are concerned by this, we are encouraged by the willingness of the relevant Colombian authorities to investigate these issues and by President Uribes's statement that he will not tolerate abuses by state officials or members of the security forces. For example, the former head of the DAS is currently under investigation. We regularly raise human rights issues with the Colombian Government and urge them to take steps to improve the record of the security forces, including the DAS.</p>

This was surplus stock that the UKAEA no longer required.

	<p pid="a.498W.5/1">Pay rates for UK service personnel are recommended by the independent Armed Forces' Pay Review Body (AFPRB), which reports annually to my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary. The AFPRB bases its recommendations on broad comparability with the pay of civilian occupations of similar job weight and responsibility within the UK. To this basic pay is then added an additional element called the 'X-factor' (currently 13 per cent. of basic pay). This adjustment to military pay is recommended by the AFPRB in recognition of the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the UK armed forces over a full career and conditions in UK civilian life, which cannot be taken directly into account in assessing pay comparability. The 'X-factor' is paid to service personnel (up to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and equivalent at the mid pay point, beyond which it tapers) throughout their service careers&mdash;regardless of where they are serving and is pensionable.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/2">The 13 per cent. X-factor is for regular personnel and some reservists, particularly those who are mobilised. The majority of reservists, however, receive 5 per cent. or 0 per cent. X-factor reflecting the different levels of commitment from those of regular personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/3">All UK service personnel are on Pay 2000, an incremental structure designed to recognise performance, length of service, and qualifications. In the case of other ranks there are two pay spines&mdash;higher and lower&mdash;and personnel are allocated to them according to their trade and rank.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/4">Basic pay is part of a wider remuneration package payable to service personnel which includes specialist pay e.g. flying pay or parachute pay, to recruit and retain personnel in specific branches or arms within the services. Various allowances are also payable, such as a separation allowance, to compensate personnel for time away from their permanent base and separation from their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/5">Members of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment (RGR) are on the same pay structure as UK regular forces, but with a lower level of X-factor, 5 per cent., to reflect their different level of commitment. RGR reservists receive an X-factor of 2.5 per cent. Where members of the RGR volunteer for service with UK regular forces, however, they receive the same remuneration package as their UK counterparts. Pay rates for the Regiment are adjusted annually by the Ministry of Defence in accordance with the increases recommended by the AFPRB. The RGR is paid for by the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/6">The criteria used to determine the pay structure and revisions to the pay structure, and the conditions of service for the Bermuda Regiment, and the Falkland Islands Defence Force are a matter for the Governments of those Overseas Territories in accordance with their delegated responsibilities. They are not funded by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/7">The Overseas Territories' military units exist primarily for local defence, whereas the UK armed forces have an expectation of worldwide service. The respective conditions of service of these organisations will therefore be tailored accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.5/8">As the information requested on pay scales is lengthy, it has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.506W.5/3">The children of service personnel who benefit from service education allowances attend a considerable number of educational establishments. A list of those educational establishments that accommodated children of service personnel in receipt of education allowances in academic years 2005-06 and 2006-07 has been placed in the Library of the House.

	<p pid="a.506W.5/14">The Ministry of Defence records the number of service claimants, the number of children benefiting from service education allowances and the educational establishments they attend. The Department does not have figures that identify the cumulative value of service education allowances which, via service claimants, benefit each individual educational establishment. Also, the number of service children benefiting from education allowances does not indicate the number of service claimants, as one service parent might claim for one or more children.</p>

	<p pid="a.506W.5/16">Eligible Ministry of Defence civil servants can claim a tax free schooling allowance for children attending fee paying schools overseas or at independent schools in the UK. The annual cost in the UK for 2005-06 is around &pound;1.1 million. However, as claims for the allowance overseas are reimbursed by local budgets, there is no central record of such costs and the total figure could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.506W.5/17">Like the services, the number of children of civil servants benefiting from schooling allowances does not indicate the number of civil servant claimants, as one parent may claim for one or more children. The figure is estimated to be in the region of 100 children.</p>

The data covers firearms stolen on a global basis, including operational theatres overseas, and private firearms lodged in MOD armouries. The total value of the stolen firearms could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The theft of any firearm is taken very seriously and is fully investigated by the police. The police undertaking the investigation may, depending on the circumstances of the theft, be the Service police, Ministry of Defence police or a Home Department police force, often working jointly.

Unfortunately, these processes are not infallible and the pressures on units prior to deployment have meant that there have been a small number of instances where soldiers have been inadvertently deployed to Iraq before their 18<sup>(th)</sup> birthday, as described above.</p>

Under the scheme, the police can issue an 80 fixed penalty for a number of fireworks offences under the Explosives Act 1875 and Fireworks Act 2003. The offence of throwing fireworks in a thoroughfare (Explosives Act) came into force in August 2002: the offences of breach of the fireworks curfew, possession of category four fireworks, and possession by a person under 18 of an adult firework (Fireworks Act) were added to the PND Scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October 2004</phrase>. The following table shows the number of PNDs that were issued in the Leicestershire police force area for 2005 and for January to June 2006 (provisional); complete figures for 2006 will be available in the spring of 2007. We are unable to give the number of PNDs issued in Leicester during the above period, as data are not collected to that level of detail.</p>

	<p pid="a.520W.0/1">Magnetic resonance imaging was tried for explosives detection in suitcases about 10 years ago. It was found to lack specificity when compared with other techniques. The need for high magnetic fields and problems with commonly occurring metals also mitigated against its use. More recently, MRI has been looked at to examine liquid explosives. This system used the Earth's field and was consequently very slow in its operation. An analogous technique, quadrupole resonance analysis, has been developed for detecting explosives containing nitrogen and systems are available commercially.</p>
	<p pid="a.520W.0/2">Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging is currently being considered as an alternative to using a polygraph, or, more probably, to use MRI scanning as an input to a polygraph to detect deception. Home Office scientists will be visiting King's College London shortly to discuss the possibility of using MRI in this role.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.5/2">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) has been established to reduce the harm caused to the UK by serious organised crime. Its priorities, set by the Home Secretary, are Class A drugs trafficking and organised immigration crime, but it also devotes effort to other organised crime threats, including fraud against individuals and the private sector, hi-tech crime, counterfeiting, the use of firearms and serious robbery.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.5/3">In terms of the National Intelligence Model (NIM), SOCA will concentrate its efforts at Level 3 criminality (usually operating on a national and international scale). However, to be effective in reducing harm, it will need to collaborate with and support the efforts of other agencies, including police forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.5/4">SOCA supports police forces operationally in a variety of ways that bear on Level 2 criminality. For example, it provides expert advice and resources in cases of kidnap and extortion, sensitive technical support and a 'flagging' service that ensures that forces do not compromise one another's operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.8/2">SOCA is a national agency. Should the policing and criminal justice functions currently held by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland transfer to the Northern Ireland Executive in the future, the Executive would assume responsibility for SOCA as set out in the relevant legislation. This will in practical terms, give the Northern Ireland Executive the power to contribute to the strategic priorities and the annual plan of the Agency, in particular with regards to how SOCA exercises its functions in Northern Ireland, and to be consulted about the appointment to any assistant to the director with specific responsibilities for Northern Ireland.</p>

Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS BSA may be notified of joiners or leavers to or from the general dental services or personal dental services up to several months, or more, after the move has taken place.<br/> <i> Sources:</i><br/> The Information Centre for health and social care<br/>  NHS Business Services Authority (BSA)</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.539W.2/2">A number of private providers are responsible for installing and managing bedside telephone services and it is these providers, not the hospital themselves, that charge the user directly. The service is provided as a free good to the national health service and the contract is made directly between the patient and the service provider.</p>
