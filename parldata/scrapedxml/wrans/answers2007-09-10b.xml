	<p pid="b.1936W.2/1">In the 12 months to July 2007 the Home Office has implemented advertising campaigns covering its policy responsibilities relating to crime reduction, drugs, internet child protection, alcohol harm reduction, recruitment of police community support officers, local trials of the single non-emergency number, employing illegal immigrants, domestic violence and the passport application procedure for first time applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/2">These policies and programmes affect the lives of millions of people and in order for them to work they must be communicated effectively. A campaign will only be implemented where there is a clear role for communications in achieving the overall policy target. All campaigns are managed with cost efficiency in mind and there are strict rules to ensure value for money on Government advertising. All advertising media are bought using COI framework media agencies which have clear targets for achieving value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/3">Effective evaluation of campaign advertising is standard departmental practice. Particular evaluation techniques will depend on the objective of the campaign and the nature of the advertising implemented, however the Department would typically use a combination of:</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/4" class="indent">Spontaneous and prompted advertising awareness and recall of messages;</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/5" class="indent">Changes in key audience attitudes before and after the campaign;</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/6" class="indent">Changes in claimed behaviour in key audiences before and after the campaign;</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/7" class="indent">Specific policy/product detail recall;</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/8" class="indent">Agreement with relevant statements (pre/post);</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/9" class="indent">Response to advertising where appropriate (telephone, coupon, website);</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/10" class="indent">Econometric analysis;</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/11" class="indent">Advertising media cost audits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/12">Of the major advertising campaigns undertaken during this period, the Acquisitive Crime Reduction campaign has achieved 90 per cent. recognition with 60 per cent. of respondents claiming the adverts would make them take more precautions to protect them from becoming a victim of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/13">The alcohol 'Know Your Limits' campaign achieved 84 per cent. prompted recall of the TV advertising. Additionally 82 per cent. of respondents said the advertising made them rethink the consequences of drinking too much</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/14">The Police Community Support Officer recruitment campaign generated over 52,000 requests for application packs, helping achieve the recruitment target of 16,400 recruits&mdash;with those aware of the advertising campaign twice as likely to consider being a PCSO as those who were not (13 per cent. <i> v</i><i> .</i> 5 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/15">The FRANK drugs helpline awareness campaign has achieved recognition among 94 per cent. of its key 15 to 18-year-old audience, with 70 per cent &quot;very&quot; or &quot;quite likely&quot; to call FRANK if they needed information in the future. Additionally, 81 per cent. of young people would recommend FRANK to friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.1936W.2/16">Additionally, the Home Office is working with Cabinet Office on a number of initiatives to improve the efficiency of civil service recruitment process, such as combining advertising with other Departments where possible to reduce advertising costs. The Home Office is also contributing to an OGC-led initiative for a central framework contract for head-hunters and recruitment consultants.</p>

	<p pid="b.1942W.9/1">Coastal towns and villages will benefit from the Government's plans, announced in the Housing Green Paper 'Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable'. We are providing at least &pound;8 billion over the next three years to invest in the supply of housing, including an increase in affordable housing, initially through the Housing Corporation and then through the new homes agency. This is an increase of &pound;3 billion compared to the previous three years and will help to deliver at least 70,000 more affordable homes a year by 2010-11. All areas, urban, rural and coastal will benefit from these resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1942W.9/2">Planning Policy Statement (PPS)3 for Housing encourages local and regional planning bodies to take more account of affordability when determining how many new homes are needed in their area. PPS3 includes stronger policies on affordable housing. The new definition of affordable housing will concentrate public funding and planning contributions on genuinely affordable housing. In addition, local authorities will be able to require developer contributions to affordable housing on smaller sites where it is viable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1942W.9/3">Planning and housing policies at the local level should be based upon an up-to-date housing needs assessment for a particular area. The findings of the assessment will inform decisions on the level of housing provision and its distribution in local development frameworks and policies on affordable housing and housing mix. It will also allow local authorities to consider the housing demands and needs of specific groups of people including families with children, older people and disabled people, as well as the precise nature and location of the area, such as coastal towns and villages.</p>

A restraint order had been made against their assets on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-24">24 May 2005</phrase>, which had a worldwide effect and also contained a provision for the repatriation of movable assets held abroad. The order also contained a clear warning that breach of the order would amount to contempt of court. This had been considered to be sufficient to prevent further dissipation of assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1944W.2/4">On discovery that Mr. Adewunmi had in fact breached the order, a money laundering investigation was begun; this showed how Mr. Adewunmi was able further to dissipate the assets. As a consequence of this behaviour, proceedings for contempt were taken against Mr. Adewunmi and, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June 2007</phrase>, confiscation orders were made against both Mr. and Mrs. Adewunmi; Mr. Adewunmi was also sentenced for a fraud on Slough borough council. In addition, Mr. Adewunmi admitted being in breach of the restraint order. As a result, he was committed to prison for 18 months' consecutive to the sentence which he was already serving.</p>
	<p pid="b.1944W.2/5">It has been calculated that Mr. Adewunmi transferred abroad a total of &pound;137,673.56 out of the &pound;867,200 stolen by him; some of this money was repatriated but the majority is caught in the confiscation order which he has to pay.</p>

From the information available regarding the bridge in Minnesota, the Highways Agency has concluded there are no bridges identical on the network of motorways and major A roads in England. The Highways Agency is however undertaking a review of its maintenance and inspection processes. If improvements are needed, these will be communicated to other UK bridge owners, including local highway authorities, who are responsible for the majority of other road bridges.</p>

Work is under way to monitor and address the corrosion that has been found in the suspension cables and over the next year, the Agency will be considering a long-term strategy for the bridge. The bridge remains safe for use, although as a precautionary measure, vehicles over 7.5 tonnes are restricted to lane one in each direction.</p>

	<p pid="b.1956W.5/1">Statutory Instrument (SI) 2003 No.1497, which came into effect in June 2003, established that the national health service in England was responsible for English residents. Similarly, SI 2003 No.150 (W20) confirmed that Welsh local health boards were responsible for their resident population, including those registered with a GP in England. A protocol was agreed between the Department and the Welsh Assembly Government in 2005 to phase the operational implications of these changes. This protocol set out interim arrangements for specific border primary care trusts and local health boards, where operational responsibility would rest with the commissioner responsible for the GP with whom the patient was registered. Last year the protocol was extended until March 2008. Work is continuing between the Welsh Assembly Government and the Department to finalise the package of care and services that will be provided for patients registered with a GP across the border from their country of residence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1961W.8/1">The &quot;Top Tips for Top Mums&quot; campaign aims to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in families with young children and has a particular focus on low-income families. This audience faces the most barriers to increase fruit and vegetable consumption including cost, lack of cooking skills, fussy eaters and a lack of structured mealtimes. &quot;Top Tips for Top Mums&quot; has been developed to show parents that helping their children to eat more fruit and vegetables is a healthy option and easier than they may think.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.8/2">To take the campaign forward, we are working with our existing &quot;5 a Day&quot; stakeholders and engaging with new partners to support the campaign. We are developing new radio and TV fillers which will help to promote the ideas of the Top Tips campaign and encourage fruit and vegetable consumption. The fillers are planned to go live in November 2007 and are expected to achieve at least &pound;4 million pounds worth of free advertising space over a three-year period. New web pages will launch on the &quot;5 a Day&quot; website to coincide with the launch of the TV and radio fillers, and will incorporate a mechanism for parents to upload and share their own Top Tips with others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.8/3">To date, we have spent approximately &pound;481,000 on the &quot;Top Tips for Top Mums&quot; campaign including activity to support partnership marketing, public relations (PR) aimed at both the national and local media and on website development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.8/4">The production of the TV and radio fillers will cost &pound;300,000 and a further &pound;300,000 has been committed to extend the campaign initiative into 2008 to recruit key partnerships, and sustain high profile PR and media activity to promote awareness of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1961W.8/5">We track changes in consumption in fruit and vegetables in different population groups using the Food Standards Agency Consumer Activity Survey and the Health Survey for England.</p>

	<p pid="b.1980W.13/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-05">5 September 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will estimate (a) direct and (b) indirect taxes as a percentage of gross income for households with an income (i) lower and (ii) higher than (A) 95 percent of all households, (B) 99 percent of all households, (C) 75 percent of all households and (D) 25 per cent, of all households. (152707).</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/4" class="indent">Estimates of household income and related taxes are provided in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2005/06 was published on the National Statistics website on 17th May 2007 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/5" class="indent">Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all before tax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes&mdash;these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/6" class="indent">Indirect taxes, when expressed as a proportion of gross income, appear particularly high for those on lower income, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. Estimates of indirect taxes are estimated based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for low income households where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are not being met solely from current income, and so indirect taxes are very high when expressed as a proportion of gross income.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/7" class="indent">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower income households in particular include some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EPS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1980W.13/8" class="indent">It is usually accepted that surveys have problems picking up data from extremely high income households. With the EPS having a sample of approximately 7,000 households, interpreting data for this high income group should be done with caution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1984W.6/1">My Department has a research programme examining the experiences of vulnerable court users in both civil (including family) and criminal proceedings. One of the identified groups is individuals with mental health problems. Within this programme, we have commissioned two complimentary literature reviews, due for publication by 2008. One focuses on how people with mental health problems access and experience justice and the barriers they face. The other focuses more on the implementation and impact of legislation on individuals with mental health problems. These reports discuss, but do not specifically delineate between victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1984W.6/2">During 2007 we expect to commission a 12-16 month project to determine how effectively the court system supports the complex and specific needs of individuals with mental health problems, learning disabilities or limited mental capacity. The focus will be on parties, victims and witnesses in both civil (including family) and criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1984W.6/3">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform published a report on the evaluation of the use of special measures for Vulnerable and Intimidated Witnesses (VIWs), one of the criteria for which is having a mental disorder. The report found that VIWs were, and felt, better assisted than prior to the implementation of the special measures. But there continued to be a significant unmet need. However, there have been substantial developments in Government work relating to victims and witnesses since this piece of research was commissioned in 2000-01, which qualifies the conclusions of the study. The report has been placed in the libraries of the House and can also be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1985W.5/1">The Government are wholly committed to ensuring that a high quality service is provided to victims of serious crimes and to rebalancing the criminal justice system towards victims. The victim liaison service is a key part of delivering that commitment since it provides victims with both a means of being kept informed as the offender's sentence progresses and opportunities to make representations on issues relating to their safety in the event of the prisoner being released.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.5/2">The Government value the public sector and believe it must continue to play a major role in probation services. However, all current providers should be open to challenge and be given the opportunity to demonstrate that the services they offer are the best available. The Offender Management Act 2007 has established probation trusts, accountable through contract to the Secretary of State. We have asked probation boards to consider whether other providers have the capability to deliver service improvements and to contract with those providers who can demonstrate a more effective use of resources. This approach will allow the probation boards and trusts to focus more effectively on the core activity of offender management, and bring other providers in to deliver other services where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.5/3">As part of the move to the competitive provision of services, probation boards have been given a target of contracting out 10 per cent. of their service budget by the end of 2007/08. The London Probation Board has been working closely with the Regional Offender Manager to identify the services most appropriate for this process, and victim liaison is an area of operation where it has been agreed that steps should be taken to develop the use of external providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1985W.5/4">If the decision is taken to contract out the service, the statutory responsibility, and accountability for service delivery, would remain with the London Probation Board. Consequently, the London Probation Board would be accountable for ensuring that any contractor delivered its statutory responsibilities to the high standard required.</p>

This figure includes central purchases for courts, tribunals and offices. Costs of newspapers and magazines taken by the National Offender Management Service and the Office for Criminal Justice Reform are not included as they have yet to be transferred from the Home Office. Costs of subscriptions held locally by courts, tribunals and other business areas for which my Department is responsible can be compiled only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1996W.5/1">The statutory requirement to &quot;advise, assist and befriend&quot; was deleted from the relevant legislation when the Probation Order became the Community Rehabilitation Order under the 1991 Criminal Justice Act. To advise, to assist and to befriend are all inputs in probation work with offenders. In common with most of the public sector, the probation service has been more focused in recent years upon the outcomes of its efforts rather than the inputs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/2">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (s 142) sets down five purposes of sentencing. Offender Managers&mdash;Probation Officers and Probation Service Officers&mdash;are charged with implementing sentences of the court in order to achieve the purpose or purposes defined by the court for any individual sentence passed. The Offender Management Model, which has been implemented for all offenders on community sentences and around 14 per cent. of offenders in custody, sets out the NOMS end-to-end case management approach. Within this approach, Offender Managers will select one of the four broad options for which the one-word labels&mdash;PUNISH, HELP, CHANGE and CONTROL&mdash;are a &quot;shorthand&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1996W.5/3">The Offender Management Model itself describes what these labels mean in more detail. The terms PUNISH, HELP, CHANGE and CONTROL map well against the five purposes of sentencing set out in the Act. They each attract different workload allowances for the Offender Manager. The Offender Management Model describes a case management approach with a sound working relationship between an Offender Manager and an offender at its core. Advising, assisting and befriending are approaches an Offender Manager might use in that relationship, depending on the needs and learning style in each case, in order to achieve the outcomes sought from the sentence, but advising, assisting and befriending are no longer viewed as the objectives of probation work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1999W.3/1">The Ministry of Justice and the Youth Justice Board do not hold the exact information requested but figures are available on the number of young people released from custody as part of the Detention and Training Order (DTO). This has been the main custodial sentence for young people since April 2001 and will make up the majority of young people released from imprisonment. The DTO has been designed so that half of the sentence is served in custody and the other half under supervision in the community. The aim of the DTO is to provide a clear focus on planned and constructive use of time spent in custody and effective supervision and support after release. This includes a strong emphasis on training and rehabilitation throughout.</p>

This equated to approximately 4 per cent. of the IPP population and includes those newly sentenced and waiting allocation. The situation will of course change daily as prisoners move. Whether an individual requires a programme, and if so, which programme, will depend upon the assessment of their risk and needs. Not all prisons provide the same programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.2002W.7/1">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has not yet released the full Afghanistan Opium Survey for 2007 which will contain details of the methodology used. However, we believe this year's opium survey used similar methodology to that used in the 2006 survey. This is described in detail in the 2006 Opium Survey available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.2002W.7/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/AFG05%20_full_web_2006.pdf">http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/AFG05%20_full_web_2006.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2002W.7/3">The UNODC calculated opium poppy cultivation by use of a sampling approach that combined interpretation of satellite imagery with field surveys on the ground. In order to estimate opium yield per hectare, the UNODC measured both the size of opium capsules and the density of cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2002W.7/4">The 2006 Opium Survey stated that the extent of heroin production is more difficult to establish, as opium in Afghanistan is primarily exported to foreign markets, where it is subsequently processed into heroin. Additionally, heroin laboratories, by their nature, are clandestine.</p>

	<p pid="b.2025W.2/1">The terms in question are not defined in statute. They describe various forms of third-party intervention with the aim of resolving workplace disputes, but the nature of the processes to which each refers can differ according to whether they are being used in the context of collective or individual employment disputes.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/2" class="italic"> Collective employment disputes</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/3">S210 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 states that:</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/4" class="indent">(1) Where a trade dispute exists or is apprehended Acas may, at the request of one or more parties to the dispute or otherwise, offer the parties to the dispute its assistance with a view to bringing about a settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/5" class="indent">(2) The assistance may be by way of conciliation or by other means, and may include the appointment of a person other than an officer or servant of Acas to offer assistance to the parties to the dispute with a view to bringing about a settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/6">Conciliation is a flexible process. It can be carried out in different ways according to the context of the dispute and the needs of the parties; although it always involves discussing the issues with both sides with a view to finding and recording a mutually acceptable solution. The distinguishing features of conciliation in collective employment disputes are that participation is voluntary for the parties; the conciliator's role is purely facilitative (i.e. he/she cannot formally recommend a solution or give any form of determination on the issues); and that a settlement reached in conciliation is not of itself binding in law (although on some substantive issues the outcome may be a change in employees' terms and conditions which may be incorporated into contracts of employment).</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/7">In practice, conciliation is always the first step in third-party collective dispute resolution. Only if a settlement cannot be achieved by this means will parties be encouraged to consider arbitration or mediation. Formal Terms of Reference must be agreed and drawn up before a dispute can be put to arbitration or mediation, and these are generally brokered with the assistance of a conciliator.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/8">S212 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 states that:</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/9" class="indent">(1) Where a trade dispute exists or is apprehended Acas may, at the request of one or more of the parties to the dispute and with the consent of all the parties to the dispute, refer all or any of the matters to which the dispute relates for settlement to the arbitration of</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/10" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> one or more persons appointed by Acas for that purpose (not being officers or employees of Acas), or</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/11" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> the Central Arbitration Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/12">The key distinguishing feature of arbitration in collective disputes is that the role of the arbitrator (in Scotland, the title is &quot;arbiter&quot;) is to give a formal determination on the issues put before him or her. However, participation remains voluntary for the parties; and an arbitration decision is not of itself binding in law (although as with agreements reached in conciliation, the outcome can result in a change in employees' terms and conditions which may be incorporated into contracts of employment).</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/13">Neither in the 1992 Act nor any other employment legislation is there explicit mention of mediation. However, in the collective employment relations context this term refers to a variant of arbitration under which the third party makes formal recommendations rather than giving a determination. Parties entering into mediation are free to choose to accept, ignore, or use the recommendations to inform further negotiation. In other respects, the two are essentially indistinguishable.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/14" class="italic"> Individual employment disputes</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/15">S211 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 states that:</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/16" class="indent">(1) ACAS shall designate some of its officers to perform the functions of conciliation officers under any enactment (whenever passed) relating to matters which are or could be the subject of proceedings before an industrial tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/17">The role of conciliation officers in individual rights claims is set out in S18 of the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996:</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/18" class="indent">(2) Where an application has been presented to an industrial tribunal, and a copy of it has been sent to a conciliation officer, it is the duty of the conciliation officer&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/19" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> if he is requested to do so by the person by whom and the person against whom the proceedings are brought, or</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/20" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> if, in the absence of any such request, the conciliation officer considers that he could act under this subsection with a reasonable prospect of success,</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/21" class="indent">to endeavour to promote a settlement of the proceedings without their being determined by an industrial tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/22">S18(3) of the 1996 Act extends the conciliator's role to resolving certain individual disputes in which no claim has as yet been presented to an employment tribunal:</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/23" class="indent">(3) Where at any time&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/24" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> a person claims that action has been taken in respect of which proceedings could be brought by him before an industrial tribunal, but</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/25" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> before any application relating to that action has been presented by him a request is made to a conciliation officer (whether by that person or by the person against whom the proceedings could be instituted) to make his services available to them,</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/26" class="indent">the conciliation officer shall act in accordance with subsection (2) as if an application had been presented to an industrial tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/27">Conciliation in individual rights disputes shares almost all the features of conciliation in collective disputes. The process is flexible and can be carried out in various ways according to the context and the needs of the parties, but will always involve discussing the issues with both sides with a view to finding and recording a mutually acceptable solution. Participation is voluntary for the parties, and the conciliator's role is purely facilitative (i.e. he/she cannot formally recommend a solution or give any form of determination on the issues). The critical difference, however, is that a settlement reached in the course of conciliation under S18 is legally binding in that it disposes of the claim(s) or potential claim(s) to the employment tribunal to which the terms of the settlement agreement refer.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/28">The use of arbitration in individual disputes is confined to the Acas Arbitration Scheme, which was introduced as a result of provisions created by the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998 to provide a voluntary alternative to the employment tribunal for resolution of unfair dismissal disputes. The Scheme was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-21">21 May 2001</phrase>, initially only in England and Wales, and was extended to cover Scotland on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-06">6 April 2004</phrase>. Under the ACAS (Flexible Working) Arbitration Scheme (England and Wales) Order 2003, and analogous Scottish legislation, the Scheme was widened on <phrase class="date" code="">61 April 2003</phrase> to allow for referrals to arbitration in respect of claims or prospective claims under the Flexible Working Regulations 2003 which came into force on the same date.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/29">The process of arbitration in individual disputes has much in common with that in collective disputes. Participation is voluntary for the parties. Independent arbitrators /arbiters are appointed by and paid through ACAS (but are not employees of that organisation) and give a formal determination on the issues put before them. However, in contrast to the situation in collective disputes, an arbitration decision under the statutory Scheme is binding in law, and effectively has the same force as a decision of an employment tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.2025W.2/30">There is no direct parallel in individual dispute resolution for the directive form of mediation carried out in collective disputes. The term &quot;mediation&quot; is used in relation to the resolution of individual workplace disputes; but to describe quite different processes. Nor is the term used consistently by all commentators or practitioners. For instance, some take it to encompass all non-directive forms of third-party dispute resolution, while there are others who only use it in respect of interventions which apply certain techniques or practices. Neither these nor any of the other ways in which the term is presently used affords an entirely satisfactory definition, and so instead BERR has used the word &quot;mediation&quot; to describe any non-directive third-party individual dispute resolution other than that conducted by ACAS under SI 8 of the 1996 Act, which continues to be defined as conciliation. The difference between mediation and conciliation in individual rights claims therefore lies in the statutory context rather than the techniques or the identity of the provider.</p>

Price signals which clearly reflect supply and demand conditions, including any local variations, are the most efficient way of bringing supply and demand together, through (for example) supply increase through investment in new supply capacity and demand reduction through investment in energy efficiency. Nationally regulated prices disguise these signals and may lead to waste, inefficiency and shortage as supplies fail to get to where they are most needed.</p>

The survey also found that 23 per cent. of employees reported that working from home on a regular basis was available to them (an increase from 20 per cent. in 2003).</p>
	<p pid="b.2030W.8/2">We are encouraging flexible working through the introduction of the right to request flexible working which was introduced in April 2003 for parents of young and disabled children. In April 2007 we extended this right to carers of adults. We also encourage flexible working through providing detailed guidance and promoting the benefits. The business.link.gov.uk website has a number of interactive tools. Both employers and employees can access the ACAS telephone helpline.</p>

	<p pid="b.2038W.0/21">The NDA purchases its accident insurance through an insurance programme which, subject to policy terms and conditions, covers all of its sites. This includes sites which generate electricity from nuclear power such as Oldbury and Wylfa; sites which generate electricity by other means such as Maentwrog (hydro); fuel fabrication sites such as Springfields; sites that are now in decommissioning such as Trawsfynydd, Hunterston and Chapelcross; multi-activity sites such as Sellafield; and finally non-nuclear administrative sites such as offices. Insurers give no premium breakdown across the sites in the NDA estate. The total premium including insurance premium tax for all classes of insurance across all NDA sites was &pound;25.5 million for financial year 2006-07. The NDA estimate between 7.5 per cent. and 17.5 per cent. of this is allocated to sites which generated electricity from nuclear power.</p>
