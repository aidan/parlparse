	<p pid=".937W.3/1">The celebration and evaluation of the 10 years since the Beijing Platform for Action will be an integral part of the UK Government's work on gender equality in 2005. The 49th Session of the Commission for the Status for Women (CSW) at the United Nations in March 2005 will review and appraise the implementation of Beijing over the last 10 years. The cross-Whitehall UK Government delegation will actively participate at CSW. We have already begun feeding into this process, completing a United Nations questionnaire on progress made since 1995 in the UK (available at <a href="http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk">www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk</a>), which will feed into the UN Secretary-General's report. During the UK Presidency of the EU, July to December 2005, we will host a major European conference and a Ministerial Informal meeting to consider best practice across the EU in relation to national implementation of the Beijing Platform. The UK Government are a strong advocate of the Beijing Platform for Action and UN initiatives to further gender equality.</p>

	<p pid=".943W.2/1">In the UK National Allocation Plan, sectors that are subject to international competition have been allocated according to projected need. The impact of the scheme on these sectors is expected to be similar to that of existing national policies. In those member states where more effort needs to be made to reach Kyoto targets, the impact of the scheme is expected, over time, to be that much greater.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.2/2">We are aware of different proposed implementation in the French and Spanish allocation plans, which would result in the vehicle manufacturing industries in those member states not being included in the scheme.

The UK has also been lobbying the Commission to ensure their assessment of allocation plans is robust, consistent and transparent.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.2/1">DFID is in regular contact with the Kenyan Government on the issue of corruption and its impact on our development assistance. DFID's Kenya Country Assistance Plan recognises that poverty reduction budget support is the Government of Kenya's preferred form of aid. It also makes clear that the level of British aid to Kenya, and whether or not we will provide bilateral poverty reduction budget support, will depend on the pace with which the Kenyan Government implements its Economic Recovery Strategy, especially in tackling corruption, preparing and implementing budgets that benefit the poor, and strengthening public financial management. Progress is not yet sufficient to enable us to provide such support. This point was most recently reinforced in a meeting with President Kibaki on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/2">We are particularly concerned about recent reports of corruption allegedly involving senior members of the Kenyan Government and have urged President Kibaki, in previous meetings, to ensure that appropriate and firm action is taken to investigate these reports, make the results public and take appropriate action against all those found to have acted corruptly. Some progress is being made, i.e. in the establishment of anti-corruption institutions, but it still remains to be seen whether this will lead to decisive action in the short-term.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/3">We will, therefore, continue to use sector support and project aid where we believe that it can have a sustainable impact on poverty reduction and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.5/1">The European Commission presented a communication to the Agriculture Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-19">19 July</phrase> that set out their preferred option for reform. The communication proposes to substantially reduce sugar exports and export refunds, abolish intervention, reduce ELI production and the internal sugar price and grant a de-coupled payment to sugar beet farmers. The reform process will start in July 2005. This should make the regime more market oriented and reduce the quantity of EU sugar exported to third markets. If the option were to be agreed, the Commission estimate that the combined, aggregate effect of the proposals on support price and quota reduction would be a significant reduction in the level of EU production under quota, from 17.3 million to 14.5 million tonnes per year. In turn, as a consequence of the substantial reduction in the overall level of EU production, EU subsidised sugar exports dumping are projected to fall by around 2 million tonnes. The Commission communication will be the subject of discussion between the EU Member States over the coming months.</p>

	<p pid=".947W.5/1">DFID has always stressed the need to take account of the impact that reform of the EU sugar regime will have on our developing country preferential suppliers. DFID is conscious that substantial reform will give rise to transitional problems for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP)s that currently benefit from preferential access to the EU market at existing price levels and for the Least Developed Countries (LDC)s seeking to develop an export trade to Europe under the EBA initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/2">In order to help inform the debate and ensure the impact on developing countries is taken sufficiently into consideration, DFID commissioned a study last year with LMC International and Oxford Policy Management, 'Addressing the Impact of Preference Erosion in Sugar on Developing Countries'. The study is divided into two sections. The first part assesses the economic and social impact on the ACP Sugar Protocol countries of the various reform scenarios suggested by the European Commission. The latter part of the study assesses alternative options for addressing the impact of preference erosion in sugar. The purpose of this analysis was to identify various options for debate by the ACP and the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".947W.5/3">DFID has recently commissioned two further pieces of work on this issue. The first report has been commissioned with LMC International, 'EU Sugar Reform: the Implications for the Development of LDCs and should be finalised early next month. The second report has been commissioned from the Overseas Development Institute, 'Forthcoming changes in EU sugar/banana markets: a menu of options for an effective EU transitional assistance package' and should also be finalised next month. This report should help those countries affected by reform determine their priorities for a transitional package. This report will include some analysis of alternative uses for sugar.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.2/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) engagement in Vietnam since 1997 has focused on supporting the Vietnamese Government in implementing its own strategies for poverty reduction. In their five-year plans, the Government of Vietnam has highlighted the severe poverty issues facing the Central Highlands where the majority of the Montagnard people live.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/2">From 1997 to 2003 DFID's strategy focused on working with other donors. During this period DFID has developed two projects with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which aim to improve the quality of services provided by the Vietnamese Government to poor people in four provinces of the Central Highlands region. The projects focus on greater participation by poor people in planning and monitoring services, which should ensure that the services provided are more appropriate and of better quality. In addition, DFID has funded UNICEF to improve water supplies to rural areas in three Central Highlands provinces.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/3">In DFID's Vietnam Country Assistance Plan, 2004&ndash;06, a key strategic objective is to strengthen the Government's efforts to achieve development which is socially inclusive. In addition to the co-financed ADB projects mentioned above, DFID is currently addressing the development needs of the Montagnard people through co-financing a number of national programmes, which include Central Highlands provinces, districts and communes along with those in other poor areas of Vietnam. In education, our two national programmes with the World Bank, Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children and Primary Teachers Development Project, are strengthening the capacity of local government to improve the quality of primary education for all children. In transport, DFID is working with the World Bank to improve access to rural roads for poor people and building Government capacity to monitor and forecast associated recurrent budget costs. DFID also co-finance two United Nations Development Programme projects aimed at strengthening the capacities of the National Assembly and a number of provincial People's Councils, including several in the Central Highlands region.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.2/4">The only programmes where DFID can explicitly disaggregate it's monetary aid, and aid in kind, for the Montagnard people are for our Rural Transport Programmes, and our Central Region Livelihoods Improvement Programme (CRLIP). Since 1997 our Rural Transport Programmes have disbursed &pound;512, 427 in the two Central Highland provinces of Dak Lak and Gia Lai. The CRLIP has pledged &pound;2,766,667 to the Central Highland Province of Kon Turn.</p>

	<p pid=".950W.2/1">DFID's support for the water sector is predominantly through our country programmes and support to multi-lateral institutions. This includes direct water sector activities, improvements attributed through assistance to other sectors such as health and education, as well as through our poverty reduction budget support, where expenditure reflects developing countries' own priorities and our assistance is coordinated with that of other donors. DFID works to assist countries to use their budgets to make the biggest impact on reducing poverty. DFID's Water Action Plan published in March 2004 and available on our website: <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a> emphasises the importance of water and sanitation in all aspects of development.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/2">DFID does provide significant support to the water sector; DFID's bilateral expenditure alone was estimated at &pound;87 million in 2001&ndash;02. DFID is currently undertaking work to update it's estimates and project our likely expenditure on water-related activities through to 2007&ndash;08, both bilaterally and multilaterally, including the results of DFID's initial resource allocation round in autumn 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/3">Critically, during 2005, the international community will be reviewing progress against all the MDGs, including the water and sanitation targets, and there will be a special UN General Assembly discussion. Leading up to that, the UK and other parties will be reviewing what further action needs to be taken on water and sanitation at the UN Commission for Sustainable Development in April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".953W.5/1">Within the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities are required to work with the police to conduct a review of levels and patterns of crime and disorder. They are then required to consult widely with key agencies, community groups, charities (such as Help the Aged and Age Concern) and the community about these findings. Each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships across England and Wales conduct resident surveys on a variety of issues to find out what people's concerns are, and then act on them as necessary. The survey covers a whole spectrum of residents from young people to older people.</p>
	<p pid=".953W.5/2">In addition, the Fear of Crime Team within the Home Office have presented to, and facilitated, workshops at the Help the Aged National and Regional Senior Safety Conferences, developed and published a vulnerability strategy which identifies and addresses fear of crime issues among older people, and developed Fear of Crime reassurance cards, which challenge misperceptions about local crime issues. These cards are being disseminated to older people by Help the Aged handyvan fitters and neighbourhood wardens.</p>

	<p pid=".956W.2/16">In accordance with the policy objectives of the spending review and strategic plan commitments to staff cuts, we are streamlining departmental Head-Quarters (HQ) and reducing staff numbers by 30 per cent. in order to focus resources on the front-line. We are committed to similar reductions in the HQ of Corrections and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Reducing our HQ staff numbers by 2,700 full-time equivalents will free up around &pound;100 million in real terms to be spent on the front-line.</p>

	<p pid=".958W.8/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced a new civil preventative order; the sexual offences prevention order (SOPO). A court may make a SOPO against someone with a conviction or caution for a relevant sexual offence (those listed in schedules 3 or 5 to the Act) where it is satisfied that such an order is necessary to protect the public or any particular member of the public from serious sexual harm from the defendant. A SOPO prohibits the offender from doing anything described in the order. This means protecting the public from serious physical or psychological harm caused by the defendant committing one or more of the offences listed in schedule 3.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.8/3">It is possible that a court could make a SOPO that would limit the use of credit or debit cards by the offender, if it was thought that limiting this use would protect the public from serious sexual harm. For example, a SOPO could prohibit an offender from making online purchases. Such a restriction would have to be compatible with a defendant's rights under Article 8 of the Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.8/4">Statistics on the forms of prohibitions contained in SOPOs are not held by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.8/5">In addition, the Home Office has been working closely with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS), who have a clear policy that acquiring banks routinely monitor the transaction activity of their internet merchants, and that they will not knowingly do business with sites that sell content inciting, advocating or perpetuating violence against persons, including scenes of sexual assault. APACS have also been developing a range of work with the Internet Watch Foundation to assist in tracking and identifying illegal sites.</p>

	<p pid=".961W.0/1">Central records are not kept of the number of policies for which environmental screenings are undertaken. However, advice on the need to screen policies for environmental impacts is contained on the Department's policy makers checklist and the ministerial website on the Department's intranet site states that policy submissions should contain a section on environmental considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.0/2">No formal environmental appraisals have been conducted on policy issues, although policy proposals which are likely to have a direct or indirect impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector are required to have a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). RIAs require examination of the potential impacts of relevant policy developments on all stakeholders including environmental impacts.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.0/3">Assessments of environmental impacts are undertaken on building developments as required by planning authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".961W.3/1">The following table shows allocations to each prison establishment to purchase library services. The figures include maintenance of the book stock, exchange of stock within a year and off-site administration of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.3/2">Information on the number of local authority-employed librarians working in prison establishments is not held centrally. A survey conducted in February 2004 found that Public Library Authority (PLA) library managers delivered 2,608 on-site hours per week while PLA library assistants delivered 2,230 per week. This equates to 134 full-time equivalent library staff across the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid=".961W.3/3">The Prison Service is currently working in partnership with the Public Library Authorities to develop a new and wider ranging specification for prison libraries that addresses the learning and skills agenda as well as providing information, advice and guidance. A new framework for resourcing the new service is also being developed.</p>

	<p pid=".964W.2/2">No departmental review of smoking in prison workplaces (where this is permitted) and prisoner smoking is planned. Governors are still operating under Instruction to Governors 16 of 1996, which instructs them where to ban smoking in prisons and gives them discretionary powers to extend this ban to other parts of the prison. Smoking policies are included in the Health and Safety Standard and are audited by the Prison Service Standards Audit Unit.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.2/3">In 2003 the Department of Health and the Prison service published 'AQUITTED: Best practice guidance for developing smoking cessation services in prisons'. Extra funding of &pound;500,000 has been made available for each of the three years up to 2006. The launch of 'AQUITTED' was supported by a programme of training seminars for staff of prisons and their local Primary Care Trusts. The effectiveness of the initiative is being evaluated and a report is expected in 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.2/2">There are well tried and tested emergency plans to deal with a release of radioactive material from Sellafield's nuclear facilities. These plans are maintained under the licence condition arrangements for all such sites and have been reviewed and tested at regular intervals over many years. The off-site emergency plan, prepared by Cumbria county council in consultation with the emergency services and British Nuclear Group, has been published in accordance with the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001. The plan covers procedures, facilities and equipment, and includes evacuation arrangements. REPPIR is monitored and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.2/3">There is an ongoing programme of regular off-site exercises for civil nuclear installations such as Sellafield. These test the local off-site facility for each site, and involve a wide range of local and national agencies. The last such exercise at Sellafield was held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-24">24 September 2003</phrase> and this tested all aspects of Cumbria county council's off-site emergency plan which clearly covers evacuation aspects. The lessons of off-site nuclear exercises are taken forward locally through a standing local Emergency Planning Consultative Committee. Any issues of national relevance are taken forward through the Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group, which is administered and chaired by DTI, and are fed as appropriate into central Government's contingency planning.</p>

Other contributing factors have been related to providing advice to the organisers of the 2002 Football World Cup in Japan and Euro 2004 in Portugal and the creation of new units to support the police reform agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".967W.2/1">There is no specific requirement for police forces to inform parents, schools or an education institute when alcohol is removed from children or pupils under the under-age drinking legislation. A decision to inform parents or an education institute is an operational matter for individual police forces. However, a child who commits an offence and is reported for the offence can be seen in the presence of his or her parent or a responsible adult.</p>
	<p pid=".967W.2/2">Police forces would have their own arrangements for involving Social Services or an education institute if the child might be at risk. The role of the police school liaison officers in schools is a matter for the individual police force and the school.</p>
	<p pid=".967W.2/3">There is a statutory requirement to educate children and young people about the effect of alcohol. All schools are encouraged to have systems in place to identify and support those young people for whom drugs (including alcohol) may be a problem. Where concerns have been raised schools can provide support either through the curriculum, pastoral system or through referral to more specialised agencies, perhaps co-ordinated through the Connexions Service.</p>

	<p pid=".972W.6/2">Of the emergency services, only the police carry out counter-terrorism work. Funding for police counter-terrorism and other national security functions is predominantly funded through mainstream funding mechanisms rather than direct grant. However since 2002&ndash;03 the Home Office has provided additional funding to the Police Service to enable it to respond to the increased threat posed by international terrorism since September 2001. In 2004&ndash;05 this will amount to &pound;84 million. The allocation of this funding to individual forces is determined following full consultation between individual police forces, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.6/3">Funding for counter-terrorism has to be considered within the wider context of funding for national security in the round, which will rise from &pound;980 million in 2001 to over &pound;2.1 billion in 2007, including the doubling of the size of M15.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.6/4">In addition, an extra &pound;20 million per year from 2005&ndash;06 will be allocated to the Civil Defence Grant. This will double to &pound;40 million per year, the contribution the Government previously allocated to local authorities.</p>

Likewise it has not been feasible to obtain comparable figures for periods before April 2001 when the Skills for Life strategy was launched and the LSC was formed, but information shows it was considerably less than at present.</p>

	<p pid=".974W.6/1">The statistics published by the Department do not record the types of special educational need (SEN), such as autism and Asperger's syndrome, which excluded pupils with SEN have. The most recent provisional statistics, for 2002/03, do show that children with SEN, both those with and without statements of SEN, account for two-thirds of permanent exclusions and that children with SEN were nine times more likely to be permanently excluded than those without SEN. As part of the SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, published in February, we are carrying out research into exclusions and children with SEN, including those with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs), and we will act on its findings.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.6/2">Research by the National Autistic Society in 2000 suggested that children with ASDs, including Asperger's syndrome, were far more likely to be excluded than their peers. The Society is represented on our Autism Working Group which produced Good Practice Guidance on ASDs in 2002. This guidance aims to raise awareness of the disorders and to give good practice pointers to schools, local education authorities and others to help develop and audit their autism provision. It is available to assist schools make the reasonable adjustments to their policies and practice with respect to children with ASDs required by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, which they need to consider when meeting their duty not to discriminate against disabled pupils, without justification, by excluding them because of behaviour caused by their disability.</p>
	<p pid=".974W.6/3">Children with autism display a range of strengths and difficulties of differing levels of severity and complexity. Those with SEN statements should be placed in a setting where their profile of needs can be met. The Good Practice Guidance recommends that LEAs, either singly or in regional groupings, should develop a range of provision in mainstream, special and specialist schools so that children with statements can be placed appropriately with the placement being monitored and changed as necessary.</p>

We will link the free early education entitlement for 3 and 4-year-olds more effectively with the hours of child care for which parents pay, to offer integrated education and care for a full day, while extended schools&mdash;both primary and secondary&mdash;will provide, or host, a wide range of services, including child care and a range of family learning and parental support, on-site.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.5/1">The information is not available in the form requested. The available information on the numbers of day nurseries or full day care facilities for St. Helens and the regions are shown in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.5/2">With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection to Ofsted, child care providers are now classified according to whether they are full day care, sessional day care, childminder, out of school day care or cr&egrave;che day care places. Previously, child care providers were classified according to whether they were day nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, childminders, out of school clubs or holiday schemes. Therefore, figures for 2003 are not directly comparable with figures for earlier years because they are collected on a different basis.</p>
	<p pid=".976W.5/3">Statistics on the number of child care facilities registered in England were published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase> in a report by Ofsted &quot;Registered Childcare Providers and Places in England, <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>&quot;.

	<p pid=".981W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills receives many representations on a variety of issues. The academies programme is specifically designed to address the intractable problems of poor standards of teaching and learning, under-achievement and low aspirations in the most socially and economically deprived parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".981W.2/2">It will take time for the new leadership, buildings and curriculum to turn things round. However, of the three academies with GCSE results in 2003 the number of 5A*&ndash;C grades rose to 21 per cent. and 35 per cent. respectively from 7 per cent. and 25 per cent. in 2002, and the other had results broadly comparable with its predecessor schools. Academies are also improving behaviour and attendance.</p>

	<p pid=".983W.2/19">As can be seen from the figures, spend on advertising fluctuates from year to year. Some campaigns will run over financial years and billing will fall in the later period. The increase in Public Relations (PR) relates to an increase in the use of external organisations to contact those elements of our key audiences that prove more difficult to reach through traditional advertising methods. Examples of this are in the promotion of adult basic skills, Aimhigher and Connexions. Since 2001&ndash;02, the Department has changed its approach by concentrating on having fewer, larger, more focused communications, such as that for adult basic skills (to help adults improve their reading, writing, language and maths) instead of numerous smaller campaigns.</p>

	<p pid=".991W.5/4"><i>(b)</i> DfES has established a network of 6,000 UK online centres to help those who have not used computers or the Internet before, or who do not have access to a computer of their own. These centres provide free or low cost access to ICT and the Internet, with support from staff on hand to help individuals get started. One of the target groups is older people. Everyone in England should be able to find a UK online centre near to their home. Around 3,000 are based in libraries and the rest are located to provide easy access for all.</p>

	<p pid=".996W.8/1">In 1997 access to free nursery education was effectively a postcode lottery. We have since invested more than &pound;11 billion as part of an unprecedented expansion of early years provision. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, six months ahead of the original target, we have amended the regulatory framework to require all local authorities to ensure there is sufficient provision to deliver a free part time nursery education place for all three and four-year-olds whose parents want one. Provisional data from the January 2004 Early Years Census, published in May, confirmed that around 93 per cent. of three-year-olds and virtually all four year olds were already benefiting from some free provision. The Department's Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners, presented to Parliament in July (Cm 6272) outlined our plans to transform and build on the basic free entitlement by enabling parents to use it more flexibly as part of a wider integrated offer of education and child care.</p>

The 2002&ndash;03 figure is calculated by taking all the LEA expenditure, excluding CERA and Youth and Community, and dividing it by the FTE pupil numbers in maintained pre-primary, primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

We outlined how we would improve science teaching and learning in schools by providing additional incentives to recruit more people to train to be science teachers, making better use of specialist science support staff and, subject to the advice of the School Teacher Review Body, enabling science Advanced Skills Teachers to be paid more. We also outlined the importance of a science curriculum that inspires young people, with opportunities for exciting science practical work in and outside the classroom.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.3/2">To improve teacher confidence in using fieldwork, we have funded the Field Studies Council in association with the Geographical Association, the Association of Science Education and the Open University to develop a training course for geography and science teachers. Complementary courses on fieldwork will also be offered through the new national network of Science Learning Centres. Our Growing Schools programme supports teachers to educate pupils about food cultivation, farming, and understanding the natural environment, as well as how to use the outdoors for teaching subjects across the curriculum.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.8/1">Individual schools will decide how they introduce planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) time for all teachers from September 2005. That is because schools make changes in their staffing levels every year in response to a range of issues including changing pupil numbers, new school priorities and the resources available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/2">The calculation of the Education Formula Spending Share has a floor and ceiling component which ensures that all authorities see a minimum increase per pupil which is in part funded by having a ceiling which imposes a maximum increase per pupil. In 2004&ndash;05 Nottingham City local education authority received the ceiling increase (6.8 per cent. per pupil and percentages provide for average cost of implementing PPA time).</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/3">I refer also to the written statement I laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-13">13 July 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-07-13.55"><i>Official Report</i>, column 55WS</phrase>, on school funding for 2005&ndash;06. On the same day there was also a press notice issued by the Department (DfES press notice 2004/0137), which included a statement welcoming the school funding settlement by the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group (made up of the majority of the school workforce unions and other partners).</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/4">The written statement to the House sets out how we have considered, with our partner signatories, the costs of implementation of the National Agreement. It announces what funds will be available to schools to implement the Agreement in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/5">At local level, the funding allocation for each local education authority for 2005&ndash;06 will be announced in the provisional local government finance settlement in the autumn. However, every authority will receive an increase in the Schools Formula Spending Share of at least 5.5 per cent. per pupil. Primary and nursery schools will receive a minimum funding increase per pupil of 5 per cent. and secondary schools of 4 per cent. where pupil numbers do not change.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.8/6">We will continue to monitor trends in the schools workforce through the Annual Schools Census each January. There are now 427,800 full-time equivalent teachers&mdash;28,600 more than in 1997 and the highest number since 1981&mdash;and the number of support staff has increased to 241,700, having more than doubled since 1997. These figures illustrate the trend of the significant increases in teachers and support staff since 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".1008W.5/1"><i>(a)</i> The 2003 Skills for Life survey provides the latest estimate of literacy and numeracy levels for England, the North East and the Tyne and Wear Learning and Skills Council area in particular. At present it is not possible to estimate levels of need for the Newcastle-upon-Tyne area although such figures will be available via DfES's website this autumn. The Skills for Life survey maps skill levels to the National Standards for Adult Literacy and Numeracy and is not directly comparable with previous estimates of basic skills need. This means we are unable to look at changes in basic skills levels since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.5/2">The survey highlights that 22 per cent. of North East respondents were classified at Entry Level 3 or below for literacy (below a GCSE grade G). The figure for England as a whole is 16 per cent. If the North East's population is approximately 2.6 million, this would mean that over 500,000 people would have literacy skills at entry level 3 or below. For Tyne and Wear LSC area, 22 per cent. of respondents were at Entry Level 3 or below for literacy.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.5/3">For numeracy, 55 per cent. of North East respondents were classified at Entry Level 3 or below for numeracy. This compares with a figure of 47 per cent. for England as a whole. If the North East's population is 2.6 million, this would mean that approximately 1.4 million people would have entry level 3 or below numeracy skills. 50 per cent. of respondents were at Entry Level 3 or below for Tyne and Wear LSC area.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.5/4">Available data show that between the launch of the Skills for Life strategy in April 2001 and July 2003, Learning and Skills Council funded learners in the North East achieved some 35,000 Skills for Life qualifications, 18,000 within the Tyne and Wear Learning and Skills Council area. These figures are in addition to achievements funded through the Offenders' Learning and Skills Unit and the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>

	<p pid=".1011W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.9/2">Through the Age Positive campaign the Government are combating age discrimination in the workplace. Age Positive is vigorously promoting the business benefits of an age diverse workforce by encouraging employers in both the public and private sector to adopt the voluntary Code of Practice: Age Diversity at Work, A Practical Guide for Business.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.9/3">The Age Positive campaign is promoted to employers and individuals through advertising, the website and press features in national, local and specialist publications. It features existing good practice by employer champions, research, and strongly promotes to employers at exhibitions and workshops. Age Positive awards help to widely publicise the achievements of businesses and individuals who overcome ageism in employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.9/4">Legislation will come into force to outlaw unfair discrimination on the grounds of age in employment and vocational training in 2006. We are currently developing proposals for draft legislation. This will cover both direct and indirect discrimination and will apply to all those in employment or vocational training and not just those aged 50 and over.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.9/5">As the White Paper 'Fairness for All' has outlined, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will provide institutional support for the provisions on age discrimination, working closely with partner organisations and key stakeholders to provide advice and assistance. The CEHR will be able to advise individuals of their rights under the legislation, and provide support for some people to bring their cases before the courts. In addition, the CEHR will have the powers to conduct an investigation into a named party where it has reasonable suspicion that the person is not complying with the statutory requirements of the age legislation. If unlawful discrimination or harassment is found, the CEHR will be able to require the discrimination to stop.</p>

To collate such information from records maintained by partner regional development agencies (who usually lead on coalfields projects) and contractors across the country could only be achieved at a disproportionate cost.</p>

The bulk of activity is through EP's well developed business and projects in the National Coalfields Programme and land reclamation works for sites in the Urban Regenaration Companies' and Millennium Communities' areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1020W.6/1">Occupational segregation has been identified as one of the key causes of the gender pay gap. We know that women are concentrated in just two industrial sectors within low-paid occupations. Men in comparison are spread much more evenly across the labour market in typically higher-paid occupations. They also typically hold more senior positions within the labour market than women.</p>
	<p pid=".1020W.6/2">The Government aims to break down the barriers of occupational segregation as part of a raft of measures to tackle the pay gap. It aims to increase young women's awareness of the importance of education and career choices; address the problems women face getting access to appropriate training or re-skilling and inform employers about their potential in various male-dominated sectors such as information technology, engineering and science.</p>
	<p pid=".1020W.6/3">We have set up Sector Skills Councils and Learning and Skills Councils to address industry specific training needs and to broaden post-16 learning opportunities. These are addressing occupational segregation issues through various research and initiatives. E-skills Sector Skills Council for example launched initiatives in the South East such as 'Go 4 IT' workshops, Computer Clubs for Girls and IT Beat, to challenge girls' perceptions of Information Technology (IT). These target schools and young teen publications after a 2001 MORI poll found girls formed negative images of IT between 11 to 13-years-old.</p>
	<p pid=".1020W.6/4">Other examples of government initiatives include: A new Science Engineering and Technology (SET) resource centre to be set up aimed at working with SET employers; raising the profile of women in SET; funding pilot schemes such as mentoring and networking; and providing help for SET women returners.</p>
	<p pid=".1020W.6/5">The government are also taking an active interest in the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), general formal investigation (GFI) into occupational segregation and the correlation with skills and pay gaps in the UK. The report is due in the autumn and will inform government policy in this area.</p>

From <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, subject to Parliamentary approval, we shall be introducing changes to the way in which employment tribunals deal with the complex equal value cases.

Subject to Parliamentary approval, the legislation is due to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, at the same time as new tribunal procedures for equal value cases. These form part of a wider package of measures to speed up and simplify equal pay cases, such as amendments that were made to the Equal Pay Act in 2003 to introduce the Equal Pay Questionnaire, and make changes to time limits and payment of arrears.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.5/1">The Government continues to lead the way in undertaking equal pay reviews. We believe that the best way to achieve lasting change is through working alongside the business community, employers, trade unions and the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) to drive forward action on equal pay and to promote voluntary pay reviews. We have toughened our equal pay review target to 45 per cent. of large organisations having carried out equal pay reviews by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/2">The EOC published a revised Code of Practice on Equal Pay, which recommends equal pay reviews as the best way of ensuring that a pay system delivers equal pay. By helping employers to check the pay gap in their organisation and by encouraging good equal pay practice, the Code reinforces the Government's commitment to promoting equal pay and closing the gender pay gap.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/3">In addition to pay discrimination, occupational segregation has been identified as another cause of the gender pay gap and the Government is putting in place a range of educational and employment measures to address this. The EOC is conducting an investigation into occupational segregation and we await the results of this with interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/4">The Government has provided funding to the EOC to prepare a model for voluntary pay reviews and have also provided funding to trade unions to train representatives in equal pay issues in the workplace. Over 400 representatives have now been trained and as a result a number of unions and employers are now carrying out joint training on how to do an equal pay review.</p>

	<p pid=".1022W.2/2">The Government have continued to lead the way in undertaking pay reviews. All Government departments and agencies, have now completed pay reviews and submitted action plans. Recent figures from the EOC show that 45 per cent. of large employers had completed an equal pay review, were in the process of completing one or were planning to do so in 2004. Among those that had carried out a pay review or were planning to do one, 41 per cent. said that government policy and publicity had influenced them.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/3">We provided funding to the EOC to prepare a model for voluntary pay reviews, including a separate system for small businesses, and these were produced in 2002 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/4">The Government are also encouraging voluntary pay reviews by funding the TUC's Equal Pay Partnership Project. The project aims include: setting up a panel of recognised experts in the field of equal pay who have the confidence of both employers and unions; encouraging companies and organisations to undertake voluntary equal pay reviews; offering technical support to unions and employers; and building on the TUC Equal Pay project which has trained over 400 union equal pay representatives from government funding of &pound;295,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/5">We are working with the EOC to promote pay reviews in specific sectors. The Government also welcomes the EOC's investigation into modern apprenticeships and the concentration of men and women in different professions. An interim report was published in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/6">As regards legal change, in April 2003 the Equal Pay Act was enhanced with changes to time limits and payment of pay arrears, and amendments so that the statutory questionnaire procedure for discrimination claims can apply to equal pay claims. The EOC produced a revised statutory Code of Practice on equal pay which was laid in Parliament and came into force in December 2003. From October 2004, subject to Parliamentary approval, we shall be introducing changes to the way in which Employment Tribunals deal with complex cases involving the question of whether jobs are of equal value. We also intend to amend the Equal Pay Act to remove the 'no reasonable grounds' defence in section 2A(1)(b) of the Equal Pay At 1970 to limit the circumstances in which a tribunal could refuse to consider an equal value claim.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.3/2">The Department and the Employment Tribunal Service carried out a sample survey of employment tribunal claims&mdash;the Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications 2003.

	<p pid=".1024W.3/3">The survey of employment tribunal applications contains a sample of all discrimination cases in 2002&ndash;03&mdash;race, sex, disability and equal pay claims&mdash;which would be large enough to allow an estimate of the average cost to business of such discrimination claims. This average mean cost has been calculated as &pound;5.813. However, this estimate would not be representative of the cost to business of equal pay claims, since equal pay claims tend to be of longer duration than the average discrimination claim. Nor, on the other hand, would it include the lower costs of the many cases that are settled, for example there were 578 ACAS conciliated settlements of equal pay cases in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

The percentage of employees with children aged under six years who requested a flexible working pattern (and for whom their employer is legally obliged to consider the request) was higher, at 24 per cent. Of all employees who requested flexible working arrangements, 38 per cent. requested to change to a part-time working arrangement; 25 per cent. requested flexi-time; 13 per cent. requested reduced hours for a limited time; 10 per cent. requested to work from home on a regular basis and 8 per cent. requested a compressed working week.</p>
	<p pid=".1025W.3/2">The second Work-Life Balance Study&mdash;employees' survey, carried out during January and February 2003, asked employees whether they worked particular flexible working patterns. If they did not (or had not in the past year), they were then asked whether they would like to. Table 1 shows the percentages of these employees who said they would like to take up particular flexible working practices.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not commissioned any research into fraud in large businesses. But the Department has engaged in a considerable range of activity post Enron as the Secretary of State announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January 2003</phrase> in a speech on strengthening corporate governance.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/2">A number of those measures are now taken forward in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Enterprise) Bill which is currently before Parliament. The Bill amends the current regime for investigating companies. It contains provisions giving investigators a new power to get relevant information from anyone and strengthening their document-gathering powers, while retaining the existing protection for legally privileged material and banking confidentiality. There is also a provision giving investigators the power to require entry to, and remain on, a company's business premises without obtaining a warrant. This will make it easier to require documents and other information and to see the business in operation.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/3">The Bill will also increase the independence of the regulation of the audit profession and give the independent regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, the powers and resources it needs to do its job more effectively. Further the Bill will enable company auditors to carry out their duties more effectively by entitling the auditor to require information and explanations from a wider group of people than at present, in particular from employees.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/4">The Financial Reporting Review Panel will be given a power to require companies to provide it with the information it needs to carry out its investigations. This body currently reviews the annual accounts and reports of public and large private UK companies. The Bill will allow the Government to extend this to reviewing the interim reports of listed companies. The FRRP will also take a more proactive approach to enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/5">I would also like to draw the hon. Member's attention to the proposal by the Home Office to establish the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This body will be part of a comprehensive strategy to target organised criminals. It will exploit hi-tech 21st century technology to uncover the new wave of crime bosses whose lucrative illegal enterprises range from drug trafficking and people smuggling through to fraud and money laundering.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/6">The Government has recently completed a consultation on legislation to reform the law of fraud. The Government proposals for change are based mainly on the Law Commission Report on Fraud published in 2002. The main proposal is for the general offence of fraud which can be committed in three different ways: by false representation, by wrongfully failing to disclose information, or by abuse of office. In each case the behaviour must be dishonest, and must aim at securing a gain for the defendant or a loss for another.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/7">Additionally the Government sought the views of business and other interested parties on the best means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce opportunities for crime against business and to enhance the contribution that business could make to crime reduction in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".1027W.2/1">As stated in Peter Gershon's report on his independent review of public sector efficiency &quot;Releasing Resources to the Front Line&quot;, the Regional Development Agencies have agreed to deliver 2.5 per cent. efficiencies per year in the Spending Review period, at least half of which will be cash-releasing back into the Single Programme budget, which brings together allocations from all the Departments that fund them. DTI as the lead sponsor Department, will work with the Regional Development Agencies to identify further efficiencies where possible. The Regional Development Agencies will be expected to identify efficiencies in delivering on the additional responsibilities that have been devolved to them. These additional responsibilities include the delivery of regional and local Business Link services and the grant for Research and Development. The Regional Development Agencies will report to my Department on how these savings are to be achieved.</p>

	<p pid=".1034W.11/1">The regional centre of the Manufacturing Advisory Service in the North East (MAS-NE) dealt with 1,323 inquiries from manufacturing companies in the period June 2002 to June 2004. Of these, 1,257 inquiries came from companies based in the North East region, 304 were from companies based in the Tees Valley, and seven were from companies in the Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland constituency. 146 companies who contacted MAS-NE in this period have gone on to receive in-depth help. The direct impact of this help on company productivity is measured by the &quot;added value&quot;. The total added value generated as a result of MAS-NE interventions stood at just over &pound;705, 000 at March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1034W.11/2">The names of all companies that have received in-depth assistance from MAS are given in the MAS 2004 Annual Report, which can be found at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a></p>

It also asked NIMR management to submit a proposal. All attended a meeting of the Task Force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-21">21 June</phrase> for discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.2/5">The Task Force has recommended that the renewed institute should be co-located with either King's College London or University College London and was expected to produce a full report to the MRC Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-29">29 July 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1046W.8/1">Regional Supply Offices (RSOs) were designed to provide a means by which small businesses could gain access to the supply chain business of large firms. The market failure was that large firms were often unaware of smaller, potential suppliers in their regions, and for their part small businesses were unable to talk to chief buyers etc because they lacked the status to do so. The role of the RSO Advisers was to go out and learn of the large suppliers' supply chain requirements, and then offer to locate (small business) suppliers for them. In parallel, the RSO Advisers would help the small suppliers to develop their services to meet the customer requirements. Practical examples of these activities included seminars and workshop to highlight the benefits companies could gain from understanding supply chain development programmes, briefing on special topics such as manufacturing issues, subsidised stand space for companies at major trade shows and exhibitions as well as the organisation of business to business events. In April 2001, responsibility for the RSOs was transferred to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in the English regions.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.8/2">The RDAs integrated their RSOs but services of a similar nature continue to be provided in all regions as part of the RDAs' and Partners' range of business support. However, as supply chain support has been mainstreamed in this way, information about costs cannot be easily disaggregated and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1051W.6/2">There is no 'average length of time' taken by CAFCASS officers to draft reports. However, the number of weeks required to draft a private law report ranges from 10&ndash;18 weeks. The length of time may vary from region to region, and also on the scale of officers' workloads and the complexity of individual cases. CAFCASS officers will often seek to agree these times with the courts, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.6/3">In Public Law, the Protocol for Judicial Case Management in Public Law Children Act Cases standard is that cases are to be completed by the courts within 40 weeks, though some of these cases can take a year or more. The drafting of reports in these Public Law cases will be undertaken during part of this period.</p>

	<p pid=".1051W.9/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.9/2">The Government have no plans to give grandparents a legal presumption of contact. The Children Act 1989 makes clear that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in any proceedings relating to the upbringing of a child.. The Government believe that this principle should be sustained, without qualification, in order that there continues to be the clearest possible focus on the needs of children.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.9/3">The Government recognise and value the important role which grandparents can play in children's lives. Many grandparents are already involved with the care of their grandchildren and most children see their grandparents as important figures in their lives. However, the primary responsibility for bringing up children in most families lies with their parents and there may be cases where parents prefer to limit contact with grandparents.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.9/4">Under the Children Act 1989, grandparents may, provided that the permission of the court is obtained, apply to the court for an order granting contact with a grandchild. The requirement for the court's permission is not designed to be an obstacle to grandparents but to act as an initial filter to sift out prejudiced applications that are unlikely to succeed. Experience suggests that grandparents would not usually experience difficulty in obtaining permission where their application is motivated by a genuine concern for the child.</p>
	<p pid=".1051W.9/5">The Government are aware there is considerable concern about how court ordered contact arrangements can be supported more effectively. Our consultation document, &quot;Parental separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&quot;, published in July, outlines how the Government propose better to support families who are going through separation. It details a range of measures, including better information for parents, parenting plans to help parents make good arrangements, in-court conciliation and mediation for those parents who do go to court, active judicial management and stronger powers for judges to enforce court orders.</p>

A Ministerial Committee is to consider the Law Commission's draft programme every two years.

My Department already seeks from other Government Departments six monthly reports on their progress in deciding on published Law Commission recommendations, and when they propose to implement them.

	<p pid=".1055W.5/1">Statutory responsibility for the training of magistrates currently rests with the 42 independent magistrates courts committees (MCCs). In court lay magistrates sit with their justices' clerk or a legal adviser. The justices' clerk has a statutory duty to provide advice to the magistrates on questions of law, practice and procedure. This will include advice on applying any case law and relevant Court of Appeal judgments when making decisions. Cases concerning contact (access) arrangements are therefore considered by magistrates on individual merit and with appropriate advice on law and procedure. In each case the child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".1055W.5/2">The Children Act 1989 introduced the legal framework for contact (access) arrangements for children in cases of family breakdown. A grandparent is entitled to apply to the court under s.10 of the Act for permission to make an application for contact.</p>
	<p pid=".1055W.5/3">Only magistrates who sit on the Family Panel can hear cases that involve contact arrangements. The recently updated Magistrates' National Training Initiative (MNTI 2) sets out (and confirms the current practice) that magistrates should only be invited to sit on the Family Panel after successfully demonstrating the competencies required to sit in the adult court. Magistrates have been using a competence framework since 1998 for appraisal and training. Under MNTI 2 there are new competence frameworks for both the adult and family courts. These competence frameworks set out the knowledge, understanding, and skills magistrates need to demonstrate to perform their role.</p>
	<p pid=".1055W.5/4">Applications for contact arrangements can also be heard in family proceedings in the county court.</p>

	<p pid=".1062W.0/21">The figures relate to both the FCO's offices in London and Hanslope Park. Hanslope Park, since 1996&ndash;07, has developed into an important operational site to the Department and leads on major Projects such as Firecrest, the FCO Telecommunications Network and PRISM; hence the number of visitors has increased. The site is not supported by public transport links and use of taxi's to/from Central Milton Keynes (London main line) station has been the only method of reaching the site for train users. We have recognised the increased use of taxis at Hanslope Park and introduced an 'in-house' minibus service at peak times of the morning/afternoon to cut costs. In addition, we are actively managing the taxi contracts to ensure value for money. We have also encouraged taxi-sharing where possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1063W.2/1">For normal departmental use the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not use pre-printed headed notepaper. FCO staff use electronic templates to print out the FCO letterhead. There are, however, some departments/posts which require the use of pre-printed headed paper.</p>
	<p pid=".1063W.2/2">Data from the financial year 1996&ndash;97 are not available, although headed paper produced by FCO Services Crystal Print cost &pound;7.70 for 500 sheets in 1996&ndash;97. This does not include embossed letterheads which would have been sourced through an external supplier; financial data for this is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".1063W.2/3">The cost of obtaining 500 sheets of pre-printed letterheads from FCO Services Crystal Print is &pound;49.00, &pound;6.50 for each extra 500 thereafter. In 1996&ndash;97 the letterheads were charged at cost (ink and paper) as the artwork was supplied by a separate department, and pricing for the internal market had not been introduced fully. Now that the artwork is produced in house a charge for the set up fee of the artwork is included in the initial cost, hence the reduction in price for multiples of 500. This current price also includes full economic cost. For the latest period June 2003&mdash;June 2004, FCO Services Crystal Print took orders for about 133,000 sheets of letterheads, including continuation sheets, for both home and overseas departments. The total cost was approximately &pound;5,200. This type of letterhead is produced in house, from layout to print. For the period June 2003 to July 2004 FCO Services Crystal Print ordered embossed letterheads to the value of &pound;6,586 from external suppliers.</p>

	<p pid=".1067W.2/2">Following close liaison with the British embassy in Caracas and key operational partners in the field, DFID initially provided 500,000 to Venezuela following the floods in December 1999. This was used to support the World Health Organisation (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Red Cross. The funds went towards providing emergency assistance for those affected and initiating long-term rehabilitation for up to 10,000 families.</p>
	<p pid=".1067W.2/3">The right hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, Mr George Foulkes, the then DFID Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, later held detailed discussions with the Venezuelan ambassador about DFID's role in providing assistance to the people of Venezuela. DFID also deployed experts to liaise with Venezuelan authorities and humanitarian organisations to identify priority needs. We then provided a further &pound;300,000 in January 2000 to WHO (to expand their programme), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (to fund two disaster management specialists) and the Red Cross (to ensure continuity of relief assistance towards the full-scale recovery process).</p>

	<p pid=".1069W.8/1">Government does not specify the content of the general practitioner training curriculum. This is the job of the joint committee on postgraduate training for general practice (JCPTGP), which is the competent authority for general practice training in the United Kingdom. The JCPTGP is an independent body and it is required by section 9(3) of the Vocational Training Regulations 1997 to determine and publish the curriculum to be followed by a GP registrar (a trainee GP).</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/2">The Regulations do specify seven competencies which must be tested, and which the curriculum must therefore teach:</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/3" class="indent">factual medical knowledge sufficient to enable the doctor to perform the duties of a GP;</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/4" class="indent">the ability to apply factual medical knowledge to the management of problems presented by patients in general practice;</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/5" class="indent">effective communication, both orally and in writing; the ability to consult satisfactorily with general practice patients;</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/6" class="indent">the ability to review and critically analyse the practitioner's own working practices and to manage any necessary changes appropriately;</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/7" class="indent">clinical skills;</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/8" class="indent">the ability to synthesise all of the above competencies and apply them appropriately in a general practice setting.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/9">It is, therefore, the responsibility of the JCPTGP to assess the impact of the revised National Institute for Clinical Excellence referral guidelines for suspected cancer and adapt postgraduate general practitioner training accordingly.</p>

The public service agreement published as part of the spending review and the departmental publication, &quot;Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Guidance 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08&quot;, set the priorities for investment during the next planning period. In support of these objectives, we plan to allocate the majority of NHS funding directly to primary care trusts and so maximise local flexibility in meeting these priorities.</p>

In addition, the NHS is contracting with the independent sector for the provision of surgical procedures rather than new physical capacity. In total, we expect there to be around 80 treatment centres open by the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1078W.9/4">Guidance on maintaining patient privacy and dignity issued to the service in 1997 advises that patients admitted under emergency procedures should be transferred into appropriate single-sex accommodation at the earliest possible opportunity; but at least within 48 hours. Where the use of mixed-sex accommodation is unavoidable, hospitals should have in place clear operational policies that minimise the impact of this situation until the patient can be moved to accommodation that is more appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".1080W.2/2">The Government is committed to improving standards of health and social care and people with Alzheimer's disease will benefit from the new investment that is being made available to support this commitment. For the NHS, there is an annual average funding increase of 7.5 per cent. above inflation over the five years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08. This is now the largest ever sustained increase in NHS funding. There have also been substantial increases in the level of funding provided for social services in recent years. Social services resources will increase by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real terms from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. These significant funding increases will help provide new and better health and social care services for people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>

	<p pid=".1082W.8/1">Central Government Departments are required to produce pay and workforce strategies in respect of the public services workforces that they cover. The social care workforce is covered predominantly by three Departments; the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".1082W.8/2">The social care workforce conference was organised by the Department of Health to bring together stakeholders in the development of the social care workforce to share knowledge and to reflect on and inform the revision of the Department's national social care workforce strategy in relation to recruitment, development and rewards.</p>
	<p pid=".1082W.8/3">Over the past year, most parts of the national infrastructure that are accountable for the social care workforce have experienced significant change. In the Department of Health, a major reorganisation has created a new workforce directorate that has joined health and social care workforce development functions into new teams. Children's social care policy has moved to a new children and families directorate in the DfES and new people are engaged in taking forward the proposals in the Green Paper, Every child matters. Key regulatory institutions, the National Care Standards Commission and the Social Services Inspectorate, have merged into the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). The proposed introduction of a sector skills council is also having an impact on the social care employers infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".1082W.8/4">The conference had the dual purpose of providing an early opportunity for the many new people to meet and share perspectives, and then to consider with the Government Ministers with central responsibilities how future strategy should be shaped and partnership managed.</p>
	<p pid=".1082W.8/5">Invitations were sent to the following people:</p>

Each trust will have an infection control policy which should comply with current best practice and have access to local advice. Healthcare organisations including ambulance trusts should have systems in place to minimise the risk to patients from healthcare associated infections. Health Service Circular 2000/002 required all NHS trusts, including ambulance trusts to take action to strengthen prevention and control of infection, to secure appropriate health care services for patients with infection and improve surveillance of infection.

	<p pid=".1095W.0/1">Since 2000, assessments of hospital cleanliness have been undertaken by patient environment action teams (PEATs). Following these assessments hospitals are allocated a rating on a 'traffic-light' scale&mdash;Red equals poor, Amber equals acceptable and Green equals good. Since August 2001, PEATs have confirmed that there are no hospitals where overall standards are less than acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".1095W.0/2">However, following the PEAT assessments in 2002, some hospitals were identified where, although overall acceptable levels had been achieved, it was felt that there were grounds for additional support to be provided to ensure that standards were maintained and any shortfalls identified remedied. This was also the case in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1095W.0/3">In 2002, 51 hospitals were identified where such support was been deemed appropriate and in 2003 this number was 111. The PEAT rating for all of these hospitals was 'Amber'.</p>
	<p pid=".1095W.0/4">The star rating process is applied to the aggregate performance of a trust, whereas the PEAT rating is applied to each hospital within a trust and it is therefore possible that a trust with an overall good star rating may have an individual site where cleanliness standards are a cause for concern.</p>

	<p pid=".1101W.5/1">There are no plans to introduce additional targets specifically to reduce the number of winter deaths. The Government are committed to decreasing the number of national targets imposed on the national health service and allowing more locally agreed targets. The document, &quot;National Standards, Local action: Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Framework 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, has already set out the national targets for the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".1101W.5/2">However, there is an existing target to tackle influenza, one of the biggest seasonal killers. A target for influenza vaccination in those aged 65 and over has been set since 2000&ndash;01. In 2003&ndash;04, the target was that nationally over 70 per cent. of that age group would be vaccinated, and thanks to last year's successful 'flu immunisation campaign, this was exceeded, with 71 per cent. of those aged 65 or over being vaccinated. The 70 per cent. take-up target remains this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1101W.5/3">In addition to the 'flu target, the Government have several other initiatives to reduce avoidable winter deaths. These include the &quot;Keep Warm, Keep Wel1&quot; campaign, which offers people advice on staying warm and keeping well in winter and winter fuel payments for older people, which help to keep warm those most susceptible to the cold weather.</p>

	<p pid=".1105W.5/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) carried out a survey of compliance with ELCI in the autumn of 2003. That survey included small, medium and large firms across all sectors in England, Scotland and Wales and concluded that ELCI compliance was high&mdash;nearly 99.5 per cent. of those employers surveyed were ELCI compliant.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.5/3">The provision of ELCI does not, of itself, impact on the health and safety of workers. ELCI merely ensures that there is some money available to compensate a person who successfully claims against their employer in the event of an injury or ill health arising out of their employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.5/4">The survey found that the most commonly sited response to the increased cost of ELCI has been to &quot;try and improve health and safety performance&quot; (50 per cent. of respondents). In the context of our work to promote a risk-based approach to the setting of ELCI premiums, better Health and Safety performance will enable insurers to better reflect good Health and Safety practices in the terms they can offer.</p>

	<p pid=".1115W.6/1">Many voluntary and community groups and small businesses, where they are employers or provide services to the public, are already under a duty to meet certain requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995. For example, they are already required not to discriminate unjustifiably against, and to make reasonable adjustments for, disabled people in recruitment, employment or in the way that they deliver services to disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".1115W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>, the employment provisions of the DDA are being extended to employers with fewer than 15 employees. At the same time, service providers will be under additional duties to tackle physical features of their premises which otherwise make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to access the service, or to provide the service by another reasonable means.</p>
	<p pid=".1115W.6/3">The Government, and the Disability Rights Commission, have undertaken wide-ranging publicity campaigns over the last two years to raise awareness of the new duties in order to give employers and service providers the opportunity to understand, and plan for, their implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".1115W.6/4">There is no specific funding available to help <i>(a)</i> voluntary and community groups and <i>(b)</i> small businesses, or indeed any business or organisation with duties under the DDA, to meet the requirements of the Act. This is because employers and service providers are only required to do what is reasonable, and factors such as the cost and practicability of making reasonable adjustments, and the financial and other resources available to the business or organisation, will be taken into account in determining what is reasonable.</p>
	<p pid=".1115W.6/5">In certain instances, an employer who employs a disabled person may be able to obtain assistance to make adjustments for the disabled employee from the Access to Work programme. Employers can obtain further information about the programme by contacting their nearest Access to Work Business Centre.</p>

	<p pid=".1120W.5/1">We recognise that pension saving is far more affordable when done over a long period and the key is for young people to start taking action early in life as they become financially independent and enter the workplace for the first time.</p>
	<p pid=".1120W.5/2">Through our Informed Choice <sup>1</sup> programme we are encouraging all people, including young people, to plan ahead. We are doing this by making them aware of their options and ensuring they have the right information at the right time, together with the basic financial awareness and skills, to help them make appropriate choices. The range of initiatives include measures to: maximise workplace pensions savings, provide personalised information about an individual's forecasted state and occupational/private pension positions, working with employers to provide information and advice in the workplace, and introducing a new web-based retirement planner.</p>
	<p pid=".1120W.5/3">Furthermore, the national Financial Capability Strategy, led by the Financial Services Authority and set out in two recent FSA documents <sup>2</sup> , is working to address the financial capability needs, including those related to saving for retirement, for all groups, including young people.</p>
	<p pid=".1120W.5/4">We already provide incentives to encourage long-term savings by giving more generous tax treatment on pensions than on other forms of investment. Pensions are one of the most efficient ways of saving for all age groups. To encourage and reassure individuals who save in occupational pensions that their pension is secure, the Pension Protection Fund, will, for the first time in the UK, serve to protect members of defined benefit schemes if their sponsoring employer becomes insolvent and the scheme is under-funded.</p>
	<p pid=".1120W.5/5">We are also introducing other measures to encourage the savings habit. For example, in June, we announced our proposals for the stakeholder suite of simple, low-cost, risk-controlled savings and investment products to meet the needs of all, including the young, for their short, medium and long-term needs. Measures such as the Savings Gateway, the Universal Banking Services, the Community Finance and Learning Initiative and the introduction of the Child Trust Fund, also serve to encourage young people to engage with the financial sector.</p>

	<p pid=".1121W.2/1">The Families and Children Study (FACS) collects data from a sample of British families with dependent children on an annual basis. The questionnaire covers topics such as demographics, health, child outcomes, work, family income, material well-being and child support, among others.</p>
	<p pid=".1121W.2/2">FACS also continues to collect data on the marital status of the study's members. However, for reasons of limited space, the most recent FACS annual report did not include a separate analysis of marital status. Instead, the focus was on lone parent/couple status, a key determinant of benefit entitlement. It is anticipated that future reports based on FACS data will provide analyses by marital status.</p>

	<p pid=".1126W.14/1">The Secretary of State announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-20">20 July 2004</phrase> that he intended that appropriate powers for the construction of Crossrail should be sought by means of a hybrid Bill to be introduced in Parliament at the earliest opportunity.

	<p pid=".1127W.14/1">The 10 Year Plan for transport marked the beginning of a more strategic approach to delivering transport improvements. It delivered a long term Government commitment to sustained increases in transport spending.</p>
	<p pid=".1127W.14/2">Much of this investment will benefit freight alongside other transport users. The plan is delivering new capacity on the road network, with 80 schemes at various stages in the Targeted Programme of Improvements totalling around &pound;8.8 billion. 13 of these schemes are currently under construction, including widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15 around Heathrow. We have also invested in the Rail Network, renewing 800 miles of track last year. And we have increased total Government capital support for local authorities from &pound;650 million in 2001 to &pound;1.9 billion in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".1127W.14/3">In relation to specific references to Freight in the 10 Year Plan, there has been a significant increase in freight on rail over recent years. The possibility of dedicated HGV only lanes on our strategic routes has been under consideration, but suitable sites have yet to be identified, though a number of schemes have been introduced .which afford goods vehicles priority, along with buses and cyclists, over general traffic in congested urban areas. Finally, we have made significant progress in implementing road haulage efficiency measures as outlined in the 10 Year Plan, particularly through the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. In particular we have been funding projects to offer training in safer and more fuel efficient driving, and to promote operational practices that save on the use of fuel.</p>
	<p pid=".1127W.14/4">&quot;The future of Transport&quot;, published in July this year builds on the 10 Year Plan and looks forward to the factors that might shape travel demand and our transport network over the next 30 years. It sets out how the Government will respond to those pressures while safeguarding our economic and social wellbeing and the environment. Our policies for freight transport are set out in that document.</p>

	<p pid=".1132W.0/1">The Government are on track to deliver 32 new bypasses on the strategic road network by the end of 2010&ndash;11. The following table gives the relevant detail on these bypasses which have either been completed, or are contained within the current Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI).</p>
	<p pid=".1132W.0/2">Firm decisions have yet to be made on start of works for the remainder of the current programme so no forecast dates of opening are possible but the latest estimated outturn costs and status report for these schemes has been provided.</p>
	<p pid=".1132W.0/3">On local roads it is too soon to say whether the quoted number of local road schemes will be delivered. This depends largely on how quickly local authorities bring their schemes to completion. 79 road schemes have been fully or provisionally approved by the Government since 2000; these schemes are now at various stages of delivery. A local authority's progress in delivering a local road scheme is a matter for the local authority concerned. The Government are considering a number of other road scheme proposals from local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".1136W.5/1">Delayed discharges have some impact on waiting lists at Antrim, Whiteabbey and other hospitals, although the scale of this is difficult to quantify.

This work, coupled with planned increases in capacity, such as the 24-bed ward at Antrim hospital due to open in 2005, will reduce the need for medical patients to be cared for in surgical wards.</p>

	<p pid=".1138W.5/1">There are no measures available which are foolproof and which would ensure traceability of a stolen boat. However, there are other factors which may enable the Board to trace the vessel. The Board has registered the vessel with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Accordingly, if it was stolen and recovered it could be traced back to the Board. The Board is also looking at whether there are cost effective measures, which might make traceability easier. Furthermore, appropriate equipment on board the vessel carry serial numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1138W.5/2">The Board has taken measures to try to protect the boat from theft. The vessel is moored in a prominent berth in Ballycastle Marina. The Marina is staffed from 8.00 am to midnight during the summer and from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm in winter. There are also three CCTVs covering the Marina for security purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".1142W.3/2">The average processing target time operated by the legacy organisations IDE and LEDU, was 83 days. Invest NI has set target times which are shorter than those operated by these legacy bodies. It would require a disproportionate administrative effort to attempt to provide precise information on the legacy agencies' performance. However, it is clear that in the majority of cases the target timeframes were met and where this was not the case it again tended to reflect the complexity of the case concerned.</p>

This has been assessed using established methodologies taking into account population growth and anticipated housing and commercial development. This projection does not take into account the recent proposal to develop the Herdman's Mills site in Sion Mills. This could have an impact on the required capacity of the new Works but the implications cannot be assessed at this stage. However, as the design of the Works is still at an early stage, it should be possible to allow for the impact of the proposals for the Herdman's Mills site at a later stage in the design.</p>

	<p pid=".1151W.5/3">The Titanic brand could have substantial tourist potential, especially on the centenary in 2012 and the years immediately after. Conservatively, MAGNI (National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland) estimate that visitor numbers to a new museum attraction and to Belfast could be in the region of 300,000 per annum. Such is the interest in the Titanic and the city in which she was built, that it is considered that visitors will be attracted from all over the world.</p>

It should be noted, however, that changes in simple average prices from one period to the next may reflect both actual price change and change in the mix of properties sold in the respective periods.</p>

	<p pid=".1165W.2/1">The policy statement accompanying the draft Regional Assemblies Bill published in July 2004 confirmed that where voters choose to have an Elected Regional Assembly there will be a Regional Fire and Rescue Service. A referendum will take place in the North East on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-04">4 November</phrase>.

However, the period initially specified may have had the effect of making it impractical to run a tender exercise. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will therefore shortly be issuing guidance setting out revised milestones which will enable authorities to enter into more viable arrangements and create a natural progression to the proposed national arrangements. Where an Authority requires further clarification of whether a proposed contract will conflict with the National Procurement Strategy, they should not hesitate to contact the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, as two authorities have already done.</p>

	<p pid=".1167W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister currently has four externally commissioned research projects on different aspects of homelessness, which include consideration of homeless families.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.6/2">1. A nationally representative survey of homeless families will collect data on the characteristics of homeless families and on the reasons for their homelessness. It will also assess the impact of homelessness and living in different types of temporary accommodation on the health and education of children, and collect information on the additional costs faced by families as a result of their homelessness. Findings from the survey will help to inform future policy on homelessness and the use of temporary accommodation. Planning for this major survey has been informed by a successful feasibility study, which reported this summer. This study will complement quarterly statistical data collected on households accepted as statutory homeless by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.6/3">2. Research about the causes of homelessness among black and minority ethnic communities. People from BME groups are disproportionately represented in statutory homelessness statistics. A development guide to assist local authorities and other agencies to address the needs of homeless black and minority ethnic households is expected to be published by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.6/4">3. A study to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of homelessness prevention initiatives, including family mediation services, help for victims of domestic violence to remain safely in their own homes, and homelessness advice services. This research has recently been commissioned, and will produce good practice guidance for local authorities and service providers, to be published early in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1167W.6/5">4. A survey of households receiving Supporting People legacy funded services. This survey was commissioned to measure satisfaction with housing related support services provided by the Supporting People programme. The survey included interviews with 351 families receiving Supporting People funded services for homeless families. The survey reported on their support needs, the help and services that they receive, and on the problems they had experienced. It is due to be published in the autumn of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1172W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, I announced to the House that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not intend to use 2001 Census data for the 2005&ndash;06 Local Government Finance Settlement, <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-07-21.30"><i>Official Report,</i> column 30WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1172W.6/2">This announcement followed work carried out by officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government experts during the last year to remodel Formula Spending Shares (FSSs) using the 2001 Census data. Incorporating the new Census data in the funding formula is not a simple task. It is technically incorrect to update the Census data in the police formula; and in other areas the changes needed to incorporate the 2001 Census data would break the current formula freeze, and could cause large changes to the distribution of FSSs. I should also add that, for the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services and the Highways Maintenance formulae, we still do not have all the 2001 Census data we need.</p>
	<p pid=".1172W.6/3">In the Government's December 2001 White Paper 'Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services' (CM5237), it was announced that there would be a freeze on formula changes for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 in order to ensure a period of stability for councils. In deciding not to use 2001 Census data in the 2005&ndash;06 FSS calculations, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister balanced this aim of providing stability in local authority funding against our desire to use the most up-to-date data in the funding formulae calculations.</p>

	<p pid=".1176W.5/1">The rules for the North East referendum were approved by Parliament in July. The administration of the North East referendum is for the Chief Counting Officer, Ged Fitzgerald, Chief Executive of Sunderland city council and for the local counting officers.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/2">The Electoral Commission published their report into the June electoral pilots on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-27">27 August</phrase> and has said:</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;The Commission has therefore considered carefully, in the light of our conclusions in relation to postal voting more generally, whether it is appropriate for the referendum in the North East to continue as planned . . . ..our conclusion is that the referendum should proceed as an all-postal ballot without major changes to the process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/4">In reaching this conclusion the Electoral Commission highlighted the desirability of avoiding late changes in a process already approved by Parliament, and a number of additional factors specific to the North East referendum, as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/5" class="indent">The form of all postal-voting defined in law for the regional referendum is a significant improvement over that piloted in June, in part as a result of changes advocated by the Commission earlier in the year. For example there is no requirement for a witness to sign the security statement and more assistance and delivery points are provided for and discretion given to counting officers to provide additional points as they see fit.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/6" class="indent">There is presently no evidence on which to conclude that an all-postal referendum in the North East would be unsafe in terms of fraud or malpractice. To the Commission's knowledge, no allegations of electoral fraud made in the North East in relation to the June all-postal pilot scheme have led to formal prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/7">Voters and election professionals in the North East have substantial previous experience of all-postal ballots.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/8" class="indent">The public is more positive about all-postal voting, and its future use, in the North East than in any other pilot region; and</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/9" class="indent">The capacity of commercial printers and the Royal Mail to manage an all-postal ballot of the scale required in the North East (with approximately 1.9 million electors) was evidenced in June and their capacity will be further enhanced by the lack of competing pressures from other all-postal ballots taking place simultaneously. Additionally, planning between printers, local authorities and other key suppliers is already well under way.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.5/10">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering the Electoral Commission's report and will make a statement to Parliament about the implications for the regional referendums soon.</p>

	<p pid=".1177W.5/1">The Housing Bill, currently before Parliament, contains a provision that would allow the Housing Corporation to pay grants to bodies other than Registered Social Landlords (RSLs). Such grants would be essentially for the same housing purposes as the Corporation's grants to RSLs. This could include the provision of shared equity schemes such as Homebuy.</p>

	<p pid=".1180W.2/1">There is no rule. It is up to each RPB (Regional Planning Body) to decide how best to take sub-regional matters forward and to define the sub-regions in the draft RSS (Regional Spatial Strategies) revision. What might be an effective sub-regional approach in one region may not necessarily suit the circumstances and geography of another.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.2/2">The definition of need for a sub-regional approach should be based on an assessment of the functional relationship between settlements, such as journey-to-work patterns, or land uses within the area affected by the same strategic planning issue or issues which may well differ from administrative boundaries. This could include consideration, for example, of how the strategic planning system can assist not only in creating and sustaining the economic competitiveness of a city or a cluster of towns but in spreading the benefits of a prosperous city to the wider region (the concept of a 'city-region').</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.2/3">The sub-regional definition should be based on a clearly recognisable 'strategic policy deficit' which cannot be adequately addressed by general RSS policies or by LDDs (Local Development Documents) on their own. In some parts of a region, LDDs may be capable of being prepared within the context of the generic policies of a RSS. In some cases this may need to be on a joint LDD basis and the RPB may need to encourage the relevant LPAs (Local Planning Authorities) to produce a joint LDD in order that the RSS can be effectively implemented. However, in many cases there will be sub-regional strategies issues which cannot be tackled through a joint plan or where the LDDs require a more detailed strategic policy context which cannot be provided by generic policies in a RSS. Therefore, it will be common to have sub-regional policies as part of the RSS revision.</p>
	<p pid=".1180W.2/4">Where the RPB decides that it is appropriate to have RSS policies which are specific to a particular part or parts of the region, section 5(5) of the Act requires a section 4 (4) authority or authorities to be first to make detailed proposals, unless it is agreed that the RPB itself or a district council should do so instead. Providing these section 4(4) authorities agree, there is no reason why an RPB should not continue to take the lead, as it has in the past, in preparing detailed proposals on a partnership basis with these authorities and others.</p>

This will seek to preserve the best elements of the regimental system while adapting to ensure operational success for the future.

Details of the new organisation will be worked through by the Army and announced by the end of the year.</p>

At home, the Royal Navy act in support of HM Customs and Excise under the terms of &quot;Military Aid to the Civil Power&quot;. In the Caribbean, the RN deployment (Atlantic Patrol Task (North), primarily promotes UK interests in the region and provides security to UK Overseas Territories. It is also tasked to carry out counter-drugs activities as part of its deployment and provides a tangible presence as one element of the UK's broader counter drugs activities in the region. In addition. Royal Navy units East of Suez may also be involved in efforts to reduce narcotics trafficking.</p>

	<p pid=".1187W.5/1">Formal relations between NATO and Russia are conducted through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC). The Council facilitates engagement between the twenty-six member-stales of NATO and Russia on a number of key issues. It provides a forum where concerns can be aired and practical solutions to problems can be identified. There is an increasing broadening of political dialogue in the NRC to cover key security issues including Afghanistan, the Balkans and counter-terrorism. Our aim is for Russia to be a long-term strategic partner of NATO. Wider European security can only benefit as a result</p>
	<p pid=".1187W.5/2">As many countries of Eastern Europe are now members of NATO, their security&mdash;like that of other allies&mdash;is part of the normal business of the Alliance. NATO has encouraged Russia to make progress in negotiating with-Georgia and Moldova over her presence in the region; this was reflected in the communiqu&eacute; following the Istanbul Summit (28&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-06-29">29 June 2004</phrase>). NATO and Russia are working together on a range of security issues including: counter-proliferation; theatre missile defence; arms control and counter-narcotics. They are also conducting work towards joint operations such as Operation Active Endeavour (NATO's counter-terrorist naval mission in the Mediterranean).</p>

These changes, in conjunction with the achievement of planned organisational efficiencies, will lead to a reduced RAF manpower requirement of around 41,000 by 2008, from a current strength of around 48,500.</p>
	<p pid=".1188W.6/3">In addition to the reductions in service manpower, we envisage reductions of around 10,000 civilian jobs across Defence. These will flow from efficiencies as a consequence of the Department's change programme and other initiatives, as well as changes to the force structure.</p>

Departments' decisions will be based on their own business needs and priorities, taking account of the requirement to improve public services, secure greater efficiencies and value for money for the taxpayer as well as of local economic conditions. Departments will also take into account forthcoming locational guidance that will be issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".1192W.3/1">The Government are making steady progress towards the PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low-income households by 2004&ndash;05, as a contribution to the longer-term goals of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. By 2002&ndash;03 there were around half a million fewer children in relative low-income households compared to 1998&ndash;99. The 2004 Spending Review announced a new child poverty PSA target, shared by the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Treasury, to halve the number of children in relative low-income households between 1998&ndash;99 and 2010&ndash;11, on the way to eradicating child poverty by 2020. The Government will also set an additional target in the 2006 Spending Review to halve by 2010&ndash;11 the number of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and low income. The child poverty review, published alongside the 2004 Spending Review, sets out a range of key measures to reduce child poverty and improve poor children's life chances, thus breaking cycles of deprivation.</p>

	<p pid=".1193W.2/1">In line with Sir Michael Lyons' recommendations contained in his report published in March this year and endorsed in the 2004 Spending Review, it will be for Departments and public bodies themselves to determine the destination of relocated activities from London and the South East. Departments' decisions will be based on their own business needs and priorities, taking account of the requirement to improve public services, secure greater efficiencies and value for money for the taxpayer as well as of local economic conditions. Departments will also take into account forthcoming locational guidance that will be issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.2/2">In the course of the Lyons and 2004 Spending Reviews, some Departments, including the Chancellor's Departments and the Department for Work and Pensions, have identified the South West as a possible destination for public sector activity. As you know, the South West has already benefited recently following the significant relocation of the Meteorological Office from the South East to Exeter.</p>

	<p pid=".1194W.8/1">The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. It is providing over $70 billion of debt relief, to the 27 countries that have reached decision point. It is helping increase annual social expenditures in countries receiving debt relief. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&mdash;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. of the use of HIPC debt relief.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.8/2">But there are countries that are forecast to exit the initiative with debt-to- export ratios above the HIPC target of 150 per cent. because of factors beyond their control. The UK continues to push for additional relief to be granted to all these countries at completion point ('topping up' relief). We successfully campaigned for Niger and Ethiopia to receive such additional relief, resulting in over $800 million in additional relief for two of the world's poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.8/3">At the recent G8 Summit at Sea Island, the UK successfully pushed for Heads of Government to reaffirm their commitment to the provision of topping up relief for eligible countries at completion point. The UK also continues to lobby for a change in the topping up methodology to maximise the quantum of topping up relief.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.8/4">The UK also believes that more must be done beyond the HIPC Initiative to ensure debt sustainability in the world's poorest countries. We are proposing that the international community review further debt relief for the poorest countries, including making better use of IMF gold using a revaluation or off-market transactions, so that, to match bilateral debt relief, which we provide at up to 100 per cent., we can begin to consider how we provide multilateral debt relief of up to 100 per cent. as well.</p>
	<p pid=".1194W.8/5">However, all low-income countries will need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is why the UK has called for an examination of possible financing mechanisms to provide up to 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief for HIPCs, and continues to push the International Finance Facility (IFF), which could provide the much- needed substantial increase in aid&mdash;in the form of grants, concessional loans, or further debt relief&mdash;needed to attain the MDGs without threatening the long-term debt sustainability of the world's poorest countries.</p>

	<p pid=".1196W.5/1">The Government are working closely with the voluntary sector, the financial services industry and others to develop and implement a national strategy for raising levels of financial capability, under the leadership of the Financial Services Authority. This strategy has identified a number of priority areas, based around key life events, from prospective parents to those who are planning for retirement. The Government already provide incentives to encourage long-term savings by giving generous tax treatment on pensions and is also working with industry to set up a suite of simpler savings products. In June this year the Government announced their proposals for the stakeholder suite of savings and investment products to be launched into the marketplace in April 2005. These are a suite of simple, low-cost, risk-controlled products to meet the short, medium and long-term savings needs for all consumers.</p>

	<p pid=".1200W.6/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions about long-term unemployment. (186945, 186930)</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.6/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number of men and women aged 50 and over in long-term unemployment. Table 2 shows the rate of long-term unemployment as a percentage of all unemployment in this age group. Both tables relate to the three month periods ending in May of each year from 1997 to 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.6/5" class="indent">Estimates are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to sampling variability. In particular, estimates for UK regions are based on small sample sizes and are subject to a high degree of sampling variability. They should be treated with caution.</p>

	<p pid=".1203W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-12">12 March 2004</phrase> David Miles published his review of the UK mortgage market. His remit was to undertake analysis of supply and demand side factors limiting the development of the longer-term fixed-rate mortgage market in the UK, and to examine whether there has been any market failure that has held back the market for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. In Budget 2004 the Chancellor endorsed the conclusion in David Miles review of the UK mortgage market that &quot;urgent reform is desirable to make the market work better for consumers in a number of areas&quot;. The Treasury has been discussing the recommendations with a range of stakeholders including the Financial Services Authority, and intends to provide a detailed update in the Pre-Budget Report.</p>

	<p pid=".1208W.2/2">There has been no official review of PFI insurance costs by HM Treasury. However, guidance on the treatment of insurance costs is contained in the HMT Standardisation of Contracts Version 3 (SOPC3) and OGC Business and Operational Guidance &quot;PFI Contracts: Insurance Costs&quot;. SOPC3 states that the risk of increases in insurance costs should be borne by the contractor, while recognising that it will not represent best value for money if bidders price in worst case scenarios for future insurance premium levels in to their bids. The OGC guidance therefore sets out a mechanism for sharing insurance cost increases should there be exceptional circumstances in the international insurance market.</p>

These figures are 1996-based and are the latest basis on which long-term subnational population projections are currently available. These projections have a 25 year &quot;horizon&quot; and so only figures to 2020 are available at this geographical level.</p>

	<p pid=".1208W.5/6" class="indent">The figures shown in the table for England are not the latest 2002-based projections produced by GAD but are 1996-based to be consistent with the subnational projections shown. Please note that these include a lower assumption for international migration than the latest set which can be found at: <a href="http://www.gad.gov.uk/Population/index.asp">http://www.gad.gov.uk/Population/index.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".1208W.5/7" class="indent">A note considering the overall impact of assumed net migration on future population growth is available from the Government Actuary's Department website at: <a href="http://www.gad.gov.uk/Population/2002/methodology/mignote.htm">http://www. gad.gov.uk/Population/2002/methodology/mignote.htm</a>.

	<p pid=".1213W.2/1">The Saving Gateway pilot final evaluation is due in early 2005. No substantial conclusions can be drawn until we receive the full research findings, however indicators so far are good. The latest interim evaluation report showed that 1,478 accounts had been opened (the target was 1,500), and the participants were mostly drawn from young families with children. The total amount saved by account-holders was approaching &pound;300,000 by the end of February 2004, and there was little evidence that people had transferred money from existing savings accounts or borrowed to save. This report is available on the HM Treasury website.</p>

	<p pid=".1220W.6/2">Arts Council England funds a number of arts organisations which aim to encourage older audiences and engage older people in artistic opportunities. Older people were also a focus of the Arts Council's recent New Audiences pilot project. Over &pound;250,000 was awarded to projects targeting older people. Projects designed for older people addressed barriers such as lack of transport, price and having no one to go with. Information about successful New Audiences projects will be disseminated to arts practitioners and arts organisations across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1220W.6/3">On Sport, Game Plan, our strategy for delivering Sport and Physical Activity Objectives, identified older people as one of the key priority groups for increasing physical activity. Following discussions with the British Heart Foundation, Sport England's 9 Regional Plans for Sport are providing the framework for regional action. Older people are also one of the target groups for Local Exercise Action Plans (LEAPs). The Public Health White Paper due in the autumn will set out the Government's proposals for increased activity across the population.</p>

There have been no direct discussions with individual transport authorities, public transport user groups and companies operating public transport services other than through the public consultations that preceded the introduction of the Licensing Bill and the laying of the Guidance in Parliament. At paragraph 3.50, the Licensing Guidance advises licensing authorities when developing local statements of licensing policy to have regard to the existing policies and strategies of the relevant local transport authority as set out in their local Transport Plan. Local Transport Plans are the mechanism by which local authorities are expected to work in partnership with all appropriate bodies to deliver effective local transport services that meet the needs of local people. These are expected to include provision of night-time and evening services, where this is appropriate to the local situation. It is for local authorities to identify where and how to take action.</p>

	<p pid=".1238W.2/1">Since April 2003, the Regional Development Agencies have had strategic responsibility for tourism development in the regions, reflecting its importance as a driver of regional economies. Over 2003&ndash;06, South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) will receive &pound;403,000 per annum from my Department for tourism development activity, which is currently passed to the Regional Tourist Board, South West Tourism (SWT), as core funding. The board of SWRDA has recently endorsed the new tourism strategy, 'Towards 2015' and additional funding of &pound;1.5 million per annum for the next four years has been proposed to cover its implementation. SWRDA has also funded other projects which benefit tourism in the region, including regional marketing, the Tourism Skills Network and capital investment in regional attractions.</p>
	<p pid=".1238W.2/2">DCMS has made available to VisitBritain in 2004&ndash;05 grant in aid of &pound;35.5 million to promote Britain overseas and &pound;12.9 million to lead the domestic marketing of England. Tourism in Bridgwater benefits from this expenditure, as does the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid=".1238W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State currently has no official plans to visit Herefordshire. However, Herefordshire is promoted both globally and domestically in many of VisitBritain's campaigns. Domestically, it is featured in the flagship &pound;2.5 million 'enjoyEngland' campaign and other themed promotions. For example, in the 'Outdoor England' campaign the region's natural attractions, such as the Wye Valley walk and the Forest of Dean are featured. Internationally, the county is included in campaigns such as 'Good Living', 'Lifestyle &amp; Culture' and 'Hidden Britain'.
