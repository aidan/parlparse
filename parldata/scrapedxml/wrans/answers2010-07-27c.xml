	<p pid="c.881W.2/1">The Climate Change Act 2008 sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 (both from the 1990 baseline). The first three carbon budgets, running from 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022, are set in line with the 34% target. This is based on the UK's share of an EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. Latest projections published in June indicate that on central scenarios we are on track to achieve the 34% target.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.2/2">The Prime Minister has pledged to make this the greenest Government ever. In addition to a range of new policy initiatives, the coalition has already announced that central Government would reduce its carbon emissions by 10% within 12 months and that real time reporting of energy efficiency data would be implemented across Government HQ buildings. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency by introducing the Green Deal and have announced in the House that we are extending the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) to the end of 2012. We are supporting the carbon price by arguing for the EU to adopt a 30% emissions target for 2020 and we will reform the electricity market to deliver the investment we need to ensure decarbonisation and security of supply.</p>

Ofgem administrate CERT on the Government's behalf, publishing quarterly updates of suppliers' progress towards targets. Ofgem accredit the carbon score of schemes where suppliers meet the terms of the operational guidance, including auditing and reporting requirements. CERT has been focussed around measures which deliver long lived savings, namely insulation. We estimate that the measures delivered under CERT will deliver lifetime savings of some 185 Mt CO2 by April 2011. An evaluation of the scheme will be undertaken in 2011.</p>

We are currently undertaking an evaluation of the CESP, which will be complete in March 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.887W.8/1">The Department for Energy and Climate Change does not publish wholesale energy price forecasts. It publishes oil, gas and coal price assumptions for the period till 2030, which are used in the Department's analytical work. Rather than forecasting prices, DECC attempts to generate a number of price scenarios, based on estimates of fundamentals, that represent a plausible range that might materialise in the future. The assumptions do not capture short-term volatility in fossil fuel prices, but they are intended to reflect potential long-term trends. It is therefore possible to witness significant deviation from these trends in any one year. The Department keeps these assumptions under review, and will update them when necessary. The last review took place in January 2010 but no changes were made. In addition, as part of DECC's Updated Energy and Emissions Projections, DECC produce wholesale electricity price projections which arise from the fossil fuel price assumptions. The most recent projections can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.899W.2/1">There are 55 directly-employed security guards working for HM Courts Service (HMCS) at the Royal Courts of Justice. A further 57 guards at the Central Criminal Court are provided by Corporation of London. However, the majority of security guards currently deployed across the HMCS estate are provided under contract through third party providers. As at June 2010 there were approximately 1,439 security staff working at HMCS sites and a further 72 working at Tribunals Service sites. A complement of circa 300 guards is also available to draw on to cover leave/sick absences. At a minority of HMCS sites, a further (estimated) 24-30 security staff are provided under the terms of occupational lease agreements.</p>

	<p pid="c.905W.2/1">Officials at the Ministry of Justice speak to a wide range of interested parties as part of conducting the business of Government. However, since <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</phrase> there have been no meetings with any organisations to discuss debt management, nor has been any further research on alternative regulatory models to the system of self-regulation in that sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.2/2">The consultation on debt management schemes that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-18">18 December 2009</phrase> looked at the way that debtors deal with their indebtedness. It asked for evidence on whether the powers contained in Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act (TCEA) 2007 to approve operators of Debt Management Schemes (DMS) should be introduced or whether the taking of other steps to make sure that debtors are protected and creditors' interests are safeguarded would be more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.2/3">There is currently very little empirical data relating to debt management plans. It is estimated that 100,000 to 150,000 individual plans are created each year, with up to 700,000 plans in existence at any one time. However, there is no definitive data on either the proportion of these where fees are charged, or the nature and level of any fees that may be charged by different providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.2/4">An initial impact assessment was published alongside the consultation paper which considered the potential effectiveness of all of the options contained in the consultation paper. The impact assessment contained a number of questions which sought to obtain information relating to each of the options. However, the few responses to these questions contained very little factual information relating to these options. Consequently, it is not possible to make any estimate about the total amount of fees that will have been incurred by customers entering into debt management plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.2/5">Officials at the MoJ have recently completed a full analysis of the views and opinions offered by all interested parties to the debt management consultation. The Government will consider the results of the consultation before deciding what further action to take, and will publish its response shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.911W.8/1">Bridgwater Magistrates Court is the only court in the Sedgmoor Local Justice Area. The closure of the court would require the merger of the Taunton Dean and West Somerset Local Justice Area and the Sedgemoor Local Justice Area. The proposal is to close Bridgwater and transfer work to Taunton Magistrates Court, which is 12 miles and a 20 minute car journey away.</p>
	<p pid="c.911W.8/2">Bridgwater has a very low utilisation rate of 41.2%. The court is not permanently staffed and does not provide a public counter service; staff at Taunton currently travel to Bridgwater for hearings. Taunton Magistrates Court has a utilisation rate of 52.5% and could accommodate the workload from Bridgwater, should it close.</p>
	<p pid="c.911W.8/3">Should the decision to close Bridgwater Magistrates Court be taken, a full implementation plan will be produced to ensure the smooth transfer of work. This will include some minor work in Taunton Magistrates Court to prepare it to receive the additional work.</p>

We hope that the scheme will be in a position to start accepting claims shortly. The scheme will remain open for applications for the period of one year from the date on which it comes into operation. Payments will be made on a timely basis on receipt of applications, and any payments outstanding at the end of the one year period for applications will be made as soon as possible after that date.</p>

	<p pid="c.926W.6/3">Restraint holds or, on occasion, handcuffs, are also used, following individual risk assessments, when escorting young people through non-secure areas; and handcuffs are used in some court areas where it is mandatory to do so. Previous data are not available for this category of restraint, but earlier this year contractors began putting in place systems to collect the data, which the Youth Justice Board expect to be available from July onwards.</p>

	<p pid="c.930W.3/1">It is essential that approved and effective restraint techniques are available to staff in custodial establishments, to enable them to deal with young people whose behaviour puts at risk the safety of the young person him- or herself, other young people, or members of staff. Restraint is only used as a last resort, when all other methods of control have failed or would not succeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.930W.3/2">Any form of restraint has the potential to cause pain if the young person resists. In deciding whether a technique should be approved for use, the key issue is safety. The Restraint Accreditation Board, chaired by Professor Susan Bailey, is about to begin a programme of work to assess the safety and appropriateness of all techniques used in the under-18 secure estate.</p>

	<p pid="c.930W.9/1">There are no techniques authorised for use in secure training centres that involve deliberately taking young people to the floor. If, in the course of a restraint, a young person deliberately takes himself or herself to the ground, then, in general, either the young person will continue to be restrained and will be brought to a standing position at the earliest opportunity, or he or she will be released. A young person must not be held on the floor for more than three minutes, after which he or she must be released. The Physical Control in Care manual makes it clear that girls who are pregnant must not be held face down on the floor. The manual also draws attention to the heightened risks of restraining other groups of young people, including those suffering from asthma, obesity, or recent head injury or who are in a psychotic state or a state of excited delirium.</p>

They are for use only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

To discover the purpose for which the technique was used on each occasion would involve analysis of individual incident reports, which could not be done without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.3/1">Value added tax (VAT) is designed to be a broad-based tax, charged on goods and services supplied in the course of business unless they are specifically relieved from the tax by zero-rating or exemption.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.3/2">Foods for animals reared for human consumption are generally zero-rated, but VAT law has always excluded most other animal food items from this relief.

	<p pid="c.958W.0/1">IPSA's policy is that it will reimburse taxi fares where a journey is necessary and at least one of the following criteria is satisfied: no other reasonable method of transport is available for all or part of the journey, or alternative methods of transport are impracticable due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury of the MP or of a staff member. Heavy luggage may be a factor in the MP deciding these criteria apply. Whether the journey is between a London rail terminus and the Palace of Westminster is not, in itself, a criterion, although taxi fares will not be reimbursed for any part of an MP's daily commute between their London home and Westminster, or their constituency home and office.</p>

	<p pid="c.964W.6/1">As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary set out in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-01">1 July 2010</phrase>, the British Council has a crucial role to play in raising the profile of the UK overseas, projecting the UK's core values to the world and contributing to the strong networks that will underpin the UK's engagement with emerging powers. The British Council's network of country offices is constantly reviewed to ensure it is an efficient and effective platform for the UK. There is a Government-wide spending review under way. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British Council will be expected to contribute to reducing the deficit as part of that review. No decision will be taken on the future of the British Council's operations until the result of that review has been settled.</p>

This may include cases where the trial does not follow fair trial standards, or where there is a complaint about mistreatment or discrimination. However, while we keep records of individual cases, we could only produce an overall figure for the number of times we have made representations on fair trial issues by individually going through the records of all British nationals who have been in detention abroad.

Following up reports of human rights abuses is difficult in Eritrea, but we have repeatedly pressed the Eritrean Government to address the situation. At the United Nations Universal Periodic Review last year the United Kingdom called on the Eritrean Government to address concerns relating to religious detainees. British officials raise human rights issues with the Eritrean Government at every suitable opportunity, in Asmara and with the Eritrean embassy in London. The EU also has an ongoing political dialogue with Eritrea and human rights concerns, including religious freedom, are raised as part of this.</p>

	<p pid="c.971W.6/1">The Government's policy on settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is clear. Settlements are not only illegal under international law and in direct contravention of Israel's Roadmap commitments, but they also represent an attempt to create 'facts on the ground' which makes a two-state solution harder to achieve. It is important that consumers in the UK are able to make fully informed decision concerning the products they buy. That is why, in December 2009, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs introduced guidelines in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to label more accurately produce from Israeli settlements that are sold in the UK. This does not represent a ban on the sale of products from Israeli settlements in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.973W.3/1">The Government remain committed to supporting Somalis as they rebuild their country. My hon. Friend Henry Bellingham, Minister for Africa, works closely with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for International Development and the Secretary of State for Defence working alongside EU partners and the UN to support international efforts to bring lasting peace to Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="c.973W.3/2">The root causes of the instability need to be addressed, taking steps to promote stability and better governance. We have a tri-departmental conflict prevention budget of &#163;7 million this financial year. We believe a Somali-led approach is needed, focusing on the political, military and economic. These three strands of activity need to be properly sequenced and interwoven if there is to be success.</p>
	<p pid="c.973W.3/3">On the political front we support the UN-led Djibouti peace process and the political reconciliation efforts of the transitional federal Government which is taking the lead in the delivery of peace and stability in Somalia. The peace process provides the best hope for Somalis to turn their country around, form an effective Government and improve security and humanitarian access.</p>
	<p pid="c.973W.3/4">The UK is willing to work with the Somali authorities, the UN and African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and all other stakeholders to help build a stronger and more accountable security sector, providing that a coherent plan is in place. The UK has supported AMISOM since its inception and we will continue to look at ways in which we can further support the mission.</p>
	<p pid="c.973W.3/5">Improved security enables better service delivery and economic growth. We are working across Government to help promote a peaceful, politically stable and economically viable Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="c.981W.6/10">DFID's principal contribution to meeting MDG 2 in Afghanistan is made through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The ARTF is managed by the World Bank and reimburses proven expenditures on Government operating costs. Between 2007-08 and 2009-10, the education sector was assessed as accounting for 52% of ARTF expenditure. The Ministry of Education's published data does not distinguish between spending on primary and secondary education, but in 2008-09, primary students (Grades 1-6) comprised 76% of the primary and secondary education total (Source: Afghanistan Ministry of Education, &quot;Education Summary Report 2008/09&quot;). On that basis, the UK's ARTF contribution to primary education can be notionally assessed as set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.983W.2/1">HIV awareness programmes are having a positive effect. A recent study by UNAIDS found that young people are adopting safer sexual behaviours. HIV prevalence among young people has declined by more than 25% in 15 of the 21 countries most affected by AIDS. These declines are largely due to a fall in new HIV infections among young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.983W.2/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is contributing to the decline in infection rates. For example, in South Africa, prevention programmes funded by a number of partners, including DFID, have helped contribute towards a 60% decline in new infections among 15 to 24-year-olds.</p>

Furthermore, the Department for Transport's guidance on eligibility for disabled people sets out that eligibility for a concessionary bus pass may be considered automatic for injured veterans who are in receipt of war pensioner's mobility supplement, where eligibility is linked to the ability to walk. We are currently considering how to extend the scheme to include automatic eligibility for veterans in receipt of similar awards under the new armed forces compensation scheme.</p>

In the East Midlands, work has been completed at Sleaford, work is undergoing at Boston, and work is at the design stage at Long Eaton, Loughborough and Wellingborough. Under the Access for All 'Small Schemes' fund, the Department has been able to allocate over &#163;300,000 to stations in the East Midlands for smaller scheme improvements reflecting local needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1013W.11/1">The 2006 Eddington Study estimated that, using the Department for Transport's National Transport Model, the direct costs of congestion to business could rise by &#163;10-12 billion from 2003 to 2025 (in 2002 prices). Adding in the value of the lost time experienced by other travellers raises this figure to &#163;23-24 billion per annum. This report is available at:</p>

They provide a long term view of the net growth in the number of households given a projected population and previous demographic trends. As such the household projections do not take into account changes in policy or economic circumstances that may have a material effect on future household formation and do not explicitly reflect the different tenure pattern and household formation of migrant groups. The household projections reflect a net position; the number of newly forming households net of those that dissolve. Using the zero net migration population variant it is estimated that net international migration could account, on average, for 40% of the net growth in households in England over the projection period from 2006 to 2031.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.6/4">However, this does not directly equate to the actual effective demand for housing. This will also be determined by factors such as the ability of individual households to meet the cost of housing which is in turn influenced by the wider economic context. These projections also do not take into account the 2008-based population projections, subsequently published by the ONS, which include lower projected levels of net international migration. CLG expect to publish 2008-based household projections later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.14/1">Those who are injured deserve our greatest support. Our policies allow the services to retain those who have been seriously injured, if they wish to stay, for as long as there is a worthwhile role or it is judged to be in the interest of the individual and the service. When an individual can no longer undertake their current role, for medical reasons, they are able to look for other roles that they are medically capable of fulfilling. Where a job can be found, and they are either qualified or can be trained for the job, the individual may be transferred to that post.</p>

We will ensure that these men and women, and their families have the care and support they require. Personnel may also be entitled to financial support from the Armed Forces Compensation scheme and an invaliding pension, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.14/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-11">11 February</phrase>, the Ministry of Defence launched the army recovery capability (ARC) along with its partners the Royal British Legion and Help for Heroes. The ARC meets the needs of injured, wounded and sick personnel and helps these personnel either return to duty or to make a smooth transition to civilian life, however long it takes. It focuses on the specific welfare, administrative and developmental needs of individuals during, in-between, or after their medical care, as well as providing support to their families where appropriate. This ensures there is an end-to-end system for enabling injured personnel to regain fitness for duty if possible, or to leave the services with the appropriate level of support, where this is more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.14/4">The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force also have their own bespoke recovery capabilities, tailored to their particular service's requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.1054W.5/1">The aim of the discharge medical assessment is to assess and record the medical status and functional capacity at the time of discharge. It is conducted by a doctor during an individual, face to face consultation. The total time spent conducting these assessments can vary from case to case but typically lasts approximately 60 minutes. This currently includes a self-declaration, formal health check (including hearing and a comprehensive physical examination) and a review of all significant episodes of ill health during service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.5/2">The full assessment is recorded on a FMed 1 (signed by both the doctor and the patient) and summarised on a FMed 133. In most cases individuals still in service will not have re-registered with a NHS General Practitioner (GP) by the time of their Release Medical, and therefore the individual is provided with a copy of the FMed 133 to pass to their new NHS GP. The FMed 133 also provides the new NHS GP with a single service-specific address from where the individual's full medical records may be obtained, which includes the completed FMed 1 form. The individual must consent to the transfer of their FMed 133 form to their GP, and to the GP having access to their service medical records.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.5/3">The Defence Medical Services (DMS) is actively engaged with the Department of Health and the Royal College of General Practitioners to: assist individuals' re-registration with an NHS GP at discharge; to transfer the FMed 133 directly to the NHS GP incorporated into the registration process; to enhance the NHS' visibility of the ex-military population at the point of release; and to further smooth the transition of health care delivery from DMS to NHS through direct correspondence between primary health care teams as required.</p>

The Green Paper will build on the SDSR conclusions, and ongoing discussions with industry and others. There will then be a wider consultation process with Parliament, industry and academia before we bring forward a White Paper in spring 2011.

The average cost of UORs approved last financial year (2009-10) was approximately &#163;8 million. UOR timeframes reflect the operational urgency of the requirement, many deliver well within a year of the requirement being identified, 18 months is the maximum planning horizon.</p>

Rule 2 provides that the electorate of any constituency must be within 95% to 105% of the United Kingdom electoral quota. There are only three possible exceptions:</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.6/2" class="indent">Rule 6 preserves the existing constituencies of Orkney and Shetland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar. These constituencies have small populations and are not easily reached from the mainland. They have already been recognised either in legislation or in practice in previous boundary reviews as justifying particular treatment. We have concluded therefore that exceptions for these areas are justified by their particular geography.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.6/3" class="indent">Rule 4 requires that no constituency will be larger than 13,000 square kilometres and that a constituency larger than 12,000 square kilometres would not have to be within 95% of the UK electoral quota, if a Boundary Commission is satisfied that it is not reasonably possible for the constituency to comply with Rule 2. This rule would not, however result in additional representation for a part of the UK where it was applied and all other constituencies in that part of the UK must be within 95-105% of the UK electoral quota. Rule 4 simply aims to prevent extremely geographically large constituencies from having to be created in sparsely populated areas in order to meet the parity requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.6/4" class="indent">Rule 7 applies only to Northern Ireland. Because a whole number of constituencies must be allocated to each part of the UK, the average number of electors in each constituency in each part of the UK will be different from the UK electoral quota. This difference might have a particular impact in Northern Ireland due to the small size of the electorate, and might unfairly constrain the ability of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland (BCNI) to take account of other factors set out in the Bill, such as geography and local ties. The size of the other parts of the UK make this problem manageable elsewhere. The Bill therefore provides that if the rounding effect is of a particular magnitude, and the BCNI considers that either their ability to take other factors into account or to complete the review within the deadline set out in the Bill would be unreasonably impaired, then the BCNI may propose constituencies that vary from the UK electoral quota by a fixed amount (the difference between the UK electoral quota and the electorate of Northern Ireland divided by the number of seats allocated to Northern Ireland).</p>

	<p pid="c.1073W.5/1">The majority of the terms and conditions currently set by the Agricultural Wages Board, such as a minimum rate of pay, holiday entitlement, sick pay and rest breaks will in future be covered by the minimum entitlements for such matters specified under the National Minimum Wage Act or specified by other relevant employment legislation such as the Working Time Regulations or the Statutory Sick Pay Rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/2">The National Minimum Wage Act and the Working Time Regulations do not make provision for the following entitlements which are currently covered by the Agricultural Wages Order:</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/3" class="indent">Specific rates of pay for overtime</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/4" class="indent">Standby duty and night allowance</p>

	<p pid="c.1073W.5/7" class="indent">Dog allowance</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/8">The Agricultural Wages Order makes specific provision for:</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/9" class="indent">Apprentice under the age of 19, or in the first year of their apprenticeship</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/10" class="indent">Workers of compulsory school age</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/11" class="indent">Students on a work placement of less than one year</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/12">Specific provision for these categories of workers is not made under the National Minimum Wage legislation. However, such persons are entitled to employment rights and protections under the Working Time Regulations and the legislation dealing specifically with the employment of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/13">It is also important to note that the terms of a worker's employment contract which exist at the time the Agricultural Wages Board is abolished will continue to apply until such time as the contract is varied by agreement between the employer and the worker, or until the contract comes to an end. This is the case whether the terms are written, verbally agreed or implied by custom and practice. If an employer makes changes to the terms of employment without the worker's agreement, this constitutes a breach of contract. The worker may have a claim for breach of contract, unfair dismissal or unlawful deduction of wages if the change relates to pay.</p>

It does not include some projects that were completed before the establishment of DEFRA in 2001, for which details are not readily available. Most of the DEFRA projects in this area relate to the risk assessment of GM organisms and the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops, rather than the development of GM crops as such.</p>

	<p pid="c.1093W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-06">6 July</phrase> this year, the Forestry Commission announced a &#163;600,000 support package to support woodland owners in tackling the outbreak of Phytophthora ramorum infection in larch trees in south-west England and south Wales. The package has been put in place as part of DEFRA's five-year Phytophthora programme, which is being managed by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera). The first &#163;100,000 has been earmarked to give private sector owners access to professional advice about how to have infected trees felled and marketed in ways that comply with biosecurity and other regulations. Owners will be able to apply for up to &#163;1,000 of aid from this part of the fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.2/2">The remaining &#163;500,000 will be used to prevent further spread of the disease. It will help owners with the costs of clearing immature or 'thicket-stage' Japanese larch from affected sites, both privately owned and those managed by the Forestry Commission, especially those most likely to cause further spread of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.2/3">Further details are available on the Forestry Commission's Phytophthora ramorum web pages.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.2/4">Scientists from Forest Research are preparing guidance on restocking sites affected by Phytophthora ramorum for owners and managers. They expect to be able to issue this within the next few weeks on the Forestry Commission website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.2/5">The Forestry Commission and Fera are working closely with industry to develop guidelines for improvements in parks and garden management, and in the retail and nursery trade, which will further reduce the spread of the disease.</p>

	<p pid="c.1093W.5/1">Since the first detection of Phytophthora ramorum in Sussex in May 2002, a systematic programme of surveys has been carried out by the Food and Environment Research Agency and the Forestry Commission covering nurseries, garden centres, woodland and other sites in the wider environment, with action being taken to destroy infected plants that posed a risk of further spread: especially Rhododendrons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.5/2">In August 2009, the pathogen was found for the first time in Japanese larch, a commercial forestry tree species, at sites in Cornwall (as well as in Devon and Somerset), and surveys since then have found a number of further sites where trees have been infected. These surveys have intensified and are ongoing, supported by aerial surveillance by helicopter. Notice has now been served on 373 hectares in Cornwall, which have been confirmed with the infection since the initial outbreak was discovered. Only one new infected site was found between April and June this year. Most of the infected sites are on the public forest estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1093W.5/3">In addition to this, since the first infections were discovered, there have been 166 non-larch sites confirmed as infected in parks and gardens in Cornwall. At least 22 of these are now confirmed as being clear of the pathogen.</p>

	<p pid="c.1095W.11/2">All water companies plan for secure water supplies through their 25-year water resources management plans. These set out how a company will provide for a sustainable supply and demand balance, taking into account pressures such as population growth and climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.11/3">This does not mean that they can avoid introducing restrictions in times of water shortages although typically companies plan for restrictions once every 20 years. To plan for resources that would meet demand in any circumstances would accrue significant additional costs, which would be passed to customers, and would also have environmental impacts. All companies take a risk-based approach. They balance a planned level of service, which includes measures such as hosepipe bans, against the costs customers are willing to pay for a secure supply.</p>

The Home Office HQ and UK Border Agency moved to the current system in October 2008. Other agencies and NDPBs did not have systems in place for the whole period and/or do not separate out travel costs from other expense types.

	<p pid="c.1114W.2/1">The Lisbon Treaty contains transitional provisions for measures adopted under the police and judicial co-operation title of the old Treaty on European Union. These provide for a transitional period of five years to apply in relation to those measures.

	<p pid="c.1116W.11/1">The Department commissioned two studies in 2009 to explore the social harms associated with khat use, though the perceived health effects of khat are also briefly reported on in each of the studies. The first of these is a mainly qualitative study undertaken among the UK's Somali, Yemeni and Ethiopian communities exploring perceptions of the social harms associated with khat use and perceptions of the appropriate role of Government intervention (the study also included a short survey of drug action teams to gauge the availability of treatment service provision for khat users). The second is a review of the national and international literature examining the evidence on the social harms associated with khat and the impact of legislation in countries which have legislated against khat use and supply.</p>

	<p pid="c.1117W.2/1">Available data relate to offences recorded in London and England between 2007-08 and 2009-10, and are from the Home Office's additional data collection on selected offences involving knives and sharp instruments (hereafter referred to as 'knife offences'). Since only aggregate knife offences data are collected from forces, it is not possible to provide information broken down by age of victim or suspect, or below police force level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/2">The collection was introduced in April 2007 and knives are taken to be involved in an incident if they are used to stab or cut, or in a threat. A sharp instrument is any object that pierces the skin (or, in the case of a threat, is capable of piercing the skin) and includes bottles and glass (when broken prior to the offence) and syringes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/3">Data collected in 2007-08 covered the offences of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, GBH without intent and robbery. The following offence categories were added to the collection in 2008-09: threats to kill, actual bodily harm (ABH), sexual assault and rape.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.2/4">The following table shows data for the years 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10. It should be noted that data for 2007-08 are not directly comparable to those for later years. This is due to the change in offences covered by the collection, and also due to changes in: (i) the clarification rules for recording GBH with intent; and (ii) the definition of GBH without intent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1119W.11/1">Police community support officers all have a set of 20 standard powers. They may be granted additional powers at the discretion of the chief officer of their force. There are three standard powers to issue fixed penalty notices (FPN) while five are discretionary. Some FPNs are issued on behalf of local authorities and these are produced in a number of different formats. Hence, training differs between forces, depending on local circumstances. There are no plans by the Home Office to issue guidance to police forces on these powers. The issue of guidance on the use of fixed penalty notices is an operational matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.1132W.2/3">The details of the new assessment are currently under development but will be designed from the beginning to meet our obligations under the United Nations convention and our duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, ensuring that the impact on disabled people is given full consideration. To assist with the development process, and recognising our obligations under the UN convention, we will engage with external partners, including disabled people and their organisations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1133W.0/1">Supporting lone parents into paid work is essential to our strategy for the eradication of child poverty. As well as maintaining and building the necessary culture and infrastructure around provision of childcare and promotion of flexible working, the Coalition Government will introduce a single Work programme in the first half of 2011, which offers all benefit recipients, including lone parents, personalised help, delivered by contractors drawn from the private, public and voluntary sectors, as well as social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.0/2">We are also increasing the requirement on lone parents with older children to seek work, in line with their caring responsibilities. Currently, lone parents whose youngest child is 10 or over and who are not in paid work must ordinarily claim jobseeker's allowance and look for work, or employment and support allowance and undergo a work capability assessment. Before that, they can claim income support. The age of the youngest child will be reduced to seven in October 2010, and the June 2010 Budget announced that it would be lowered to when the youngest child enters school or formal education. We plan to implement this change in 2011-12, subject to passage of the relevant primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.0/3">Lone parents with children under the age of 13 can restrict their availability for work to their children's school hours, and non-availability of childcare must be taken into account by benefit decision-makers when considering whether a parent had good cause for turning down an offer of employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.0/4">Lone parents with younger children are not required to seek work, but if they wish to return to work, pre-employment and in-work support are available through specialist Lone Parent Advisers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1133W.0/5">In recognition of the difficulties lone parents caring for disabled children may encounter in returning to work, regulations provide that lone parents on income support with a child aged fifteen or under who have a child receiving the middle or higher care component of disability living allowance are not required to seek work in return for benefit.</p>

This relates to shortfalls or excesses caused by a customer's contractual rent being higher or lower than the appropriate local housing allowance rate. 8% of customers paid the same amount of rent as they received in local housing allowance.</p>

Of the estimated 6.5 million individuals in families who recorded receipt of housing benefit, the number who were living in households with income below 60% of median household income in 2008-09 was 2.6 million (40%) before housing costs and 3.9 million (60%) After housing costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1140W.5/5" class="indent">3.

	<p pid="c.1148W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to respond to your parliamentary questions about Back to Work Sessions as these fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/4" class="indent">With regard to your first question, data is not available on this aspect of Jobcentre Plus performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/5" class="indent">With regard to your second question, there is no central requirement to have a security guard in attendance at Back to Work Sessions. However, we take the health and safety of our staff and customers very seriously. Each location where we run Back to Work sessions is subject to a formal Risk Assessment on which we consult staff health and safety representatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/6" class="indent">Additionally, and in response to your third question, before running a Back to Work Session all facilitators must have completed a bespoke learning and development package called Presenting and Facilitating Group Sessions. These sessions are designed to support those delivering the various group sessions available to our customers. The aim of the event is to provide our staff with the skills required to deliver Group Sessions to our Customers. This event gives them the necessary skills and knowledge to research, prepare and deliver group sessions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/7" class="indent">With regard to your question about content, Back to Work Sessions are designed to raise awareness of the local labour market - employers recruiting; jobs available; travel to work areas, etc - and the help available to improve job prospects; and remind customers of their responsibilities to actively seek work and take-up opportunities made available. To support delivery, material is available centrally to ensure the consistency of basic information and key messages and is then tailored locally to give the presentation greater relevance to the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/8" class="indent">We welcome customer feedback, as it helps us to improve our service. Nationally, Back to Work Sessions have been, and continue to be, evaluated and the results are encouraging. Most customers have viewed the sessions favourably, particularly where they have been interactive and of local relevance. Feedback has also highlighted areas where they could be better and this has led to service delivery improvements. Similarly, offices will seek and act upon customer feedback locally to help assess and improve their Back to Work Sessions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/9" class="indent">In terms of travel expenses, we aim to run Back to Work Sessions so they coincide with the normal requirements to attend the Jobcentre for a jobsearch review. This means customers are not required to make an additional journey and do not incur additional travel expenses, so reimbursement is inappropriate. However, where this is not possible and in circumstances where customers are entitled to a reimbursement, this should be made clear at the outset of the session; and payment made promptly. I have asked for operational guidance to be reviewed and clarified in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/10" class="indent">Finally, the 3-Step Plan is an integral part of the Back to Work Session. The guidance issued to Jobcentre Plus staff states quite clearly that each attendee must be issued with a copy of the 3-Step Plan and encouraged to complete it as fully as possible. The guidance also instructs staff to encourage attendees to access the Jobseeker pages of the Direct Gov website where they can find practical help and advice when applying for jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.2/11" class="indent">I hope this reply is helpful and assures you of our intent to provide people with the best possible service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1150W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner. As the Child Maintenance Commissioner is currently on annual leave, I am responding on his behalf.</p>

	<p pid="c.1150W.5/5" class="indent">In the 12 months to March 2010, &#163;1,910,000 in child maintenance was collected and arranged for parents with care in Redditch constituency. As at March 2010, &#163;6,720,000 in arrears was owed on cases where the parent with care is resident in Redditch constituency. &#163;3,718,000 of this is owed specifically to the parent with care with the remainder owed to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.5/6" class="indent">Outstanding maintenance arrears were down from &#163;3,828 million in March 2009 to &#163;3,761 in March 2010.

	<p pid="c.1150W.5/7" class="indent">The Coalition Government has said that tackling the issue of outstanding child maintenance arrears is a high priority and the Commission is reviewing its strategy and plans for pursuing arrears in light of this. In addition, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-14">14 June 2010</phrase> that the Commission would set a new target for the collection of arrears. The Commission is working with Ministers to agree a suitable level for this target.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.5/8" class="indent">In the meantime the Commission is deploying its range of enforcement measures to collect arrears, including deducting money directly from bank accounts, seizing properties through Order for Sale action and preventing or reversing the transfer of assets from a non-resident parent with outstanding arrears to another person in order to evade child maintenance.</p>

To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. This assesses the effects of a person's condition on their ability to carry out a number of everyday activities relevant to work. People with a recorded diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependency may have other diagnoses, for example mental illness, which result in their incapacity for work. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation:</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.2/1">Drug and alcohol addiction is one of the most damaging root causes of poverty. Helping people who are trapped on benefits through drug and alcohol addiction so that they can recover and find employment is a top priority for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.2/2">Drug or alcohol dependency does not of itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. This assesses the effects of a person's condition on their ability to carry out a number of everyday activities relevant to work. People with a recorded diagnosis of alcohol or drug dependency may have other diagnoses, for example mental illness, which result in their incapacity for work. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation</p>

It is for individual trusts to determine their own provision and they are not under a statutory obligation to consult with any advisory body on the appointment of healthcare chaplains. However, many will refer to the occupational standards and codes of conduct published by organisations and professional associations such as the Hospital Chaplaincies Council, the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy and Multi Faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy.

	<p pid="c.1199W.8/1">Academies are scheduled bodies under the Local Government Pension scheme and are therefore automatically members. Academy Trusts will continue to be required to ensure that all employees at Academies other than teachers have access to the LGPS. This requirement is included in their funding agreement. A similar requirement applies to teachers in respect of the Teachers' Pension scheme. The ongoing funding of Academy Trusts is contingent upon the conditions in their funding agreements being met.</p>

	<p pid="c.1202W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the Department announced that Building Schools for the Future (BSF) projects that have reached financial close will continue, together with repeat projects which have outline business case (OBC) approval prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>.

However, we are clear that the whole way in which we build schools needs radical reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.2/4">We have therefore commissioned, in the context of the Government's fiscal consolidation plans and emerging policy, a comprehensive independent review of the Department's existing capital expenditure which will make recommendations on the future delivery models for capital investment. The review team will report at the end of the year. Its interim report will guide future spending decisions over the next spending review period. It will also look at how best to meet parental demand; make current design and procurement cost-effective and efficient; and consider how capital is allocated and targeted.</p>

	<p pid="c.1212W.0/1">The Secretary of State has not had any recent discussions with or representations from Warrington borough council about Building Schools for the Future (BSF). Nor has the Secretary of State discussed with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government the relationship between plans to re-build William Beamont high school and the development of the Orford Park project, although departmental officials have been in discussion with Warrington borough council about the impact of the BSF announcement on projects in their area. No assessment has been made of the effects of his decisions on BSF on levels of educational inequality specifically in Warrington.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> the Secretary of State announced a review of the Department's capital programmes. The review will make recommendations to help shape decisions over future capital investment in schools, to ensure that investment represents good value for money and strongly supports the Government's ambitions to reduce the deficit, raise standards and tackle disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.0/3">The effects of ending the BSF programme on the construction industry were considered by the Secretary of State in coming to his decision. The cancellation of BSF does not represent the end of capital investment in schools or the opportunities for employment in the construction industry. In particular, a more flexible and streamlined approach is likely to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to become involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.1212W.3/2">The coalition agreement announced the decision to close the Government Office for London and to review the position of the other eight Government Offices. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government offices, subject to using the spending review to resolve consequential issues. A final decision will be made at the end of the spending review in the autumn. In the light of that announcement the six DFE-funded GO-based field forces will also come to an end earlier than planned. The six field forces to end early are: Safeguarding advisers; Children and Learners Strategic advisers; Child Poverty advisers; Teenage pregnancy co-ordinators; Sustainable schools network; and, Healthy schools co-ordinators (jointly funded with DH).</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.3/3">Closing the GO network is in line with the Government's intention to remove administrative layers and simplify accountability across national and local government and service providers, and to reduce public expenditure. This also supports the Government's commitment to empower local authorities by removing top down monitoring, support and challenge. This approach aims to free up local authorities so they can focus on their own improvement agendas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.3/4">Local authorities themselves have called for greater freedom to plan and manage their own improvement and to be innovative in how they deliver high quality services for children and young people. We are keen to work with the sector in developing its own, sector-led, models for improvement-for example through the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes which shares good practice round the system and uses specialists seconded from the sector that councils can draw on as and when they want.</p>
	<p pid="c.1212W.3/5">The Government are determined to make child protection as effective as can be, with a focus on better frontline services. We will not do anything that will jeopardise or compromise child safety. We are seeking to put responsibility back to frontline services to ensure they have the right level of local scrutiny and accountability to drive up quality and provide the kind of children's services the public want.</p>

As announced at the end of May, the spending on 16-18 core participation funding for 2010-11 will be maintained and protected from any in-year spending cuts. At present, funding is provided to all three types of provider through the 16-18 national funding formulae. The learner responsive model (for schools and colleges) is managed by the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) as one of its key roles. The Department also funds 16-18 Apprenticeships where funding is calculated through the employer responsive model (for work based learning) managed by the National Apprenticeship Service (NAS), as part of the Skills Funding Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1228W.11/2">The levels of funding from 2011-12 will be determined as part of the spending review this autumn, and considerations surrounding the current funding methodology and formula will continue to form a part of that process. We have already taken steps to reduce bureaucracy in 16-18 education and simplify the 16-18 funding process by ensuring that funding follows the choices of young people. From the academic year 2011-12, core allocation budgets for school sixth forms and colleges will be based on the equivalent of lagged pupil numbers. We will also ensure that local authorities can focus on their strategic role as champions of young people, taking action where they identify significant issues in terms of gaps in supply or quality, particularly in ensuring access among the most vulnerable groups.</p>

	<p pid="c.1229W.5/2"><i> </i>Sure Start Local Programmes were the first stage in the delivery of the Sure Start Children's Centre service. They provided services for fewer than half of the under fives living in the 20% most deprived wards in England. The Government decided from 2003 to move toward a national programme of Sure Start Children's Centres offering a universal, mainstream service for children under five and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1229W.5/3">Funding for Sure Start Children's Centres is part of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant, which is ring-fenced. Funding for former Sure Start Local Programmes was ring-fenced, within this grant, for the original centres in the most deprived areas. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-24">24 May</phrase>, the Chancellor announced that revenue funding for Sure Start, including former Sure Start Local Programmes, will be protected from in-year cuts in 2010-11: and both ring fences maintained this year. Questions about future funding and the existence of any ring fences in future years will be dependent on the outcome of the spending review. Local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure sufficient provision of children's centres to meet local need - and it is important, in the current financial climate, that we make sure we are getting the most out of every pound spent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1230W.5/1">The Government announced the local government contribution to cross-government savings on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June 2010</phrase>. These savings include &#163;311 million in the Department for Education's Area Based Grant (ABG) to local authorities in 2010/11. This reduction does not imply a direct cut to services funded by ABG, which include the provision of statutory information, advice and guidance to young people. The overall impact on total local government expenditure will be a 3.6% reduction, and we expect local authorities to manage this reduction across all their services, whether the initial funding source is formula or area-based. I am not expecting cuts to fall disproportionately on IAG services over others-these are critical services for young people. The Government believe that local authorities do have scope to make efficiencies this year.</p>
