	<p pid="b.744W.10/1">The Government have made no such assessment. The Electoral Commission has the power to set and monitor performance standards for electoral services. Since 2008, the Electoral Commission has monitored the performance of electoral registration officers (EROs) in Great Britain against a set of standards, and has published annual assessments. The Commission's March 2010 Report 'Performance Standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain' found that &quot;just under 96% of EROs met the 'Completeness and accuracy of electoral registration records' standard this year compared with 85% of EROs last year&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.744W.10/2">The Electoral Commission advises and works closely with EROs who do not meet these standards in order to improve their performance.</p>

	<p pid="b.746W.0/1">I am responding as the questions largely relate to Wales Office expenditure. However, the query relating to the Spring Supplementary Estimates for 2010-11, HC 790,</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;for what reason there is proposed an increase of <i> (a)</i> &#163;1.9 million in voted expenditure in Request for Resources 2&quot;,</p>

	<p pid="b.746W.0/4">The comprehensive spending review (CSR) 2007 settlement determined under the previous Government was based on the presumption that the Wales Office would be allowed to bank underspends where they occurred and for those underspends to be carried forward under the end year flexibility (EYF) scheme to be used to meet pressures in later years. The &#163;1.3 million EYF drawn down in the Spring Supplementary Estimates allowed the Wales Office to meet its spending commitments for 2010-11. In addition to the EYF drawdown, the Treasury exceptionally allowed the Wales Office to switch unspent capital provision to meet the pressures in the resource budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.0/5">The increases to the Welsh Consolidated Fund are set out in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.0/6">Details of changes to the Wales Office DEL are set out in the written statement laid in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-14">14 February 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-02-14.67"><i> Official Report</i>, column 67WS</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.748W.9/13">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>, the directorate in which the coroners and burials unit sits has operated a flexible staff resource model, with staff being moved around the directorate to meet ministerial priorities. The staff cost for 2010-11 are thus estimated because they are part of the overall directorate costs. Similarly, other costs are now held at a wider level than this unit so cannot be identified separately. The budget for 2011-12 has yet to be agreed and existing resources cannot be guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.2/1">All approved premises in England and Wales provide staff with personal alarms which in some way link to local police stations. The most common arrangement is that, if a staff member activates their personal alarm, this alerts a call centre, which in turn contacts the approved premises by telephone to confirm whether an emergency has occurred. If there is no response, it is assumed that an emergency has occurred and police are alerted. In some cases, there are additional failsafe procedures such as passwords that have to be given before the call centre will accept that no emergency has occurred. Some approved premises instead have direct-to-police functions on personal alarms carried by staff. A minority of approved premises also have building alarm systems which operate in similar ways to the personal alarms.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.2/2">Approved premises provide for enhanced supervision, particularly of high risk of harm offenders on release from custody. It would be much more difficult to provide that level of supervision, were such offenders to be dispersed into less suitable accommodation in the community on release from custody.</p>

	<p pid="b.755W.6/1">Under Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 42/2010, governing governors are required to ensure that an assessment of the risks to which their staff and others who may be affected by their undertakings are exposed is carried out and that measures are in place to eliminate or control the risk. Any failure to adhere to this Instruction may be dealt with in accordance with the conduct and discipline policy of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS).</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.6/2">NOMS' Conduct and Discipline Instruction (PSI 06/2010) provides a range of options for dealing with staff who fail to meet the required standards of behaviour. The primary objective of the policy is to encourage improvement in an individual rather than impose a disciplinary sanction and encourages the use of performance management processes where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.6/3">Each case would be considered on its individual merits, but depending on the nature and potential consequences of the breach, the following sanctions are available: oral warning, written warning, final written warning, regrading, removal from the field of promotion, financial restitution and dismissal from service. In cases where the misconduct is serious but does not warrant dismissal, a combination of penalties can be awarded.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.9/1">In 2009, DEFRA funded a wide-ranging research review to identify the causes of decline in wild bird populations. This included an assessment of the impact of predation. It found evidence that predation was, at least in some areas, having an impact on ground-nesting species such as seabirds or wading birds of wetland habitats (i.e. not songbirds). Predation was also identified as a potential driver of declines for nine woodland bird species including some songbirds such as bullfinch. Many bird and other animal species are known to predate songbirds. However, despite some studies showing a link to local declines in some bird populations at some individual sites, the evidence that predation is driving national declines is mixed. In addition, most research treats 'predators' as a single group and further research to better understand the role of individual predators and the known or likely impact of their control is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.9/2">A more recent review undertaken by the RSPB, specifically on predation came to similar conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.9/3">Both reports highlight one further important caveat: that there is a strong interaction with land use change-as habitats become degraded, birds are more susceptible to predation. What is clear from the research is that while predation can be important for some species in some areas, key drivers of change are habitat degradation and fragmentation, and in woodland, changes to habitat structure and so this is where our policies are focused. Improved habitat management also benefits the full range of species associated with the British countryside.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.2/1">DEFRA has used multiple channels of communication to remind farmers of the availability of the derogation and how to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.2/2">The Department worked with key farming organisations before the opening of the 2011 derogation application window on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase> so that they could alert their members and encourage them to apply. DEFRA issued an information bulletin on its website and alerted those who follow the Department on Twitter with an update on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase>. The derogation was also publicised in DEFRA's Farming Link Online newsletter.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.2/3">DEFRA's Farming Online team issued email reminders to those farmers that received the derogations in 2010. Farmers and growers who met the relevant requirements could apply for the 2011 derogation online through DEFRA's Whole Farm Approach pages during the application window.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.2/4">Furthermore, the Environment Agency issued a factsheet during the 2011 application period to all farmers that received 2010 derogation. A reminder of the deadline and ways to apply was also included in the October Fertiliser Advisers Certificated Training Scheme quarterly newsletter, 'Fertiliser Matters'. A text message reminder via the Cross Compliance text messaging service was also sent to urge farmers to reapply for the derogation.</p>
	<p pid="b.763W.2/5">DEFRA officials worked again with the key farming organisations shortly before the deadline for applications to provide a further reminder to the farmers through their communications networks.</p>

	<p pid="b.764W.2/1">In autumn 2010 the Department (which includes the core Department and its network of arm's length bodies) estimated that around &#163;190 million (2% of the overall DEFRA budget for the four-year spending review period) would be required to fund voluntary exits and redundancies.</p>

	<p pid="b.764W.5/1">Relationships between DEFRA and its non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are governed by memoranda of understanding. There are two types of NDPBs: executive NDPBs, which deliver a particular public service and are overseen by a board rather than Ministers, and advisory NDPBs, which advise Ministers on particular issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.5/2">Executive NDPBs have their own chief scientists or heads of evidence and their own efficiency targets. Therefore, DEFRA does not routinely assess the value for money of evidence and advice provided by such NDPBs.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.5/3">With respect to advisory NDPBs, as part of a wider review of its arm's length bodies, the Department has recently reviewed the role and functions of its 18 scientific and technical advisory bodies. The aim of the review was to improve transparency and accountability. The majority of the scientific and technical advisory bodies will become expert committees. They will all continue to provide independent advice but this change will allow for greater co-ordination as the scientific expert committees will work more closely with DEFRA's Science Advisory Council and the Chief Scientific Adviser.</p>

	<p pid="b.765W.0/1">With regard to the effectiveness of evidence and advice, DEFRA recently commissioned a pilot study to assess how evidence has informed policy decision-making within four case study areas<sup>(1)</sup>. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of evidence on policy making, rather than evaluate the impact-or success-of policy decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/2">DEFRA's chief scientific adviser (CSA) provides an independent challenge to the evidence underpinning policy decisions to assure himself that policy is informed by high-quality, robust evidence. Where specific issues are brought to the CSA's attention, or where evidence and advice is particularly complex or uncertain, the CSA will assess and give advice on them, to Ministers or senior policy colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/3">DEFRA's three laboratory agencies (*Fera, VLA and CEFAS) are subject to science audits about once every five years; the most recent series was completed in 2007. These audits have covered all aspects of scientific work carried out at the agencies including R and D and non-R and D to give an independent assessment of quality, balance, scope and appropriateness of the science. The timing of the next audits will depend on the outcomes of the arm's length bodies review.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/4">No specific assessment of the openness and accessibility of evidence and advice has been carried out recently. For core DEFRA, current practice includes publication of all R and D reports on the DEFRA website<sup>(2)</sup> and encouraging publication in peer reviewed journals.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/5">Statistics are produced in line with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics produced by the UK Statistics Authority<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/6">DEFRA has published an 'Information Strategy' on how it will make its data accessible to everyone and routinely publishes large amounts of data, including statistical datasets; DEFRA will soon improve its publication channels to provide greater ease of use and further increase the number of data offerings. DEFRA is also reviewing its data holdings through HM Treasury's Review of Government Data which when completed, will also lead to an increase in our publication output.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/7">The Government chief scientific adviser (GCSA), after cross-Government consultation, re-launched his &quot;Guidelines on the Use of Scientific and Engineering Advice in Policy Making&quot;<sup>(4)</sup> in 2010. These include good practice principles relating to openness and transparency and DEFRA and its non-departmental public bodies are actively working on their implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.0/8">DEFRA's scientific advisory committees apply the Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees<sup>(5)</sup>, which has openness and transparency as a key theme. The DEFRA Science Advisory Council's code of practice makes clear that it operates a policy of openness in line with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations. The Science Advisory Council publishes full information on its website.</p>

	<p pid="b.766W.11/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) informs DEFRA of its healthy eating policy and recommends consumption of at least two portions of fish a week, including one portion of oil-rich fish such as anchovy, herring, sardine and mackerel.</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.11/2">However, stock sustainability is an important consideration when recommending the consumption of fish species. DEFRA has commissioned work to understand the potential for encouraging increased consumption of herring and sardines as part of their 'Fishing for the Markets' project-an initiative to encourage domestic consumption of sustainable, under-utilised fish species. The project began last year and research is ongoing. Initial results will be available in spring 2011.</p>

The working groups are collecting data from a number of sources, including on the availability of insurance, and are due to report this summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.782W.5/1">In 2008-09 the Governments Citizenship Survey showed that the main barriers to volunteering were, work commitments (cited by 55% of those that did not volunteer), family responsibilities (30%), lack of spare time (26%) and not hearing about opportunities to help (20%).</p>
	<p pid="b.782W.5/2">Encouraging social action, including volunteering is one of the three aims of the Governments vision for a big society. To support this aim, in December 2010 the Government published the Giving Green paper. The Green Paper sought to start a debate on how we can make social action a norm and encourage more people to give their time, including removing barriers to volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="b.782W.5/3">The Government are also committed to reducing bureaucracy for charities, social enterprises and community organisations. To achieve this the Cabinet Office and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) have set up a joint taskforce to investigate how to reduce the bureaucratic burdens on civil society organisations, particularly small organisations. The taskforce is chaired by Lord Hodgson and will report to Ministers in spring 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.785W.0/1">The Giving Green Paper, published in December 2010, contained a preliminary analysis of existing research.

The Green Paper also outlined the Government's initial ideas for catalysing a culture shift towards a more giving society, including: the creation of an &#163;80 million Volunteering Fund, which comprises a volunteering match fund and a volunteer infrastructure programme. These programmes will both provide support to organisations to take on more volunteers, and encourage individuals to take up these new opportunities.</p>

The Remuneration Committee Chair of each bank will write to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to confirm that this commitment has been met. These banks have also committed to world-leading pay disclosure arrangements which when taken together with the FSA's sector-wide regime make the UK's disclosure arrangements the toughest of any major financial centre. The Government expect that these commitments will be met. Going forward, the Government will consult on extending the disclosure requirements to other large banks in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.789W.3/1">HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) approach to tackling child benefit error and fraud is two-fold; to prevent fraud from entering the child benefit system and, where it already exists, to remove it.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.3/2">HMRC requires each customer to provide documentary evidence of each child being claimed for, such as an original birth or adoption certificate. Those documents are subject to strict verification before a claim is paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.3/3">HMRC deploys a specialist compliance team to tackle error and fraud already in the system. The team undertake a range of interventions targeting non-compliant customers, challenging information they provide and stopping claims where appropriate.</p>

This has no material effect on the broader issue, which is that the Government believe that EU Council Regulation No. 407/2010, establishing the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, is consistent with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

	<p pid="b.792W.6/1">Treasury Ministers and officials have meetings with a wide variety of organisations in the public and private sectors as part of the process of policy development and delivery. As was the case with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of all such meetings.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.6/2">UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI) manages the Government's investments in financial institutions on an arm's length and commercial basis. The development and execution of strategies for disposing of the Government's shareholding in Northern Rock is part of UKFI's remit.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.6/3">UKFI will look at the full range of alternatives for divestment, and will explore options based on maximising value for the taxpayer, maintaining financial stability and paying due regard to promoting competition. All exit strategies for Northern Rock plc will be considered. The final decision on the sale of Northern Rock will be made by the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.6/4">UKFI and Northern Rock plc are in the process of jointly appointing advisers to examine all possible exit strategies. Advisers will be appointed in the field of corporate finance, tax and accountancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.6/5">On the financial health of friendly societies, despite the challenges faced by much of the wider financial sector, most mutuals have emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed. The Government support the mutual proposition of which friendly societies are one part, however, they also recognise some specific challenges this model will face over the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="b.799W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is considering funding research on the use of biochar to assist carbon capture and soil improvement in smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. The existing-mainly technical-research suggests that biochar can deliver benefits in terms of improved soil performance, carbon capture, crop nutrients and plant disease control. However, there is currently little understanding of how this will work for smallholders in Africa. DFID is considering strengthening this evidence base, in collaboration with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).</p>

	<p pid="b.799W.6/1">I last discussed support to Northern Sudan with my EU colleagues at a meeting of Development Ministers and EU Commissioner Piebalgs on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-22">22 February 2011</phrase>. I have also in recent months discussed UN delivery across Sudan with the Heads of UN Agencies including Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Baroness Amos, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. The UK will continue to work with EU and UN counterparts to promote economic development and improve lives in both North and South Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.6/2">Sudan is currently not eligible to money from the 10th round of the European development fund. However, the UK has led on the creation of a special fund for Sudan using undisbursed money from previous rounds. Some of this special fund will go to Northern Sudan for use in its marginalised areas: the three states of the East, the North-South Border Areas, and in Darfur. The Department for International Development's (DFID's) office in Sudan is currently working closely with the EU delegation on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.6/3">The UN is pivotal to the delivery of the UK's humanitarian assistance to Northern Sudan, for example through the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). Thus far in 2011, the UK has provided &#163;30 million to the CHF, of which 46% will be spent in Northern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.6/4">Beyond our work through these specific multilateral channels, I have recently announced the results of the UK's Bilateral Aid Review. Over the next four years, the UK Government will work with North and South Sudan to promote growth, employment and accountable and transparent government; we will help 1 million people escape from poverty; get 240,000 children through primary school; give over 500,000 people access to clean water and sanitation; and provide life-saving health and nutrition support to up to 10 million people.</p>

	<p pid="b.800W.5/2">All DFID's funding for development awareness raising work is currently being reviewed to determine its effectiveness and to assess whether, and if so how, DFID should continue to use aid funds in the UK to promote awareness of global poverty and public involvement in efforts to address this.

	<p pid="b.802W.4/1">It is too early to say definitively what the outcome of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) surge has been but the signs are encouraging. The increase in both ISAF and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) has enabled us to continue to take the fight to the insurgency through the winter months. This has led to the momentum of the insurgency being arrested and reversed in many areas. In addition, we expect the formal process of transition to Afghan-led security to begin shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.802W.4/2">These gains are not irreversible and we should expect levels of insurgent activity to rise again in the spring but as the insurgency is degraded and the ANSF are built up there is some cause for cautious optimism.</p>

Military assistance is normally provided on a reimbursement basis at the request of, and in support of, other Government Departments.</p>

Staff in the RDP usually continue to work in their last directorate or are redeployed to cover short-term tasks. The RDP is also used by staff returning from overseas postings, including civilians supporting the armed services in operational theatres. The MOD is currently subject to a freeze on external recruitment and the RDP helps us to fill vacancies from within existing staff resources.</p>

	<p pid="b.809W.3/1">Officials in the Ministry of Defence are currently collating the information requested. I will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Andrew Robathan to Angus Robertson:</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in my response to your Parliamentary Question about civil servants' bonuses on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-07">7 February</phrase> (Official Report column 27W).</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/4" class="indent">A close and effective link between pay and performance is an important element of the reward arrangements for the Civil Service. The payments reflect the individual's performance during the previous year, and are therefore a direct and immediate award to those who have achieved challenging objectives. The performance element of pay is known, colloquially but misleadingly, as a bonus. In fact, the performance-related element of pay is an integral part of an individual's pay and not an addition to it: it is funded from the core pay bill. The non-consolidated element of pay has increased over the years as consolidated pay awards have formed a lower percentage of the total pay bill. They are a cost effective way of rewarding staff because there is no assumption that the awards will be repeated the following year, so they do not add to future pay bill growth, and because they are not pensionable.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/5" class="indent">The MOD also operates an in-year non-consolidated payment scheme, the Special Bonus Scheme (SBS), which rewards eligible MOD civilians for exceptional performance of a specific task or for the achievement of a professional qualification the use of which benefits MOD and the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/6" class="indent">For the Senior Civil Service (SCS), performance incentives are paid primarily as non-consolidated performance payments. Any award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers, with groups of proposed awards judged by panels of senior staff, who make awards to the individuals who have made the greatest in-year contribution to business objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/7" class="indent">Senior Fixed Term employees are individuals who are recruited through fair and open competition from outside the civil service. Those employed as Senior Fixed Term Appointees (FTAs) are on individual contracts and have a higher percentage of pay set to performance awards which are judged against stringent and stretching delivery based objectives. Some of these payments are paid in stages, and it is now usual to pay only part of the performance award immediately with the remainder deferred for two to three years and judged against the delivery of medium to longer term objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/8" class="indent">Performance is judged by line management with assistance from senior officials, stakeholders, remuneration committees and in some cases internal audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/9" class="indent">The total values of non consolidated end of year performance pay made by the Department, the total numbers paid and the values of the highest awards are shown below:</p>

MOD's overriding interest in the BTWC is to minimise the risks that biological weapons will be used by state and non-state actors against UK interests, including our deployed UK forces. We aim to do this by ensuring that the BTWC is being strengthened in a way that increases its deterrent, transparency, confidence building, and investigative value. The UK is working closely with the EU and allied partners towards the seventh review conference of the BTWC in December 2011, with the UK objective: of strengthening the convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.12/5">The chemical weapons convention is a successful international instrument for chemical disarmament which has already seen the verifiable destruction of more than 63% of the world's declared chemical weapons. MOD expertise and engagement underpins the leading role the UK takes with the EU and allies in the work to implement and strengthen the convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.12/6">The Global Threat Reduction Programme (GTRP), the UK's contribution to the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, remains a priority for the UK. It is a key element in the UK's work to ensure that chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials and expertise are out of reach to terrorist groups or hostile states. As part of GTRP, the MOD's biological non-proliferation programme continues to develop in scale and geographical range to support these aims. Projects have included activities such as, strengthening biosafety and biosecurity, promoting the use of biological agents for peaceful purposes, and contributing to implementation of the BTWC. DECC delivers the nuclear and radiological elements of the programme, while the MOD managed the now-complete programme of assistance to Russia with chemical weapons destruction.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.12/7">The GTRP also provides assistance that enables countries to meet their international commitments including to United Nations Security Resolution 1540 (UNSCR 1540), which requires the adoption and enforcement of controls to prohibit non-state actors from acquiring the ability to deliver a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack.</p>

In view of these permitted development rights there is generally no need for proposals for the underground cable elements of a project to be caught by the Planning Act regime, although (in England) it would be possible for the developer to include aspects of an underground scheme other than the cable itself (such as sealing end compounds) in a Planning Act application as associated development. Other than in these specific cases, in view of these permitted development rights I do not consider there to be a case to require developers to obtain consent for installation of underground cables under the Planning Act regime, which would amount to a significant extra burden on developers.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.5/2">Applications for sub-sea cables are considered by the Marine Management Organisation under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA)- to be superseded in April this year by a new marine licensing regime under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. The Infrastructure Planning Commission in England can consent a sub-sea cable as associated development if it forms part of the infrastructure for an offshore generating station by granting a deemed FEPA Licence or marine licence under (respectively) section 149 or 149(A) of the Planning Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.5/3">I consider these arrangements to be adequate at this stage and do not intend to require applications for sub-sea cables to be included in the list of nationally significant infrastructure projects in the Planning Act.</p>

	<p pid="b.826W.5/1">Both the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) fund research into aspects of neurosciences. Each council is a non-departmental public body which receives its grant in aid from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.5/2">The total annual spend for BBSRC research relevant to neuroscience for the past five years is detailed in the following table.</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.826W.5/12">BBSRC does not have fixed allocations for neuroscience funding. Future funding of neuroscience research by BBSRC is dependent on the quality and strategic relevance of grant applications. Funding will be allocated over the next four years in relation to relevance to BBSRC's strategic priorities and BBSRC's four-year spending review settlement. A smaller part of that neuroscience research historically funded by BBSRC now falls within BBSRC's current strategic priorities. It is likely therefore, that there will be a reduction in BBSRC funding over the next spending review period for neuroscience research that is considered to fall outside BBSRC's strategic priorities. A precise level of funding for future neuroscience funding cannot be stated since, until BBSRC has received applications and their relevance and quality has been assessed, it will be difficult to determine, but as a broad estimate, not an allocation, which is all that is possible at this stage, BBSRC believe that their total neuroscience funding might run at approximately &#163;36 million/year.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.5/13">The total annual spend for MRC research relevant to neuroscience and mental health for the past five years is detailed in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.826W.5/22">The MRC's Delivery Plan for the spending review period 2011/12 to 2014/15 outlines plans to increase funding in research into mental health, neurodegeneration, and addiction. The MRC therefore expects to see an increase in funding for neuroscience, but the exact level of funding will be dependent on the quality and strategic relevance of grant applications received.</p>

	<p pid="b.831W.8/2">One of the basic tenets of aviation security in the UK is that everyone entering the security restricted area of an airport, including staff, is subject to security screening. The Department specifies the standards that must be met, and the methods that may be used, by industry in respect of the screening of passengers and staff. All security measures are kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.841W.8/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) was in discussions with brokers throughout <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-21">21 February</phrase> about charter options. I took the decision to authorise FCO charters at 10 pm that evening. The FCO then placed the order with the brokers and, following intense discussions, flight options were confirmed with them at 11.52 pm the same evening. The aircraft operator and FCO staff on the ground advised that landing permissions were taking up to 48 hours to process. This first charter flight was therefore arranged to depart from Gatwick airport at 9 am on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase>. Despite strenuous efforts by the operator and by embassy staff on the ground, and like a number of other countries, we were unable to secure landing permission on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-22">22 February</phrase>. By mid-morning on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase>, a few countries had taken the risk of flying to Tripoli without prior landing permission, seeking landing permission from the control tower instead. No sanctions had been taken against them. We therefore informed the operator and requested them to fly in on this basis. The operator agreed. However at this point it became apparent that the charter plane had developed a technical fault, preventing it from taking off. This fault was repaired as quickly as possible and the plane departed London Gatwick on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-23">23 February</phrase>.</p>

Our records show that other governments, including those of other EU member states, have helped over 150 British nationals to leave Libya. It is likely that additional British nationals were evacuated by their employers or our international partners without formal notification to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Estimates for 2010-11 may be revised after the end of the cold weather payment season, but will still be estimates not actuals.<br/> 2. A cold weather payment is made to an eligible customer when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0&#176;C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. (When the temperature criterion is met, the weather station is said to trigger.)<br/> 3. Each of the weather stations is linked both to an area within Stockton North constituency and also to an area outside Stockton North constituency. Estimated numbers given are for the weather station as a whole, not for the part of Stockton North constituency linked to the weather station.<br/> 4. If there is a further trigger for any of the weather stations this winter, that will not change the estimates of the number of benefit units that received at least one cold weather payment in 2010-11.<br/> 5.

	<p pid="b.850W.5/1">As the administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what assessment has been made of the likely change in the level of provision of Jobcentre Plus in (a) Glasgow, (b) Scotland and (c) the United Kingdom in each of the next four financial years; and whether an objective has been set for the level of efficiency savings to be achieved by the Jobcentre Plus network in (a) Glasgow, (b) Scotland and (c) the UK in each of the next four financial years.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/4" class="indent">This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/5" class="indent">By way of clarification, Jobcentre Plus does not provide services in Northern Ireland, therefore data is not available for the whole of the UK, but for Great Britain (GB) only. For this answer, GB is defined as England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/6" class="indent">Our financial plans for the next four years are at an early stage and are still being refined. Whilst we can provide information about the position at the GB level for Jobcentre Plus, we have not yet set efficiency targets below this level (i.e. for Scotland or Glasgow) for 2011/12.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/7" class="indent">The Spending Review, 2010 announced that DWP would deliver 26% savings in real terms from its core budget over the four year period to 2015. Jobcentre Plus will contribute to achieving this level of savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/8" class="indent">In 2011/12, we will do this by working more efficiently. For example, we will make much more use of our online services (e.g. Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) online). We are implementing ideas from our staff to make improvements in our processes and help improve productivity. We will also make savings in our back office and support functions. In our jobcentres, we will enable our personal advisers to work more flexibly to provide personalised support to customers and we will work more closely with external providers under the new Work Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/9" class="indent">To help achieve the level of efficiencies required, we will be reviewing our Jobcentre network as part of an overall service delivery plan. We will look at which locations we will deliver services from and how best to do so, working with other local services such as councils, credit unions, and training providers to join up our services better and share premises where possible. In some cities, we have a number of jobcentres close to each other and it is sensible to look at opportunities to reduce our costs here. We are also reviewing our network of Contact Centres and Benefit Centres</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/10" class="indent">Once we have developed our plans, including Equality Impact Assessments, we will share these with local stakeholders, including MPs, as part of our normal consultation arrangements for service delivery, before any decision is taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.5/11" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus expects its jobcentre network to remain one of the largest in government, with services still delivered in many small and rural towns as well as major cities.</p>

	<p pid="b.854W.6/1">The most commonly used measure of pensioner poverty relates to those with incomes below 60% of contemporary median income, After housing costs. Estimates of the number of pensioners who have been lifted out of poverty are not available, as each year different households are surveyed to produce low income statistics that are published in the Households Below Average Income series. However, information is available about the net change in the number of pensioners with incomes below 60% of contemporary median income.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/2" class="italic">(a) Pensioners in Coventry  South constituency</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/3">The Households Below Average Income figures only allow a breakdown of the overall numbers in poverty at Government office region level. Therefore, information is available for the west midlands Government office region, but not available for the Coventry South constituency. Three-year averages are used to report regional statistics as single-year estimates are subject to volatility. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100,000 and percentages to the nearest whole percentage point.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/4">In the three-year period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 there were around 300,000 pensioners in the west midlands with incomes below the 60% contemporary median (equivalent to 28% of pensioners in the region). The latest information relates to the period 2006-07 to 2008-09 in which there were around 200,000 pensioners in poverty (16%).</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/5">Between the periods 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and 2006-07 to 2008-09, there has been a reduction of around 100,000 pensioners in the west midlands Government office region with incomes below 60% of the contemporary median income. This equates to a 12 percentage point reduction in pensioner poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/6" class="italic">(b) Pensioners in the UK</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/7">At a national level, we do not need to use the three-year averages and can use the individual yearly figures. However, figures for 1997-98 cover Great Britain only, as Northern Ireland data did not become available until the following year.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/8">In 1998-99 there were around 2.9 million pensioners in poverty in the UK, which equates to around 29% of all pensioners. The 2008-09 UK figures show that around 1.8 million pensioners were in poverty, equating to 16%.</p>
	<p pid="b.854W.6/9">Between 1998-99 and 2008-09 the number of pensioners in the UK with incomes below 60% of the contemporary median income reduced by 1.1 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.880W.8/1">Reports on development of biological weapons by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan would be classified. The Home Office works across Government to examine all available information and intelligence. The risk that different types of biological terrorist threats pose to the UK and the response that is appropriate to those risks is regularly reviewed and re-assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/2">The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (ATCSA) 2001, Part 7, legislates the security of dangerous substances that may be targeted or used by terrorists and covers biological agents which pose the greatest risk to the UK. Schedule 5 of the Act lists the biological pathogens</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/3">and toxins to which the provisions of Part 7 apply. This covers both human and animal pathogens and not only the wild-type or 'intact' micro- organisms and toxins, but also genetic sequences derived from or coding for such substances. Selection of materials has been dependent upon a number of factors and is undertaken by a team of government and academic experts.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/4">Over the past six years, the UK has built up capability to prepare for a CBRN terrorist attack. Initial programmes are largely complete, however we are currently undergoing a programme of work to review and potentially augment and improve this capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/5">A wide range of possible incidents or attacks has been considered. Following this process, the UK Health Departments have established an appropriate stockpile of vaccines, medical countermeasures and specialist equipment to be used to protect and treat the public. For reasons of national security, it would be inappropriate to specify what particular countermeasures are held and where they are located.</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/6">Government have taken steps to protect emergency service personnel against such threats. A cohort of frontline health workers has been vaccinated to deal with any initial suspected or confirmed cases of smallpox. No additional plans are in place specifically in response to the impending London 2012 Olympics, although risks are regularly reviewed based in part on the threat level in the national risk assessment (NRA).</p>
	<p pid="b.880W.8/7">There is no current plan to make a statement on these issues due to the classified nature of much of the information in this area.</p>

It is clear that communities are safer places when local people are actively involved in maintaining order and have a say in how they are policed and how other services are provided. Baroness Newlove was appointed the Government's Champion for Active, Safer Communities in October 2010 and she will be making recommendations to Government about what needs to change in order to encourage and support more people to get actively involved in keeping their communities safer.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.2/2">The Government have also taken steps to ensure that there is more information in the hands of the public. Through the Police.uk website we have recently given communities across England and Wales easy access to street level crime and antisocial behaviour data for their area, alongside key neighbourhood policing information, such as details of their local neighbourhood policing team, details of their next beat meeting and how to get involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.2/3">We are replacing police authorities with directly elected police and crime commissioners. Police and crime commissioners will give accountability at the police force level and regular beat meetings will give direct accountability in neighbourhoods.</p>

Those who are not needed by the agency in question should be directed to another adoption agency so that the interest of potentially suitable people is not lost.

	<p pid="b.883W.6/1">The law is very clear that children should live with their parents wherever possible. Where a child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm, the local authority has a duty to safeguard and promote the child's welfare. Local authorities cannot remove children from their parents (without the parents' consent) without first referring the matter to a court, and they cannot place a child for adoption (without the parents' consent) without a placement order made by a court.</p>

That is why I have written to local authorities to ask them to do everything possible to increase the number of children appropriately placed for adoption, and why I have set up a Ministerial Advisory Group on Adoption to provide expert advice on a range of practical proposals to improve practice and issued revised guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.884W.5/2">At present, a statement of arrangements for children is filed with the petition in any divorce proceedings where there is a child of the family under the age of 18. It allows the petitioner to inform the court of the proposed arrangements for the children. The respondent can sign the statement to show their agreement if they wish. If the parties need a court order to decide the contact or residence arrangements after a divorce, this is applied for in separate proceedings under section 8 of the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.5/3">One of the principles within which the current Family Justice Review is operating is that the positive involvement of both parents should be promoted post-separation. The review is looking in particular at how to promote contact for non-resident parents. The Review Panel, which is independently chaired, is due to issue its interim report for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase>, followed by a final report in the autumn. We shall be considering carefully its recommendations.</p>

Our first priority has been to protect the core education programmes offered by schools and colleges. This covers the whole range of courses including A levels, vocational qualifications, foundation learning and apprenticeships that equip young people with the knowledge and skills they need to progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.5/3">In addition, the savings we have made have enabled us to increase funding for the more disadvantaged and those needing additional support. &#163;150 million of the funding that has been released from reducing the entitlement has been used to increase by almost a third the proportion of funding in the national funding formula which addresses deprivation. Schools and colleges will have the freedom to use this additional investment in the way they see fit in order to provide the activities that contribute to improved retention, attainment and successful progression. In addition we will also be re-investing over &#163;200 million in increasing the size of programmes for students working below level 2 to give them the opportunity to gain level 1 and 2 qualifications.</p>

It also involves children and young people in the development and review of policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.890W.5/2">All reviews led by the Department for Education and its predecessor Department since the UN Committee published its Concluding Observations in October 2008 relate to children and young people and touch their lives in some way. A list and terms of reference are not provided on the grounds of disproportionate cost, but there have been significant reviews on matters that affect children and young people, such as the impact of the commercial world, sex and relationships, mental health, safeguarding and major policy statements on key areas such as education and child poverty. In particular, the review of the Office of the Children's Commissioner asked how the role can be configured to better demonstrate Government's commitment to UNCRC.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.5/1">We recently announced proposals that practitioners wishing to supply unlicensed herbal medicines should be required to be registered with the Health Professions Council. This will enable us to use a derogation in European medicines legislation which permits national arrangements allowing those designated as authorised healthcare professionals to commission an unlicensed medicine on their professional responsibility to meet the special needs of their individual patient. Under these arrangements we would envisage similar criteria applying to practitioners of herbal medicine as is the case with a range of other healthcare practitioners in the United Kingdom who can already commission unlicensed medicines, known as &quot;specials&quot;, under such a scheme. Safeguards for the patients are provided primarily by a combination of professional regulation of the practitioner and by the role of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in regulating the manufacturers and distributors of the products.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.5/2">We also propose that in future practitioners of herbal medicine wishing to use the provisions of section 12(1) of the Medicines Act 1968 to prepare unlicensed herbal remedies on their own premises to meet the needs of individual patient identified in consultation should be required to register with the Health Professions Council. The introduction of this requirement should strengthen safeguards for patients while ensuring consumers continue to have access to herbal medicines. There will be public consultation on all these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.5/3">At <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April 2011</phrase>, following the end of the period of transitional protection allowed under Directive 2004/24/EC, section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 will no longer be available. This provision permitted the marketing of unlicensed herbal remedies in the UK without a requirement for patient consultation and incorporated few safeguards for patients as to the safety and quality of the product or the provision of information about the safe use of the medicine. In future such products will require either a marketing authorisation or a traditional herbal registration.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.2/1">The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises Ministers and the national health service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy. The UK NSC reviewed the policy for screening for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) carriage in pregnancy in 2009. The review was the subject of a broad consultation and concluded that the evidence did not support the introduction of screening.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/2">The UK NSC had previously commissioned a clinical and cost-effectiveness study comparing different approaches to GBS. The health technology assessment took this work forward on behalf of the UK NSC and published the results in 2007. The main conclusion was that there was considerable uncertainty on the most effective approach to GBS. The study results were considered by the UK NSC during the screening policy review in 2009. The UK NSC will review its policy position again on GBS carriage in pregnancy screening in 2012 or earlier if any significant new peer reviewed evidence emerges.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/3">Information for women on GBS is contained in 'The Pregnancy Book', a guide to a healthy pregnancy, labour and childbirth, and life with a new baby, which is given to all pregnant women. Information is also available on the NHS Choices website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.2/5">Women who are concerned about GBS infection are advised to talk to their doctor or midwife.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/6">Current guidance on the prevention of early-onset neonatal GBS disease is provided by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The guideline advises health care professionals on the management of high risk pregnancies and is currently being reviewed and updated. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are currently developing guidance on the management of early onset infections including GBS.</p>
