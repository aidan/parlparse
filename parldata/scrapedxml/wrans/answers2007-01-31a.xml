	<p pid="a.305W.2/1">Implementing DFID's climate change policies on adaptation and mitigation in country programmes involves a range of staff, including programme managers and advisers with environment, livelihoods and infrastructure responsibilities. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/2" class="indent">In Bangladesh, China and India the numbers of advisers working on environmental issues over the last three years (2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07) is: Bangladesh: 0, 1, 1; China: 1, 2, 2; India 3, 2, 2. However the proportion of time spent on climate change has increased over the period. A new post has been created in Brazil on climate change and markets starting 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/3" class="indent">The work of advisers in the Environment, Infrastructure and Livelihoods groups, while not necessarily dedicated to climate change, covers aspects of the subject, for example adaptation in agricultural research or in infrastructure design. The numbers of internal posts over the 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 financial years are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/4" class="indent">Environment posts: 20, 18.5, 22.5 (includes GEA climate change posts)</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/5" class="indent">Infrastructure posts: 29, 27, 34</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/6" class="indent">Livelihoods posts: 49, 45.5, 45.5</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/7">The Global Environmental Assets (GEA) team of the Sustainable Development Group leads on climate change policy work. Its complement of dedicated staff working on climate change over the last three financial years is as follows: 3 in 2004-05, 3.5 in 2005-06 and5.5 in 2006-07. We expect to fill two additional posts in coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/8">In addition, we are externally recruiting a newHead of Profession for Environment who will also be engaged on this important issue. The Heads of Profession for Infrastructure and Livelihoods continue to provide support to DFID's climate change work. DFID's Chief Scientific Adviser has been providing support on climate change and agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/9">In the International Financial Institutions Department, which is leading DFID's work on supporting the multilateral development banks to develop a Clean Energy and Investment Framework, three posts include climate change in their portfolios. The number of posts over the last three financial years has remained static but the proportion of time spent on climate change has increased over the period.</p>

	<p pid="a.306W.8/1">Globeleq is a wholly owned subsidiary of CDC which is in turn wholly owned by DFID. It is managed independently by its own board of directors. They take their own day-to-day commercial decisions without intervention or interference by DFID, but working within a policy framework that we have set for them. DFID would not normally make assessments such as those in question. That remains the responsibility of CDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.8/2">Globeleq mainly operates power generation facilities and sells power on a wholesale basis to the local distribution agency. Consumer tariffs, which cover the cost of transmitting and distributing power as well as of generation, are set by the distributing agency or independent regulators. Globeleq has no direct influence on their levels. For most of Globeleq's power generation facilities, the price it receives for its power is determined by a power purchase agreement or PPA, most of which were negotiated before Globeleq bought the assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.8/3">Although consumer tariffs may have risen since Globeleq bought generation facilities, or after it disposed of them, as in the case of Kelvin Power, there is no causal link between Globeleq ownership and consumer tariffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.8/4">By improving the reliability of power supply, Globeleq makes a positive contribution to the provision of power. Most of Globeleq's power generation businesses meet or exceed their contractual requirements for generation. Globeleq mainly operates power generation facilities rather than distribution networks and has no control over the number of connections. That remains the responsibility of the distribution agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.8/5">Globeleq is involved in distribution in Uganda through its ownership of Umeme which holds a concession to operate the distribution network in Uganda. Umeme has exceeded the concession requirements for increasing customer connections.</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.2/1">Prior to the Coalition's invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the UK Government consulted and worked with UN agencies, the US Government, and others in making preparations to deal with a number of priorities including: the possibility of large-scale urban fighting with substantial civilian casualties; the possible use or inadvertent release of chemical or biological weapon materials; disruption to the Oil For Food programme due to instability following conflict or a longer-term collapse of oil production; serious damage to transport links and other essential infrastructure such as water and sewage pumps; disruption to the functioning of hospitals; large-scale movement of people within Iraq and into neighbouring countries; and internal ethnic and political conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.2/2">In March 2003, to help international preparedness, DFID allocated &pound;32 million to the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, and &pound;13 million to United Nations agencies (World Food Programme, UNICEF, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, World Health Organisation, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Office of the UN Security Coordinator). This funding contributed to the costs of pre- positioning food, medical and nutrition supplies, shelter kits and other relief supplies; establishing logistical support systems; and deploying staff in readiness for the crisis. As a result, United Nations agencies were able to return to Iraq very quickly in order to begin implementation of substantial humanitarian and recovery operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.2/3">Decades of under investment and mismanagement by Saddams' brutal regime have left the Iraqis with a huge challenge. The new Iraqi Government is firmly in the lead in the reconstruction effort and has the resources to fund much of the improvements and public services itself. It also has massive international support. The UK is one of the first major donors to Iraq to fully disburse its Madrid pledge of &pound;544 million since 2003. This contribution is helping build the capacity of the Iraqi Government, at provincial and national levels, plan to deliver investment in basic services, improve oil production levels, generate jobs and manage its own significant resources more effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.2/1">The UK's provincial reconstruction team in Basra has recently assessed microfinance initiatives in southern Iraq. It concluded that, with improved security, these initiatives can improve livelihoods, particularly in fertile agricultural areas, and urban areas where there is a market for goods and services, by extending credit to small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/2">However, in the long term a more sustainable solution is to unlock Iraq's significant financial resources for the benefit of local businesses. While DFID is not funding any microfinance initiatives in Iraq, we are advising provincial and central government officials on ways of extending credit to small and medium enterprises. This work is taking place in coordination with USAID which is funding two microfinance institutions operating across Iraq; together these two organisations have made $78 million worth of loans to over 40,000 clients.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/3">Through the UK provincial reconstruction team in Basra, we are running a series of workshops to equip local businessmen in Basra, Dhi Qar, Maysan and Muthanna with the skills they need to succeed.

This survey forms the main part of a joint Feasibility Study. The principal aims of the survey are to identify the options for anti-personnel mine clearance, what environmental impact clearance may have, and to set out the broad costs involved.

	<p pid="a.321W.2/1">Employment in the regular UK armed forces is open to citizens of Commonwealth countries and Republic of Ireland nationals as well as British citizens; all applicants are given equal consideration and all have to meet the same basic entry standards. The armed forces do not generally actively recruit overseas with the exception of Gurkhas from Nepal. However, in recent years the Royal Navy and the Army have sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries with the permission of the government concerned, and only then when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest among the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards, to save them the cost of an abortive trip to the UK to undergo the recruitment process.</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.5/2">&quot;Mothballed&quot; is not a term used by the MOD. I have interpreted it as referring to ships capable of being returned to operational service but for which there is no requirement to do so at this time. The only Royal Navy warship in this category is the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.5/3">Five other surface warships of destroyer/frigate size and above are at low or very low readiness; four of these are in refit. I am withholding further details as this could enable deductions to be made that could be prejudicial to national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.5/4">The normal readiness cycle of every Royal Navyship is comprised of a mixture of periods of lower readiness, typically for maintenance or refit, and periods of higher readiness. The extent to which costs are reduced during periods of lower readiness is not calculated separately and depends on a number of factors including the type of ship, the readiness state to which it is reduced, and the length of time spent at lower readiness.</p>

In 2002 the Government reviewed whether to allow darker tinting during daytime only. Motorcyclists favoured this approach but road safety bodies raised concerns about the dangers which could arise if darker visors were worn in day time during poor or changing light conditions. After careful consideration, and on the grounds of road safety, it was decided to maintain the current limitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.325W.8/1">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) should ensure that 5 per cent. of UK road transport fuel sales will be made up of renewable fuel by 2010. This will represent approximately 2.5 billion litres of biofuel and it is expected that this will be supplied from a mixture of domestic and imported feedstocks. To meet a 5 per cent. fuel obligation entirely from UK sources in 2010, we estimate that between 1 to 1.5 million hectares of land would be required depending on a range of factors including crop yields, fuel extraction rates, the technologies employed and the market split between petrol and diesel. However, this does not take into account the utilisation of co-products from biofuel production, for example in animal feed, which will reduce the overall land requirement. In the longer term, advanced technologies for processing feedstocks should also help to reduce the land requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.8/2">UK farmers will be able to compete in this market, and a number of major new biofuel production plants are at the planning and construction stage in various parts of the UK. We understand that several of these are anticipating making use of home-grown biofuel feedstocks. However, much will also depend on the ability of UK farmers to compete on price and quality with overseas producers.</p>

These included 2005, 2010 and 2015 targets for the recycling and composting of household waste (25 per cent., 30 per cent. and 33 per cent.) and for the recovery of municipal waste (40 per cent., 45 per cent. and 67 per cent). The Waste Strategy Review consultation document, published in February 2006, proposed new targets for 2010, 2015 and 2020 for the recycling and composting of household waste (40 per cent., 45 per cent. and 50 per cent.) and municipal waste recovery (53 per cent., 67 per cent. and 75 per cent.). We intend to publish the revised Waste Strategy in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.6/4">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) recently held a consultation on a sustainable schools strategy and DEFRA will be working with DfES and other partners, including the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), following the consultation to help schools minimise, reuse, recycle and compost their waste. It is our intention as part of this work to issue guidance to schools to include issues around the definition of waste from schools and 'top 10 tips'.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.6/5">In addition, WRAP is currently developing a schools programme as part of their successful Recycle Now communications campaign. The aim of the programme is to change recycling behaviour at home and at school. The programme includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.6/6" class="indent">A training programme aimed at providing local authority waste and recycling officers with the knowledge and skills to implement effective recycling schemes in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.6/7" class="indent">Research into resources for schools, including the development of a database of resources on the subject of waste and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.6/8" class="indent">Research with secondary school teachers and senior managers to inform WRAP's secondary schools strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.334W.2/1">The National Scrapie Plan (NSP) Ram Genotyping Scheme (RGS) has been under review during the second half of 2006, following a decision by the EU Council and Parliament to reject proposals for compulsory scrapie resistance testing in pure bred and pedigree flocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.2/2">The review included an examination by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) of the science underpinning the NSP, and an assessment of the benefits gained from the RGS over the last five years. SEAC concluded that the RGS approach of selective breeding for scrapie resistance remained a scientifically valid approach for eradicating classical scrapie. They concluded however that the prevalence of BSE in the UK sheep population is most likely zero, or very low if present at all, and consequently the current RGS would have little impact on public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.2/3">Ministers have accepted the review's key recommendation that a fully-funded RGS is therefore no longer appropriate. Instead, Departments should consult on options for the future of the RGS&mdash;either a cost-shared genotyping scheme, or closure of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.2/4">Ministers have also agreed that the consultation should take place in the summer in the light of progress on wider work on responsibility and cost sharing which is already under way. It will also cover the NSP flock register. Officials will continue informal discussions with sheep industry stakeholders and RGS members.</p>

Consequently, to avoid confusion it has been decided not to commence this provision until the legislation can be amended to remove any uncertainty. With regard to the regulation of loans in Northern Ireland, these provisions have not been commenced as different arrangements exist in Northern Ireland in relation to the funding of parties. Consequently, the detail of the secondary legislation dealing with this matter will be complex and technical, and requires further development and consultation before it can be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.346W.5/1">HMRC acknowledges that the original estimates on Budget Day 2002 did not correctly anticipate the high take-up of online filing. Figures were based on the limited information available at that time. The Department is confident that now more data about filing behaviour-particularly take-up trends&mdash;is available, it will be able to more accurately estimate payments of the online filing incentive.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.5/2">Estimates for forecasting incentive payments are based a combination of the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.5/3" class="indent">Number of employers claiming the incentive</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.2/12">Typically this highly specialised service is required for premature and very ill newborn babies. Demands on the service have increased in recent years; a trend also evident in other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/13">A Working Group, commissioned in 2005 by the Chief Medical Officer, has assessed the current provision of services across Northern Ireland. The report included a number of recommendations to sustain and strengthen services. With regard to the capacity of current services, the report indicated that an additional two neonatal cots would help meet the service demands more effectively. Other recommendations included the development of a neonatal intensive care network, improved information systems on neonatal cot usage and availability, and measures to increase the complement of appropriately trained neonatal nurses.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/14">An additional &pound;800,000 will be allocated for neonatal/paediatric intensive care services in 2007-08. This will allow the introduction of at least one additional neonatal intensive care cot, one additional paediatric intensive care bed and other improvements in a number of associated areas, including the establishment of a managed clinical network.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.2/15">These measures to increase capacity within neonatology will also be supported by the development of a neonatal and paediatric critical care transport service. A lead consultant for the service has already been appointed and other staff are currently being recruited.</p>

	<p pid="a.355W.2/1">The average transport costs associated with transferring a baby outside Northern Ireland for treatment are in the region of &pound;5,000 to &pound;8,000 per transport. This is with the exception of ECMO cases (Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation), which is a service not provided in Northern Ireland. Babies requiring this treatment are collected by a specially equipped and staffed helicopter at a cost of approximately &pound;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.355W.2/2">Due to the method by which reimbursement between NHS Trusts has been carried out until recently it is not possible to disaggregate the treatment costs associated with transferred babies without incurring disproportionate costs in obtaining the information. The cost of treatment elsewhere in the United Kingdom, however, is comparable with provision of the same treatment locally. The additional expense lies in travel for the patient and relatives, as appropriate.</p>

Under the scheme, the police are able to issue to persons suspected of committing specified minor offences, with a fixed penalty notice of &pound;50 or &pound;80. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability to conviction for the offence. Data held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform show that 641 PND's were issued in the Surrey police force area in 2005 which is the most recent 12 month period for which complete and finalized data is available. Of these, 517 were issued for 'higher tier offences' which attract a penalty of &pound;80; the remaining 124 were for 'lower tier offences' which attract a penalty of &pound;50. The total value of these tickets was &pound;47,560. Data for 2006 will be available in mid 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.362W.3/2">The initial payment rate for PND's in Surrey was63 per cent. in 2005. 35 per cent. of PND recipients had a fine of one and a half times the penalty registered against them as they failed to pay the penalty or request a court hearing, within the 21 day suspended enforcement period. Once registered, these fines fall into the HMCS fine enforcement and collection systems. Figures provided by the Courts Service show that the courts achieved an overall payment rate for all kinds of fines of 83 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="a.363W.9/1">Information on the total cost of police pensions in payment for each of the last nine years is not held centrally as the administration of the Police Pension schemes is the responsibility of individual police authorities. Information on financial statistics, including expenditure on police pensions, for police forces is included in the annual reports published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). This information is gathered independently of the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/2">The figures given in the following table are themost recently published projections of total future expenditure on police pensions in England and Wales, net of the contributions made by serving officers.These were produced by the Governments Actuary Department (GAD) as part of the consultation process in 2005 on the new system for financing police pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/3">GAD advises that in view of the time elapsed since the figures were produced they should be viewed only as indicative of the likely future trend of police pensions expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.9/4">The system for financing police pensions changed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Under the new system, police authorities no longer have to meet the cost of pensions in payment out of their operating accounts. Police authorities now have a separate pensions account for this purpose, into which are paid officers' contributions and a new employer's contribution (currently 24.6 per cent. of each officer's pensionable pay). Any shortfall in an authority's pensions account each year is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. A key benefit of this change is that it takes away from police authorities the responsibility for meeting the rising cost of pensions in payment as a result of increases in the number of pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.0/1">The programmes supporting sporting and cultural provision offered by my Department and its non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are available in all towns of England, including Stroud.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/2">Some examples of the many actions we have undertaken or plan to improve quality of life in Stroud include the following;</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase> Lottery distributing bodies, which make funding decisions independently of Government, have made 394 awards, worth around &pound;18 million, in the Stroud constituency. (This information is derived from the Department's lottery grant database which uses information supplied by the lottery distributors.) This includes an award of &pound;12.34 million in July 2004 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to British Waterways for the 'Renaissance of the Cotswold Canals'.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/4">Over &pound;1.5 million of Sport England lottery funding has been invested into sport in Stroud since 2004. This includes a new Stroud and District School Sport Partnership established in September 2006 to increase the amount and quality of sports opportunities for pupils in the area as part of the National School Sport Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/5">In addition, a Sports Development Service was launched in 2002 to provide a range of programmes and opportunities to residents, which has helped Stroud to achieve higher participation levels for sport and active recreation than the national average recorded by Sport England's 2006 Active People survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/6">We are committed to the potential benefits of the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games being maximised across the whole of the UK, and are working closely with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and the Nations and Regions Group, which brings together representatives from every nation and region. Each Nation and region is developing its own plan to maximise the impact of the Games in their area, as well as the wider opportunities to deliver a sustainable legacy from the Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/7">With close proximity to London and the Weymouth and Portland Sailing Academy in neighbouring Dorset as the venue for all the 2012 sailing events, the Games will be a terrific boost for all the South West including Stroud.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.0/8">South West Screen, the regional screen agency for the South West of England area, runs a number of schemes and services promoting cinema and film making in the area. Specifically, it is supporting 'Viewfinder', a regional film festival seeking to build regional audiences for locally made films by emerging filmmaking talent, taking place in March. The Space, Stroud's community arts centre, is one of the venues for the festival, which is expanding this year to make the consumption of locally made films a more sustainable enterprise.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.3/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that businesses and communities across the UK, including in Wales, are able to benefit fully from the opportunities presented by hosting the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. We are working closely with the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), the body responsible for constructing the Games facilities, as well as the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (London 2012 Organising Committee) to realise this aim. We have established a nations and regions group involving each constituent part of the UK and English region, and each member of the group has been tasked with developing plans to ensure that they take full advantage of the benefits presented by the Games/including procurement opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.3/2">The Government recognise that the Games present a unique opportunity to showcase the path to sustainability in the UK as a whole, including in the use of sustainable materials. The materials used in the construction of the Olympic Park and venues are a key aspect of the ODA's commitment to delivering a sustainable development, and it is committed to identifying, sourcing and using environmentally and socially responsible materials. Its sustainable development strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase>, set out its policy in relation to use of sustainable materials in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.3/3">The London 2012 Organising Committee will manage its procurement policy separately from the ODA, but will also adopt fair and sustainable procurement principles. Their procurement policy and associated strategy is currently being developed and a sustainable development plan for the Olympic programme overall will be published in the spring.</p>

The Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) has participated in a series of workshops, conferences, seminars and briefings for public sector organisations across the United Kingdom. OPSI has also issued a wide range of guidance material in order to inform public sector organisations of their responsibilities under the regulations on the re-use of public sector information. The process of providing advice and support to public sector organisations continues.</p>

However, Since early January all appeal determinations are now emailed directly to the Visa Section in Islamabad from the Home Office. This will result in a much quicker turn around and the ability to track appeal determinations sent.</p>

	<p pid="a.391W.2/1">Adult dependency increases were originally introduced to recognise of the fact that many married women did not have employment outside the home. In the case of carer's allowance, the increase is paid for the carer's spouse, civil partner or someone who looks after the carer's children, where that person earns less than the amount of the adult dependency increase, which is currently &pound;28.05 a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-31">31 May 2006</phrase>, the latest date for which information is available, some 410,000 people entitled to carer's allowance were receiving income support or pension credit, whereas only around 15,900 were receiving an adult dependency increase. Available forecasts suggest that some 3,000 new carer's allowance awards in 2006-07 and in 2007-08 will include an adult dependency increase. Forecasts are not available currently for 2008-09 and 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.2/3">The Government intends to remove adult dependency increases for new claims for carer's allowance from 2010. However, adult dependency increases already in payment at 2010 will continue until entitlement ends or until 2020, whichever is earlier. Only a small number of carers who claim carer's allowance from 2010 onwards are likely to be affected by the removal of adult dependency increases for new claims, because those in lower income households receiving either an income-related benefit or pension credit will be compensated in these benefits for the non-availability of the adult dependency increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.391W.5/1">Carer's allowance is not a &quot;carers' wage&quot;, therefore, the connection with the national minimum wage is not appropriate. It is an income-maintenance benefit for people who are not in full-time work and who regularly provide substantial care of at least 35 hours per week for a severely disabled person receiving either attendance allowance or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component. People receiving carer's allowance can have earnings, net of a range of expenses including the cost of alternative care for either the severely disabled person or a child under 16 years of age while the carer is at work, of up to the national insurance lower earnings limit, currently &pound;84 per week.</p>

	<p pid="a.393W.2/1">Under the current new child support scheme, any change in income of 5 per cent. will give rise to a recalculation in the liability for child support maintenance. This has led to the Child Support Agency facing a substantial workload of such reported changes. Therefore, as part of the redesign, it was decided that this threshold of 5 per cent. needed to be substantially increased. The issue was what the new figure should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.393W.2/2">Two main factors affect that decision, but they push in opposite directions. The first is the need to avoid too many recalculations of liability at the outset of an application (as these slow up the progress of cases from application to first payment and which argues for the figure to be high),</p>
	<p pid="a.393W.2/3">The second is the need to be fair to the parties, not making the figure either too high or too low, compared to current income (which argues for the figure to be low). Using plus or minus 25 per cent. in the Government's view takes appropriate account of both these factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.401W.11/4" class="indent">Processes: are being reviewed and, where appropriate, revised e.g. Jobcentre Plus is introducing a single call process for the majority of benefit customers from May 2007. Customers will access the service using an 0800 number and wherever possible have their application dealt with in one call, without the need for a call back and we are transforming our pension centres so customers can do their business in one call of 20 minutes, rather than taking two hours and several contacts;</p>

In that period we have also answered seven parliamentary questions, including this one, on this topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.402W.2/2">The higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance is designed for people who are physically unable, or virtually unable, to walk. It is also available to people who are both deaf and blind and require the assistance of another person to walk to any intended or required destination when out of doors, because their particular combination of disabilities means that they are, in effect, virtually unable to walk. In addition, visually impaired people who do not qualify for the higher rate mobility component can still qualify for the lower rate of the mobility component if they require guidance or supervision from another person when walking out of doors on unfamiliar routes.</p>

	<p pid="a.403W.6/2">The six primary care trusts in Cumbria and Lancashire are currently carrying out public consultation on the details of the local implementation of the clinical assessment and treatment and support (CATS) services in the two counties. The consultation covers the locations of the CATS sites, the impact on the wider health services, how the CATS can fit seamlessly into the pathway from general practitioner referrer through to local hospitals treatment, and whether the clinical specialties proposed (orthopaedics, rheumatology, ear nose and throat, general surgery, urology and gynaecology) are the most appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.6/3">The Queen Victoria site in Morecambe is one of nine potential sites currently under consideration for a CATS service. In total, it is likely that there will be eight CATS sites across the area.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.6/1">In October 2006, a number of procurement activities formerly managed by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency transferred to the NHS supply chain. The categories into which most of the items mentioned fall were part of that transfer. In addition, computer equipment is procured on behalf of government by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC).</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.6/2">Regarding the prices that are paid, these will vary according to whether or not a trust chooses to use NHS supply chain, or OGC frameworks, or to purchase goods and services directly from suppliers. There is no mandate to the national health service to use either service. Therefore it is not possible to calculate an established purchasing price given the number of purchasing points across the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.406W.6/3">However, I can provide the standard prices as set out by both NHS supply chain and the OGC for the items mentioned. Note that prices would reduce as quantities increased.</p>
