The figures provided in the Regulatory Impact Assessment would, however, suggest that under the Bill's proposals churches or other places of worship seeking to provide entertainment five times a year would pay #100 each year.

The Governor of the Falkland Islands was informed in advance of this unavoidable temporary gap in cover. APT(S) is only one element of the United Kingdom's maritime presence in the region. HMS Leeds Castle, the permanent Falkland Islands patrol vessel, is currently in Falkland Islands waters, and the ice patrol ship HMS Endurance is currently deployed to the South Atlantic region, which includes time spent in Falkland Islands waters.

	<p pid=".5W.5/1">The proposed NATO Response Force (NRF) was discussed by Defence Ministers at their informal meeting in Warsaw in late September and again at the NATO Summit in Prague last month. I have also discussed the NRF in bilateral meetings with NATO counterparts. The discussions focused on the need for a technologically advanced, flexible, deployable, interoperable and sustainable force, ready to move quickly to wherever needed. The NRF should also be a catalyst for improving the Alliance's military capabilities. At Prague, Heads of State and Government agreed to the creation of the NRF and work is now underway to take the concept forward within the Alliance. We expect that a report on the NRF will be submitted to Defence Ministers in June 2003 and that the NRF to have an initial operating capability no later than October 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.6/1">It is our policy that decommissioned nuclear submarines are not offered for sale. The four conventional Upholder Class submarines were taken out of active service with the Royal Navy in 1994, but were not decommissioned. The submarines were subsequently placed under a Custody, Care and Maintenance contract, which is now managed by BAE Systems, until agreement was reached with Canada in July 1998 for the lease with option to buy the four boats.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.6/2">In January 1999 a contract was signed between the DPA and now BAE Systems for the reactivation (refurbishment) of the submarines to a standard and to a level of safety acceptable to the Royal Navy. This included MOD safety certification with a safe to dive certificate for a period of not less than three and a half years for each boat.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.8/3">Specifically for the Royal Navy, the firefighters' dispute has caused some reductions in operational programmes, notably the removal of frigates from NATO's Standing Force Atlantic and from the South Atlantic, but other Royal Navy vessels and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary remain deployed in the Caribbean, the Gulf, the Far East, the Mediterranean and the North and South Atlantic.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.8/4">The throughput of vessels through operational sea training has been reduced as personnel have been withdrawn from ships. This means that there will be increased demand for training in 2003 as ships return to the operational cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.8/5">For the individual service person, the effects of the firefighters' dispute on training and deployment are interlinked. Some training is being disrupted with consequential effects on drafting, career progression and promotion. The Royal Navy is making appropriately trained personnel to the fleet. The effect on individuals will be minimised by giving them priority on future courses; and there are existing safeguards for those whose career progression may be adversely affected.</p>

This will contribute significantly to our ability to judge the potential benefits to the UK of possible participation in further US development of missile defences.

It updates the existing but ageing defence support programme (DSP) satellites and is needed irrespective of any decision on missile defence.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.8/1">The Skill Force scheme is now in its third year in secondary schools at its two original locations. A further nine locations are in their second year of piloting and this autumn we are putting Skill Force teams into a further 13 locations. This latest expansion is being taken forward jointly between the Ministry of Defence and Department of Education and Skills (DfES) as part of DfES's Behaviour Improvement Programme which, in turn, is part of the Government's Street Crime Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/2">Independent evaluation of the impact of this exciting scheme is an integral part of the approach we have taken to the piloting of Skill Force. This focuses on testing the scheme's achievement against the key objectives: reducing truancy; reducing exclusions; improving educational and vocational attainment; improving behaviour; and reducing the number of young people who are not in employment, education or training on completion of their mandatory schooling.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/3">The latest evaluation by the British Market Research Bureau reviews the original schemes in Newcastle Upon Tyne and West Norfolk and shows positive results. Attendance rates exceeded 90 per cent. among children who were otherwise expected to display sharply declining attendance through years 10 and 11; for many it would have been expected that declining attendance would have led eventually to exclusion. Exclusion levels have also reduced dramatically; only 13 participants were excluded, compared to 46 who were identified at being at risk of permanent exclusion. One Norfolk Head Teacher said:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/4" class="indent">XThere are youngsters that would have been excluded by now from school if it hadn't been for Skill Force. Some of them have got very challenging behaviours but there has been a noticeable improvement, there's also been a noticeable improvement in their attendance as well&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/5">Skill Force has been credited as the major factor in raising GCSE A*-C grades from 26 per cent. to 36 per cent. in one of the Newcastle Upon Tyne schools.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/6">In addition, over half of the parents interviewed have reported more positive behaviour and attitudes which they attribute directly to Skill Force.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/7">The report also indicated areas where further development of the Schemes could be undertaken and would be beneficial.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.8/8">A full copy of the British Market Research Bureau research has already been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.3/1">Such a decision would be very rare. Under the Access to Justice Act 1999, public funding (formerly called legal aid) is provided under the Community Legal Service (CLS) and the Criminal Defence Service (CDS). CLS funding, which covers civil proceedings, is only available for cases within the scope of the scheme subject to a statutory means test and funding assessment. Under the present system a person with an income of #90,000 per year would rarely qualify for civil public funding. It could be possible in cases involving public family law, such as care and supervision orders, child assessment orders, emergency child protection orders; and Mental Health Review Tribunals.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.3/2">Any individual charged with an offence and appearing before the courts can receive publicly funded representation without reference to their means where it is in the interests of justice for help to be granted. When the CDS was introduced in April 2001, the means test for criminal legal aid was abolished. It was replaced with a power for judges in the Crown Court to order a convicted defendant to pay some, or all, of the costs incurred in defending him, by way of a Recovery of Defence Costs Order.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.3/3">Thus a person with a high income might receive public assistance, but can be required to repay that support. Typically a court will exercise that power if the defendant is found guilty. A defendant found not guilty will almost certainly not have to repay legal aid costs. But this represents no effective change on the position before April 2001. It has always been, and remains, the case that a defendant found not guilty, who pays for his own defence, will almost certainly have the costs of his defence repaid by Government to the extent that such costs accord with legal aid rates.</p>

Thames Path and Ridgeway figures are combined due to joint management structures. This year the Ridgeway/Thames Path have received #203,705 via the Countryside Agency and #53,460 from highway authorities. This figure includes all maintenance costs and salaries.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.8/1">No funds have been allocated to the marketing and promotion of organic milk in the next five years. However, under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), funding is generally available for the marketing of quality agricultural produce, including organic, through the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), and for capital projects through the Processing and Marketing Grant (PMG). Under RES, farmers and others are able to propose projects for the marketing of any organic product.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.8/2">Non-capital grants are also available under the Agriculture Development Scheme. For all of these schemes, applications need to comply with scheme rules and each is considered on its merits in competition with others. State aid rules limit the extent that Government can support the promotion or advertising of agricultural produce. Previously, the organic milk sector also benefited under the Marketing Development Scheme (MDS), which is now closed to new applicants.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.8/3">During the life of the Organic Farming Scheme, which since April 1999 has assisted farmers to convert land to organic farming methods, but leaves them free to decide which enterprise to pursue, the following sums have been awarded to organic milk related projects under relevant schemes:</p>

	<p pid=".32W.6/1">The Department is concerned about fatigue-related road accidents and has an extensive programme of publicity and research aimed at reducing these.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/2">The Department has been using a variety of media to encourage drivers to plan their trips and to take suitable breaks on long journeys. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/3" class="indent">nine bursts of radio advertising since August 2000 at a total cost of #1,165,000,</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/4" class="indent">TV advertising in January, April, and August 2002 at a cost of #814,000,</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/5" class="indent">poster advertising in July and December 2000, and in February 2002 at a cost of</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/6" class="indent">#121,000,</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/7" class="indent">some two million advisory leaflets costing #17,000 have been printed and</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/8" class="indent">distributed, many at Motorway Service Areas.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/9">The total publicity spend in the current financial year on driver sleepiness has been #1.152 million, which is just over 8.4 per cent. of the publicity budget.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/10">Since January 2000, advertising agency AMV.BBDO has been responsible for the creative work for the campaigns. Media buying until July 2002 was contracted to PHD, and to Carat Ltd. since then.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/11">Quantitative tracking research demonstrates that awareness of the dangers of driving while tired has increased considerably. The costs of this are included in tracking all aspects of the Department's Think! Road Safety campaign, which is contracted to Taylor, Nelson, Sofres.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/12">Nearly 400 Variable Message Signs on Motorways were used during the 2002 Easter period to carry the 'Don't Drive Tired' message in support of TV advertising. Over half those questioned at Motorway Service Areas said they had assessed their tiredness after seeing the message and some 12 per cent. of those surveyed decided to take a break as a result. The Variable Message Signs will continue to be used for this purpose over the coming year. The cost to the Highways Agency was some #40,000. Molt MacDonald (Consultants) were the project managers, SSL Ltd. and D.S. &amp; S. Ltd. dealt with software changes and the Agency's routine maintenance contractors undertook the software installation. MVA Consultancy Ltd. surveyed drivers.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/13">Advice on how to avoid and combat driver tiredness is in The Highway Code and on the DfTs road safety website at X<a href="http://www.think.dft.gov.uk">www.think.dft.gov.uk</a>&quot;. We will continue to warn drivers of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/14">The Department has also undertaken considerable research to study driver sleepiness. The university of Loughborough Sleep Research Laboratory was contracted to carry out a series of road audits into sleep-related vehicle accidents on sections of selected trunk roads and motorways in the UK. The results were published in February 2001 in Road Safety Research Reports No. 21 and 22, available on-line at X<a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/index.htm">www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/index.htm</a>&quot;. The cost was #268,000. This contract has been extended and requires the Loughborough Laboratory to undertake six more audits. The cost is expected to be #120,000 and the report is due to be submitted in May 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/15">Loughborough Sleep Research Laboratory have also been contracted to produce the following reports:</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/16" class="indent">XOver the counter medicines and the potential for unwanted sleepiness in drivers. A review&quot;. The report was published in February 2001 as Road Safety Research Report No 24 and is available on-line as above. The cost was #5,000.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/17" class="indent">XA survey of Public Education Literature regarding Driver Sleepiness&quot;. The report</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/18" class="indent">was published in February 2001 and is available on-line at X<a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/sleepiness/index.htm">www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/sleepiness/index.htm</a>&quot;. The cost was #5,000.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/19" class="indent">On-going research, scheduled for completion during December 2002, into Xthe</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/20" class="indent">interactions between sleepiness and moderate alcohol intake&quot;. The cost is expected to be #198,000.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.6/21">A new research contract is being prepared to study XThe Effectiveness of Motorway Service Areas in reducing fatigue-related accidents&quot;. This is scheduled to start in January 2003 and last one year.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.0/1">There are a wide range of Intelligent Traffic Control systems used by both the Highways Agency and local authorities. The Department, through the Highways Agency, has supported the development of these systems on the motorway and trunk road network. Most of the local authority schemes are funded through Local Transport Plan settlements. Specific initiatives to support this include:</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/2" class="indent">ITS Assist&mdash;helping and encouraging local authorities to use new information and communication technology, including traffic control, in their plans;</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/3" class="indent">Clear Zones&mdash;encouraging innovative planning and use of technology, including for traffic management, to minimise the impacts of traffic in towns;</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/4" class="indent">Research&mdash;into traffic control systems and techniques for networks and isolated signalled junction and pedestrian crossings; and</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/5" class="indent">UTMC&mdash;The Urban Traffic Management and Control (UTMC) programme was devised by the Department to provide the framework to support efficient and effective network management in towns and cities. This concept is being developed and taken forward primarily through a five-year, #6 million research programme.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/6" class="indent">As part of this, four demonstration projects were started in September 2000 and are due to complete in 2003. These are in Reading, Preston, Stratford-upon-Avon and York. The Department has contributed #1.7 million to these demonstration projects.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/7" class="indent">A structure for evaluation of the projects has been agreed with the local authorities, reflecting their transport and environmental objectives, including impacts on congestion. As the projects are not complete, assessments cannot yet be made, but will be reported when the projects conclude.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.0/8">I have arranged for copies of leaflets describing the above initiatives to be sent to the hon. Member and also placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.3/1">The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a key role in the international Quality Shipping Campaign, which is designed to rid the seas of substandard shipping. Progress is being made, not least in terms of the growing acceptance that there is a real need for more effective and consistent implementation of convention requirements by owners and flag States, reinforced through targeted Port State Control. But there is still a long way to go before we achieve the Campaign's objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.3/2">One tangible initiative to arise from the Campaign has been the setting up of the EQUASIS database. This provides the industry with freely accessible safety-related information on the quality of the world's merchant fleet, answering calls for greater transparency. Charterers can no longer justifiably claim ignorance as an excuse for engaging in business with substandard ships.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.6/1">I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mr. Tim Matthews to Mr. Paul Marsden dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent question about the safety of the junction between the A5 and the B4380 at Montford Bridge.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/4" class="indent">The Highways Agency shares the concerns of local people about the accidents that have occurred at this junction and we have instructed our Managing Agent for the A5, as a matter of urgency, to explore what measures might be used to improve safety in the short term.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/5" class="indent">Montford Bridge was identified as a junction where safety is an issue in a Road Based Study completed in May. The study was commissioned by the Government Office for the West Midlands with the objective of making recommendations for addressing safety and congestion problems on the route between Shrewsbury and Chester. One of its recommendations is that a Route Management Strategy should be undertaken to support delivery of improvements to specific trouble spots, such as Montford Bridge.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/6" class="indent">The Highways Agency, jointly with the National Assembly for Wales, have commissioned the Route Management Strategy study which is designed to develop a three year Action Plan and a ten year Route Management Plan for the A5/A483. It will further analyse the accident locations identified in the Road Based Study, including Montford Bridge, to suggest solutions and recommend priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful; we will ensure that you are kept informed of developments on all these fronts. If you would like more information, the Agency's Route Sponsor for this part of the A5, Liz Talbot, would be pleased to help. She can be contacted at jour offices at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8746.</p>

The use of trenchless techniques can help reduce this disruption, although there will be many occasions when&mdash;for technical reasons&mdash;these will not be suitable. My Department has recently set up a working party, involving representatives of local authorities and utility companies, to look at ways in which greater use can be made of trenchless techniques when works are carried out in the street.</p>

	<p pid=".42W.5/1">Most of the vehicles that are not the subject of a European or National type approval are subject to The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001. Those regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase> that year and replaced the Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 1996 as amended. The regulations prescribe the technical standards the vehicle must meet before it can be licensed and registered for use on public roads. Compliance is determined by individual inspection of the vehicle. The main change was to replace the earlier single-tier set of technical standards with a two-tier system. The first tier&mdash;standard Single Vehicle Approval&mdash;set technical standards appropriate for vehicles entering service in very low numbers, such as amateur builds. The second tier&mdash;Enhanced Single Vehicle Approval (ESVA)&mdash;applied higher standards for vehicles being sold or entering service in competition with the mainstream supply of mass-produced cars and light goods vehicles in Britain. ESVA is much closer to the European or British type-approval standards for key safety, environmental and anti-theft items required of the mainstream manufacturers. It thus ensures a consistent level of consumer protection relative to the numbers of vehicles involved.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.3/1">The Chief Constable has advised me that in situations where it may be necessary to deploy personnel with baton guns other than public disorder, the preferred option of the PSNI is to deploy Tactical Firearms Teams. Officers within such teams who are trained in the use of the baton gun will, in addition to the initial three-day classification course in respect of the weapon, receive an additional 16 hours of training in the tactical use of the baton gun.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/2">With regard to the minimum distance in relation to baton round discharge I would refer my hon. Friend to the written reply of the Minister for Policing, Crime Reduction and Community Safety on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-06">6 November 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-11-06.312W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 312W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/3">In situations other than public order situations authorisation to deploy Tactical Firearms Teams to carry baton guns lies with an officer of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable. Authority to deploy the baton gun lies with the senior officer in charge of the non-public order incident. The actual firing of the weapon (if such is felt justified) is self-authorised by the individual officer provided that the officer is satisfied that to do so is both lawful and proportionate in the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.3/4">The firing of a baton gun whether in non-public order or in public order circumstances is classified as the discharge of a firearm. All discharges of firearms by the PSNI are subject to immediate report to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland for investigation. In addition, when a baton round is discharged a report is sent to the Policing Board for information.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.6/2">I understand that the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland does make inquiries of local hospitals after the discharge of rounds by the PSNI. The purpose of such inquiries is to establish whether anyone has suffered injury which may be attributable to a baton round and also to facilitate any necessary evidence gathering. The research report that the ombudsman published in May 2002 summarised the findings of seven reports : 86 per cent. of the 28 rounds that struck persons were observed to have struck the person's legs. While patient confidentiality is an important factor, the ombudsman is looking at ways that might facilitate inquiries.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.6/3">benefits for that period.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.6/5">These arrangements were unsuccessfully challenged by way of judicial review and petition to the House of Lords. Significantly, in the judicial review judgement from the Court of Appeal in 1997, the decision to backdate at all was considered very much an act of grace on the part of the Secretary of State. All aspects were given full and detailed consideration at that time, and there are no plans for a further review.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.7/1">My Department continues to make a significant contribution to combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In our bilateral programmes alone, expenditure on HIV/AIDS related work has increased from #38 million in 1997&ndash;98 to over #200 million in 2001&ndash;02. Major new investments include support for programmes in Nigeria, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Russia, and Ghana, China and India totalling over #350 million. We have also pledged US$200 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and #30 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Medical Research Council's Microbicides Development Programme. Considerable additional resources have also been committed to United Nations agencies and civil society organisations to help combat HIV/AIDS and to help people living with the disease across the developing world. We will continue to support health system strengthening and comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, care, control and mitigation programmes. We are also supporting access to medicines, including for HIV/AIDS. The approach of the recently launched High Level Working Group on Access to Medicines Report is to facilitate widespread voluntary differential pricing of essential medicines for the poorer developing countries as the operational norm.</p>

Cholera is reported in Congo most years. This year DRC reports the third highest number of cases, and the highest death rate from the disease. The surveillance committee (Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and Health Net International) which was established to control the outbreak has set up five cholera centres and is reinforcing surveillance and community health activities.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.0/2">Unfortunately it is not only cholera that is a problem in DRC. Almost all indicators demonstrate evidence of an appalling health situation. DFID does not directly support any cholera interventions. However a significant part of our humanitarian programme is aimed at improving general health. Specific projects deliver improved water and sanitation to poor urban communities. Other support provided through the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross is not earmarked and can also be used for such work.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.8/1">The Department of Trade and Industry has made available #30 million to the RDAs and Devolved Administrations for pilot projects to extend broadband access. Several of the recipients have used this fund to enable small businesses to access broadband via satellite technology. For example, the South West Development Agency, East Midlands, Development Agency, East of England Development Agency and Advantage West Midlands are collaborating in the Remote Area Broadband Inclusion Trials (RABIT) programme to trial alternative broadband Internet access to small businesses in rural areas using wireless and satellite. The scheme has been operating since September 2002. Some #700 is made available to each company. By the beginning of December, 264 applications had been approved, of which 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. involve satellite trials. About 1,800 to 2,000 companies are expected to participate in the programme to December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.2/1">The Government have acted on specific commitments in the Edinburgh Commonwealth Economic Declaration of 1997 by vigorously supporting: the EU's stance on multilateral liberalisation, notably through the launch of the WTO Round at Doha; the full opening of the EU's market to the least developed countries, 14 of whom are in the Commonwealth; the launch and work programme of the Commonwealth Business Council, whose task is to promote Commonwealth trade and investment. DTI Ministers have also encouraged effective Commonwealth networking on trade through informal discussions with their counterparts and in an ongoing series of seminars with High Commissions in London.

	<p pid=".67W.5/1">I attach considerable importance to the health and efficiency of the UK construction industry. Construction represents 8 per cent. of GDP and employs almost two million people. Construction is central to the delivery and maintenance of the national infrastructure and therefore to all our public service, including health care, transportation, housing and education. The Government's Rethinking Construction initiative aims to work with the industry improve its productivity and competitiveness by addressing issues such as the efficiency of processes and the quality of the end product.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.6/1">The following schemes and initiatives are sponsored by my Department in partnership with other funding bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/2" class="italic">Space for Sports and Arts Programme (SSA)</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/3">Space for Sports and Arts Programme (SSA) is a partnership between traditional public expenditure of #75 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund and #55 million from the three lottery distributors: New Opportunities Fund (#25 million), Sport England (#25 million) and Arts Council of England (#5 million).</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/4">The SSA programme is being rolled out in 65 local authorities in deprived areas. The budget for the programme is #130 million from the beginning of 2000 to March 2004, which is the life of the programme. Approximately 297 projects are planned in the 65 local authorities. The Local Education Authorities (LEAs) invited to bid were:</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/5">Barking and Dagenham, Barnsley, Bedfordshire, Birmingham, Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Brent, Brighton &amp; Hove, Bristol, City of Nottingham, Cornwall, Cumbria, Derby City, Derbyshire, Doncaster, Durham, East Sussex, Essex, Gateshead, Greenwich, Hackney, Hartlepool, Islington, Kent, Kingston-upon-Hull, Knowsley, Lambeth, Lancashire, Leeds, Leicester City, Lewisham, Liverpool, Luton, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Newham, Norfolk, North Somerset, Northamptonshire, Northumberland, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Redcar and Cleveland, Rochdale, Rotherham, Salford, Sandwell, Sheffield, Slough, Somerset, South Tyneside, Southwark, St. Helens, Stockton-on-Tees, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Tower Hamlets, Trafford, Walsall, Wirral, Wolverhampton.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/6" class="italic">Portable Antiquities Scheme</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/7">The Portable Antiquities Scheme was established in 1997 to encourage members of the public to report all finds of archaeological objects. Since autumn 1997 DCMS has been funding six pilot schemes to promote voluntary reporting of all archaeological finds. These pilots were established in Kent, Norfolk, North Lincolnshire, North West (Cheshire, Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Cumbria), West Midlands and Yorks. A further six pilots have been funded for three years by Heritage lottery fund since spring 1999. These pilots were established in Dorset &amp; Somerset, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Wales, and in London.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/8">A bid for a three-year funding for a national network of 41 posts at a cost of #1.5 million a year from April 2003 was approved by the Heritage lottery fund in May. This bid has 63 national and local partners, each of whom is contributing 10 per cent. towards the cost. In 2002&ndash;03 the Department is providing #411,000 to support the current pilot schemes until the new funding comes on line. The following schemes and initiatives are by public bodies sponsored by DCMS. These are not the subject of national roll out.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/9" class="italic">Splash Extra</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/10">This was a joint DCMS/Youth Justice Board programme of summer activities targeted on those 9&ndash;17 year olds identified as most at risk of offending in the areas covered across Government. A list of those areas has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Resourced by the New Opportunities Fund and providing almost 300 estate-based schemes across England, Splash Extra established a menu of high quality sports, arts and personal development activities.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.6/12" class="italic">Creative Partnerships</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/13">This initiative is to develop long-term partnerships between schools, cultural and creative organisations and artists. The partnerships will help children develop their own creativity, which should bring benefits in terms of educational attainment. The partnerships are being developed in 16 areas (listed below) across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/14">The Arts Council of England is delivering the initiative and the budget for 2002&ndash;03 is #15 million.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.6/36">Under the Local Government Act 1985, English Heritage is able to offer grants for the repairs of Grade II listed buildings within the Greater London area. The scheme is concentrated on those buildings included on the English Heritage Register of Buildings at Risk, and projects which make a strategic contribution to the conservation of historic buildings, areas, gardens, landscapes or archaeology within Greater London. In 2001/02 English Heritage offered a total of #175,000 under the scheme. <i>Access Radio</i></p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/37">The Radio Authority is currently running a pilot study of 15 access radio projects across the UK. These are in Glasgow, Belfast, Banbridge, Bradford, Manchester, Stoke on Trent, Nottingham, Leicester, Birmingham, Forest of Dean, Pontypridd, Havant, Southall (London), Hackney (London), South Bank (London). The projects will be subject to an independent evaluation which will assist the Government in deciding whether to introduce access radio on a national basis. The full extent of coverage will depend on a number of factors such as local spectrum availability and the local radio ecology. None of these pilots have received funding from either the Department or the Radio Authority<i>.</i></p>

	<p pid=".80W.11/2">The Government do not set a target for increases in council tax receipts. Council tax rates are a matter for local authorities to set in consultation with their electorates. In line with this the Government do not operate a system of crude and universal pre-announced capping. The Government's approach was laid out in a note to the Treasury Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-19">19 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.11/3">The 2002 Spending Review gave local government a substantial three year grant increase, amounting to an average real increase of 3.9 per cent. per annum. This should allow authorities to deliver high quality public services without excessive council tax increases.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.11/4">As in previous years the figure for council tax receipts presented in the pre-Budget report is for the United Kingdom as a whole; projections for future years are based on assumptions about changes in the council tax rate, the taxbase, the collection rate and council tax benefit payments.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/2">It is inevitably much more difficult to judge whether or not an on-trend point occurs when output hovers close to trend as it did in mid-1999 than when output clearly passes through trend. As paragraph A37 of the Pre-Budget Report states:</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/3" class="indent">XThere is still some doubt about whether the economy was on trend in mid-1999 or just close to trend, so the judgement that the present cycle started in mid-1999 remains provisional. The data and methodology for estimating on-trend points and dating cycles are kept under review. But whether the current cycle started in 1997 or 1999 does not affect the judgement that the Government remains firmly on track to meet the fiscal rules over the cycle: the average current surplus since both 1997&ndash;98 and 1999&ndash;2000 is positive in every year of the projection period.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/4">Only future GDP revisions could change the current judgement that the present cycle started in mid-1999.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.2/1">Under the terms of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the FSA is obliged to produce an annual report assessing performance against its statutory objectives of maintaining confidence in the financial system, promoting public understanding of the financial system, securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers and reducing the potential for financial firms to be used for financial crime. This is the primary mechanism for holding the FSA accountable to Ministers and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.2/2">In August 2001 the Government announced an independent inquiry under Lord Penrose into the events surrounding Equitable Life. The terms of reference of the Inquiry, which covers events going back over 50 years, include the need to identify any lessons to be learnt for the conduct, administration and regulation of life assurance business. The Government looks forward to receiving Lord Penrose's report as soon as he is able to complete it. In addition, the Government published a report by the Financial Services Authority in October 2001 which reviewed the regulation of Equitable Life from <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-08">8 December 2000</phrase> and which has been submitted as evidence to the inquiry conducted by Lord Penrose.</p>

Where weaknesses are identified in the provision made for children with autism, the Guidance is available to schools and local education authorities to provide pointers to improvement.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.3/2">We are making a #1.2 billion investment to increase expenditure in FE over the next three years. That is equivalent to a 19 per cent. real terms increase. Colleges will use this investment to increase participation in learning and to improve student outcomes. They will be able to raise standards of teaching and learning, improve the capability of the workforce and become more responsive to the demands of both employers and students. Importantly, they will also have the flexibility to use the resource to meet specific local or subject recruitment needs.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.3/3">We will continue to fund a range of recruitment and retention initiatives to attract new FE teachers into the profession. These include teaching bursaries for people undertaking post graduate certificates of education and certificates of education to enter FE and golden hellos and the repayment of teacher loans for new teachers in identified shortage subject areas. Although Xcraft&quot; subjects are not a priority for golden hellos or the repayment of teacher loans, we are keeping the list of shortage subjects under review.</p>

Section 76 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 allows the Privy Council to specify any institution offering higher education as competent to grant degrees. There is no legislation preventing private organisations from applying for degree awarding powers. I have received no representations about allowing private organisations to award degrees. However, the Privy Council has received two applications from private organisations for degree awarding powers. These are currently being considered by the Quality Assurance Agency through the normal process of scrutiny for such powers.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.2/1">We have greatly increased the financial support available to mature students. Nearly a quarter of a billion pounds is now spent on support for students with particular financial needs, including mature students, compared to #124 million five years ago. In the academic year 2002&ndash;03, in addition to means tested student loans (up to #4,815 in London, #3,905 elsewhere), and tuition fee grants (up to #1,100), full-time mature students can apply for dependants grants (up to #2,225 for an adult or otherwise for an eldest child, more for additional children), an additional dependants grant (#255), child care grant (up to #8,480 for two or more children), school meals grant (up to #275 per child) and travel, books and equipment grant (#510). They can also apply for discretionary support through their HE institution, in the form of #500 access bursaries, hardship funds and hardship loans. A single parent with two children in receipt of the full student loan and maximum child care grant could receive about #15,800 each year, plus discretionary support.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/2">Part-time HE students studying on at least 50 per cent. (or more) of a full-time equivalent course are eligible for means tested fee waivers, student loans of #500 and discretionary help from the hardship funds. There are also generous non means-tested allowances for both full-time and part-time disabled students.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/3">These arrangements are generous but overly complicated. From 2003&ndash;04 they will be simplified. A new grant (the Parents Learning Allowance worth up to #1,300) will replace the access bursary, the additional dependants grant and the travel, books and equipment grant and child dependants grant and school meals grant will be replaced by child tax credits and passported free school meals from the Inland Revenue. From 2004&ndash;05, hardship funds and loans will be replaced by grants from a new Access to Learning Fund. These streamlined arrangements will in some cases provide students with more help than they currently receive.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.2/2">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is responsible for determining the allocation of grants to higher education institutions. In general, the HEFCE fund similar courses at similar rates irrespective of which higher education institution is providing the course. However, in the case of specialist institutions, additional funding is provided to reflect the nature of the institution and the characteristics of the courses provided. Guidance on the general funding methodology for specialist institutions was published in HEFCE circular 98/10 following advice from the Specialist Institutions Advisory Panel. Criteria for the funding of specialist performing arts institutions were published in HEFCE circular 99/41 and were based on detailed analysis of the costs and characteristics of the provision. The council does not distinguish between the different art forms in its funding methodology, and the amount of additional funding for these institutions varies according to how closely they meet the criteria set out in the guidance. HEFCE have also made public criteria for the funding of very high cost institutions specialising in music, dance and drama. The supplementary funding for specialist institutions is kept under review to ensure that the levels remain appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.2/2">Decisions on whether to close schools are taken by the local School Organisation Committee or, if the committee cannot agree unanimously, by the independent Schools Adjudicator. Guidance issued by the Secretary of State requires both bodies to consider a range of factors in making their decision. For school closures, the factors include the effect on standards of educational provision, the need to preserve access to a local school for rural communities and access to community facilities, particularly in areas of social deprivation. The Department has not commissioned any research into the impact of school closures. However, where a failing school is closed, it is usual for the former pupils to show greatly increased attainment or better rates of progress at their new schools.</p>

This data relates to all school leavers from the 2000&ndash;2001 academic year. It has not been possible to match the data exactly to the coalfield areas; data is collected by Education Authority and has been aggregated to provide the closest match possible. Details of areas included are given in the footnote to the table.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.5/2">Surplus places can represent poor use of resources. This is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sets annual Best Value Performance Indicators for the percentage of surplus places in an LEA each year. Decisions on whether to close schools are taken by the local School Organisation Committee or, if the Committee cannot agree unanimously, by the independent Schools Adjudicator. Guidance issued by the Secretary of State requires both bodies to consider a range of factors, including standards and access.</p>

While resources devoted to maintaining surplus school places can sometimes be more effectively used to support schools in raising standards, we recognise that in some cases it may not be possible to remove all surplus places due to demographic changes and falling rolls.</p>

The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education for the first time from either sixth forms or FE colleges, are given in the table. There was an increase in the index in 1997&ndash;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&ndash;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&ndash;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&ndash;2000. Between 1997&ndash;98 and 2000&ndash;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.2/1">Clearsprings Management Ltd has a contract with the National Asylum Support Services (MASS) to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers. The contract is due to expire in March 2005. I am unable to give details about payments to Clearsprings under the terms of this contract since this information is commercial in confidence. Clearsprings Management Ltd is required to operate within the conditions of their contract with NASS. All properties supplied under contract must comply with all planning and other regulations set by the relevant local authority. NASS is responsible for monitoring the performance of Clearsprings Management Ltd. In particular all properties supplied by the company under contract to NASS will be inspected to ensure they meet the specification laid down in the contract. The contract also includes performance measures which the company is expected to show that it is meeting. NASS can impose financial penalties if either a property is shown to have defects or the company is not meeting its performance targets. I am not aware of any major problems with accommodation provided by Clearsprings Management Ltd. The company is meeting the terms of its contract with NASS and any problems with their accommodation are rectified within agreed timescales.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.2/2">With regard to family configuration, a three-year study, jointly funded by the Home Office and the University of Birmingham, looked at the issue of repeated abuse during childhood (Hamilton and Browne, 2000). The index sample consisted of 400 children referred to police child protection units. The vast majority (91 per cent.) lived with their biological mother, 44 per cent. with their biological father and 39 per cent. with both natural parents. However, the study did not indicate the marital status of the relationship or the presence of a step-parent.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.8/2">Final decisions have not yet been made about when the sentencing reforms in the Criminal Justice Bill&mdash;including custody plus&mdash;will be implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.8/3">In modelling the potential impact of the new sentences, it has been assumed that the number of offenders receiving custody plus under the new framework will be broadly similar to the numbers of offenders sentenced to imprisonment of under 12 months now but that a small number of those offenders currently receiving sentences of under 12 months would receive sentences of over 12 months in the new framework, while some would receive community sentences. In addition we have assumed that a quarter of those currently receiving sentences of between one and three months would receive custody minus. The Government will encourage sentencers to use penalties other than custody wherever appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.8/14">The current drop-out rate for non-compliance at 39 per cent. is not unexpectedly high. The DTTO is a tough and demanding community sentence that is aimed at serious problem drug misusers who commit crime to fund their habit. It was expected, given the intensity of the order, that a number of offenders would fail to last the course. The evidence suggests that for those who complete the order, their reduced levels of crime and drugs misuse are largely sustained over time.</p>

In doing this we work closely with other European Union (EU) countries in preventing drugs from entering both the EU and the UK.

	<p pid=".116W.5/2">Prison Service Order 3550 introduced a new Prison Service Standard for Clinical Services for Substance Misusers. This already provides that, as new evidence becomes available on the chemical management of detoxification or abstinence, establishments should develop further treatment guidelines which are in line with those available in the national health service (NHS).</p>

	<p pid=".117W.2/1">The criminal law is a devolved matter for Scotland and recent proposals for changes to the law in England and Wales are different from those in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/2">For offences committed in Scotland, the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will increase the maximum penalties available to the courts to 10 years for taking and distributing indecent images of children and to five years for possession, (which are both offences under-the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982). The Bill will also implement certain of the recommendations arising out of the recent report of the Expert Panel on Sex Offending, chaired by Lady Cosgrove. The Executive is committed to tackling all forms of child abuse and keeps this area of the law under review.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/3">In England and Wales, recent proposals in the Government command paper XProtecting the Public&quot; outlined our plans for comprehensive legislative reform of sex offences. Protection for children will be strengthened by proposed new offences of unlawful adult sexual activity with a child, familial sexual abuse of a child, sexual grooming and commercial sexual exploitation of a child, alongside the non-consensual offences of rape and sexual assault, among others. The proposed penalties for these offences, which in many cases are higher than penalties for existing offences, will clearly demonstrate the abhorrence with which society views sexual activity with children. Legislation to implement these proposals is planned for the New Year.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/4">In answer to your second point, the Sex Offenders Act 1997, which applies to the whole of the UK, places requirements on sex offenders who have been cautioned, convicted or found guilty by reason of insanity in respect of sex offences against children and other serious sex offences. Offenders convicted of a relevant offence must report to a police station prescribed by regulations within three days of the date of their conviction, caution etc. or their release from prison, and notify the police of their name (and any aliases), home address and date of birth. They are also required to notify any changes to their details within 14 days. Failure to comply is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/5">The Sex Offenders Act applies to sex offenders cautioned, convicted or found guilty by reason of insanity after 1997. Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, when the police consider that a sex offender has behaved in a way that gives reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him, they can apply to a court for a Sex Offender Order to be made. The order will place restrictions upon his behaviour and activities and requires the offender to 'register' with the police for the duration of the order. An order lasts a minimum of five years and can be indefinite.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/6">In the event that a child is abducted, the Government welcomes the pilot scheme based on the Amber Alert system used by some states in America, to try and ensure the safe return of the child. It was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> and is known as 'Child Rescue&mdash;Sussex Police'. It involves a joint effort by police, the media and the public. Its intention is to notify the general public that a child has been taken, so they look out for the child, the abductor or any vehicle used in the abduction. They then report any relevant information to the police.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/7">Decisions on taking prosecutions against internet service providers are a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. An internet service provider (ISP) which knows of the presence of an indecent image of a child on their system and does not remove or disable access to it expeditiously on becoming aware of it, would be at risk of prosecution under the Protection of Children Act 1978. The internet industry funds the Internet Watch Foundation to assess images which have been referred to it and notify ISPs and the police of those that are illegal. The Foundation also provides its members with a list of newsgroups which should not be carried because they contain or appear to offer indecent images of children. These arrangements apply across the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/8">Operational decisions on allocation of police resources to combating child exploitation rest with police authorities and chief officers and no central records exist to determine how many cases have been investigated or the resources allocated to them. The new National Policing Plan reinforces the recommendation in the Joint Chief Inspectors' Report on Arrangements to Safeguard Children that police forces and authorities should review the role, remit, location and status of child protection units to ensure that child protection is dealt with to a consistently high standard. We have also set up a National High Tech Crime Unit within the National Crime Squad to provide additional support to local forces in investigating the most technically sophisticated crimes, including internet child protection. As well as policing resources we have worked with industry and child protection organisations through our Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet to tackle this issue, for example producing Codes of Practice and running public awareness campaigns targeting children and their parents.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/9">Combating the exploitation of children by offenders who use the internet to facilitate the abuse, is an integral part of the work of the police in tackling child sexual exploitation. The Government have provided specific resources for the National High Tech Crime Unit but this is not broken down across the different areas of their work.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.5/2">There has already been considerable progress towards the co-location of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in criminal justice units. Our aim is that all criminal justice areas should have co-located units by April 2004. Such co-location means improvements to the way in which cases are prepared for court, and have led to good working relationships; in which advice can be sought quickly on more difficult cases, and have also resulted in considerable savings in casefile preparation. Such a set-up will also support the new arrangements in which the CPS take over from the police responsibility for charging. The evidence of piloting these arrangements is that there are improved working relationships between the police and the CPS and more focused investigations. Ready access to legal advice and improved understanding means that cases, which previously would not have resulted in a charge, will now be taken to court. The outcome is fewer discontinued cases and earlier guilty pleas. The Criminal Justice Bill contains provision to put these arrangements on a statutory basis.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.2/1">The Court upheld and endorsed the Prison Service's policy in relation to juveniles in custody. One sentence in its policy, which was to be changed regardless of the outcome of the judgment, has been found to be wrong. This will now be changed in the context of the judgment. There is undoubtedly a need for more consistency in the provision for young people across the prison estate and work is under way to ensure that this happens. There has been considerable investment across the juvenile estate and resources have been put into all establishments; however, these funds must be allocated according to specific needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.2/2">The Prison Service has already in place a Child Protection Protocol through which Governors have been required to introduce arrangements to protect children from significant harm, in line with its wish to reflect the principles of the Children Act 1989 and safeguard the welfare of those in its custody. The Court's judgment has found that it is for local authorities to co-operate with the Prison Service in carrying out their duties, subject to the necessary requirements of imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid=".130W.9/1">As a result of the offer set out in the Fire Brigades Employer Circular of the <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase> the local government employers estimate that all firefighters, wholetime and retained, would have received an increase of 4 per cent. in November 2002. This would have been followed by an increase in the pay bill of 7 per cent. in November 2003, although the amount firefighters actually received would have depended on how much of the pay bill increase was used to reward some staff, for example, with special allowances. Due to changes in their allowances retained firefighters would have typically received 6.4 per cent. more than wholetime firefighters under the arrangements proposed.</p>

The commission made some small but constructive suggestions for the wording of the preamble, which the Government will consider carefully and respond to in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends that regions that do not have a referendum on establishing an elected assembly in the first instance should have another opportunity at a later date. In regions where a referendum results in a Xno&quot; vote, the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Bill provides that a further referendum can be held after a period of at least five years has passed starting from the day on which the referendum was held.</p>

Our XLiving Places: cleaner, safer, greener'' report published in October 2002 stated that, by April 2003, all Regional Development Agencies will be expected to have a Design Champion in place to help them achieve their objective to promote excellence in urban design. By April 2004 the Government would like to see all major agencies and non-departmental bodies follow suit. Copies of this document are available in Libraries of the House .</p>

	<p pid=".135W.5/2">The main informal barriers relate to such problems as language or culture and are therefore not readily solved. However, the UK Government take up individual cases where any barriers seem to be unreasonable, and intervenes where appropriate when cases come before the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/3">The Department has worked with the European Commission to help produce their communication of <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-28">28 February 2001</phrase> on XNew European Labour Markets, Open to All with Access for All&quot; and have contributed to the subsequent House of Lords Select Committee investigation. We will continue to look to improve our understanding of this issue so that we can raise the employment opportunities available to all UK jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/4">Free movement of people is one of the four freedoms within the internal market of the European Union. Within the free movement title of the EC Treaty, Article 39 states that free movement of workers Xshall be secured within the Community&quot;. This means that workers of the member states are free to accept offers of employment actually made in another member state, and to remain in another member state for the purposes of carrying out employment. However, Article 39 does not apply to employment in the public service.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/5">The main EU regulation giving effect to free movement rights for workers of EU member states is EEC Regulation 1612/68. This guarantees migrant workers equality of treatment with nationals of the host country in respect of:</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/6" class="indent">The right to take up an activity as an employed person;</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/7" class="indent">The right to negotiate and conclude an employment contract;</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/8" class="indent">Full and free access to the host country labour market;</p>

	<p pid=".135W.5/12" class="indent">Membership of trade unions and the exercise of rights attaching thereto;</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/13" class="indent">Housing; and</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/14" class="indent">Access of children to education and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/15">The regulation guarantees, subject to certain conditions, the right of the migrant worker's family to live in the host country.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/16">Nevertheless, provided they fulfil their obligations under EU legislation, member states can and do place restrictions on the free movement rights of EU citizens. In particular, Article 39(3) of the EC Treaty allows member states in some circumstances to restrict the movement and residence of workers on the grounds of Xpublic policy, public security or public health&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.2/2">In March 2002, new guidance on the treatment of councillors' allowances was issued to decision makers. This simplifies procedures by allowing the averaging and estimation of expenses, thereby reducing the need for a weekly calculation.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions will be writing to customers in Great Britain over the next two years when it is their turn to change to direct payment into an account. Customers will be provided with information (including letters and leaflets) which clearly sets out the different types of accounts and enables them to choose the account that best meets their needs and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/2">Customers who wish to open a post office card account will need to contact the Department to discuss their account options with an adviser. They will then be issued with a personal invitation document. This document should then be taken to a post office branch where the customer will be given a post office card account application form to complete.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.5/3">Overall the process of applying for a post office card account is already straightforward and no more onerous than that of applying for a basic (or other) bank account.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.6/1">According to information provided by industry, the list of permitted nutrients included in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive excludes six nutrients (six minerals) and some 270 individual nutrient sources used in food supplements currently on the United Kingdom food supplements market. The costs of producing dossiers will largely depend upon the amount of new safety data that needs to be gathered, and will vary between individual cases.</p>

It concluded that the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures to radio waves below national and international guidelines do not cause adverse health effects to the general population.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.3/3">The expert group also proposed that gaps in knowledge were sufficient to justify a precautionary approach to the development of this technology and made recommendations for further research. A comprehensive research programme has now been established in this country under an independent programme management committee (PMC). Out of more than 120 submitted applications the PMC has approved 1 5 research proposals to date. This research includes studies of the effects of radio waves on cells and studies of the incidence of leukaemia and other cancers in populations. Information can be found on the mobile telecommunications and health research web site (<a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>).

The increase in nurse numbers will enable the recruitment of additional cancer-site specific nurse specialists, chemotherapy nurses, district nurses, palliative care nurse specialists and additional nurses on wards caring for cancer patients.</p>

	<p pid=".153W.9/1">The law governing assault is the same for adults and children, except only in respect of the Xreasonable chastisement&quot; defence of the physical punishment of children. Use of this defence is now governed by the outcome of the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the case of A.<i> v.</i> United Kingdom, which was heard on appeal from the domestic courts. Since the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in the UK in October 2000, the Courts have been obliged to take note of the outcome of the European Court of Human Rights ruling. Following the A. <i>v.</i> UK case, certain factors must be taken into account by the Courts when considering whether a punishment may be described as reasonable chastisement. These factors include the nature and duration of punishment, its physical and mental effects and the state of health and age of the child. The Government believe that parents have the right to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to use physical punishment in bringing up their children. The law is therefore formulated to allow them to make that choice, while affording protection for children against unacceptable forms of physical punishment.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.2/1">The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing in children in England. No exact figures on how many children are obese are available, although analyses of the Health Survey for England (1999) showed the prevalence of obesity was 10 per cent., at age six rising to 17 per cent., at age 15. There are also no figures available on the numbers of children who are obese and have Type 2 diabetes. There is however evidence to suggest that the rise in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes is in proportion to the number who are obese.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/2">The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in childhood obesity and have put in place cross-Government programmes of work to improve eating habits and increase physical activity levels. One Government Department cannot tackle obesity on its own. The Department of Health is working with other Government Departments and a wide range of other partners at national, regional and local levels.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.2/1">We do not hold central information on how many children in care have access to the internet. However, #20 million has been made available from the capital modernisation fund to increase access to information and communication technology (ICT) for children in and leaving care. The majority of this money is being paid to local councils over this year and next as part of the Quality Protects programme (details in the circular LAC(2001 )28). The remainder is supporting the development of XCareZone&quot; by the Who Cares? Trust. XCareZone&quot; will provide a range of interactive, secure, on-line services for children in care.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.2/2">Local authorities' Quality Protects management action plans, submitted in January 2002, included details of their plans for increasing access to ICT. The average position reported by councils was that just under half of their looked after children had access to a computer where they lived. This was projected to rise to three-quarters by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".156W.11/2">The proportion of older people waiting to be discharged from hospital on any one day has reduced from around 14 per cent. in 1996 to just under 8.9 per cent. today. The Government are determined to tackle the problem of delayed discharges and that is why we have brought legislation forward to deal in line with it. This is in line with the commitment in the NHS Plan to end widespread delayed discharges by 2004. Furthermore, the priorities and planning framework 2003&ndash;06 envisages delayed transfers of care will reach minimal levels by 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".157W.11/1">Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements does not require licensing of any products.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.11/2">There is currently no requirement for the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to be notified of unlicensed herbal remedies placed on the market under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 and therefore there is no information available on the number of products placed on the market under this provision and which may fall within the terms of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. We expect that some broad pointers as to the likely numbers of products for which registration might be sought will emerge from continuing discussions between the MCA and the herbal sector, particularly in the light of further refinements to the text during continuing negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.11/3">There is no provision within the Directive for grandfather rights to be given as such. However, in the MCA's consultation on the proposed Directive earlier this year, the herbal sector was invited to submit examples of products which are currently legal but which may fall outside the terms of the proposed Directive. Analysis to date of the responses suggest that there will be few existing herbal medicine on the United Kingdom market which, while having 30 years use, are unable to meet the proposed requirement that at least 15 years use should have been within the European Union. This assessment also takes account of the proposed five year transitional period for products already on the market, during which time evidence of traditional use can continue to be accumulated.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.11/4">A recent proposed amendment from the European Parliament, which we will support, would reduce the required minimum period of EU usage from 15 years to 10 years. This would further reduce any possibility that products currently on the UK market would fall outside the Directive solely by virtue of the required minimum period of EU usage.</p>
	<p pid=".157W.11/5">Where non industrially produced unlicensed herbal remedies are supplied following one to one consultation in accordance with the terms of section 12(1) of the Medicines Act 1968 there is no requirement to demonstrate traditional usage of the remedy.</p>

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is currently consulting on draft implementing Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/2">During lengthy negotiations on the Directive the FSA received a large number of representations from a wide range of stakeholders expressing a range of views.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/3">We have also received a large number of representations about the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of responses in the categories requested as many of those commenting have made specific comments rather than directly indicated support for, or opposition to, the proposed Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/4">To the best of our knowledge, we have not received any representations, either for or against the Directive, from any manufacturers not already involved in the manufacture of products in the natural health sector.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/5">The position of representatives of United Kingdom manufacturers of herbal remedies was set out in a letter from the Herbal Forum to my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (The Lord Hunt of Kings Heath) on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>. The membership of the Forum, which covers small, medium and large businesses operating in the sector, comprises the Health Food Manufacturers' Association, the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the British Herbal Medicine Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Natural Medicines Manufacturers' Association, the Ayurvedic Trade Association, the Trade Association of Producers and Suppliers of Ayurvedic Products from India, the Chinese Medicine Association of Suppliers, the European Herbal Practitioners Association, the Aromatherapy Trade Council, and the Small Growers and Producers Association.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/6">The Forum indicates its view that the traditional medicines sector needs appropriate regulation in order to ensure that the public is properly protected against inferior quality products which the current system can allow on the market. The Forum also says that its members appreciate the need for the proposed Directive, while outlining a number of areas of specific concern that it wishes to be addressed through the continuing European negotiations or at national level. We welcome the stated intention of the Forum to continue to work constructively with the Government and the MCA in particular, to address the various issues identified.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/7">We have received a wide range of representations from stakeholder interest groups in herbal sector in the form of letters and through points made in discussions with Ministers and with the MCA. The stakeholders cover many interests including, manufacturing, retailing, consumers, herbal practitioners, other complementary and alternative medicine groups, pharmacists, doctors, other health care professionals and academics. Some have been supportive of the Directive or have been supportive subject to the resolution of specific concerns. Others have raised specific points without indicating an overall view of the Directive. A minority has indicated strong opposition. Among representative groups wholly or broadly supportive of the Directive are the British Herbal Medicine Association, Consumers Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the European Herbal Practitioners Association. Representative groups expressing strongest opposition to the Directive include Consumers for Health Choice (CMC) and the National Association of Health Stores (NAHS).</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/8">In a number of meetings Ministers have held with a wide range of stakeholders directly involved in the sector the position taken by the majority of interest groups has been that the UK should support the Directive as being in the interests both of the sector and of consumers, while arguing for additional flexibility on a number of issues; and that the Directive should be interpreted and implemented in a way which minimised regulatory impact, consistent with the protection of public health. A minority of stakeholder groups has expressed strong opposition, citing fears in particular that the Directive would have an adverse effect on specialist health food retailers and consumer choice.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/9">Representations from individual companies also express a wide variety of positions, ranging from strong support to concern or opposition.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/10">We have received around 1,300 letters, mainly from the public, opposing the Directive. Many of these express the fear that large numbers of herbal remedies would no longer be available as a result of the Directive. A significant proportion specifically indicate support for the position against the Directive taken by CHC or the NAHS. We have received a number of petitions expressing a similar point of view. A number of these representations from the public also express opposition to the Food Supplements Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/11">We have in addition received around 400 letters from the public opposing the possibility of traditional use registration applying to flower essences. This followed a statement by the MCA, in response to a request from a company, that it might be possible in principle for a company to secure a traditional use registration for a product. Nearly all those writing were concerned that the possibility of a company making a successful application implied a requirement that all flower essences should be registered under the Directive. This however is not the case.</p>

Decisions about the involvement of mental health service users as advocates remains the responsibility of local services. However, the NHS plan testifies to the emphasis that the Government are keen to place on the involvement of patients at all levels in the national health service.

	<p pid=".168W.11/1">Information about staffing budgets is not held centrally. It is for primary care trusts, in partnership with health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. Funding for nurses, midwives and health visiting staff will have been made available in health authority unified allocations. Table 1 sets out these allocations for England and the average annual increase in each year.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/2">Information outlining the expenditure on national health service nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff is shown in table 2.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.11/3">Information outlining the expenditure on non-NHS nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff is shown in Table 3. The figures in table 2 include all agency staff and any other staff not directly employed by the individual NHS trusts, health authorities and primary care trusts. We are unable to disaggregate agency nursing costs.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.8/1">#10 million was made available for each of the financial years 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 to support implementation of the two week outpatient waiting time standard. From 2001&ndash;02 the additional #10 million was put into health authority baseline financial allocations. An additional #30 million was also made available for each of the financial years 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 to further support the two week standard and the modernisation of cancer services. The additional funding was not identified for individual tumour types. It is for health authorities to identify their priorities and target resources appropriately, in this case towards meeting the two week standard.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.2/2">Action continues to be taken to improve waiting times in the accident and emergency department of Wycombe General Hospital, which is the main provider of accident and emergency services to the people of Chesham and Amersham. The chief executive of South Buckinghamshire National Health Service Trust has personally led the Reforming Emergency Care agenda, with support from Thames Valley Strategic Health Authority's service improvement managers and the Modernisation Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/3">Quarterly data relating to waiting times in accident and emergency departments will be published for the first time shortly. Data on total time in accident and emergency will be published for the second quarter of 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/4">I am advised by Thames Valley Strategic Health Authority that South Buckinghamshire NHS Trust has been performing well. Waiting time figures at April 2002 showed a reduction of 6.8 per cent. from the previous year. Currently the trust is performing above target in this area.</p>
