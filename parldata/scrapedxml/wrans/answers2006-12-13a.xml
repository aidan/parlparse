	<p pid="a.1061W.5/1">The general aim for coexistence is to minimise unwanted genetically modified (GM) presence in non-GM crops as far as possible, while recognising that it is impractical to rule out all GM transfer. This is recognised by the agreed EU threshold for labelling GM presence of 0.9 per cent. In the context of this threshold, coexistence measures have to allow for all the potential sources of GM presence, including crop-to-crop cross-pollination.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.5/2">These considerations underpin our proposed crop separation distances that aim to limit cross-pollination to a maximum of 0.3 per cent.

	<p pid="a.1061W.8/1">To improve scientific understanding, we have led the development of the Marine Climate Change Impact Partnership (MCCIP) to provide a UK-wide co-ordinating framework for the transfer of high-quality marine climate change impact evidence to policy advisors and decision-makers. The MCCIP will act as a focal point to investigate, inform, advise and encourage action, in order to adapt to the challenges and opportunities presented by the impacts of climate change in the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.8/2">The first MCCIP Annual Report Card (ARC) was launched in November. The ARC highlights the range of potential impacts in our seas. Many of these, and the connections between them are poorly understood. We will use the ARC to help focus future research efforts of all MCCIP partners. Copies are available on the MCCIP website at: <a href="http://www.mccip.org.uk">http://www.mccip.org.uk</a> and have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.8/3">Defra are also funding a project to look at the 'connections' that occur within a marine ecosystem. This project will make predictions of the affect of climate variability on the complex ecosystem connections and the consequences for the health of the sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.8/4">Additionally, Defra funds the Marine Environmental Change Network (MECN) which co-ordinates and supports those collecting long-term time series information for marine waters. Long-term data series are important in understanding how much of the change we have seen in the marine environment is due to climate variability, other human pressures or natural fluctuations. One of these time series is the Continuous Plankton Recorder, run by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, (<a href="http://www.sahfos.org">www.sahfos.org</a>) which has collected plankton in the Atlantic, North Sea and Eastern Pacific since 1931.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.8/5">Defra and the Department for Trade and Industry are funding research on the impact of increasing carbon dioxide on the marine environment and the consequent ocean acidification. At present, we have little evidence of changes that have occurred, or are occurring, in UK waters. Therefore, we intend to develop a pilot marine monitoring programme for measuring carbon dioxide in our shelf seas as well as further ecosystem-based measurements in conjunction with the Natural Environment Research Council under their Oceans 2025 initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/1">The UK Pesticides Strategy published in March 2006 was directed at the sustainable use of plant protection products and their impact on the environment. We did not at that stage include human health issues within the strategy since we were considering the report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) on 'Crop Spraying and the Health of Residents and Bystanders'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.2/2">We indicated, however, that we would consider extending the strategy to cover human health issues and we will be consulting on a revised draft strategy embracing both human health and environmental protection early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078W.9/1">The aim of the microgeneration strategy is to create conditions where microgeneration becomes a realistic alternative generation source of heat and/or electricity. This will be achieved when costs are reduced and awareness of these technologies is widespread. The low carbon buildings programme is currently helping to reduce the upfront costs of microgeneration installations, and, to complement this, the measures in the strategy are aimed at stimulating widespread demand to help achieve the economies of scale that will lead to costs falling and negate the need for capital grants. Key measures that will help to achieve this include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.9/2" class="indent">Making it easier for microgenerators to access renewable obligation certificates</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.9/3" class="indent">Working with energy suppliers to ensure that microgenerators receive a fair reward for exported electricity</p>

	<p pid="a.1084W.3/1">DFID does not maintain an agreed list of 'states affected by conflict'. We do have a list of fragile states which we are currently reviewing as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. This list will include countries that are generally recognised to be conflict-affected. Detail on DFID's definition and the list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and annex 1 which is available in the House of Commons Library. As part of the Government's 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07), DFID is reviewing how to maximise value for money from our spending on fragile states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.3/2">Our regular cycle of DFID Country Programme Evaluations (CPEs) includes states affected by conflict. In 2005, we teamed up with four other donors to do a joint evaluation of our work in Afghanistan. For 2007, we are planning CPEs for Nepal and Indonesia. We also do specialist reviews of our work on particular themes related to states affected by conflict: for example a review is currently under way of our support to security and justice sector reform in Africa. We are also planning an evaluation of our work in 'fragile states' for 2007-08. Finally, we intend to pilot a 'conflict audit' in a number of countries, which will help us review how well we integrate conflict into all our development work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1084W.3/3">To maximise the effectiveness of development assistance to states affected by conflict, DFID&mdash;with other Government Departments, donor agencies, country partners and civil society, conducts conflict assessments. These help us to better understand the conflict dynamics within a region/country and ensure that at a minimum development assistance does not inadvertently fuel conflict, through for example, being blind to the distributional impacts of aid. More than this, the assessments feed into our broader country planning processes, helping us to identify where our development assistance can be most effective. In Yemen for example, our conflict assessment highlighted how poor access to justice and security was a significant conflict risk factor and led us to support the development of an integrated justice sector development programme.</p>

Detail on DFID's current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and annex 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.2/3">Using the DFID list of 'fragile states', data fromthe 2007 Global Monitoring Report and UNESCO Institute for Statistics estimates for countries without published data, the percentages of primary aged children enrolled in primary school in these states is calculated as 69 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1086W.2/1">DFID helped establish the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) in 1998 and since that time has provided over &pound;2 million to support its development. The overall goal of our support to ETI is to improve the lives of workers and their families through the application of internationally recognised labour standards throughout global supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.2/2">DFID regularly reviews the work we support. An independent review of ETI was undertaken by Ashridge Centre for Business and Society for DFID in 2005. DFID also supported the recently published Impact Assessment commissioned by ETI, which was undertaken independently by the Institute for Development Studies at the University of Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.2/3">The Impact Assessment found that ETI member companies' codes of conduct covered at least 20,000 suppliers, of which nearly all had been informed of the need to comply with the codes, and almost half (9,000) had been assessed for code compliance. The assessment found that many workers had benefited from the implementation of the ETI Base Code. In most of the supply sites in case studies used in the assessment, there were improvements in relation to health and safety, working hours, wages and child labour. For instance, it was more common for the minimum wage to be paid and for there to be greater provision for state insurance and payments, and there was less employment of children and young workers. The assessment foundless positive impact in relation to freedom of association, discrimination regular employment and harsh treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.2/4">DFID is confident that the ETI takes the Impact Assessment seriously and is acting on its recommendations. We recently agreed a five year Partnership Programme Agreement with ETI in which we have placed specific emphasis on: the need for more poor workers to know about their rights and to be supported by civil society initiatives; increasing the number of businesses taking action to ensure labour laws and standards are implemented; increasing civil society engagement with government to improve legal protection for poor workers; increasing the number of retailers in developed and developing countries that are aware of ethical trade and its benefits; and, supporting the private sector to participate with trade unions and NGOs in support of DFID's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086W.2/5">We believe that in its relatively short life-span the ETI has done much to establish best practice in the credible implementation, and monitoring and independent verification, of corporate codes of conduct and we look forward to continuing to work with them to this end.</p>

This commits the UK to spend &pound;1.5 billion to tackle AIDS between 2005 and 2008. It outlines how the UK will act to strengthen political leadership on AIDS; to improve the global response to AIDS, ensuring international initiatives and multilateral organisations complement national approaches in developing countries; to support better national programmes, including through our bilateral assistance to country responses; and to improve the long-term response, including through support for research into new medicines, preventative technologies and AIDS programmes.

This includes &pound;100 million for 2006 and a further &pound;100 million for 2007, subject to the Global Fund's performance. The UK is now the fourth largest donor for the period 2006-07 (after France; the US and Japan) and the second largest in the EU.

	<p pid="a.1096W.3/1">Data on casualties was not collected centrally before the formation of the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre in April 2005 because casualty reporting and tracking was the responsibility of each Service individually. Historic data on casualties has now been compiled for major and ongoing operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Iraq and other theatres brigaded together including Sierra Leone. The Defence Analytical Services Agency is currently working to reconcile this data. When this detailed work is complete it will be placed in the public domain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1096W.6/1">The police have primacy in the detection and prosecution of criminal activity undertaken in the UK by terrorists and their sympathisers and in the maintenance of public safety. The armed forces can and do provide support to the police, at their request, using specialist military capabilities (for example through bomb disposal). The permanent deployment since 1969 of the armed forces in support of the police in Northern Ireland has, for example, been an essential element in delivering the improved security situation seen in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096W.6/2">Overseas, the armed forces continue to play a key role as part of the cross-Government and international effort to counter the terrorist threat. Building the counter terrorist capacity of friends and allies is an integral part of the Government's strategy, addressing the terrorist threat. Conflict prevention, peace support operations and defence diplomacy can all assist in prevention by tackling some of the underlying causes of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096W.6/3">Both at home and overseas, our armed forces can therefore play an important role in pursuing terrorists and those who support them but there is no military solution to the terrorist threat. Irrespective of location, the response must be wide-ranging and include respect for the rule of law, international obligations, and human rights, all of which are threatened by the activities of terrorists.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.12/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime 2006 Opium Survey estimates that 15,300 hectares, or about 10 per cent. of opium poppy was eradicated in Afghanistan this year, some three times more than last year. The survey also suggests that where eradication took place in 2005, farmers were less likely to plant poppy in the next season. Eradication is a useful deterrent where there is access to legal livelihoods and when used as part of a balanced counter-narcotics strategy, such as the Afghan government's National Drug Control Strategy, which includes measures to interdict drugs, bring criminals to justice, build institutions and provide alternatives for poppy farmers. In areas of Afghanistan, where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions in cultivation achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases cultivation has fallen further.</p>

	<p pid="a.1100W.2/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. UNODC figures show a yield of 4,200 metric tonnes (mt) in 2004, 4,100 mt in 2005 and 6,100 mt in 2006. It is too early to estimate overall levels of opium production for 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100W.2/2">The cultivation picture varies between and within provinces. In 2006 there was a 162 per cent. increase in Helmand, accounting for 70 per cent. of the overall increase, and a rise of 379 per cent. in Uruzgan. However, in three of the four highest poppy cultivating provinces in 2005, production was down this year (Balkh&mdash;33 per cent., Farah&mdash;25 per cent. and Kandahar&mdash;3 per cent.). Where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained, and in some cases cultivation has fallen further. This shows that the National Drug Control Strategy is starting to have an impact in some parts of the country. President Karzai recently said 'we must be looking at a 10-year period' to rid Afghanistan of poppy. Achieving the Afghan Compact benchmark of a sustained annual reduction in the amount of land under poppy cultivation by 2010 will be a key step towards this goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1102W.0/1">I visited Bangladesh, India and Pakistan on 22-<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-29">29 November 2006</phrase>. The purpose of the visit was primarily to promote greater bilateral trade between the UK and South Asia, but other foreign affairs objectives were included, particularly in the area of human rights, which fall particularly in my portfolio.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/2">In Bangladesh my programme included calls on the President/Chief Adviser of the Caretaker government and the leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist party and Awami League. I also met human rights representatives, civil society leaders, political leaders from other parties and key UK investors in the energy and power sectors. I delivered a keynote speech attended by leading figures from the business community, local officials, and diplomats.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/3">I delivered all our messages for free, fair and peaceful elections, asked for responsible leadership from the main parties, and urged both leaders to address human rights concerns in their election manifestos. In particular, I raised extra-judicial killings by law enforcement agencies, specifically the Rapid Action Battalion, with the main party leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/4">I also presided over a roundtable discussion. At the discussion leading human rights advocates outlined a range of issues of concern in Bangladesh including levels of political and societal violence and the abuse of rights of vulnerable groups: ethnic and religious minorities, women and children. Participants identified examples of required political, legal and attitudinal changes and stressed the importance of the international community in applying pressure on the Government of Bangladesh to achieve these. International business had a role to play through ethical investment; human rights advocates needed to make the business case for corporate social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/5">In Delhi I met Cabinet Ministers of Commerce and Industry, and Petroleum, Ministers of State in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Kumar) and in the Ministry of External Affairs, and the Chief Minister of Delhi. I also spoke at the World Economic Forum and met business leaders and British investors in India. I was joined by a delegation of six UK infrastructure companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/6">My meeting with Anand Sharma, Minister of State for External Affairs, covered a range of issues: regional (Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma); thematic (co-operation on security and counter terrorism) and UN specific (Human Rights Commission and UN reform). The visit also provided an opportunity to reinforce some of our broader messages on the investment environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/7">In Kolkatta I inaugurated two income generation projects supported by the Deputy High Commission and gave a keynote address at the Women's Interlink Foundation, which looks after trafficked girls and the children of sex workers. I also had the opportunity to meet many of the children involved in the programme during his visit to the non-governmental organisations. I also met with the West Bengal Chief Minister, and discussed major infrastructure projects (a second airport, new deep water port, urban and river regeneration) and other key areas for British companies to consider&mdash;chemicals, petro-chemicals, agri-retail, healthcare and IT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/8">In Pakistan I had separate meetings in Islamabad with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, and the Ministers for Privatisation and Investment and for Commerce. I was accompanied by a high-level business delegation from Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC, London Stock Exchange (LSE) and HCA (Healthcare). I also gave a media briefing in Karachi, and met UK business and the visiting Manchester trade mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.0/9">I stressed, to the Prime Minister Aziz and Akhtar Khan, the UK's commitment to an ambitious, pro development outcome to the Doha Round negotiations, and ensuring that the impact on neighbouring countries was taken into account in any negotiations. With the Prime Minister, I raised UK concerns on Intellectual Property Rights issues in Pakistan, particularly in pharmaceuticals and publishing. With Akhtar Khan, I spoke of our outreach to stakeholders in the UK. I invited the Minister to visit a range of cities e.g. Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Bradford to see first hand the contribution they were making to UK society and the UK economy. I emphasised the need for continued improvement in the levels of maintenance and safety of Pakistan International Airlines. I thanked Prime Minister Aziz for his help with the release of Tahir Hussain and congratulated him on the recent Women's Protection Bill, there will be a follow-up on a number of other human rights issues.</p>

A fair and objective process for granting such exemptions with appropriate safeguards should rapidly be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.1108W.8/2">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) records the DNA profile for a particular individual. It does not hold data on arrest and criminal records. This information is held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Information provided by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) from the PNC indicated that as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-14">14 July 2006</phrase>, 2,922,624 persons on the NDNAD also had an entry on PNC. Of these, 2,317,555 (79.3 per cent.) had a conviction or caution (i.e. a criminal record). The difference between the two figures is attributable to: young persons under 18 who have a formal warning or reprimand recorded on PNC; persons who have been charged with a recordable offence where proceedings are ongoing; and persons who have been arrested for a recordable offence but no further action was taken.</p>

The first, introduced in 1998, contained 27 pages that were useable for visas and endorsements. This year we introduced the e-passport which has 25 useable pages. The number of pages has been reduced because of the need to improve the clarity of the 'Notes' to assist the visually impaired plus the requirement to cater for additional languages following the expansion of the European Union and the decision to include the Welsh and Scottish Gaelic languages.</p>

	<p pid="a.1140W.17/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140W.17/2">The Government do not, in the main, collect specific information on local authority funding for activities run by young people as these initiatives are run at the discretion of local authorities. The Youth Opportunity Fund and the Youth Capital Fund are the exception to this as they are ring fenced outside Local Area Agreements for the period April 2006 to March 2008. I am responding to the question raised from the perspective of the Youth Opportunity Fund (YOF) and the Youth Capital Fund (YCF) which were introduced in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140W.17/3">The YOF and the YCF were a Youth Green Paper commitment to young people to give them control and influence over activities and facilities in their local neighbourhood. Central to the conditions for the use of both funds is the role of young people as grant givers and decision makers and as project leaders bidding for funds to spend on activities in their local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140W.17/4">Resources of &pound;62 million for 2006-07 and 2007-08 were proposed in the Youth Green Paper for both funds. Additional funding of &pound;53 million was made available through the Chancellor's 2005 pre-Budget report making a total of &pound;115 million over the two years from April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.5/26">Ofsted data on closures include registered places in settings which are transferring ownership, and in settings which move from one Ofsted category to another, not just in those which are ceasing trading. For example, if a sessional provider moved to offering full day care provision, its places would be recorded as 'closed' sessional places and 'opened' full day care places. The Ofsted data therefore exaggerates the true extent of turnover.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.5/27">Ofsted have produced figures on the numbers of registered child care providers and places on a quarterly basis from March 2003.

	<p pid="a.1151W.5/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) both have overall budgets in excess of &pound;6 billion and are responsible for funding prescribed and non-prescribed higher education respectively in further education colleges. Neither body has planning responsibilities for higher education since we believe that, instead of a planned approach, every higher education provider must establish and sustain a competitive position in strong markets. However, LSC and HEFCE staff meet regularly with the Department to explore how partnership working can be enhanced across a range of areas, including student progression from further to higher education, which is important as we increase and widen participation.</p>

Speech and language therapy services are an important priority because foundations of communication skills development in the early years are crucial to maximising children's outcomes. It is because of thiswe have a programme to support speech andlanguage development in early year settings&mdash;&quot;Communicating Matters&quot;&mdash;which was developed following consultation with all our delivery partners including voluntary sector providers. PCTs are the main providers of speech and language services through children's centres and we work closely with the Department of Health on improving these services. Nationally, we are holding discussions with ICAN (a voluntary sector organisation with expertise in speech and language therapy) about a proposal for work in a number of children's centres. The Sure Start Children's Centres Practice Guidance supports the development of speech and language services through children's centres and encourages them to work with PCTs and voluntary sector organisations in their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1161W.2/2">The main driver to improve prostate cancer services is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on 'Improving Outcomes in Urological Cancers', including prostate cancer, which was issued in September 2002. Each strategic health authority was asked to demonstrate that its cancer network(s) had suitable action plans in place for the implementation of this guidance. Progress towards the implementation of these plans is assessed by both the Department and the Healthcare Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1162W.2/33">There is variability in incidence and deaths from prostate cancer around the country with a slightly higher than average incidence across London and the South of England. A similar pattern exists for mortality, although there was less variation than for incidence. The mortality rate has started to decline in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1162W.2/34">Geographical variations in incidence may, to some extent, be explained by regional differences in the availability and uptake of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. The introduction of the PSA test in the early 1990s led to a big increase in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, although this was on top of an existing underlying trend of more cases. Figures on PSA testing are not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid="a.1164W.8/1">Many different types of general practice and hospital computer systems are in use across the national health service. NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for maintaining and upgrading local systems, for the technical integration of these systems with choose and book. NHS Connecting for Health supports technical upgrading by providing funding to cover the reasonable costs of making existing systems choose and book-compliant. NHS Connecting for Health is also currently piloting a performance-monitoring tool designed to help local project and information technology teams diagnose and locate any problems in the overall choose and book process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.8/2">Nationally, the system has performed well since its launch in 2004. One PCT already uses choose and book for over 90 per cent. of its referrals, which demonstrates that the system is working and fit for purpose. Local benchmarking suggests that when local configuration is correct choose and book is easy and convenient to use, and over the last 12 months the national system has been available for use over 99 per cent. of the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.8/3">Choose and book has now achieved over 15,000 bookings in a single day and is being used for over25 per cent. of NHS referral activity from general practitioners' (GPs) surgeries to first outpatient appointment. Over 1.7 million bookings have been made to date, and over 80 per cent. of all GP practices have used choose and book to refer their patients to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.8/4">We know that when patients have the opportunity to book their appointments electronically they are more likely to attend their hospital appointment. This helps avoid wasting valuable appointments and contributes to hospitals running more efficiently. Missed appointments are a constant drain on NHS resources, estimated to cost up to &pound;300 million a year. For example, one trust has seen non-attendance and rescheduling rates fall from 9 per cent. to 5 per cent., and from 14 per cent. to4 per cent. respectively, where choose and book is in use.</p>

A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases, an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data does not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.<br/> 2. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) may be notified of joiners or leavers to or from the GDS or PDS up to several months, or more, after the move has taken place.<br/> 3. SHA and PCT data include all dentists practising in that area. Some dentists may have an open GDS or PDS contract in more than one PCT or SHA and therefore they have been counted more than once.

	<p pid="a.1166W.2/1">Dentists in primary care trusts' salaried dental services undertake statutory dental screening inspections of schoolchildren at around ages six and nine to identify those in need of a further examination and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.2/2">Originally, it was the practice for the primary care trust (PCT) dental services to advise parents that a school dental inspection was going to take place and that parents were to advise the school if they had any objection to their child being inspected. We reviewed this policy earlier this year and issued new guidance which indicated that it was necessary to obtain positive consent for these inspections from either the child (if he/she was judged to be competent to give consent) or from the parents/or relevant person with parental responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.2/3">Information on which primary care trusts currently undertake screening is not available centrally, but we are aware that the number of children receiving a dental screening each year has fallen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.2/4">In November 2006 the United Kingdom (UK) National Screening Committee (NSC) recommended to the UK chief dental officers that there is no evidence to support the continued population screening for dental disease among children aged six to nine years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.2/5">The NSC recommended that higher value from the use of these resources would be achieved if they were used in addressing oral health inequalities more effectively. We will shortly be issuing guidance to primarycare trusts on the implementation of the NSCs recommendations.</p>

Research by the national health service stop smoking helpline this year found that24 per cent. of regular smokers now smoke roll-ups, a rise from 11 per cent. in 1990. The use of hand-rolled tobacco had become increasingly popular among teenagers. This finding is in line with a 2006 World Health Organization poll which reported that the number of those using hand-rolled tobacco has doubled since 1990 and that one in four smokers worldwide now smokes hand-rolled cigarettes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1171W.9/3">This is a national target. No targets for reducing inequalities in health outcome as measured by infant mortality have been set below this level, so no targets exist for the NHS North East area or for Bishop Auckland.</p>

However, the rate of decline has been faster in other groups rather than routine and manual groups. As a result, there has been a widening in the relative gap between infant mortality in the routine and manual group and the total population between the target baseline 1997-99 and 2001-03 and 2002-04. The latest period 2003-05 shows a slight narrowing of the gap.</p>

	<p pid="a.1172W.8/2">We are currently considering the practicalities of giving antivirals (as prophylaxis) to members of the household of a person with pandemic influenza.

These may be used for frontline healthcare workers if there was a close enough match between the vaccine strain and the emerging pandemic strain.

The rate of connections to the new national broadband network (N3) has always been, and remains, ahead of schedule, and 98 per cent. of GPs now have a broadband connection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/3">The first Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) under the programme was implemented in April 2005 and 57 systems have been implemented to date with over 86 million digital images stored. NHSmail was implemented on time in October 2004 and currently has over 210,000 registered users sending 800,000 e-mails per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/4">Further details of progress towards delivery across the NHS of the centrally funded national infrastructure and services within the programme are contained in the National Audit Office (NAO)'s report published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June 2006</phrase> which is available in the Library and via the NAO website at</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/05061173.pdf">www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/05061173.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/6">However, some local service deployments are late, as some suppliers and their subcontractors have taken longer than anticipated to deliver software. Local service provider (LSP) systems are between one and two years behind original plans. Delays are due in part to the great complexity of developing computer software but also other factors&mdash;the need to reach a consensus with stakeholders, including doctors and patients, about the detail of both the software and the operational framework of electronic health records. Significant levels of data corruption and concomitant problems in existing local systems have also impeded the take-up of the new systems. The cost of delays is met by suppliers, not the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/7">Though there have been delays, the programme is also delivering additional projects which were notpart of the original scope of the programme. These include PACS, QMAS, the NHSmail email system, an IT system that will be used to invite people to take part in the bowel cancer-screening programme, andspecial enterprise-wide agreements by which NHS organisations can buy additional products and services at significantly discounted prices. In its first two years of implementation activity the programme has made more progress towards the objective of information being available throughout the NHS than had been achieved in the previous decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.5/8">As the NAO made clear in their report, the value of contracts let for the core components of the national programme over 10 years has not increased since the contracts were let in 2003 and 2004. None of the relevant project budgets managed by the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency have been exceeded. Anticipated expenditure under these contracts remains at planned levels.</p>

However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to under spend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178W.2/1">All systems and services delivered through the national programme for information technology incorporate stringent security controls and safeguards to prevent unrestricted or uncontrolled access to personal information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/2">Any attacker who had access to the N3 network would have to break through three separate layers of tiered architecture, each of which is protected by twin firewalls of different manufacture, in order to access the database. The firewalls are supported by intrusion detection systems, and other multiple security measures, which routinely monitor network traffic and alert on detection of suspicious activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/3">There are four separate levels of control to protect against the danger of data theft by a legitimate N3 user. The first is provided by the requirement that all users must have a smartcard. Smartcards are secure tokens that, together with a password, confirm the identity of staff and determine access rights to information. They are issued only when satisfactory evidence of identity and residence is provided in person by staff, and provide a unique digital identity that enables the system to know precisely who each user is. These arrangements conform with the e-Government Interoperability Framework (eGif) Level 3 standards for the registration and authentication of staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/4">The second control is that staff will only be able to access as much information as is needed for the purpose of their role within the healthcare team. For example, a receptionist will be able to see information about an appointment, but would not be able to look at detailed clinical records.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/5">The third control is that the system will not permit anyone to access clinical information unless they are registered within the system as working in a team that is providing the individual patient concerned with care, or are checking the quality of care provided. This safeguard is known as the 'legitimate relationship' safeguard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/6">The fourth control is provided by staff who oversee compliance with security processes. A record is kept of user activity within the system. If an irregularity is suspected these staff will be alerted automatically and will investigate the incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/7">Over and above these implemented safeguards, the NHS maintains an effective liaison with the UK's information security authorities and others for the sharing of relevant advice and guidance on known information security threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/8">Together these safeguards will provide an unprecedented level of assurance compared with existing electronic systems.</p>

It is proposed as part of the review of the national health service (NHS) pension scheme that there will be a cap on employers' contributions of 14.2 per cent., from 2012, when the 2008 valuation is expected to be implemented, and of 14 per cent. from 2016.</p>

But some records need to be kept on the spine for all NHS patients and this is not a matter on which patients will be offered choice. However, this does not apply to all records and patients do have a qualified legal right under section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 to have objections considered. The Department will shortly be consulting on how best to give effect to this right in relation to the spine and other new IT systems and applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186W.0/1">&quot;Avoidable Deaths&quot;, the five year report from the National Confidential Inquiry Into Suicide and Homicide by People With Mental Illness (NCI) is a product of the Centre for Suicide Prevention at the university of Manchester. The centre has been commissioned by the National Patient Safety Agency to investigate suicides, homicides and sudden unexplained deaths in mental health services and make recommendations on how they might be prevented. The Department's involvement is limited to representation on the NCI steering committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.0/2">The NCI issues its major reports in a five year cycle, with the time periods for each report continuing from the previous report. The report is written by the NCI team, currently headed by the director, Professor Louis Appleby, and the assistant directors Professor Jenny Shaw and Dr. Nav Kapur, head of homicide research and head of suicide research respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.0/3">The data on all homicides is collected from the Home Office Homicide Index (HI). Where available, psychiatric reports prepared for the trial are obtained. Information on previous offences is collected from the National Crime Operations Faculty. Case details are submitted to mental health services in each individual's district of residence and adjacent districts to identify those with a history of using mental health services, including those with a lifetime contact. These individuals become inquiry cases and those cases with recent service contact (within 12 months of the offence) are analysed as the main sample.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.0/4">Information on inquiry cases is obtained from a questionnaire sent to the consultant psychiatrist within the applicable clinical team. For all homicide convictions, data are collected on methods and victims from the HI, including data on diminished responsibility and hospital orders. Data on mental illness at the time of offence comes from psychiatric reports prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, including details of mental health, drug and alcohol use at the time of the offence. The questionnaire also provides data covering demographic details, clinical history, details of the homicide, details of in-patient/community care received, details of final contact with services, events leading to the homicide and respondents' views on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.0/5">Due to delays inherent in the notification procedures, homicide data were not complete for 2004, the final year of the study. Data on homicides in this report therefore covers the period April 1999 to December 2003, where it is more complete. Data on suicides is more complete for 2004, hence the report covers the period April 2000 to December 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.1192W.2/1">The information is not available in the format requested. The Department has no local information on what specialities have been transferred to primary care trusts. In addition, the Department is unable to extract average number of patients treated per day. The table placed in the Library therefore shows the count of finished consultant episodes for ordinary and day case admissions at York Hospitals NHS Trust in each year since 1992.</p>

	<p pid="a.1216W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what his most recent estimate is of the average per capita government expenditure on each income decile group. (105731)</p>
	<p pid="a.1216W.8/4" class="indent">Estimates of cash benefits and benefits in kind received by households are provided in the ONS analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot;. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. Through measuring household receipts of benefits, this analysis shows how government expenditure on cash benefits and benefits in kind are allocated to different types of households, and in particularhouseholds in different income decile groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1216W.8/5" class="indent">The results in the article are presented for households rather than on a per capita basis. However, the table below shows average per capita receipts of cash benefits and benefits in kind within each household decile group. They show that the average ranges from &pound;5,309 per person, per year in the bottom income decile, to &pound;2,171 in the top decile. A more detailed breakdown by different types of benefit appears in the article (although presented as household averages, rather than per capita).</p>
	<p pid="a.1216W.8/6" class="indent">Cash benefits include things like Income Support, Child Benefit, Incapacity Benefit, and the state Retirement Pension. The estimates of benefits in kind reflect the value of education and health services provided by the state to households, and also include housing and travel subsidies. Together these items constitute approximately 55 per cent of total government expenditure. They are the parts of government expenditure which can be directly allocated to households. Other types of expenditure such as on defence cannot be allocated except on the assumption that all households benefit equally.</p>
