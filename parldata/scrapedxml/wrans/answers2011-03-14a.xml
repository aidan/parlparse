	<p pid="a.6W.3/1">Before a non-European Union (EU) country is approved to export to the EU, the exporting country must have acceptable disease status, the recognised standard for relevant control authorities and guarantees from the country of origin with regard to compliance with EU import rules and results of EU missions to these countries. A list of those countries approved for export of beef can be found in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 206/2010. For countries which are regionalised for beef exports (certain countries in Southern Africa and South America) all exported meat is required to be deboned and matured in approved premises as a risk mitigation measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.3/2">All meat imported from non-EU countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals that have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of disease. Imports of products of animal origin (POAO) are checked at approved facilities at Border Inspection Posts (BIPS). All consignments of imported meat have a documentary check on the veterinary certification, and an identity check, to match the goods to the certification. A minimum of 20% of consignments of meat imported from non-EU countries undergoes a physical check by an official veterinary surgeon, and this rises to 50% for poultry and game.</p>
	<p pid="a.6W.3/3">DEFRA monitors outbreaks of high impact diseases around the world. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is among those diseases of major concern. When DEFRA becomes aware of a new disease outbreak in an export region or country, it carries out an initial rapid risk assessment of the risk of introduction of that disease into the UK in live animals or POAO and may produce a preliminary outbreak assessment. If this preliminary assessment concludes that a full qualitative risk assessment is not justified, then we will publish the preliminary outbreak assessment here:</p>

	<p pid="a.8W.3/2">The question has been passed to me for reply as the Minister responsible for health and safety at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/3">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has not issued specific guidance on the safe use of telescopic materials handlers (telehandlers) in agriculture. It has published general guidance on the selection, use and maintenance of work equipment in the industry, which advises on compliance with relevant legislation. HSE has also published an Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) and guidance on training for operators of lift trucks, which applies to telehandlers.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/4">Industry specific guidance on the safe use of telehandlers in construction was launched by the Strategic Forum for Construction in February 2011. The guidance provides clarity on the safe use of telehandlers; including planning, role of personnel, training and familiarization of personnel, safe use, maintenance, inspection and thorough examination. These basic principles are applicable to the use of telehandlers in any work environment or industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.3/5">HSE will be reviewing external guidance during 2011. Any revisions to guidance will be posted on HSE&#8217;s website at:</p>

The breakdown is by tariff level at which the amputation was awarded (for more than one condition the figure includes the condition awarded at the most serious tariff level only) and provides the lump sum amounts that are currently awarded at each tariff level. Claims are awarded under the AFCS based on 15 tariff levels, with a lump sum attached to each level. For the more severe injuries, tariffs one to 11, a further sum is paid in the form of a guaranteed income payment (GIP), which consists of regular payments to provide a continuous income stream.</p>

	<p pid="a.19W.0/1">A contract was signed with Eurocopter UK in September 2009 for the demonstration and manufacture phases of the Puma Life Extension Programme (LEP). In addition a contract was placed with Turbomeca for the supply of new Makila engines. The total value of contracts placed in support of the Puma LEP is &#163;347 million. This includes the one-off costs associated with developing the required modifications and undertaking the trials activity necessary to certify the aircraft; the provision of initial support and conversion training for aircrew and maintainers; and the cost of modifying each helicopter.</p>
	<p pid="a.19W.0/2">The contract renegotiation programme in support of the decision taken in the Strategic Defence and Security Review is under way. It is not appropriate to make a statement about individual contracts at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.19W.0/3">In 2009, prior to the award of the current contracts, a detailed review was undertaken of whether the acquisition of new medium helicopters could be advanced in lieu of the planned life-extension of Puma. This review concluded that, within available resources, it would not be feasible to acquire new helicopters without unacceptable risk to operational commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.19W.0/4">The Strategic Defence and Security Review undertaken in 2010 reviewed the need for Puma and confirmed the ongoing requirement. As with all programmes this is subject to the ongoing planning round which is expected to conclude in spring 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.2/2">In line with the strategic defence and security review (SDSR) and the Whitehall International Energy Strategy, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), and other Government Departments (including the Ministry of Defence (MOD)) have raised the level of engagement with those countries identified as priorities for UK energy security. For example, FCO, DECC, and MOD Energy Ministers have all visited Norway since the SDSR; a State visit by the Emir of Qatar took place in October 2010; the Deputy Prime Minister visited Kazakhstan in December 2010. More regular ministerial contact has been established with UK-based International Oil Companies to support UK commercial energy interests. We are working through the EU, G20 and other international fora to increase price stability and mitigate risks to supply. A new International Energy Forum charter was agreed in February 2011 to enhance producer-consumer dialogue.</p>

So far there is no indication of a significant change in applications for asylum made by nationals of affected countries, or from the surrounding areas. Nonetheless the UK Border Agency will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that it is well placed to manage any emerging risks and respond effectively should the situation change.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.5/1">The Government recognise the challenges that are faced by Dyfed-Powys police in covering a large geographical area with a single helicopter but also recognises the need to provide value for money for the taxpayer. The introduction of a National Police Air Service (NPAS) from <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-01">1 April 2012</phrase> will provide a mixed fleet of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft that will operate across borders. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) believes that the replacement of the Dyfed-Powys helicopter with a fixed-wing aircraft is a more effective solution giving eight hours more coverage and greater resilience across the whole of Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.8/1">A number of international organisations, including Eurostat, have attempted to collate international homicide statistics. It is important to note that there are issues surrounding the comparability of international homicide data. There are different definitions of homicide between countries, although definitions vary less than for some other types of crimes. Furthermore, there are differing points in criminal justice systems at which homicides are recorded, i.e. when the offence is discovered or following further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/2">The most recent Eurostat figures compare homicide rates averaged over the years 2006 to 2008. These are published in &#8216;Crime and Criminal Justice&#8217; by Cynthia Tavares and Geoffrey Thomas and are available via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/3">http://www.eds-destatis.de/en/downloads/sif/sf_10_058.pdf</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/4">The rates for the 15 countries that were members of the European Union prior to the accession of 10 candidate countries on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> are shown in Table A, per million population. The Eurostat published rate for England and Wales is 13.5, for Scotland is 21.4 and for Northern Ireland is 15.2. Eurostat calculated the England and Wales rate using the recorded crime returns rather than the Homicide Index. If the Homicide Index had been used, the figure would be slightly lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/5">Among the countries that joined the EU on or after May 2004, rates for eastern European countries tend to be higher, rising to 87.6 in Lithuania and 66.0 in Estonia, though the rate for Poland is 12.9, which is lower than that for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/6">The Federal Bureau of Investigation commented on homicide rates in the USA in their publication &#8216;Crime in the United States, 2008&#8217;. They stated that, although the rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the USA has fallen substantially in recent years, to 56 per million population in 2008, it is still well above those experienced in western Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/7">Another key source for international homicide data is the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). UNODC statistics currently cover over 198 countries or territories. The data are drawn from various different datasets. The UK are included in the table of homicide rates based on criminal justice sources and are ranked below the median for all countries which provided these</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.8/8">data. However, for the reasons stated earlier, caution should be taken when making such comparisons. The UNODC data are available at the following link:</p>

However, I believe all the multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, should be doing even more to support a shift to climate-smart investment and lending. I will be raising this when I visit the bank in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.9/2">The UK is a strong supporter of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) which work through the World Bank and other development banks to finance renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transport in developing countries as well as forestry and adaptation to climate change. Current commitments under the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the largest of the CIFs, amount to $3.1 billion for over 12 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity, sufficient to provide power to almost 16 million households. We also provide core funding to the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, which helps countries develop roadmaps for renewable energy deployment and better understand the costs and benefits of renewables when compared to fossil fuels.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.5/2">The Government have made a clear commitment to raising the participation age to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. This includes a major commitment in the spending review of October 2010 to fund sufficient education and training places. In addition, we are simplifying the post-16 commissioning system to free providers from red tape, introducing a funding system based on &#8220;lagged&#8221; student numbers that will ensure that funding follows students&#8217; choices, and continuing the process of ensuring that all 16 to 17-year-olds receive a suitable offer of a place in education or training to help match supply and demand. The Government are also ending the disparity between post-16 funding between schools and colleges. We are giving schools responsibility for careers guidance at Key Stages 3 and 4 to ensure that it is fully tailored to young people&#8217;s needs. Local authorities retain their statutory duty to encourage and enable young people to participate in education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.5/3">There is also a strong demand for Apprenticeship places and the Government are committed to significant growth in the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.8/2">School governing bodies have a statutory responsibility to ensure that schools have a policy for teaching about sex education</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/3">which, as a minimum, should provide information about how sex education will be provided, any sensitive issues that will be covered and who will provide it. The policy must be made available to parents on request and must include information about parents' right to withdraw their children from sex and relationships (SRE) provided outside the national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/4">We believe it is important that all children have access to high quality SRE so they can make wise and informed choices. Those parents who do not believe that their children are ready to receive SRE at school, or who want to provide it themselves are able to withdraw their children from SRE lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/5">Members of school governing bodies are already responsible for deciding what information the school should make available to them. It is therefore not necessary to require schools to inform school governors of the teaching material used in sex education. In practice this will already happen as part of the governing body's statutory responsibility to have a sex education policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/6">When providing sex education all schools must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State published in 2000. This is designed to secure that pupils receiving sex education learn about the nature of marriage and its importance for family life and the upbringing of children. Furthermore, it is designed to protect pupils from teaching and materials which are inappropriate having regard to the age and religious and cultural background of the pupils concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/7">The guidance provides information about how schools can set in place arrangements to protect pupils from inappropriate teaching and materials. The guidance can be viewed at:</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/8"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/DfES">http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationdetail/page1/DfES</a>%200116%202000</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.8/9">We believe it is important that teachers have good quality teaching material to support them in providing sex education, but that they should have the flexibility to use their own professional judgment in deciding such matters, taking account of the guidance, the needs of pupils and the ethos of the school. We have no plans, therefore, to require the suppliers of teaching materials for sex education to be licensed.</p>

Among the key findings were that 98% of participants assessed the project as excellent and 2% as good, and 74% of teachers either agreed or strongly agreed that participation in the project had positively impacted on the school&#8217;s teaching and learning about the Holocaust.

	<p pid="a.52W.6/2">We are concerned that the number of pupils, especially those in disadvantaged areas, who receive a broad education in core academic subjects is far too small. Through the introduction of the English Baccalaureate, we want to encourage more pupils to take these core subjects and to bring about greater fairness of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.6/3">The English Baccalaureate is not intended to include all the subjects worthy of study. We recognise that study in other subjects will be just as valuable to pupils and we will encourage all pupils to study non-English Baccalaureate subjects alongside the English Baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well-rounded education. This is why we have kept the number of core subjects in the English Baccalaureate small enough to allow wider study. Subjects, such as religious studies, philosophy, and economics, which do not count towards the English Baccalaureate, can and will play a part in a well rounded, rigorous education. Achievement in these subjects will continue to be recognised in the performance tables as part of the A*-C measure and the teaching of religious education remains compulsory throughout a pupil&#8217;s schooling. However we remain open to arguments about how we can further improve every measure in the performance tables&#8212;including the English Baccalaureate.</p>

In addition to this there were 10 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, paid at a lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further &#163;2,000. However, these are estimates only.</p>

From April, education services are funded through the dedicated schools grant and the local government finance scheme. It is for local authorities to decide on how those resources are allocated, including in respect of children whom they fund in residential schools. Capital funding is also provided by this Department to local authorities and to schools which can be used to provide facilities that meet mobility needs where this is the local priority. We are currently reviewing the schools funding system and this will include a review of the funding for children with special education needs and disability.</p>

We trust schools to take their own financial decisions when planning a truly rounded education including physical education and competitive sport.

	<p pid="a.57W.5/2">Through the Education Bill schools will be placed under a new duty to secure access to independent, impartial careers guidance for all pupils aged 13 to 16. Schools will be free to determine how best to fulfil this duty based on the needs of their pupils but the careers guidance must include information on 16 to 18 education or training options, including Apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.57W.5/3">As the Education Bill makes its way through Parliament, we will remind schools of the importance of offering the broad range of activities encompassed within the term &#8216;careers education&#8217; to prepare pupils for future learning. This will help to place careers guidance in context and support the development of decision making and career management skills for all young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.60W.12/1">Evidence suggests that Connexions services are not consistently providing high quality careers guidance to young people. The Ofsted report &#8220;Moving Through The System&#8221;, published in March 2010, reported that there was considerable variability in the quality of information, advice and guidance provided. In a 2010 survey by the Edge Foundation, 51% of young people reported that information, advice and guidance is not meeting their needs. The Government want to restore a focus on independent, professional careers guidance for young people and adults which is based on accurate labour market information and strong evidence about the impact of individuals&#8217; decisions on their future prospects.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.3/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)&#8217;s most recent Annual Opium Survey, published in December 2010, reported that the potential opium production in Afghanistan was 3,600 metric tonnes, down from 6,900 metric tonnes in 2009. The UNODC has predicted a slight fall in poppy cultivation in 2011 from last year&#8217;s level of 123,000 hectares&#8212;though it should be stressed that this is indicative only.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.8/3">(Yorks) (Mr Hague) met with non violent human rights defenders in Ramallah during his visit in November 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.8/4">The UK recognises the rights of Palestinians to protest peacefully against occupation including against the illegal route of the separation wall that cuts into the west bank, often severing villages from land on which their livelihoods depend. Peaceful protests form an important element of the Palestinian Authority&#8217;s two-year plan published in August 2009. This plan was explicitly supported by the 27 member states of the European Union in the December 2009 conclusions of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.</p>

In addition, screening of donated platelets for evidence of bacterial infection should be in place in England and North Wales by April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.2/3">In addition to these steps, any suspected or confirmed serious adverse reactions arising from the transfusion of blood or blood components (including viral or bacterial infection from blood platelets) must be reported to the haemovigilance unit of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.9/2">We are advised that NHS Brighton and Hove PCTs activity levels for diabetic retinopathy screening services have increased over recent years. In 2010-11, the PCTs diabetic retinopathy screening has not been able to meet the increasing demand and a backlog of patients being invited for screening has developed. The reasons for this are a reduced screening service capacity in 2010-11 because of a number of difficulties including problems around recruitment and staff taking unplanned leave.</p>

In this respect the aspect of encouraging junior doctors to participate in management and leadership training is only indirectly referred to. For example, by using more simulation in training, doctors will be able to develop skills around teamwork, leadership and management.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.12/2">Medical Education England has identified leadership as a unifying theme across its professional advisory boards, and this will help ensure that it is included in training throughout the professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.12/3">Medical Education England has developed an action plan to implement the recommendations of the Temple report known as &#8220;Better Training, Better Care&#8221;, which will implement changes in clinical practises resulting in better supervision of trainees and increased consultant presence on the wards.

	<p pid="a.82W.5/1">We are informed by the chair of Monitor (the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) that Monitor does not hold or collect data on either the proportion of foundation trusts that hold board meetings in public; or on the proportion of foundation trusts which publish their board agendas, papers and minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/2">However, foundation trusts should follow a policy of openness and transparency in their proceedings and decision making. &#8220;The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance&#8221;, produced by Monitor, sets out a framework for good governance and encourages openness from the board. The code also encourages foundation trusts to hold a meeting of their membership at least annually. Foundation trusts must either comply with the code, or explain clearly the reasons why they do not do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.5/3">The Department is committed to making the national health service more transparent and accountable to patients and the public it serves. The measures we are taking in the Health and Social Care Bill would strengthen the accountability of foundation trusts and their directors to governors, the majority of whom are elected by the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.86W.6/1">In setting out the framework for the Affordable Homes Programme, the Government have made clear that the programme must take account of local priorities, which in some areas will include the provision of family-sized homes.

	<p pid="a.86W.6/2">The new homes bonus will also encourage local authorities to meet the housing need in their areas, including the housing need of families, by matching the council tax for the following six years. Family homes will tend to be in a higher council tax band than smaller houses or flats. In addition, every affordable home built will receive an additional premium of &#163;350 per year, up to around 36% more than for an equivalent market home.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.6/1">Gift aid transitional relief was introduced as a temporary measure to give charities time to prepare their financial plans in response to a lower rate of relief from gift aid. By April 2011, when the relief ends, charities will have had four years since the announcement of the 20% basic rate of income tax to prepare for the change. In 2009-10 charities benefited by &#163;105 million from this relief and it is forecast that they will benefit by &#163;120 million in 2010-11. The Government believe the &#163;100 million transition fund announced in the spending review will better target support on charities most in need.</p>

Cycling England was reviewed as part of the coalition Government's commitment to radically increase the transparency and accountability of public services and reinvigorate the public's trust in democracy. The Government's approach was based on the presumption that state activity, where needed, is best undertaken by bodies that are democratically accountable at either national or local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/4">We also believe that the Government's move towards localism, and particularly in this regard the nature of the new Local Sustainable Transport Fund, for which all local transport authorities outside London are eligible to bid and for which we expect bids for cycling related projects, means that the rationale for a body like Cycling England has weakened. I would however like to acknowledge the good work the organisation has done during its existence.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.5/6">4.15.2 Government policy is to ensure that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project development. Where applications for development consent for infrastructure covered by this NPS relate to potentially &#8216;critical&#8217; infrastructure, there may be national security considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.5/7">4.153 DECC will be notified at pre-application stage about every likely future application for energy NSIPs, so that any national security implications can be identified. Where national security implications have been identified, the applicant should consult with relevant security experts from CPNI, OCNS and DECC to ensure that physical, procedural and personnel security measures have been adequately considered in the design process and that adequate consideration has been given to the management of security risks. If CPNI, OCNS and/or DECC are satisfied that security issues have been adequately addressed in the project when the application is submitted to the IPC, it will provide confirmation of this to the IPC. The IPC should not need to give any further consideration to the details of the security measures in its examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.5/8">4.15.4 The applicant should only include sufficient information in the application as is necessary to enable the IPC to examine the development consent issues and make a properly informed decision on the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.5/9">4.15.5 In exceptional cases, where examination of an application would involve public disclosure of information about defence or national security which would not be in the national interest, the Secretary of State can intervene and examine a part or the whole of the application. In that case, the Secretary of State may appoint an examiner to consider evidence in closed session, and the Secretary of State would be the decision maker for the application.</p>

However, Government policy remains that we apply the 1998 ICNIRP guidelines in terms of the 1999 European Union (EU) recommendation for public exposure levels to EMFs. If the EU decides to revise its recommendation to member states based on the new 2010 ICNIRP guidance, then at that time the Department of Health will consider how that affects UK policy. If this policy changes as a result of the recommendation we will then look to review EN-5 to ensure that it is still relevant.</p>

	<p pid="a.116W.2/1">In 2010, provisional figures show that liquefied natural gas (LNG) accounted for 35% of UK gas imports, or around 16% of gross demand. The majority (around three quarters) of LNG imports came from Qatar, with the remainder largely sourced from Trinidad and Tobago, Algeria, and Norway.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/2">DECC assesses that there is not currently a significant risk of disruption to LNG operations in the above countries, or to major shipping routes. LNG operations and shipping through the Suez canal have continued uninterrupted throughout the recent unrest in Egypt and Tunisia, and LNG infrastructure is well protected. The UK has low direct dependence for gas on countries in the middle east and north Africa (MENA) region, and any loss of LNG supplies from MENA countries could be replaced by alternate sources. This analysis is regularly reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.116W.2/3">In terms of the security and resilience of LNG operations in the UK, the Government have in place a resilience programme to reduce the vulnerability of important national assets, including energy assets, to disruption either from natural hazards or other threats, including acts of terrorism.

	<p pid="a.122W.5/1">Eligibility for disability living allowance is based on care and mobility needs. The current assessment for disability living allowance is subjective and inconsistent. We want to ensure support is targeted on those disabled people who are most impacted by their health condition or impairment. Personal independence payment will support disabled people to lead full, active and independent lives and the assessment will consider their ability to carry out a range of key day-to-day activities. We are developing the assessment with a group of independent specialists in health, social care and disability. It is still being developed and the detailed criteria will be set out in regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.5/2">From 2013-14 we will begin a managed programme to reassess the existing DLA working-age caseload and transfer people to personal independence payment. We want to use the experience of reassessing the working-age caseload to inform any future decisions on arrangements for children and people aged over 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.5/3">The costs of implementing a new benefit will depend on the detail of how the benefit is delivered and the design of the new assessment. Costs will be refined as</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.5/4">further detail on the reform is developed. The disability living allowance reform impact assessment, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-16">16 February 2011</phrase>, estimated approximate high level costs to be &#163;675 million over five years (real terms, net present value). These include provision for making changes to the IT systems, training DWP staff, the administrative effort required to manage the transition of existing recipients to the new system and the cost of independent health care professionals undertaking the new assessment. As the new assessment for personal independence payment and the process for reassessing the existing DLA case load are still being developed, I am unable, at this stage, to provide a precise estimate for the cost of reassessment alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.123W.2/1">The Government are putting in place a much more flexible, personalised approach to helping people back into work, which begins with Jobcentre Plus. From April 2011 the support that Jobcentre Plus delivers to customers across all working age benefits (JSA, ESA and IS) is changing. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will have more flexibility to judge which interventions will help its customers, tailored to personal and local labour market needs. To support this Jobcentre Plus are introducing a suite of measures bringing together communities, the voluntary sector, business people and employers, to help get people back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/2">The Government are also implementing a new Work Programme from this summer, which will help a wide range of customers move into sustained employment. Work programme providers will not be required to deliver centrally specified support, which may be inappropriate for many customers, but instead will be given the freedom to innovate and develop personalised support. In return for this freedom, they will be paid on the basis of the results they achieve. We will offer providers higher rewards for supporting harder-to-help customers into employment, to ensure that it is worthwhile for providers to help all customer groups. We will also reward providers for keeping customers in employment, to help meet our aim for sustained employment outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.2/3">Jobseeker's allowance customers will become eligible for the Work Programme from 12 months into their claim if they are aged 25 years or over, from nine months into their claim if they are aged 18 to 24, and from three months into their claim if they are disadvantaged in the labour market.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.0/1">Under the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, victims of certain serious violent and sexual offences, where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more, may elect to receive information about key developments in the offender's sentence through the Victim Contact Scheme operated by probation trusts. Such key information will include where offenders are moved to open conditions, where they are granted a work placement in the community for rehabilitation and the month of release from prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.0/2">Eligible victims are able to make representations about conditions which may be attached to the offender's licence on release and under probation supervision. They can, for example, request that the offender is excluded from a particular area, such as where they (the victims) live.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.0/3">The scheme is flexible enough to allow probation trusts, in exceptional circumstances, to provide key information to victims who do not meet the statutory criteria. Such circumstances might include, for example, domestic violence cases where the offender was given a sentence of less than 12 months, but where the victim wishes to opt in, even though such an offender would not be subject to licensed supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.0/4">The statutory scheme provides for the available resources to be directed primarily towards the victims of the most serious violent or sexual offences, where the offender is to be on licensed supervision following release and where victims might make representations about licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.0/5">However, there are other sources of support and advice for victims where the offender receives a short sentence. The police are notified of all prisoner releases by the National Offender Management Service and are, therefore, in a position to take appropriate action to protect victims who may be at risk and to support those who express concern about their personal safety. This could include notifying victims of an offender's release.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.0/6">For victims of domestic violence in particular, the police may arrange to manage the case through the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) process. It would be open to the MARAC to put in place measures to protect a victim or potential victim, including providing information about an offender's release.</p>

	<p pid="a.142W.12/1">The budget for probation trusts is planned to reduce by 10% over the comprehensive spending review period. The National Offender Management Service does not expect that this budget reduction will have an impact on reoffending rates. The Ministry of Justice is clear that probation trusts must deliver savings by streamlining administration and delivering services more effectively. Funding must be focused on maintaining front-line services, to protect the public and reduce reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.143W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office have not made a specific assessment of the impact of reductions in probation, police and court budgets in Lewisham and Croydon on rates of arrest and conviction over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/2">The Ministry of Justice has been clear that a large part of the savings required by the spending review settlement will be achieved through improvements in efficiency and cutting administration, while maintaining current performance. In terms of police funding, the Government allocate funding to police authorities as a whole but it is only right that decisions about the use of resources are made locally. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner and the Police Authority are better placed to judge local need and prioritise resources accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">The Ministry of Justice will be monitoring a number of trends and impacts in Lewisham and Croydon over the next two years, as part of the evaluation of a project to test a local approach to payment-by-results. The approach will be tested from April 2011 across a number of London boroughs, including Lewisham and Croydon, and in Manchester city region, as announced in the Ministry of Justice Green Paper, &#8220;Breaking the Cycle&#8221;. The approach aims to share the savings if a local area is able to reduce demand on criminal justice services. The savings could then be reinvested in further reoffending prevention activity at the local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.2/2">The civil procedure rules state that all claims for the repossession of land must be commenced in the district in which the land is situated.

	<p pid="a.144W.5/1">The table shows the numbers of claims leading to orders being made for the repossession of property in the Bury St. Edmunds constituency and Suffolk county by mortgage lenders in each year since 2000 and landlords in each year since 2003. Data for previous years are not available due to the lack of valid postcodes.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.5/2">These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This is more accurate than the number of orders, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. It is also a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.5/3">These figures do not indicate how many properties have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order, such as where borrowers hand the keys back to the lender. Also, not all possession orders result in repossession. Many orders are suspended and if the borrower complies with the repayment arrangements set out in the suspended order the property will not be repossessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.146W.3/3">The Government do not disclose their legal advice. Disclosure of legal advice has a high potential to prejudice the Government&#8217;s ability to defend their legal interests&#8212;both directly, by unfairly exposing their legal position to challenge, and indirectly by diminishing the reliance they can place on the advice having been fully considered and presented without fear or favour. Neither of these is in the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.3/1">An export licence is required to export arms and other military equipment from the United Kingdom. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria taking account of all prevailing circumstances at the time of the application. A licence will not be issued where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria or other relevant announced commitments. In particular criterion two concerns the &#8216;respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination&#8217;, and states that the Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. If a re-export of concern comes to light we can and do factor that in to our assessment of subsequent licence applications for similar goods to that destination.</p>

Linked to this, UKTI is developing a new strategy as part of the Government's growth review. This will set out new priorities for trade promotion. It is through these activities this Department encourages businesses new to exporting to discover and seize international opportunities, and more experienced exporters to improve their exporting capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/3">UKTI services are delivered through a network of international trade advisers in England, partner organisations in the devolved Administrations, sector specialists in the UK and staff in 96 overseas markets. In 2009/10, UKTI provided significant help to some 23,600 exporters generating over &#163;5 billion of added value to the UK economy. UKTI has an ongoing and active programme of support for the UK manufacturing sector, in partnership with numerous stakeholders, including organising UK groups at overseas trade shows, leading targeted trade missions and bringing potential buyers and decision-makers to the UK to see our manufacturing capability first-hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/4">The Government are also launching four new products to support exporters that will be offered by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) alongside its existing facilities and services. The new products are: a bond support scheme; a more simple credit insurance product; an export working capital scheme; and a foreign exchange credit support product. With the launch of these new products, ECGD is widening the range of eligible exports it will support, which was previously confined to capital and semi-capital goods and services.</p>

	<p pid="a.149W.2/1">Under the Companies Act 2006 companies must disclose in their accounts certain information about any subsidiary undertakings including the location of any overseas. Alternatively, where that requirement would result in excessively lengthy notes to the accounts, provide the detail in an appendix to the company&#8217;s annual return.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/2">Companies House has delegated authority to give notice to companies whose accounts appear to be defective. Companies House will pursue those companies that fail to comply with the notice or provide a satisfactory explanation.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/3">If necessary, the Financial Reporting Review Panel (FRRP)&#8212;part of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)&#8212;has delegated authority to apply for a court order requiring the directors of the company to prepare revised accounts or a revised report. If the company continues to contravene and is found guilty, the court could impose a fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/4">Each case is dealt with on its merits and prosecution would only be used is cases of persistent and wilful failure to comply with the legislation. To date the FRRP has never had to apply to court for an order requiring revision of accounts or reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.149W.5/1">Standardisation of the prequalification process features frequently in my discussions with the construction industry, particularly with those bodies representing small firms in the sector. The National Specialist Contractors' Council estimate that completing multiple prequalification questionnaires costs the industry &#163;250 million a year, much of which could be saved. The industry is very supportive of the PAS91 approach and is working with Government to ensure the standard is widely adopted. We would expect to review the standard early next year in the light of a year's experience of its use in the public sector and more widely.</p>

These controls require Departments to adopt a common, disciplined commercial approach to the use of the estate. These build on the success of the Lease Moratorium introduced in May 2010, which to-date has reduced property costs by around &#163;50 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.155W.5/1">The overall framework of the UK export licensing system is closely scrutinised by the Committees on Arms Export Controls and detailed information about export licensing decisions is published in the Government&#8217;s annual and quarterly reports on Strategic Export Controls. Given the volume of licences issued each year and the need for exporters to respond promptly to business opportunities, I do not think it would be practicable to have prior parliamentary scrutiny for arms export licensing decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.161W.2/3">However, around 585 prisoners made a claim in the domestic courts for compensation and/or a declaration that their rights were infringed by the fact that they were denied the right to vote in the May 2010 general election. The Government successfully applied to the High Court to strike these cases out, on the basis that damages cannot be awarded in the domestic courts under the Human Rights Act for a failure to introduce compatible legislation. The judgment was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-18">18 February 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.161W.2/4">In addition, UK prisoners have made claims to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. I understand that as at the beginning of February 2011, the European Court of Human Rights had received approximately 3,500 claims from UK prisoners unable to vote in elections. The Court has suspended consideration of these claims on the basis that the Government will implement the Hirst and Greens and MT judgments. The Government have sought to refer the Greens and MT judgment against the UK to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. If the Grand Chamber agrees to the referral, they will look again at the case and issue their own judgment. How the suspended claims are dealt with may depend on whether the Grand Chamber decides to accept the referral.</p>
