Employees will be entitled to 20 days paid holiday, plus the eight statutory holidays, and five days sick pay after a standard qualifying period. There will be a further rise in the basic rate in October 2006. The two parties have agreed to work together within the terms of the current contract to seek to identify further efficiency savings acceptable to the parliamentary authorities, with the aim of funding a further rise in the basic hourly rate to &pound;6.70 an hour in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking if he will list the Jobcentre Plus offices which <i>(a)</i> closed and <i>(b)</i> have had reductions in opening times of over one day per week since 1st January 2005. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/4" class="indent">It may help if I first explain that the majority of our Jobcentre Plus offices are open from 9am to 5pm, Monday-Friday. There will however be occasions when we adjust our opening hours to meet the demand for our services. For instance, during January many of our services were open for longer than their usual hours, including weekends, to ensure that we maintained customer service and benefit processing during some of our busiest times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/5" class="indent">In some circumstances, we do also take the decision to reduce the number of hours that some of our Jobcentre Plus offices remain open. This may be appropriate where we deliver some services from other premises in the area and need to fit with their opening hours. Elsewhere we will reduce opening hours if demand does not warrant full opening hours. We of course keep office opening hours under regular review to ensure we give a good service to our clients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/6" class="indent">Our modernisation programme is opening up new ways for clients to access and use our services. For instance, customers are now able to receive advice on jobs and benefits over the telephone and on the internet. These improvements do enable us to look more flexibly at the service we deliver through our Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/7" class="indent">Creating Jobcentre Plus out of two separate services has enabled us to rationalise our outlets and so far, 130 offices are no longer required. 36 offices have reduced their hours in response to customer demand. The information on sites specifically affected has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.2/8" class="indent">I must apologise as we were previously unable to provide this information, specifically in response to your earlier Parliamentary Question (PQ 18416).</p>

	<p pid="b.1194W.2/1">The cost of providing water coolers and bottled water at meetings cannot be separated without disproportionate cost. A total of sanitisation costs of some of &pound;146,595 was spent on these two costs around 1,000 DfT central and agency sites. This includes the maintenance, servicing and the water coolers at DfT regional sites. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency do not record the purchase of bottled water separately from other refreshments and cannot confirm the amount spent without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1200W.12/1">Research undertaken for the Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, showed that a national road pricing scheme could potentially reduce congestion by some 40 per cent. with benefits of up to &pound;12 billion a year in time savings and increased reliability. But moving to a national system of road pricing would be a huge and complex task. That is why the study recommended that local or regional schemes should be used to pilot approaches to road pricing. A copy of the study report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.12/2">The Government are working with local authorities to develop a major pilot in the next four to five years. Because the development of these schemes will be a complex undertaking the Government has made &pound;18 million of pump priming funding available between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08 to help support the work of local authorities in developing local demand management schemes.

	<p pid="b.1211W.5/3">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning services, including speech therapy services for children, to meet the health needs of their local population. In the current financial year, PCTs in Cumbria and Lancashire received resource revenue allocations totalling &pound;2 billion, with the two PCTs covering Westmorland and Lonsdale receiving a total of &pound;413.3 million. By 2007&ndash;08, the total resource allocation to PCTs in Cumbria and Lancashire will have increased to &pound;2.8 billion, with the two PCTs covering Westmorland and Lonsdale receiving &pound;528.8 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211W.9/1">DFID recognises that eclampsia is an important cause of maternal and neonatal death and disability. DFID provides most of its health-related assistance through non-earmarked Poverty Reduction Budgetary Support (PRBS) or ear-marked health sector support. Funds are not generally allocated against specific medical conditions, so it is not possible to specify the amount for tackling eclampsia in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211W.9/2">To prevent and treat eclampsia, women need an integrated health service with facilities and staff for antenatal and obstetric care, emergency referral to specialists and surgeons when they are required, reliable equipment and access to the right drugs. DFID funding supports country governments' plans to develop and strengthen their health systems. The aim is to improve access to all health services, including those for ante-natal and obstetric care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211W.9/3">DFID is committed to a year-on-year increase in spending on maternal health. DFID's bilateral expenditure (excluding spend through general poverty reduction budget support) on programmes marked as contributing towards improving maternal health has increased by 34 per cent. over the last three years (and by 41 per cent. if reproductive health services which contribute to reducing maternal mortality are included).</p>
	<p pid="b.1211W.9/4">To complement our country level support, DFID also channels funds though the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). In 2005&ndash;06, DFID has provided &pound;20 million core funding and &pound;10 million specifically for reproductive health.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212W.2/1">Fair and sound property rights are essential for growth, investment and poverty reduction in Africa. DFID works both to improve the business environment to boost private sector investment and create jobs and to secure the investments and livelihoods of poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.2/2">DFID is helping Governments and other non-Government groups with land rights and administration in countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Lesotho, Rwanda, Swaziland, Botswana, Angola and Mozambique. This support is to improve poor people's access to land and property and enable them to secure their rights to land and property assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.2/3">DFID is also helping support an African Union Land Policy Conference to be held in Addis Ababa at the end of March, held with the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the Africa Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212W.2/4">DFID funds various programmes across Africa that aim to strengthen court systems and thereby enhance property rights. A major new African initiative, the Investment Climate Facility for Africa (ICF), has property rights as one of its priority areas and will substantially increase the support that DFID currently provides to property rights in Africa. DFID committed $30 million to this initiative in November 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.1215W.3/1">The UK has pledged &pound;359 million to the Global Fund for the period 2002 to 2008. Our contribution in 2005 was &pound;51 million, which brings our total contribution delivered to date, to &pound;159 million. Over the next two years, we have pledged to provide &pound;100 million to the Global Fund for 2006 and &pound;100 million for 2007 to support the fund's estimated resource needs of US$ 7 billion for this period. The two-year total of &pound;200 million represents 8.4 per cent. of the total pledged to date (i.e. &pound;3.7 billion) and 5.1 percent. of the US$ 7 billion total resource needs. This is above our gross national income (GNI) fair share and is consistent with our past support. The UK is currently the fourth largest donor for the period 2006 and 2007 (after France, the US and Japan) and the second largest in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1215W.3/2">There will be a mid-term review of the Global Fund's replenishment process in June. This will be an opportunity for the international community to review further the Global Fund's performance and urge new and existing donors to put in more money. The UK will continue its efforts to encourage additional support for the Global Fund, including from the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.11/1">I regularly meet the First Minister and discuss a range of issues including support for manufacturing in Wales. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Nick Ainger) has similar meetings with Welsh Assembly Government Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.11/4">The Assembly and its agencies provide a range of support to Welsh manufacturers. These include financial assistance, business advice, promoting innovation, for example the Technium programme, and initiatives to improve skills and promote entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.11/5">The Assembly works directly with the sector through the manufacturing task and finish group. The Assembly's Economic Development Minister announced at the Wales TUC manufacturing conference last October that there will be a Welsh manufacturing forum represented by a cross section from the sector, and is consulting on the detail. This initiative has been well received by the manufacturing sector in Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.8/48">The trend in both company liquidations and self-employed bankruptcies has been decreasing, with some fluctuation, since the last recession in the early 1990's. The 2005 figure of 12,893 company liquidations is just over half of the level reached in 1992 (24,425); self-employed bankruptcies in 2004 (the latest full year available) at 9,564 are less than half the level in 1992 (19,525). The latest available data for self-employed bankruptcies are for January-September 2005, where the 8,131 bankruptcy orders compare with 14,531 during the same period of 1992.</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.8/49">Since 1997, company liquidations have shown modest increases year-on-year until 2002 after which the figures fell in 2003 and again in 2004. The 2005 figure, while up slightly on 2004, is about the same as for 1997. Self-employed bankruptcies decreased year-on-year from 1997 to 2002, after which 2003 and 2004 saw small increases; the 2004 figure (at 9,564) remains, however, lower than in 1997 (11,269).</p>
	<p pid="b.1221W.8/50">When compared with numbers of companies on the Companies House active register, the rate of company insolvencies has been falling from Q3 1992 to Q4 2005; the latest figure of 0.7 has remained the same for the last six quarters and compares to that of 2.6 for Q3 1992. The equivalent rate during the second half of 1997 was 1.2.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.5/1">The communication specialists at DTI adopt an industry accepted definition of the marketing mix which can include direct mail, paid-for advertising, use of non-news media and promotional items.

During the second JETCO meeting, Ministers Nath and Johnson asked their officials to continue conduct a six monthly review of the JETCO process.

	<p pid="b.1227W.5/1">The options to increase narrative reporting requirements and the associated costs of these were fully considered in the final regulatory impact assessment (RIA) that accompanied the Companies Act 1985 (Operating and Financial Review and Directors' Report etc.) Regulations of March 2005 which was the subject of extensive consultation in summer 2004. No further RIA was considered necessary because the information provided in the original RIA was used by the Government to adjust its decision. In deciding to repeal the OFR, the Government chose one of the original options rather than another, and did not consider that a new RIA was necessary. Relevant Departments were consulted before the decision to repeal the OFR requirement was taken.</p>

The Draft Northern Area Plan, published May 2005 is also a material consideration in determining planning applications and affords protection to the castle and its surrounding area by two designations. The first is as a Local Landscape Policy Area. This seeks to prevent proposals liable to adversely affect features that contribute to the environmental quality, integrity or character of the area. The second is as an Area of Archaeological Potential. This highlights, for prospective developers, areas where it is likely that archaeological remains will be encountered in the course of development. Where remains are found, PPS 6 provides policies for their safeguarding and management. The Castle Environmental Park is a major area of existing open space which is protected by another Planning Policy (Statement 8 Open Space and Recreation). A small part of this park is within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.2/1">The growth potential of the London-Stansted-Cambridge area was identified as part of the previous Regional Planning Guidance for the wider South East in 2001. The Sustainable Communities Plan, &quot;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&quot;, published February 2003, established the London-Stansted-Cambridge growth area, and it was extended to cover Peterborough in January 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.2/2">The draft East of England Regional Spatial Strategy was published by the East of England Regional Assembly in December 2004. Following public consultation, the draft Plan is currently subject to Examination in Public by an independent panel. Once Government receives the panel's report it will consider the recommendations, including any relating to the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough growth area.</p>

This evaluation, &quot;Modelling the initial effects of the climate change levy&quot;, concluded that the levy is effective and should save over 3.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010. In particular, Cambridge Econometrics concluded that the announcement effect of CCL in Budget 1999 will, in combination with the price effect, have reduced energy demand in the commerce and public sector by 14.6 per cent. by 2010. Cambridge Econometrics attribute most of the emissions savings to the announcement effect. However, because these two effects interact in CE's model, it is not possible to apportion precise carbon savings to either effect in isolation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267W.6/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) aims to complete all disclosure applications within the shortest time possible, but recognise that there may be some applications which take longer than others to complete. Factors that may influence the time taken to process applications include, but are not restricted to, incomplete or inaccurate application forms that require further information from the applicant or counter-signatory; the existence of criminal record information or other relevant non-conviction information and, for enhanced disclosures, the performance of disclosure units within police forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.2/1">Data concerning the average time taken to complete a disclosure are not a performance target and are not routinely collated by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). However, the bureau has calculated that during 2005 it took on average 31.5 days to complete all enhanced disclosures; although this figure does include time out with the customer, where applications were returned for correction or clarification. In such circumstances the CRB cannot control when an application will be returned in a fit condition to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/2">The CRB operates to a set of published service standards (PSS), which are to process 93 per cent. of standard disclosure applications within two weeks and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosure applications within four weeks. The proportion of standard checks completed within PSS was 99.4 per cent. and the proportion of enhanced checks completed within PSS was 85.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/3">For enhanced disclosures, CRB are expected to complete their part of the checking process in 90 per cent. of cases in 12 days before referring these applications to local police forces for them to complete their part of the checking process against local intelligence databases. The CRB has consistently exceeded its targets in processing disclosures up to the point at which they are referred to police forces. In December 2005, the latest period for which information is available, CRB processed 95.8 per cent. of valid enhanced applications to the police within six days of receipt. This has provided forces with considerably more time to complete their checks within the PSS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/4">In 2005, the bureau received 293,615 standard disclosures and 2,443,207 enhanced disclosures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.5/1">The information requested by my hon. Friend is not available from the Criminal Records Bureau. It is solely a matter for a recruiting organisation to determine whether information revealed on a standard or enhanced disclosure indicates that an individual is unsuitable for a position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.5/2">However, a CRB-commissioned MORI customer research programme showed that in 2004, over 20,000 unsuitable people were prevented from gaining access to children or vulnerable adults, as a direct result of CRB checks. Many more unsuitable people were deterred from applying to work with children and the vulnerable as a direct result of a requirement for a CRB check.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271W.2/1">There is a broad consensus arising from reviews of reputable scientific literature, consultations with anti-fraud and biometric experts as well as communication with other biometrics schemes. It indicates that supervision of the enrolment process and the implementation of anti-spoofing technologies can counter the &quot;spoofing&quot; of a biometric which in any case is very difficult to achieve. Furthermore, these consultations also indicate that the use of multiple biometrics, as envisaged in the Identity Card Scheme, will provide further protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.2/2">As noted in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>, the Identity Card Scheme will have a supervised enrolment process and the systems proposed by the various manufacturers during procurement, to meet the scheme requirements, will be rigorously tested to ensure risks from fake biometrics are adequately mitigated. Work with experts and other schemes to counter such threats will continue through this process. Such issues will also be independently scrutinised in order for the Scheme to achieve official security accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.2/3">The Scheme is consulting with biometric identity card and border control schemes that use, or propose to use, facial, fingerprint or iris biometrics as part of their operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271W.5/1">The security of EU travel documents and passports is an important issue and there have been a number of discussions with EU counterparts on the matter. The UK has participated regularly in discussions with member states in EU working and technical groups concerning the development of biometric passports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.5/2">The Council regulation on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by member states requires biometric facial identifiers to be included in passports by August 2006. It is anticipated that the Council will shortly make a decision on the date from which biometric fingerprints should also be included in passports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.5/3">The UK has been excluded from the regulation but we are mirroring the provision and challenging our exclusion in the European Court of Justice. The Home Office has not received any representations from IT companies or businesses on mechanisms for identity verification in regard to e-passports. Identity cards have been discussed at bi-lateral meetings with Justice and Interior Ministers of several EU states. In December 2005 the Justice and Home Affairs Council, acting intergovernmentally, adopted Council Conclusions on common minimum security standards for national identity cards which encompass the inclusion of biometric identifiers. The Identity Cards Programme has held individual meetings with over 90 commercial organisations during the course of consultations and market sounding on ID cards, and has engaged with many more organisations at conferences and other market events. These interactions have been carried out in accordance with procurement guidelines and best practice established by the Office for Government Commerce and most have been facilitated through working with Intellect, a UK based ICT trade association with over 1,000 members. Most of these organisations have commented in some way on security aspects of the scheme and several have commented on more specific operational and technology issues including security issues related to identification and verification. In particular, in October 2004 the programme ran a seminar specifically on verification issues and in December 2004 ran a seminar on security. Both of these seminars would have included representations on security issues related to verification. The seminars were hosted by Intellect. There were 35 commercial organisations represented at the verification event and 51 at the security event. A list of those represented is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1281W.2/2">An exercise has been carried for the household sector, for the period 1970 to 2001. The carbon changes are subject to a &quot;decomposition analysis&quot; into seven factors, two efficiency ones&mdash;reduced losses from the building envelope, and improved heating system efficiency&mdash;and five others which drive emissions both up and down&mdash;household numbers, level of energy service demand (e.g. for comfort, hot water), external temperature, the carbon intensity of grid electricity, and fuel switching by households. The changes are presented in terms of tonnes of carbon rather than shares of the net change. The results for the three decades are shown graphically, for each complete decade, to illustrate the longer term effects of the different factors, and eliminate the shorter term annual fluctuations. The table gives the annual changes from 1997 to 2001. The graph will be placed in the Library.</p>

Comparable work on indicators for the Industry and Services sectors is also under way but at a less advanced stage since energy use is much more complex, and energy efficiency technical measures more numerous, than in the household sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283W.2/1">A meeting is being arranged with the European Commission to discuss the sufficiency of the UK list of degraded raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), including the merits of Solway Moss and Bolton Fell Moss. I hope that this will result in the Commission coming to its final view this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/2">There are outstanding objections (including scientific ones) from the peat extraction operators on the criteria used for the selection of the two peat sites, principally concerning the composition of the topography and the restorability of the sites and their margins. English Nature is in discussion with the objectors to resolve these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/3">During the public consultation undertaken by English Nature on the proposal to designate these sites as Special Areas of Conservation for their degraded raised bog interest, objections were received from the peat extraction companies at each of the sites. Discussions aimed at resolving the objections included correspondence with the Secretary of State over the grounds for including these sites as Special Areas of Conservation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/4">Given the complex nature of the objections raised about the candidature of Solway Moss and Bolton Fell Moss, it is not possible to give a definite date for their resolution and subsequent conclusion of the consultation. Once concluded, and if Bolton Fell Moss and Solway Moss are required to be included as part of the UK list of sites of degraded raised bog sites within the UK, these will be designated as candidate SACs immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283W.2/5">Bolton Fell Moss Site of Special Scientific Interest has been assessed by English Nature as being in an unfavourable condition. As part of its overall work on the SSSI PSA target, which is to bring 95 per cent. of Sites of Special Scientific Interest into favourable condition by 2010, English Nature is identifying the works which need to be put in place, and by whom, to restore all unfavourable sites to a recovering or favourable condition. And it is in the process of discussing options to achieve this with interested parties. Overall the latest figures indicate that 70 per cent. of sites are now in favourable condition.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286W.5/1">Preparations are under way to consult on amendments to legislation that transposes the directive to clarify its application. New regulations will also be introduced to extend the application of the directive to marine areas beyond our territorial seas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.5/2">The UK has also done far more than most to address the policy objectives of the Habitats Directive (maintaining or restoring species and habitats favourable conservation status). We were the first country to designate and fully protect all 608 of its proposed special areas of conservation at the end of 2004. In addition, the Government have set itself a public service agreement (PSA) target of bringing 95 percent. of sites of special scientific interest into favourable condition by 2010. The latest figures indicate that 70 per cent. of sites are in favourable condition now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286W.5/3">The UK has also taken significant action to protect marine biodiversity. We were the first country to identify a truly offshore special area of conservation, the Darwin Mounds, and worked through the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure damaging bottom-set trawling in the area was banned. In 2004 the UK unilaterally banned pair trawling for sea bass in its waters, which was widely blamed for high numbers of dolphin and porpoise deaths.</p>

The allocation of funding for woodland creation in 2006&ndash;07 currently stands at &pound;7.4 million and like the current planting season some claims and payments for work in the 2006&ndash;07 planting season will not be made until the following financial year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1287W.8/1">There is no requirement on woodland owners to provide details of the area that they manage in accordance with the UK Forestry Standard. However, a very large proportion of actively managed woodland in England receives support from the Forestry Commission through its grant scheme agreements or is subject to a felling licence issued by the Commission. Recipients of grants and felling licences are expected to meet the UK Forestry Standard. The public forest estate is also managed to the UK Forestry Standard and has been independently certified under the UK Woodland Assurance Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287W.8/2">The Forestry Commission estimates that the area of actively managed woodland in both public and private ownership that meets the UK Forestry Standard is 470,000 hectares, which is 42 per cent. of the woodland in England.</p>

The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they use around their products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.5/3">The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.8/1">Waste Strategy 2000 set out national recycling and composting targets for household waste, of 17 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04, rising to 25 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06, then 30 per cent. in 2010 and 33 per cent. in 2015. Each local authority was also set a statutory target for 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 and to assure that further progress is made, I recently consulted on options for further recycling/composting targets in 2007&ndash;08. Analysis of the responses is under way and there will be a formal announcement once a decision is made. Provisional figures show more than a fifth (approaching 23 per cent.) of household waste in England was recycled, in 2004&ndash;05. Furthermore, waste disposal authorities have been set challenging landfill diversion targets for biodegradable municipal waste which will drive authorities to ensure that the recycling of this waste is maximised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.8/2">To support the attainment of these targets, Defra introduced the Household Waste Recycling Act in 2003 which provides that English waste collection authorities shall ensure, except in certain circumstances, that by the end of 2010 they collect at least two recyclable materials from doorsteps separate from the remainder of the waste. About two thirds of households in England now receive a kerbside collection of recyclable materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.8/3">In the Spending Review 2004 the Government announced an increase in the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services block of &pound;888 million over 2004&ndash;05, by 2007&ndash;08 and over the three-year period to 2005&ndash;06, authorities are also benefiting from a total of 294 million invested through Defra's Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund. Its successor, Defra's Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant, will run in parallel for the first year and provide a further &pound;260 million over the three years to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.8/4">Since 2002, Local authorities have also been assisted by targeted support and advice available through the Waste and Resources Action Programme and Defra's Waste Implementation Programme&mdash;which will continue to provide targeted assistance to authorities for a further two years and an announcement of its new programme will be made in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290W.8/5">For the longer-term, as part of the review of waste strategy, Defra is looking at what levels and what forms of targets will be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen in waste performance. The review will take into account existing policy levers designed to drive the management of waste up the hierarchy (such as the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, the landfill tax escalator, and the obligations on producers in relation to packaging and waste electrical and electronic equipment). The Government intend to publish a consultation document on the Waste Strategy review in the next few weeks, followed by a revised waste strategy in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1292W.8/17">A survey was recently completed for DTI to determine the quantity of tyres accepted into landfill in the UK during 2004 and the first 6 months of 2005. The survey sought information on whether tyres were being disposed or used for engineering purposes and whether in whole or shredded form. Tyres are also disposed to landfill as part of automotive shredder residue from end of life vehicles. I will place a copy of the survey in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.8/18">There are many ways of putting used tyres to good use, although broadly all of these can be defined as either reuse, recycling or recovery. WRAP (the waste and resources action programme) was established in 2001 in response to the Government's Waste Strategy 2000 to promote sustainable waste management. Its mission is to accelerate resource efficiency by creating efficient market for recycled materials and products. In 2005, WRAP began developing a discrete used tyres programme and is currently working on a series of projects and trials investigating the properties and potential applications of new products made from used tyre rubber.

	<p pid="b.1296W.2/1">The Gambling Act 2005 for the first time introduces new requirements on operators of all categories of gaming machines to ensure that gambling remains crime free, and that children and vulnerable people are protected. DCMS and the Gambling Commission are working with the industry and other interested parties to develop the relevant licence conditions and codes of practice that are needed to deliver these protections. The Gambling Commission and licensing authorities will be responsible for monitoring compliance with the new requirements once they are formally implemented in September 2007.</p>

I have also met with them separately on two occasions. ACRE responded to the consultation on the temporary event notice (TEN) regulations in September. ACRE'S main concerns relate to the limits associated with the new TENs regime and the difficulty for some volunteer-run halls in meeting the requirements for a designated premises supervisor when a licence includes alcohol sales. ACRE are conducting research into how village halls have adapted to the new regime since it came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase>. Their views, and any evidence they provide, are being fed into both our review of the statutory guidance and the Independent Review of Licensing Fees.</p>

These figures however, are merely a guideline and it is up to the national health service locally to decide how best to manage their services. Some hospitals operate at occupancy levels in excess of these levels while still delivering a high quality of care, patient safety and the key access targets.</p>

Studies in the review are specific to seasonal flu and do not affect our plan for pandemic flu. The findings to date are of little public health significance as the change to make the strain more resistant to antivirals also makes it less infectious.</p>
	<p pid="b.1312W.5/3">Tamiflu was chosen for the United Kingdom stockpile on the basis of independent expert advice that reflected its efficacy and ease of administration. Internationally, this is agreed as the product of choice. Our antiviral strategy is kept under constant review and we are looking carefully at alternatives as a possible back-up to Tamiflu.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.2/1">The independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP), under Sir William Stewart produced the Stewart Report in May 2000 and its principal conclusion in relation to exposures to radiofrequency radiation (RF) from base stations (masts) was that</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of the guidelines.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.2/3">A more recent report, 'Mobile Phones and Health 2004', reviewed measurements of exposures to radiofrequency radiation from masts (or base stations) made by Ofcom and by National Radiological Protection Board and noted that they were consistent with those available at the time of the Stewart Report 2000. These reports are available on the Health Protection Agency's website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.2/4">It had been noted that concern had been expressed about exposures to pulsed fields. However, a 'Review of Scientific Evidence for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields' (0&ndash;300 GHz) was published in 2004 (Docs NRPB Vol. 15 No. 3 2004) in support of its 'Advice to Government on Exposure Guidelines for EMFs'. This review included a consideration of possible biological effects of exposure to pulsed radiofrequency fields. Overall, no convincing and consistent evidence in support of low-level pulsed fields having detrimental effects was found.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316W.0/1">Mobile phone base stations and handsets comply with national and international guidelines that were introduced to prevent thermal effects from exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF). The guidelines have been based on extensive scientific reviews by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and, in this country, the Health Protection Agency (HPA). This includes consideration of non-thermal effects in tissues and a variety of pulsed signals at the levels normally encountered from mobile phone technology in use today. Independent measurements near base stations (masts) have demonstrated that RF exposures are very much lower than the guidelines (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.0/2">In response to recommendations for continuing research, the mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has supported about 30 individual studies to investigate the potential health effects of RF exposures from mobile phone technology. A description of the programme and the individual studies is available on its website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a> The studies in the MTHR programme concentrate largely on the exposures from the mobile phone handsets because these exposures are considerably higher than those from base stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.0/3">Worldwide research is evaluated periodically by the WHO and the HPA's radiation protection division. The report, 'Mobile Phones and Health 2004', available on the HPA's website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>, noted that there are continuing concerns about the impact of base stations on health and well-being</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;despite the current evidence which shows that exposures of individuals are likely to be only a small fraction of those from phones&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.0/5">The report recommended</p>
	<p pid="b.1316W.0/6" class="indent">&quot;studies focused on ascertaining the exposure of people to RF fields&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.0/1">The net deficit for 2004&ndash;05 across the national health service was &pound;256 million, which includes the financial outturn of NHS Foundation Trusts (NHSFTs). The forecast outturn position for 2005&ndash;06, as submitted by NHS organisations at the mid-year point, is a net deficit of around &pound;620 million, excluding NHSFTs. The 2004&ndash;05 financial position and the 2005&ndash;06 forecast month six position for NHS organisations, excluding foundation trusts is available on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/2"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en">www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications /PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAnd GuidanceArticle/fs/en</a>?CONTENT_ID=4119175&amp;chk= JuzTDZ.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/3">Overspending and underspending by NHS bodies is carried into the following year, as part of the carry forward regime. This is operated by the Department at strategic health authority level (SHA), and SHAs have the authority to determine how the regime operates for organisations within their health economy. For this reason we do not know how much of the carry forward was applied to individual organisations, so it is not possible to distinguish between historical and recurring deficits for primary care trusts (PCTs) and SHAs. For the purposes of comparison, the turnover and financial position for all SHAs and PCTs for each of the last two years, 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/4">All NHS Trusts and PCTs should break even every year. Where an organisation has a historic deficit, the SHA can provide financial support to the organisations to allow them more time to break even whilst the recovery plan is implemented. SHAs have the responsibility for ensuring the organisations across its area are in financial balance every year, so to provide planned support to one organisation requires other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/5">All NHS organisations have minimum standards of quality they must deliver, including targets for maximum waiting times. These are dramatically better than the standards of the NHS in the past and there can be no trade-off between these quality standards and removing deficits. All areas of the country have seen dramatic improvements in care, and all areas of the country will continue to see improvements. Going further in a specific hospital cannot be achieved if it is unaffordable. This would, in effect, be one part of the NHS spending the money of another part of the NHS to deliver a better service, which is unfair on the other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/6">The Department allocated PCTs &pound;4.5 billion through primary medical services (PMEDS) funding arrangements in 2005&ndash;06, contributing towards the implementation of new general medical services (GMS) contract arrangements including out of hours and quality outcome framework (QOF) services for both GMS and personal medical services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/7">The latest available data, which is still being validated, is for 2004&ndash;05. This data indicates that PCTs are having to manage overspends on allocations around the quality outcome framework (&pound;200 million) and out of hours (&pound;100 million). This has been offset by lower than expecting growth in other areas, such as hospital elective activity and prescribing expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.0/8">The NHS has received record increases in funding, and the majority of PCTs are delivering improved services as well as living within their budget. Where organisations are failing to do this it is due to poor management, so there is no need to sacrifice the delivery of the required standards and targets to deliver financial balance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320W.2/18">The NHS and Community Care Act 1990 sets out the breakeven duty for national health service trusts as a requirement to breakeven &quot;taking one financial year with another&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.2/19">In agreement with the Audit Commission and other audit bodies, this has been clarified by the NHS Finance Manual as a requirement to breakeven over a three-year period, starting from first year of deficit. This period can be extended by agreement with the local strategic health authority (SHA) for up to five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.2/20">Furthermore, the accumulated deficit at the end of the financial year must be material for the trust to be deemed to have failed to breakeven in that year. Material has been clarified as meaning greater than 0.5 per cent. of turnover.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.2/21">Using these criteria, Medway NHS Trust has achieved its breakeven duty in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. Similarly, Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust achieved its breakeven duty in 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04; its three-year breakeven duty period therefore commenced in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.2/22">The remaining four trusts have all agreed extended five-year recovery terms with their SHAs, and therefore none are in breach of their statutory duty to break-even &quot;taking one year with another&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320W.2/23">Compliance with the statutory duty to breakeven is inextricably linked to improving financial performance. Various measures are taken to improve this, the most recent being the announcement of the turnaround teams. Details of the turnaround team process, and the organisations covered is available on the Department' website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot</a>?04/12/71/88/04127188.pdf.</p>
