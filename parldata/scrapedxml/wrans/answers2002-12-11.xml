	<p pid=".311W.11/1">The Department set out to consult as many interested parties as possible in conducting the bird registration review. We have therefore consulted all people who currently keep Schedule 4 birds. This includes zoos and bird parks, falconry centres and members of raptor groups. In addition, consultation took place through a number of umbrella organisations such as the RSPB, the RSPCA, the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the British Bird Council, the British Trust for Ornithology, the Hawkboard and the Countryside Alliance. We also issued consultation documents to conservation organisations and publishers of bird magazines and relied on them to cascade information to their members and readers. All Police Wildlife Liaison Officers in England and Wales were consulted. In all over 2,000 individuals and organisations were consulted through these mechanisms. Consultation documents were also available via the Department's website.</p>

The objective of section 7 of the Act was to support the conservation of our native wild birds by requiring those holding them to register them with the Department, and to fit them with a ring approved by the Secretary of State.

	<p pid=".314W.2/1">I am assured that there is no difference between the information held on the cattle tracing scheme website (CTS Online) and that held on the main database held by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). The online database is a copy of the main database.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/2">The differences that exist between the Government's central database and on-farm records represent those births, deaths and movements that the keeper has taken steps to record on one but not on the other. Our programme of on-the-spot farm inspections bring these differences to light and we work with keepers to sort their records out. Where serious discrepancies are found, individual animals or, in the worst case, the whole herd of cattle will have a movement restriction placed upon them until the problems are rectified.</p>

Both are committed to providing consistently high quality services that are valued by their customers. With the legislative requirement to cross-check common agricultural policy bovine subsidy claims against the cattle tracing system, it is essential that they work together to achieve these objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.5/2">A formal Service Level Agreement exists between the agency and the service and this is constantly reviewed. I understand that they have had a good working relationship in the past and they have liased extremely closely over recent months to ensure that the queries discovered during the cross-check exercise were resolved without referral to the industry where possible. Rural Payments Agency staff working at, and in conjunction with, the British Cattle Movement Service, examined over 150,000 cross-check queries during recent months.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.3/1">My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 27 to <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>. Ministers responsible for fisheries and farming issues in Scotland and Wales also attended and, together with the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, joined me at a short bilateral meeting with Commissioner Fischler on Friday morning at which we discussed the Mid-Term Review of the CAP.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/2">On fisheries, the main items discussed by the Council were reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and cod and hake recovery. The Presidency noted the positions of the member states on CFP reform and will now reflect on how to promote agreement at the December Council.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/3">On cod and hake recovery, the Commissioner outlined his revised strategy for securing cod recovery in the light of the recent scientific assessments. He envisages an 80 per cent. reduction in fishing effort for whitefish fishing, 40 per cent. for flatfish, 10 per cent. for industrial fishing and 5 per cent. for nephrops. The UK emphasised its commitment to securing stock recovery. On the other hand we emphasised our commitment to finding a package of measures which would enable sustainable fishing activity to continue while still achieving recovery. We stressed in particular the importance of the burdens resulting from recovery action falling equitably on all fleets whose activities impact on cod stocks. There will be further technical discussion at official level before the December Council.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/4">The Commissioner also made a first presentation of his proposed action plans on the social, economic and regional implications of EU fleet restructuring and on how to reduce discards of unwanted fish. These will return to the Council for further consideration after study by officials.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/5">The Council reached political agreement, by qualified majority, on rules for the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified (GM) food and feed. This was a difficult discussion. I eventually voted against the final compromise because it contained provisions regarding the adventitious presence and labelling of GM organisms that are neither practicable nor enforceable. I also had concerns about the legal base on which the proposal rested.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/6">There was a brief discussion of the measures forming part of a package addressing hygiene rules and their enforcement in respect of food of animal origin. Further work is planned at official level before the December Council.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/7">The Commission gave its regular report on BSE in the EU and reported contacts with the French Government over its plans in respect of Specified Risk Material (SRM) controls on sheep spinal cord. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary restated our concerns about the proposed French measures and strongly underlined our view that member states should not take unilateral action that goes beyond existing EU legal provisions and scientific advice.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/8">The Council continued its consideration of the Mid-Term Review of the CAP with a discussion concentrating on modulation, decoupling and cross-compliance. I welcomed the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals while noting that the EU needed to start work quickly on the detailed legislative texts which the Commission had promised for January. I recalled our opposition to certain features of the Commission's modulation model, including its unfair redistribution of modulated funds. I gave strong support to the principle of decoupling aid from production which would encourage farmers to focus more on markets and at the same time strengthen the EU's hand in the WTO negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.3/9">Under other business, there was discussion of animal welfare in third countries and the situation in Spain following the sinking of the oil tanker 'Prestige'. The Council also approved a state aid to Greek cotton producers.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.2/1">ENCAMS will play an important role in supporting the Government's agenda of improving the local environment and people's quality of life by running high-profile campaigns each year based around Local Environmental Quality and Litter issues.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.2/2">Campaigns planned for 2003 include a focus on fly-tipping, car litter, fly-posting and youth litter and these initiatives are in effect a continuation of the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign year on year.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.2/3">I met the director of ENCAMS, Alan Woods (Environmental Campaigns which is the current name of the Tidy Britain Group) today to discuss the organisation's work which is focused on making a real difference at a local level, which is where we need to influence public attitudes and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.2/4">In parallel to the Government's policy to make a significant impact on the antisocial behaviour, litter, graffiti and noise which spoils the quality of lives in so many places, ENCAMS has developed tools which help their local authority partners to target real local problems. These include a set of posters to challenge people who allow their dogs to foul local parks. Evaluation has shown that a significant improvement has been achieved in areas where these have been used as part of a local campaign. We are encouraging ENCAMS to spread information about successful local campaigns so that lessons learned can help to improve the quality of life for people in other areas too. This fits with efforts by Ministers in DEFRA, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Office to give a high profile to tackling quality of life issues nationally while promoting action at the local level in conjunction with the Local Government Associate and other partners.</p>
	<p pid=".316W.2/5">Joanne Whitaker, ENCAMS5 Director for the North West Region, would be more than happy to meet the hon.Member to talk about the future of local litter campaigns and programmes. More details of ENCAMS campaigns as well as promotional material can be obtained via their website: <a href="http://www.encams.org">http://www.encams.org</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".332W.9/1">The humanitarian situation is a matter of concern. But in 2002, good co-ordination and timely action by the Government of Ethiopia, donors and NGOs has prevented crisis from turning into disaster.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.9/2">The UK has played a significant role and committed #17.3 million to food and non-food humanitarian assistance in calendar year 2002. DFID has also provided nearly 20 per cent. of the EC contribution. We have also actively promoted and participated in continuous dialogue on the situation between Government, donors and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.9/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, a joint Government-UN appeal was launched for humanitarian assistance in 2003. The appeal identifies 11.3 million people as needing more than 1.4 million metric tonnes of food assistance and places a further 3 million under close monitoring. Such massive need has resulted from the impact of widespread drought on a highly vulnerable population with little capacity to cope with shocks.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.9/4">The scale of need has led to comparison with the famine of 1984. However, as reiterated by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during the appeal launch, no-one anticipates a repeat of the suffering experienced in 1984. A state of war existed in Ethiopia at that time which impeded the humanitarian response. In addition, Government, donors and NGOs have put effective systems of early warning and response in place that were absent in 1984.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.9/5">But there is no room for complacency. We remain committed to playing our part in responding rapidly to urgent humanitarian need. We also continue to support the Government of Ethiopia in tackling the underlying causes of food insecurity and protecting the vulnerable.</p>

As this contribution is unearmarked it is difficult to ascertain exactly how much of the #14 million is spent in the context of this specific refugee situation.</p>

	<p pid=".336W.5/1">The only solution to the humanitarian situation in Palestine is through political action, but we should not allow the increased human suffering of the Palestinian people to continue unaddressed. The UN has recently produced a plan of action to help the international community address the most urgent needs. We are supporting a broad range of emergency programmes through UNRWA, local NGOs and the World bank. In October, I agreed an additional #5 million from my Department's contingency reserve to meet the continuing urgent needs of the Palestinian people.</p>

Since the ceasefire, already over-stretched aid agencies have been able to access several thousand more severely malnourished people. The 2003 UN CAP states that 4.3 million Angolans depend on some form of humanitarian assistance and the WFP has raised its caseload figure of people requiring assistance to 1.9 million.

	<p pid=".348W.11/1">The publication of the White Paper, Time for Reform, in April 2000, was followed by a well-publicised, open public consultation announced in both Houses of Parliament and which resulted in 1,215 responses being received. Copies of the White Paper were specifically sent to those organisations, including a number of district councils, which had written to us with their views during the review that took place prior to publication and which raised issues relating to licensing generally. Salisbury District Council did not fall into these categories. The Local Government Association, with whom we had established a good working relationship, was also sent a copy of the White Paper with the expectation that they would consult their members, including all local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".349W.9/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent question about extending the speed limit south of Bayston Hill on the A49 Trunk Road.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.9/4" class="indent">There are a number of criteria that are used when deciding an appropriate speed limit, including the nature of the road and its surroundings, existing traffic speeds and the accident rate. The speed limit should appear reasonable to most drivers and have the support of the police, who have responsibility for enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.9/5" class="indent">The 30 mph speed limit through Bayston Hill was introduced in 1997 as part of a traffic calming scheme through the village. The length south of Bayston Hill is much more rural in character, there have been only two incidents in the last three years, resulting in two minor injuries. Most drivers would consider that a reduction in the limit there would be inappropriate for the conditions and it is unlikely that the police would support any change. In the circumstances, it would therefore be difficult for us to justify an extension of the limit.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.9/6" class="indent">That said, the Route Management Strategy for the A49 between Ross-on-Wye and Shrewsbury, which went out to public consultation earlier this year, is examining the appropriateness of all existing speed limits along the route, including Bayston Hill. Amongst other things, it will identify a short and long term programme of improvements and aim at a consistent speed strategy. If anomalies are found, changes will be made. A report is due early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.9/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like more information, the Agency's Route Sponsor for the A49, Dennis Wheeler, would be pleased to assist. He can be contacted at our offices at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8126.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.5/2">The first stage reductions should contribute a small but useful reduction in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions at a reasonable cost to manufacturers. With regard to the second stage reductions, while the Government welcome further measures for reducing motor cycle emissions, they considered that mandating a second stage of emissions reductions before its impact on the industry could be fully assessed was not in accord with the principle of better regulation, as reasserted in the Mandelkern Report and endorsed by heads of Government at the Barcelona European Council. While the UK did succeed in negotiating some relief for small manufacturers, support from other member states and the European Parliament for a review prior to any second stage implementation was not forthcoming. The Government therefore abstained from voting in the EU Environmental Council's third and final reading on this measure.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.5/3">The Department has been in contact with the UK industry throughout the negotiations and continues to do so in order to revise its regulatory impact assessment to take account of the second stage measures.

	<p pid=".354W.2/2">The records which would enable the movements of this vessel to be plotted over the last 10 years are not readily available. However, records of ship movements for the last five years have been placed in the House Libraries. These record sightings of the PRESTIGE and details of its entries into port. They indicate that the PRESTIGE has called three times at UK ports (Tees in October 1998 and at Tees Bay and Tees in May 1999). The database of inspections under the port state control system does not record ship movements but does indicate that the vessel was inspected in Hull in July 1995 and has not been inspected in a UK port since then.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/3">The movement and manoeuvring of vessels in harbours is the responsibility of the harbour authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/4">Since July 2002 the International Safety Management Code has applied to most vessels trading internationally. It is the international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/5">The UK was instrumental in securing international agreement to accelerate the phasing out of single hull tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight or more. Those having no additional protection must be phased out in order of age no later than the dates in the following timetable:</p>
	<p pid=".354W.2/6" class="indent">2003 for ships delivered in 1973 or earlier,</p>

	<p pid=".354W.2/11">Single hull tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight or more having a degree of additional protection, and all those between 5,000 to 20,000 tones deadweight, must be phased out in order of age no later than the following dates:</p>

	<p pid=".354W.2/25">Shipbuilding and shipowning are long-term commitments. Investment in the newer double hull tankers depends on the stability offered by this timetable.There is no evidence that reducing the size of oil tankers will improve safety. However, at the recent Transport Council, we agreed to invite a proposal from the Commission to accelerate the timetable for phasing out single hull tankers even further, and to consider how the carriage of heavy oil in single hull tankers might be restricted, with a view to reducing the risk of a spill from a single hull tanker even more.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.2/1">Information is not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.2/2">The Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) produced a report entitled long-term analysis of oil spill statistics for the waters around the British Isles 1964 to 1995. For this period there was a consistent and continuing decline in the numbers of beach pollution incidents accompanied by a significant reduction in reports of crude oil and tar in the marine environment, reductions in the annual totals of tanker-source pollution and reductions in the annual total number of incidents attributed to the handling and transportation of oil around the UK coastline.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.2/3">Between 1978 and 1999 the ACOPS annual data has reported 12,746 oil pollution incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.2/4">The recently published ACOPS annual survey report 2001 identified 678 accidental or deliberate polluting discharges from vessels and offshore installations operating in the UK pollution control zone. There was a downward trend identified in the annual number of oil discharges in the open sea (excluding discharges from offshore installations).</p>
	<p pid=".355W.2/5">Principal pollution incidents during the period 1990 to 2002 requiring a concentrated cleanup included the Braer in 1994 spilling 85,000 tonnes of crude oil, clean-up cost #52 million and the Sea Empress in 1996 losing 72,000 tonnes of crude oil, clean-up cost #39 million.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.2/6">Since 1995 the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has successfully prosecuted 10 ships, with an average fine of #20,000. This excludes prosecution by port authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".356W.2/1">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) undertakes regular aerial surveillance of the UK Counter Pollution Control Zone through a contract it has with Air Atlantique. In August 2000, the contract was revised and awarded as a MCA/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) joint contract, to provide 600 hours of programmed flying per year for the MCA to monitor pollution from shipping, and 300 hours for the DTI to monitor pollution from offshore installations. In addition to these programmed hours, the MCA has the capability to mobilise these aircraft at short notice to reports of pollution at sea.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.2/2">Although the allocated hours in the new contract did not change, it provides faster aircraft and has enhanced Side Looking Airborne Radar, which allows the aircraft to scan 20 miles either side of the aircraft, compared with 10 previously. The aircraft can typically survey 32,000 square miles in a five hour period of surveillance, compared with 14,000 square miles in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.2/3">The aircraft are therefore able to respond quickly to reported incidents over a wider area, increasing the chances of identifying offending vessels and gathering evidence for use in court.</p>
	<p pid=".356W.2/4">The MCA also commissioned a satellite oil spill sensing trial to assess whether satellites could be used to improve the detection and identification of polluters. Information from this survey was used to target surveillance aircraft to potential incidents in the survey area and surveillance flights were timed to coincide with reports from satellite imaging. The MCA are presently evaluating how this trial can be developed further to enhance their monitoring capability.</p>

	<p pid=".361W.5/8">Local authorities will continue to be able to provide support to asylum seekers under the National Assistance Act 1948 (or in Scotland the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968) but only where they are presently empowered to do so, ie where special needs have been identified so as to engage those provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".361W.5/9">Whether the particular types of case which are referred to will be eligible for support will depend on whether, on the particular facts of the case, the claim for asylum has been made as soon as reasonably practicable and, if not, whether the case falls within one of the exceptions referred to above.</p>

However, the vast majority of non-visitors are given limited leave to remain for periods of up to between one and five years.

	<p pid=".367W.5/16">The Prison Service has a duty of care to all prisoners in its custody, and recognises that self-harm is a particular problem among women offenders. The Prison Service is currently developing several interventions that may help female prisoners reduce and manage self-harm in prison. One such example is at Holloway prison, where all prisoners who have been identified as at risk of suicide/self-harm are offered individual crisis counselling. About 40 per cent of prisoners take up the offer, while others may be referred to alternative sources of help within the prison. Staff report that following counselling women have shown increases in self-esteem, decreases in depression and are less likely to see suicide or self-harm as the solution to their problems.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.5/1">Information on the number of under-18s held in prisons outside the juvenile estate is given in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/2">The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales is responsible for the placement of under-18s remanded or sentenced to custody. It is sometimes necessary for them to be placed outside the juvenile estate, and this is particularly so where girls are concerned. The number of girls in Prison Service custody is too low for them to be accommodated in juvenile-only accommodation whilst at the same time maintaining proximity to home and providing an appropriate level of educational and recreational services. The Board nevertheless seeks to avoid mixing as far as possible and is supporting the development of under-18 wings within larger women-only establishments.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/3">Occasionally, juveniles are held outside the juvenile estate for the duration of their trial if their case is being heard in a Crown Court without any conveniently located juvenile establishment. In such circumstances, they are held on young offender wings, ie with 18 to 20-year-olds rather than with adults as such. Even more exceptionally, a juvenile may be categorised as Category A and be accommodated in a high security establishment.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/3">Youth courts have jurisdiction to deal with summary only, triable either way and indictable only offences. Nearly all criminal proceedings brought against a child or young person are dealt with in a youth court. The main exceptions are:</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> homicide;</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> the juvenile is charged jointly with an adult and it is in the interests of justice that they be tried together;</p>
	<p pid=".371W.2/6" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> the juvenile is charged with a grave crime and the youth court considers that the greater sentencing powers of the Crown Court ought to be available.</p>

	<p pid=".374W.2/2">Jobcentre Plus maintains a continuous dialogue with the Department of Health through regular meetings of the Joint Service Development Group. Discussions about the most cost-effective way of establishing an NHS-wide e-recruitment service on the internet, and how that might be linked to and supported by the Jobcentre Plus website, are continuing. The Department of Health is currently assessing responses from potential suppliers to an invitation to tender for this work.</p>
	<p pid=".374W.2/3">Officials in Jobcentre Plus and the Cabinet Office are working together to improve existing internet-based services for recruitment to the Civil Service. That work is currently focused on identifying the resources needed to do the development work and on identifying an appropriate opportunity in the current programme of improvements to the Jobcentre Plus website to implement the changes required.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.2/2">The Government are determined to tackle unemployment and social exclusion both at home and throughout the European Union. Signing the social chapter has allowed us to influence the broad direction of EU social policy, and to ensure that employment creation has been put at the heart of the Lisbon agenda for economic reform. Since 1997, over 10 million new jobs have been created in the EU, 6 million of which have been taken up by women, and the number of unemployed has fallen by over 4 million. This has provided a route out of social exclusion for many millions of European citizens.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.2/1">There is no absolute requirement for ambulance crews to hand over patient records personally to a member of hospital staff.</p>
	<p pid=".384W.2/2">It is considered good practice for ambulance crews to provide information to nursing or medical staff when handing over a patient. While this does add to the time that the ambulance crew spend at hospital it is vital to patient safety and there is no reason why it should cause significant delays.</p>

	<p pid=".384W.5/2">The Government have welcomed the publication of this report. The Government recognise that there is still more to be done to ensure that the high standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why they commissioned the joint chief inspectors' report. It is also why my right hon. Friends, the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary, set up the statutory Inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death of Victoria Climbie. The issues raised by Victoria's case are wide-ranging, in terms of both policy and practice. The recommendations of the joint chief inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbie Inquiry will provide us with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made and if radical reform is necessary, we will implement it. The Government will respond to both reports after they have carefully considered them.</p>

	<p pid=".390W.2/1">The NHS Plan makes a commitment to substantially increase the national health service work force by March 2004. The numbers of consultants are expected to increase by 7,500, specialist registrar numbers by 1,000, general practitioner (GP) numbers by 2,000 and GP registrar numbers by 550 over a 1999 baseline.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/2">The latest forecasts for growth, set out in XDelivering the NHS Plan&quot;, expect the NHS to have net increases by 2008, over a 2001 baseline, of at least 15,000 doctors, both consultants and GPs.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/3">Between September 1997 and September 2001, the number of total NHS doctors increased by 11 per cent. and specialist registrar (SpR) numbers specifically also increased by 11 per cent. Between September 1997 and March 2002, the number of consultants and GPs increased by 23 per cent. and 3 per cent. respectively and GP registrar numbers by 42 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/4">In respect of consultants, we are not solely relying on the output from training to deliver a sufficient supply of applicants for consultant posts. We are implementing a range of measures to:</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/5" class="indent">Improve retention&mdash;through a flexible careers scheme and flexible retirement;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/6" class="indent">Identify and encourage suitable doctors on the specialist register to compete for posts;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/7" class="indent">Target action to reduce delay to certificate of completion of specialists training completion and encourage recent qualifiers to take up consultant posts;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/8" class="indent">Establish more part-time and job-share posts;</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/9" class="indent">Increase international recruitment, including government to government agreements, a global recruitment campaign and the international fellowship programme.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/10">With regard to SpR numbers, we have adopted a new approach to maximising the numbers of SpRs trained within existing resources. The current training system has been freed up by taking a service-led approach, which will meet educational needs. We expect this to result in substantial increases in SpR numbers beyond the 1,000 assumed in the NHS Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/11">We have also introduced a GP vocational training scheme for senior house officers in 2002, which has resulted in 84 appointments.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/12">To meet the GP targets, the Department has implemented a number of recruitment and retention initiatives, which include:</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/13" class="indent">golden hellos to new and returning GPs</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/14" class="indent">delayed retirement payments</p>

	<p pid=".400W.5/1">The inclusion of silicofluoride chemicals in a product does not necessarily make that product a medicinal product. Silicofluoride has many different uses and can therefore be subject to a number of different regulatory regimes. For example, various forms of fluoride can be included in oral hygiene products under the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations and some forms of fluoride will be permitted in food supplements through the forthcoming Food Supplements (England) Regulations. The decision as to whether a particular product is a medicinal product is made by the Medicines Control Agency using the definition of that term in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83, relevant legal precedent and its own published guidance. The MCA considers that neither fluoride added to drinking water nor the resulting fluoridated water are medicinal products which require marketing authorisations as medicines.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.0/1">Across the national health service 45 services are taking part in the wheelchair service collaborative programme to improve the service that they already provide. The collaborative will operate for approximately 18 months and it is hoped that the services will share their learning and experience in order to make specific improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".402W.0/2">Every service will have its part to play specifically in sharing good practice in particularly what works well for them and what could be adopted by other services to improve their own. Similarly there will be ideas that they in turn will adopt&mdash;hence the reference to everybody teaching and everybody learning.</p>
