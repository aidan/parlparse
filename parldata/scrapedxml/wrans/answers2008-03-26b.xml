DFID provides support to programmes in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that reduce conflict over water resources. DFID is also increasing funding to support countries to manage the effects of climate change, which will improve the management of water and reduce the risks of conflict as resources become more scarce.</p>
	<p pid="b.147W.2/2">In the Middle East, DFID provides support to the EXACT programme (part of the multilateral track of the Peace process), to improve regional management of groundwater pollution. In Sudan, DFID is providing &pound;1 million for the development of an integrated water resources management plan to improve co-operation over scarce water resources and help build sustainable livelihoods. We have provided &pound;14 million to the Nile Basin Initiative that supports co-operation among the countries that share the waters of the Nile. DFID has also recently agreed to provide initial funding to the South Asia Water Initiative to promote co-operation over water in one of the world's most volatile regions. We continue to consider other requests for support to improve the management of water to help reduce conflict at regional levels and in countries.</p>

We have asked the Chinese authorities for permission for an official, from our embassy in Beijing, to visit Tibet. We have expressed our concern to Chinese authorities both in Beijing and London and have urged them to respect fully the human rights of those detained; to avoid use of excessive force in dealing with riots; and to respect freedom of expression and religion in Tibet.</p>

	<p pid="b.166W.8/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1808W, about compensation for Porton Down veterans.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.8/4" class="indent">Solicitors on behalf of Porton Down veterans issued the Ministry of Defence (MOD) with a letter of claim on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March 2007</phrase> for alleged illnesses arising from non-therapeutic human experimentation conducted at Porton Down. 244 veterans claiming short term illnesses and 116 claiming long term illnesses formed a Group Action. The majority of claims relate to experiments involving nerve gas, mustard gas or riot control agents.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.8/5" class="indent">The matter has been resolved by way of mediation at which the MOD agreed to pay a global settlement of &pound;3 million in full and final settlement to the entire group of 360 veterans and to make an apology by way of a written ministerial statement in the House, which I did on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 26WS. The MOD has therefore paid all known claims from Porton Down veterans.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.8/6" class="indent">That said we recognise that more veterans, some of whom decided against joining the Group Action, might come forward. This is despite being assured by the Claimants' solicitors that the Group Action had been publicised and that those who remained in the group had been carefully selected on the basis that each had a meritorious claim for personal injury said to have been caused by exposure to a specific chemical warfare or treatment agent which was supported by expert evidence. I should make clear that the MOD did not compensate individuals for mere attendance at Porton Down.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.8/7" class="indent">Against this background, the MOD has decided that it will consider any additional meritorious claims that are made on or before <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2008</phrase>; after that date, the MOD reserves the right to plead a defence based on the provisions of the Limitation Act 1980.</p>
	<p pid="b.166W.8/8" class="indent">Any veteran now considering pursuing a claim for compensation might wish seek advice to establish whether they have a reasonable claim against the Department.

	<p pid="b.170W.2/1">In the Secretary of State for Transport's statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>, she outlined measures to improve the security of personal data in the context of the Cabinet Secretary's review of data across Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.2/2">She also advised that, to ensure greater clarity of responsibility, the Permanent Secretary had written to senior officials in the Department, including Agency Chief Executives, to draw their attention to current guidance on the application of the Data Protection Act. This includes the main principles of the Act, information on handling personal data appropriately and the role of the Information Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.2/3">Regulation 27(1)(e) of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002 requires the DVLA to release information to any person who can demonstrate 'reasonable cause' to have that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.2/4">The term 'reasonable cause' is not defined in legislation but the DVLA has always taken the view that release should normally be associated with road safety or events occurring as a direct consequence of the use of the vehicle. Everybody that applies for personal information is required to produce evidence that they have 'reasonable cause' for requesting the information.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.2/5">A full list of the circumstances that the DVLA has, in the past, considered to meet 'reasonable cause' has been published on the DVLA and Direct.gov websites. The website also contains a list of bodies that it has released information to and the names of companies that have approved conditional access (ACA) which allows companies to request and receive information via an electronic link.</p>

			<tr pid="b.177W.3/66"> <td colspan="3"><sup>(<i> 1 </i>)</sup><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. The Department has three main categories of consolatory payments. Where a person is found to have suffered gross inconvenience, embarrassment or severe distress as a result of maladministration a consolatory payment is made. Each case is judged on its individual merits and an award is made, as applicable, for each of these categories.<br/> 2. The Department does not retain details of the number of individuals who receive consolatory payments. Records are retained of the number of awards made under each of the above categories. Where, for example, a customer receives an initial award based on an early examination of a complaint he may later receive additional awards as a result of further investigation or under one of the other categories. The number of awards made therefore exceeds the number of individuals concerned.<br/> 3. The first table shows the entire sum awarded as consolatory payments by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and its predecessor, the Department of Social Security (DSS). The figures include those paid by agencies that were part of the Department at the relevant time.<br/> 4. The Pension Service, Jobcentre Plus and the Disability and Carers Service were formed in 2002, prior to this they were part of the Benefits Agency (BA).<br/>  5. Debt Management is not an Executive agency of DWP. A consolatory payment awarded because of maladministration by Debt Management is awarded by Jobcentre Plus.<br/> 6. The Rent Service (TRS) was formed in October 1999 as an Executive agency of the Department of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. TRS became an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions in June 2001. The Rent Service has not made any consolatory payments.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.179W.8/1">Most Department of Work and Pensions policies and programmes are aimed at individuals, with eligibility dependent on personal circumstances rather than where they live. This means that even without specific targeting the help provided by the Department is concentrated in areas facing labour market disadvantage. Over the last ten years, the biggest labour market improvements have been in the areas that started in the worst position.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.8/2">In addition to national programmes there is also a range of locally flexible support, such as the Jobcentre Plus Adviser Discretion Fund, the Deprived Areas Fund and the new Working Neighbourhoods Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.8/3">When determining how to deliver its services, Jobcentre Plus also considers the implications for rural and other areas. For example, support is provided not only through the Jobcentre network but also by telephone through the Contact Centre and Benefit Delivery Centre network as well as the internet. This allows all customers to access key services regardless of where they live. Where there are issues about the ability of customers to access Jobcentre Plus support, provision can be made for additional or more flexible arrangements. These include the installation of jobpoints in libraries, surgeries in third party premises, partnering in local authority outlets and, where practical, some mobile services.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.8/4">Taken together, the Department's approach helps to ensure that individuals in deprived communities across the country are able to get the help and support they need to move back into work. However, our new generation of employment programmes, including Pathways to Work and the flexible New Deal, will offer further scope for provision to be tailored to the needs of individuals in different geographical locations and those facing particular labour market challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.8/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December 2007</phrase>, we published 'Ready for work: full employment in our generation' which sets out the measures the Government will take to reach the goals of an 80 per cent. employment rate and working people with world class skills. The paper responds to the 'In work, better off' consultation exercise which ran from July to October 2007. A full assessment of the effects of those measures will be carried out as part of post-implementation evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.8/6">A key feature of the measures is the need to provide more flexible, responsive and individually focused employment and skills support. For example, by extending our use of private and voluntary sector organisations we will be making use of their knowledge of the challenges faced by particular groups or localities. They will be able to provide the right kind of support to individuals based on their particular circumstances, which could include issues related to where they live. Each contract will be evaluated as to its effectiveness throughout the duration of that contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.181W.0/1">Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) can be made, subject to an annual cash limit, where a person is entitled to housing benefit or council tax benefit and the local authority considers that person is in need of further financial help to meet any shortfall in their housing costs or council tax. The scheme is discretionary so it is up to local authorities to decide how they operate it, with any decisions on its use being made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.0/2">DWP cannot prescribe the circumstances in which an authority must make payments, but guidance has been issued to all local authorities setting out the conditions for entitlement to an award.

	<p pid="b.181W.0/3">In our revised guidance, due to be published shortly, we make it clear that a DHP can cover a shortfall resulting from rent officer restrictions such as the single room rent.</p>

	<p pid="b.181W.3/1">The Department's recent review examined the shortfalls faced by many single room rent (SRR) claimants and considered why the majority of this group do not live in shared accommodation. Three aspects were examined&mdash;affordability, accessibility and availability of shared accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/2">On affordability we found that there are gaps in the market evidence on which the Rent Service set SRR rates and this may impact on affordability. However, changes to the way the Rent Service gathers market evidence brought about by the introduction of the local housing allowance (LHA) from April 2008, and a change in the SRR definition, should overcome the current evidence gaps and lead to an increase in SRR rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/3">On availability we found that some areas of the country, particularly rural areas, appear to have a shortage of shared accommodation that falls within the definition currently used for the SRR. However, the introduction of the national LHA will address some of these issues through the move to a median LHA rate and the new Shared Room Rate. The latter covers a wider definition of shared accommodation than under the current SRR and will better reflect the range of accommodation available to tenants.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/4">The findings on accessibility from academic research and some anecdotal evidence suggest that young people and housing benefit tenants are unpopular with landlords in the private rented sector which may restrict SRR customers' access to shared accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/5">The Department plans to make an initial assessment of the impact of the rollout of the LHA on the SRR as part of the two year review of the LHA.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/6">There is no data available to provide an accurate estimate of the quantity of accommodation that matches the definition of the SRR.</p>

Median incomes within the relevant quartiles have been presented. We have used median rather than mean as a measure of average incomes within the quartile. This is in line with the HBAI publication, where medians are used because the mean will be heavily influenced by the small number of households having very high or very low incomes.<br/>  4. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are. This means that after housing cost incomes will generally be lower than before housing cost.<br/>  5.

	<p pid="b.192W.5/1">I am not aware of any specific DEFRA initiatives in Morecambe and Lunesdale. However, the Government's Waste Strategy for England 2007 sets out the aim of encouraging local authorities to take on a wider role (in partnerships) to help local (particularly smaller) businesses reduce and recycle their waste with cost savings through more integrated management of different waste streams; and encouraging regional development agencies and other regional bodies to coordinate business waste and resource management in partnership with local authorities and third sector organisations. Small and medium sized enterprises can also get information on recycling from Government and Waste and Recycling Action Programme (WRAP) websites.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.5/2">DEFRA supports businesses to improve their efficient use of resources and to reduce their carbon emissions. This work forms an important part of the Government's drive towards a sustainable consumption and production economy. By cutting their waste and reducing material use, businesses of all sizes can boost profits and create jobs by reducing environmental impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.5/3">The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme has delivered much of the above support to businesses. The programme has returned additional landfill tax to business over three years through resource efficiency and waste minimisation programmes, including recycling projects. Good results have been achieved from the intervention.</p>

	<p pid="b.193W.5/1">For onshore windfarms under 50 megawatts, planning decisions are taken by local planning authorities. For windfarms above this threshold, decisions are taken by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform under the Electricity Act 1989. DEFRA is not consulted in either case but Natural England will have a chance to comment as statutory consultees. Natural England and its founding bodies have objected to three onshore wind farms in three regions, and seven offshore wind farms adjacent to four regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/2">The Environment Agency is not a Statutory Consultee for windfarms, but is consulted on some windfarm developments for other statutory reasons. Between 2005 and 2007 (inclusive) the Environment Agency objected to a total of five planning applications for windfarms for reasons including flood risk, impact on biodiversity and groundwater. In all five cases after further work by the developer the Environment Agency were able to withdraw their objections.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.5/3">The Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) has a direct role in licensing offshore renewables under the Food and Environment Protection Act. An application could be rejected if assessment of the detailed environmental statement, submitted with the application, and other information showed that the proposed development would have a negative impact on the marine environment. To date, the MFA has not rejected an application for an offshore wind farm.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.2/1">It is important to remember that no screening method is perfect and anyone invited to be screened for cancer must be aware of both the benefit and harm of being screened and be able to make an informed decision on whether to take part or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.2/2">However, we do recognise the important role that screening plays and, as set out in the &quot;Cancer Reform Strategy&quot;, we are taking steps to build on and improve our existing screening services.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.2/3">This includes extending the age ranges for both breast and bowel screening, so that as many people as possible have the opportunity to be screened. We estimate that this will mean that an extra 3 million men and women will be screened over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.2/4">In the Staffordshire area, it is the responsibility of the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority working in partnership with its primary care trusts (PCTs) including South Staffordshire PCT, local screening services and stakeholders to provide appropriate cancer screening services for their local populations. This includes promotion of local screening services.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.8/1">Oral health in England has improved considerably during the last 30 years and the Government wish to see this improvement maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.8/2">In 2003 the Government enacted new legislation which gives communities a real option of having their water fluoridated should this be needed to reduce oral health inequalities and improve oral health. A number of areas across the country are now actively considering the possibility of new water fluoridation schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.8/3">Recognising that it may not be feasible to fluoridate all these high need areas, the Government developed the Brushing for Life programme. Brushing for Life involves health visitors giving families with young children in high need areas advice on preventing dental decay and a free pack containing a tube of fluoridated toothpaste, a toothbrush and a leaflet on oral hygiene. In many areas it is run in close association with Sure Start.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.8/4">In October 2005 the Government published Choosing Better Oral Health: an oral health plan for England which set out a strategy to reduce oral health inequalities. In September 2007 the Department published Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence-based toolkit for prevention which contains guidance to dentists and other dental care professionals on how to promote oral health and prevent dental disease and provides information to primary care trusts on what preventive care they should be commissioning.</p>

	<p pid="b.201W.5/2">In 2005 the Department asked the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) to include radiation protection aspects of medical practices in its work programme and as a first consideration to report on computerised tomography (CT) scanning of the asymptomatic individual. COMARE produced its 12th report entitled &quot;The impact of personally initiated computer tomography scanning for the health assessment of asymptomatic individuals&quot; in December 2007. The report has been placed in the Library and is also available on the COMARE website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.201W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.comare.org.uk/documents/COMARE12thReport.pdf">www.comare.org.uk/documents/COMARE12thReport.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.201W.5/4">COMARE recommended that regulation of these commercial CT services should be reviewed. It also recommends that clients should be provided with comprehensive information regarding dose and risk of the CT scan, as well as rates of false negative and false positive findings. Among its detailed recommendations (nine in all) COMARE noted there is a regulatory requirement that all medical exposures using ionising radiation should be optimised, and that it is not possible to optimise exposure parameters for CT scans of the whole of the body, and have strongly recommended that services offering whole body CT scanning of asymptomatic individuals should discontinue to do so. In addition, CT should not be used in assessment of spinal conditions, body fat and osteoporosis in asymptomatic individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.201W.5/5">The Department will be consulting widely on implementation of these recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.203W.2/1">The Department recognises how stressful a child's hospital stay can be, which is why the average length of stay has been reduced to two days. The most important issue is to ensure that a child's stay in hospital is kept to a minimum, consistent with achieving a good recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.203W.2/2">The relevant national service framework for children states that children should have the comfort and reassurance provided by personal contact with close family members. Wherever practicable, hospitals make suitable provisions for parents to stay overnight with their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.203W.2/3">Where this is not possible or practicable for parents to stay, mobile telephones may be used in certain areas of the hospital and bedside telephone systems allow children to maintain contact with friends and relatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.203W.2/4">The cost of a telephone call to the bedside system in a children's ward varies, although, in most cases, it is 39 pence per minute off peak and 49 pence per minute peak rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.203W.2/5">Other options exist for people not wishing to use the bedside telephone systems. These include the traditional payphones and hospital switchboard facilities and mobile telephones which ensure parents can be kept up to date on their child's progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.227W.2/1">Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines, produced by the Magistrates Association with the support of the Lord Chancellor, cover the main offences dealt with in those courts, including drugs offences. The guidelines were revised in September 2000 and January 2004 and are currently under review by the Sentencing Guidelines Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.227W.2/2">The Court of Appeal provided guidelines on: supply and dealing in Class A drugs in the cases of R <i> v.</i> Diahit (1999) 2 Cr App R (S) 142, R <i> v.</i> Twisse (2001) 2 Cr App R (S) 37, and R <i> v.</i> Afonso and others (2004) EWCA Crim 2342; the importation of controlled drugs in the case of R <i> v.</i> Mashootlahi (2001) 1 Cr App R (S) 330; Class B drugs&mdash;amphetamine in the case of R <i> v.</i> Wijs and others (1999) 1 Cr App R (S) 181; cannabis (prior to its classification as a Class C drug) in the case of R <i> v.</i> Ronchetti (1998) 2 Cr App R (S) 100; possession with intent to supply&mdash;LSD in the case of R <i> v.</i> Hurley (1998) 1 Cr App R (S) 29; purity analysis of Class A drugs in the case of R <i> v.</i> Morris (2001) 1 Cr App R (S) 297; and cultivating cannabis in the case of R <i> v.</i> Herridge (2005) EWCA Crim 1410. In December 2004, the Council issued guidelines on seriousness, &quot;Overarching principles: seriousness, and Reduction in sentence for a guilty plea&quot;, which apply in all cases. The latter guideline was revised in July 2007. The Sentencing Advisory Panel is currently undertaking research and background work on drug offences, which is the first stage in the process of producing sentencing guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="b.240W.2/1">There is no simple relationship between the number of community penalties passed and their resource impact upon the probation service. The cost of community penalties is related to the number of such sentences, the risk profile of the offenders made subject to them, the number and nature of requirements included in them and their length. The impact of any rise varies with other changes in the mix of probation workload, such as the number of reports to be prepared and the number of offenders to be supervised on release from custody.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/2">New community penalties to be supervised by the probation service rose by 5 per cent. between September 2006 and September 2007. The caseload of such cases under supervision at any one time rose by 3 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/3">An additional &pound;40 million has recently been made available to the probation service for the specific purpose of supporting local plans to promote confidence in the use of community penalties.</p>

	<p pid="b.242W.2/1">Young adult offenders are not placed in secure training centres or secure children's homes. The Ministry of Justice statistical bulletin 'Re-offending of Juveniles: results from the 2005 cohort' (July 2007) found that 76 per cent. of young people aged under 18 discharged from custody in the first quarter of 2005 re-offended within a year. It analysed the figures in various ways: for example by age, by ethnicity and by offence sanctioned. However, there would be difficulty in attempting such an analysis by type of custodial establishment, because transfers occur between different types of establishment and the number of offenders given custodial sentences is very small compared to other disposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.243W.2/20">It should be noted that the increase in the number of people who meet the definition of a PYO is partly a consequence of the large improvements in the timeliness of dealing with such offenders. The definition of a PYO relies on counting successive sentencing occasions for a single offender during a limited time period. Speedier operation of the youth justice system has markedly reduced the average time taken from arrest to sentence, and as a result the number of young offenders who fall within the scope of this definition has increased. This was a particular issue from 1997 to 2002, the period during which these timeliness improvements were taking effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.243W.2/21">Information is not available on the total number offences committed by PYOs. However, information is available on the number of convictions handed down to these offenders, and the following table therefore shows the proportion of total notifiable offences brought to justice that is attributable to court convictions of PYOs.

	<p pid="b.252W.6/1">Enforcement action consists of many stages in the end-to-end process of resolving a case. It can include policy work, caseworking, inquiries abroad, intelligence work, legal advice, support costs, operations, detention, escorts the cost of charters and other flights used to effect removal, and ministerial and senior officials' time. Such costs are spread across a number of cost centres within the Agency and its predecessor and are not functionally recorded on a case-by-case basis. The information requested could therefore be provided only by the detailed analysis of individual case records at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.252W.6/2">The Border and Immigration Agency's budget allocations are not made or recorded on a detailed activity basis and therefore it is not possible to give a definitive figure for the proportion of budget attributed to activity against individuals involved in identity theft or identity fraud involving document abuse. However, action against such theft or fraud is an important part of our Enforcement Strategy, published in March 2007.</p>

Shift managers decide how many of the available staff should work in the EU or non-EU channels at any particular time in order to deal with approaching passengers as quickly and effectively as possible. The only constraint is that one officer must be on duty in each channel at all times when flights are landing. This flexibility makes the best use of available resources.</p>

This includes ensuring that data is kept secure; companies that offshore activities remain bound by the requirements of the UK's Data Protection Act. Companies also have a responsibility to engage in a transparent dialogue with employees affected by relocation decisions. But, companies must be allowed to decide the best course of action to remain competitive.</p>

	<p pid="b.290W.3/2"><i> </i>The security of nuclear material on board a UK-flagged vessel is regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) in accordance with the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 (NISR). These regulations, which ensure that the UK's obligations under the Convention on the Physical Protection on Nuclear Material (CPPNM) are met and which take full account of international recommendations in this area, are supplemented by a Technical Requirements Document which details minimum security standards. This document is protectively marked; it is not Government policy to release precise details of security measures since this information could be of use to those with malicious intent.</p>
	<p pid="b.290W.3/3">In terms of security arrangements for the transport of nuclear material, distance is not the factor which sets the level of security. The overall security posture will be dictated by the category of the material being carried and the threat pertaining. The mode(s) of transport, packages to be used and other physical, procedural and administrative measures based on the principles of defence-in-depth and graded approach will also be relevant in designing a security system combining deterrence, detection, delay and response measures, complemented by other measures for mitigating the consequences of malicious acts, including recovery and for minimizing the radiological consequences of any theft, sabotage or other malicious act.</p>
	<p pid="b.290W.3/4">Vessels transporting nuclear material by sea are required to operate in compliance with the requirements of prevailing international law on the safety of ships, most notably the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS, found at <a href="http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=257">http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=257</a>&amp;doc_id=647). Additionally they are required to comply with supplementary measures contained in the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes on board ships (the INF code, found at <a href="http://www.imo.org/Safety/mainframe.asp">http://www.imo.org/Safety/mainframe.asp</a> ?topic_id=354) which deal specifically with the carriage of nuclear material.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.0/1">West Midlands Learning and Skills Council works with employers across the region to increase the number of people starting and completing Apprenticeships. It plans to increase Apprenticeships by around 4 per cent. in 2008/09. Projections are for 12,550 Apprenticeship starts with 8,415 completions and a further 5,620 Advanced Apprenticeship starts with 3,385 completions in 2008/09. The overall completion rate will be 65 per cent. which represents a rise of 3 per cent. on the projected 2007/08 level.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.0/2">The increase in Apprenticeships in the West Midlands will be achieved by re-directing funding to high performing providers, introducing the Apprenticeship matching service, developing closer employer engagement, removing support for poorly performing provision and introducing new opportunities for young people to prepare to undertake an Apprenticeship.</p>

We do not currently routinely collect information on payment of fees by employers, but some information is available from surveys of learners. The last such survey was of learners who completed an FE course in 2003/04. It found that 30 per cent. of the learners doing full level 3 courses said their course fees were paid for by their employer, compared with 18 per cent. of non-full level 3 FE learners.</p>

	<p pid="b.303W.9/16">Borrowers who graduated in 2007 are not required to begin repaying their loans until April 2008; consequently the April 2008 figures in the table cover only those borrowers who have chosen to fully repay their loans before any repayments are due. The table reflects the change from mortgage-style to income-contingent loans. The figures relating to 2001 graduates, who started to repay their loans from April 2002, are significantly higher because the normal period for repaying mortgage-style loans is five to seven years.</p>
	<p pid="b.303W.9/17">Borrowers with up to four mortgage-style loans repay over five years when their income exceeds the repayment threshold; those with five or more loans repay over seven years. The threshold for borrowers with mortgage-style loans is 85 per cent. of national average earnings, currently &pound;25,287 from <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>. Borrowers are able to apply for deferment of repayments if their income is below this. Income-contingent loans replaced mortgage-style loans from 1998. Borrowers with income contingent loans repay at a rate of 9 per cent. of earnings above &pound;15,000 a year. Repayments are usually collected through the tax system by employers, in the same way as income tax and national insurance contributions. Self-employed borrowers make repayments through the self assessment system.</p>

	<p pid="b.304W.2/2">Where local authorities suspect fraud at the application stage, they will not process the application until they are completely satisfied with the documentary evidence.

	<p pid="b.305W.2/1">The estimated additional resource cost for each &pound;1,000 increase in the current &pound;15,000 repayment threshold is an initial &pound;200 million (for existing loans) plus an ongoing cost of &pound;80 million per year (for new loans). Increasing the threshold to &pound;25,000 would therefore cost an estimated &pound;2 billion plus &pound;800 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.305W.2/2">The income threshold is one of the main features of the income contingent loan scheme. This protects borrowers when they need it as they only pay their loan back once they earn over the threshold. Borrowers currently repay nothing until they earn over &pound;15,000. This strikes the right balance, making payments affordable to the individual and student loans affordable to the public purse. We are committed to maintaining the repayment threshold at &pound;15,000 until 2010 when we will review it.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.2/2">Part H (drainage and waste disposal) of the Building Regulations currently requires an adequate system of drainage to be provided to carry foul water from appliances within the building to a suitable sewer, septic tank, waste water treatment system or cesspool.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.2/3">This means that where mains drainage cannot be provided and an applicant wishes to use an appliance such as a composting toilet there may be benefits in using urine separation as this can improve overall efficiency. However, there is a risk that urine separation and the subsequent discharge of a mixture of urine and water from washing appliances to the ground may cause pollution and damage water resources. People who plan to use urine separation and subsequently discharge direct to ground should undertake a robust site investigation and consult the appropriate authorities such as Building Control or the Environment Agency before finalising plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.2/4">Guidance of the provision of toilets is contained in the Approved Document G (Hygiene) of the Building Regulations. This guidance is under review and we expect to consult on the proposals shortly. It will include improved guidance on the location and use of composting toilets.</p>

These reforms are designed to support the extension of the free entitlement and to address the inconsistencies in how the offer is currently funded across the maintained and private, voluntary and independent sectors.

	<p pid="b.317W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/2">Further to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Skills, to the hon. Member's question 168417 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 271W, the legacy of our investment for the games goes beyond more houses and better transport. It must strengthen London's skills base and boost job prospects for London's residents in a lasting way. To help young people to gain skills and improve their employment prospects, the ODA has publicly committed to get at least 2,000 people into trainee apprenticeships and work placements (up to 2012) at the Olympic park and other venues that the ODA is working on or building. The first phase is the training centre at Eton Manor fields based at the Olympic site.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/3">In addition, the Major Contractors Group, which represents some of the UK's largest construction companies, has pledged:</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/4" class="indent">to make available 1,000 job placements to young people enrolled on FE construction courses;</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/5" class="indent">to work with the Construction Youth Trust to sponsor 50 undergraduates to obtain a construction-related degree;</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/6" class="indent">make available 1,000 training placements for local people over 21 who do not qualify for apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/7">London LSC is also signed up to a target of 4,000 public sector apprenticeships by 2012, and is working closely with the Mayor's office to increase the number of apprenticeships across the GLA family (police, fire service, TFL). The LSC is also funding a range of community engagement activities to inspire people about the games and raise their aspirations. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/8" class="indent">Funding a series of theatre tours to visit 130 schools across London to raise awareness of 'Olympic opportunities' for young people;</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/9" class="indent">Building an Olympic/Paralympics element into the training of London teachers;</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/10" class="indent">Providing skills advice and materials for a series of road-show events throughout 2007-08 to visit communities across all 33 London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.6/11">In total, London Learning and Skills Council is planning to spend a further &pound;7 million in 2008/09, up from the previous years &pound;5 million which will contribute to improving both the volume and quality of work based learning in the four key sectors: construction, sport; audio-visual and customer service. In addition, the LSC will provide a further &pound;12.2 million for demand-led investment in training at the NSA centre on the Olympics site in the period between now and 2012.</p>

One of the factors used in this calculation of contextual value added is whether a pupil has English as an additional language. Thus this factor is already taken into account within the tables, for all pupils for whom there is a record of attainment at the previous key stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/2">There is no direct interface between the Unique Learner Number and Unique Pupil Number, other than the fact that both numbers are held on the National Pupil Database.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/3">The Unique Learner Number is designed to support better processing of data and improve services to individuals undertaking learning. The ULN will in time be used across the education sector, and will support much improved data sharing between third parties, for example school to college, school to awarding body, school to careers service, school/college to university. It will directly enable the aggregation of qualification awards and the creation of a learner record showing participation and achievement, which the individual will control.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/4">The Unique Learner Number is assigned to learners over the age of 14, using an on-line learner registration service, which is accessible to learners and those who are supporting them, for example, education providers and careers advisers. This service also confirms how individuals want their information shared.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.11/5">The Unique Pupil Number was designed specifically for the school sector to facilitate a smoother movement of pupil information between schools, local authorities and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), and lapses when a pupil leaves the maintained school sector. When designed it was agreed with the Data Protection Registrar that the Unique Pupil Number should be held by schools on the pupil's electronic record, and only used when required to provide information to the local authority, to the DCSF or National Assessment Agency (NAA), or to another school to which the pupil is transferring.</p>
