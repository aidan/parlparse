	<p pid="a.1062W.8/1">Statistics on the labour market situation in Wales are published monthly by the Office for National Statistics. The latest data for January 2011 show there are 24,600 young people aged 18 to 24 claiming jobseekers allowance in Wales. This is a fall of 3,600 or 12.6% compared to a year ago. By comparison, youth unemployment levels in Wales increased by around 30% from Q2 1997 to Q2 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1062W.8/2">This Government remain extremely concerned about youth unemployment and are determined to deal with their legacy in Wales. Our approach is to ensure that young unemployed people get the personalised help they need to find permanent jobs. As part of our reform of the welfare system we are introducing a number of measures to support young people to find employment. Jobcentre Plus local offices are being given more control to allow them to deliver a more personalised service in a way that is more responsive to local needs. Under the Work Programme, providers will be free to design support based on the needs of individuals and target the right support at the right time. Both Jobcentre Plus and Work Programme providers will work with local public, private, and third sector organisations where this delivers the best job outcomes for individuals.</p>

We are working with the finance industry to ensure that the design of the scheme is robust enough to secure the most efficient types of financing, which in turn, will drive down the cost. The Green Deal is a market mechanism and therefore it is not appropriate for government to dictate the interest rate. We may however, set out permissible financial terms in secondary legislation to ensure consumer protection, and will be considering whether these should place controls on the structure of interest rates which can be applied to Green Deal plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.6/1">Skills conditionality will apply to both jobseeker's allowance claimants and benefit recipients in the work-related activity group of employment and support allowance. People referred to training on a mandatory basis will be subject to the same benefit rules as those engaging in training on a voluntary basis. Skills conditionality is currently being piloted in 11 Jobcentre Plus districts and will apply nationally from August 2011. Mandatory referrals to training may then take place prior to a claimant's entry to the work programme as well as once they are on the work programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.6/2">The course length will not be prescribed but will depend upon the identified job goals and skills need of the claimant. Before a mandatory referral to training can be made, the college or training provider must have confirmed that they are able and willing to accept the claimant onto an appropriate course. Benefit entitlements will not be dependent on the length of the training course. Units of accredited training will be offered as well as longer courses depending on the skills needs of the individual and those of the local labour market. Claimants will be subject to sanctions for failure to participate but where they can demonstrate good cause they will not be sanctioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.6/3">Recipients of jobseeker's allowance who take part in part-time training will continue to receive jobseeker's allowance provided they continue to meet the full labour-market requirements and are willing to give up the course if a job opportunity is offered. Courses funded by the Skills Funding Agency, Welsh Assembly Government and Scottish Government are considered to be full-time training where they involve 16 hours or more a week. There is no definition about what constitutes a full- or part-time course where training is funded from other sources-it is for the course provider to determine. Jobseekers who take part in full-time training are moved onto a training allowance and are not subject to jobseeker's allowance conditionality for the duration of their time on the training.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.6/4">Recipients of employment and support allowance referred to training by Jobcentre Plus will continue to receive their usual benefit entitlement. In setting the work-related activity for a member of the employment and support allowance work-related activity group, Jobcentre Plus advisers will ensure that the requirements they place on a person are apt and reasonable in their circumstances. Work-related activity may include attending training to address a skills need if this will make it more likely that a customer will obtain or remain in work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.3/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a partnership agreement with the Association of Train Operating Companies, which offers a 50% discount on rail travel in England and Wales to Jobcentre Plus customers who are seeking work or have entered the various New Deal Programmes for lone parents and disadvantaged groups. This agreement has been in place for the last 13 years and has helped a wide range of customers with travel costs. A similar scheme is also in place in Scotland via Scot Rail.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.3/6" class="indent">For those wishing to consider employment outside their immediate locality, we currently have the Travel to Interview Scheme, which helps with the cost of attending interviews considered to be outside the local travel to work area. The scheme does not have a large annual budget, so careful management is required to ensure it helps as many customers as possible each year. In doing so, advisers make awards, taking into account individual circumstances and factors which include making sure the applicant has an established claim to a qualifying benefit, the availability of jobs locally, the distance involved in attending the interview in question and what is considered to be the local travel to work area. Customers must apply for help before attending an interview to check entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.3/7" class="indent">In delivering a more personalised service from April this year, we are providing District Managers with a flexible support fund, which will subsume a number of current discretionary funds, including the Travel to Interview Scheme. This new fund will be used directly and in partnership with other local organisations to tailor services to individual and local need. Where appropriate, this will include support for people who are looking to travel further a field to look for and take-up work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094W.5/1">I meet the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change on a regular basis and a variety of relevant matters are discussed. Although we have not met specifically to discuss the World Bank Energy Strategy Review, officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change regularly meet and discuss the Review as it progresses. Both I and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change are in close touch with officials on this process. DFID officials have also been in regular contact with the World Bank to feed in UK views on previous drafts of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094W.5/2">DFID has emphasised the need for the World Bank to take full account of all the relevant issues concerning use of renewable energy versus fossil fuels in developing countries, and to pay better consideration to the vulnerability of natural resources and energy assets in developing countries. The UK has also emphasised the importance of strengthening the World Bank's role in supporting developing country planning capacity for low carbon, climate resilient growth.</p>

We have estimated that the cost of the commercial element of the procurement function in 2009-10 was &#163;153 million. The commercial element of the procurement function is a sub-set of the overall cost, which also includes the cost of project management, the supply chain and the costs involved over the entire life-cycle of a project, from initial requirement and concept, through to ultimate final disposal. This estimate is based on an average cost of the number of commercial staff in the main commercial areas, including overheads.

	<p pid="a.1104W.3/1">The Department currently has a contract with the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) to run the Enterprise Network to support enterprise education. The network is made up of Enterprise Learning Partnerships (ELPs), each chaired by a head teacher with representatives on the board from two secondary schools, two primary schools, a special school, a further education college and an employer. There are currently 54 ELPs covering 99.6% of local authority areas in England. Lead practitioners for each sector of education have been identified in each region to share their ideas for enterprise education with their peers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.3/2">The contract with SSAT ends in March 2011. Beyond that date, we expect the ELPs to become self-sustaining without Government funding, ensuring a network of local and teacher-led groups to support enterprise education in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1104W.3/3">From April 2011, if schools wish to provide enterprise education, they may do so of their own accord, either buying in services from enterprise education providers or arranging their own enterprise activities. They will be able to use the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for this purpose which, from financial year 2011-12, will include the &#163;55 million that used to be notionally allocated for enterprise education but is no longer earmarked for that purpose. Schools are free to spend the DSG however they so choose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1106W.14/1">This is a key theme of our reform programme on Sure Start. The Government wants to retain a national network of Sure Start Children's Centres, which offer universal services and proven early interventions to support families in greatest need, and to increase local flexibility to configure services to meet local need. We want to enable more voluntary and community sector organisations to run and deliver services within children's centres; and we are seeking opportunities for public sector workers within children's centres to form employee owned mutuals or cooperatives. The recent Localism Bill included measures to give local organisations and local authority employees the right to challenge local authorities to run services if they can do things better or more cost effectively. The Government are also working with local authorities, the early years sector and the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, to discuss how to overcome practical barriers to increasing voluntary and community sector involvement in children's centres. In addition, the Department is investing &#163;59 million each year over the next two years to directly fund voluntary and community sector organisations to deliver a range of grant funded activities of national significance in relation to children, young people and families, with a particular emphasis on early intervention and supporting the most disadvantaged.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.5/1">The purpose of the Education Endowment Fund is to fund bold and innovative approaches into ways of raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils in underperforming schools. If a sixth form or a further education college considered it could support an underperforming school to raise attainment then it would be eligible to submit an application for consideration to the organisation administering the Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.5/2">The intention of the collaboration incentive as described in the Schools White Paper is to reward schools who support weaker schools demonstrably to improve their performance while also improving their own.

	<p pid="a.1111W.2/2">The initial teacher training (ITT) requirements require that providers of ITT design, deliver and assess training to enable trainee teachers to demonstrate that they have met all of the QTS standards. This includes preparing trainees to teach outside the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/3">The guidance accompanying QTS standard Q30 provides links to the &quot;Learning Outside the Classroom Manifesto&quot; and the &quot;Teaching Outside the Classroom Programme Website&quot;. It also offers links to four case studies that chart high quality provision in training teachers to teach outside of the classroom. The teacher training resource bank provides support for trainers and their trainees and currently hosts 37 resources related to fieldwork, including geography and science-related subject specific resources. In addition, there are 152 resources relating to education outside the classroom including a National Foundation for Educational Research survey report on provision in ITT, and the &quot;Manifesto for Learning Outside the Classroom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/4">ITT providers are regularly inspected by Ofsted to ensure that they continue to comply with the ITT requirements, that their provision is high quality, and that they have the capacity to improve the quality of that provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111W.5/2">Learning outside the classroom can play a valuable role in any child's educational experience. Existing legislation prevents schools from charging for any visit that takes place during school time, is being undertaken as part of the national curriculum, or as part of preparing a child for a prescribed public examination. Schools may make a charge for board and lodging on residential trips, but parents of pupils eligible for FSM will be exempt from paying this cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.5/3">From April 2011 we are introducing the pupil premium to support the attainment of deprived children who are currently eligible for free school meals (FSM), children looked after for more than six months and FSM pupils in non-mainstream settings. Schools may in future wish to consider using the pupil premium funding to enable such children to benefit from out of school educational activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1112W.6/2">As such, neither Mosaic nor Acorn identifies individual pupils as deprived; rather they group areas with other similar areas. Were this to be used for the pupil premium a decision would need to be made about which areas should be defined as 'deprived'. The number of pupils eligible for the pupil premium using either of these methods would depend on which 'types' were chosen to represent areas of deprivation. The more types selected, the more pupils would be living in them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1115W.2/18">This shows that, while the number of state funded schools offering triple science has risen from 27% to over 70% in six years, the proportion of pupils entered for triple science GCSE is lower in deprived areas. The Government wants to ensure that triple science GCSE is available in all schools and to any pupil who can benefit, and we have already introduced a number of measures to achieve this. We have encouraged schools to offer triple science by including it in the English Baccalaureate. We are also taking steps to increase the number and quality of science teachers, for example by expanding programmes such as Teach First and by looking at how to encourage graduates to teach in shortage subjects, including physics and chemistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.2/19">The recent Schools White Paper confirms that we will support schools to offer triple science. We plan to announce details of how this support will be focused on increasing take up by those pupils who live in the most deprived areas.</p>

The total allocated in 10-11 for Sure Start children's centres was &#163;1,135 million. From April 2011, funding for Sure Start will form part of the new un-ringfenced Early Intervention Grant which in total is worth &#163;2,222 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,307 million in 2012-13.

In addition, the Department for Education's partner supporting local authorities' work on children's centres until March 2011, Together for Children, will be ready to assist local authorities in making plans to keep centres open.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126W.2/1">The RENEW North Staffordshire Pathfinder, for which Stoke on Trent city council is the accountable body, was allocated &#163;108.2 million of housing market renewal funding in 2008-11. Dedicated funding for the housing market renewal programme ends in March 2011 and with the country facing a record deficit and less money available for top-down investment, we need to find innovative ways to deliver regeneration. This will require an ambitious and creative approach to the new funding sources such as new homes bonus, affordable rent/empty homes and private sector and asset based investment. I have also announced a transition fund of &#163;5 million for growth and housing market renewal areas to retain key capacity to help tackle these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126W.2/2">The new homes bonus, for example, is payable both on new build and on bringing long-term empty homes back into use. Stoke on Trent's provisional new homes bonus allocation for 2011-12 is &#163;1,105,641. There will need to be a much greater emphasis on refurbishment than previously. Where local authorities in former housing market renewal areas wish to develop a transition plan based on this approach, my Department and the Homes and Community Agency will be ready to help.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126W.14/2">The level of pay of local authority staff is for each local authority to determine in the light of local circumstances. However, the Government expects local authorities to show restraint particularly when setting of senior pay and for voluntary pay reductions from the very top earners.</p>

The Secretary of State will be consulting on guidance, shortly and has made clear his preference that full council vote on all new appointments over &#163;100,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.8/1">No estimate has been made of the quantity of milk or other dairy produce purchased by all Government bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.8/2">However, DEFRA has previously established the quantity of milk and other dairy produce purchased from January 2010 to January 2011 by its Nobel House, headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.8/3">This purchased 41,600 pints of milk (23,640 litres) in this period. In addition, it purchased 1,040 kg of yoghurt, 1,200 kg of cheese and 205 kg of butter. These products are supplied by Brakes Chilled. The milk is sourced from Yew Tree House Farm in Lancashire. The average price paid per litre of milk is commercially confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.8/4">It is not possible, to establish what amounts of milk individual farm businesses supply to public sector organisations and we are therefore similarly unable to make specific estimates of the costs of production or the prices received for dairy farmers supplying the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.8/5">However, DEFRA has estimated the following costs<sup>(1)</sup> of milk production for 2009-10 using data from the Farm Business Survey in England<sup>(2)</sup>. These estimates are representative of the vast majority of milk produced in England and will include a small proportion of organic production. The average cost of production was around 22.5 pence per litre.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.8/16">DEFRA collects statistical data every month on the price received by dairy farmers. The latest available figure is the January 2011 average milk price, which stood at 25.72ppl, 4.26% higher than January 2010. The average milk price for 2010 was 24.66ppl.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141W.8/1">Thermal treatment includes both incineration/combustion and other treatments, such as gasification and pyrolysis. However, if the activity involves only thermal treatment in this broader sense (as distinct from incineration/combustion), then it will be subject to the Waste Incineration Directive only 'insofar as the substances resulting from the treatment are subsequently incinerated'. This ensures that the Waste Incineration Directive covers processes such as pyrolysis and gasification, unless their purpose is the manufacture of products with no resulting release of combustion gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.8/2">Therefore, if a gasification/pyrolysis plant produces a number of products, one or more of which are subsequently burnt, then the Waste Incineration Directive applies to the whole plant.

	<p pid="a.1143W.2/1">Croatia's accession process was assessed in the European Commission's annual progress report published in November 2010, and scrutinised by member states at the EU General Affairs Council in December 2010. The Council Conclusions stated,</p>
	<p pid="a.1143W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The Council welcomes Croatia's good overall progress towards meeting the membership criteria. Accession negotiations have reached their final stage and preparations for the drafting of the Accession Treaty have progressed steadily. Conclusion of the negotiations is within reach.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1143W.2/3">We fully endorse this assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143W.2/4">We work closely with other EU member states and with the European Commission to encourage and support progress in Croatia's accession process. Croatia has now opened all of the substantive chapters, of which it has closed 28. But Croatia still has work to do, particularly on judicial reform, public administration reform, tackling corruption and organised crime. Full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a requirement for the closure of negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143W.2/5">The Commission published an interim report on Croatia's progress on chapter 23 (judiciary and fundamental rights) on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-02">2 March 2011</phrase>. The Government welcome the report and Croatia's continued engagement on the accession process. The report will be discussed by EU member states over the coming weeks.</p>

			<tr pid="a.1150W.3/8"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. Estimate of alcohol-related admissions<br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at:<br/> www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf<br/> The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Information about episodes estimated to be alcohol-related may be slightly different from previously published data.<br/> 2. Accident and Emergency<br/> Admission method Codes 21 and 28 were used:<br/> 21: Emergency via A&amp;E, including the casualty department of the provider;<br/> 28: Emergency: Other means including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider.<br/> 3. SHA/PCT of residence<br/> The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> 4. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in national health service practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> 5. Data quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1153W.0/1">It is for individual local authorities to follow European Union procurement guidance for the tendering of domiciliary care contracts. Domiciliary Care is classed as a Part B service of the Procurement Directive. The detailed award criteria set out in that guidance for tendering for these services do not apply to Part B services. However local authorities are expected to follow procedures which provide an outcome to their purchasing requirements that delivers value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153W.0/2">Authorities are required to ensure that any specifications set out in the tender documents are not discriminatory and do not point to particular products. Authorities should not use standards which are inconsistent with wider international standards.</p>

Choice of AWP allows innovative and responsive services to grow, benefiting patients and providers alike.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175W.9/2">On accountability, the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is a Department of State. Its powers are derived from statute: the Export Guarantees and Investment Act 1991, as amended by the Industry and Exports (Financial Support) Act 2009 (the Act). These powers may be exercised only with the consent of HM Treasury. Through its Secretary of State, ECGD is accountable to Parliament for all its activities. From time to time Parliament conducts enquiries that address ECGD's operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175W.9/3">On transparency, ECGD fulfils the Government's commitment to transparency. ECGD publishes details of its operations, including export transactions it has supported, in its annual review and resource accounts and on its website. The entitlement to confidentiality, either for individuals or entities, is set by the law of confidence, and the basis for balancing openness and confidentiality by government and public authorities has been established by Parliament through the Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations. ECGD operates within these frameworks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1179W.8/2">Students from the European Union (EU) are entitled to receive the same student support as home students in respect of tuition fees. The first main cohort of EU students were due to start repaying in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.8/3">Where borrowers have returned overseas and have not responded, a default schedule is drawn up and the account put into arrears. A default letter is sent immediately asking for repayment of the default balance. This step allows court action to follow if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.8/4">To date, no penalties have been charged to borrowers. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-30">30 April 2010</phrase>, 1,100 EU borrowers were in arrears (10% of EU borrowers). In 2009, the SLC successfully raised nine judgments against EU borrowers. The SLC enforced some in Scottish courts and some in other EU countries. This group of borrowers were those who had left their courses and who came into repayment earlier than the first main cohort. We cannot break the information down further as it could compromise the confidentiality of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179W.8/5">It is too early to say how successful these processes will be since the full cycle has yet to be run. Nonetheless, we continue to work with the SLC to develop the most robust and cost-effective methods for collection as possible. This applies equally to UK students who notify the SLC that they are moving abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.1181W.2/1">The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) publishes worldwide patent application and grant statistics every year, according to the information it receives from patent offices around the world. Although it has previously published comparator tables on the number of patents granted per million of population, it has not done so for recent years, and in this year's publication it notes that patent offices do not consistently report the origin of patents granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.2/2">WIPO does publish figures for patent applications filed per million of population and comparisons can be made for recent years up to 2007, in which the UK's position has been consistently within the top 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.2/3">Several points should be borne in mind in making such comparisons. First, patents do not cover all areas of industrial and commercial endeavour, and so patent filings will reflect a country's economic structure. Some innovations are more likely to be monetised through other types of intellectual property, such as designs, trade marks, copyright, know how, and plant breeders rights. And there are some specific exceptions from patent protection under most national laws. Secondly, individual patents are not equal in value, which can depend on market forces and how well the patent has been drafted to stand up against challenge. Studies have shown that patent value is skewed so that a small percentage of patents overall turn out to have a very high value compared with the remainder. Thirdly, an applicant may choose not to patent in a particular market if there are no significant competitors. So the absence of a patent does not necessarily mean that no products are being sold.</p>

	<p pid="a.1182W.2/1">The UK is strongly committed to an EU patent, or a unitary patent, that delivers real benefits for businesses and the European economy. The proposed unitary patent will offer an additional choice to businesses wishing to obtain patent protection covering the majority of the EU market. Estimates of the savings to business and economic impact are difficult to make as they depend on the arrangements that are finally agreed. But a unitary patent should allow businesses to save the costs of filing translations in order to validate their patent in the different countries concerned. Compared with a typical European patent under the current system, there could be savings of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000 per patent on translations alone. For UK businesses currently taking out around 2,000 European patents per year this could represent a saving of &#163;20-40 million a year. Other savings should be possible from simplified administration and enforcement of patents in Europe; the proposals are not sufficiently advanced to allow quantitative assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182W.2/2">Specific estimates for the effects of the proposed EU patent arrangements, or the existing European Patent Office (EPO) system on economic growth or foreign direct investment are hard to make, because the impacts of the intellectual property system are closely bound up with other regulatory and market factors. However, there have been a number of studies which show the role of aspects of the single European market in UK economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182W.2/3">The Government recently published an assessment (BIS Economics paper 11) of likely additional national income in the UK if trade and competition in Europe were as integrated as it is in the US. If barriers in the EU were reduced to the point at which trade was as easy as between US states (which, unlike the EU, have one patent system), by 2020 UK national income would be 7% higher than if barriers remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182W.2/4">Emerging results from UK Trade and Investment's ongoing research programme show that intellectual property (IP) is important for foreign direct investment. About one third of inward investors to the UK cite IP as an important factor in their decisions to invest. Differences in IP systems can impose costs. These are particularly hard for young innovative firms which, under current arrangements, have to defend their intellectual property rights under national systems even if they have an EPO patent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184W.5/1">Statistics on deferred entry to higher education are available via the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). Final end of year figures for 2010 show that 487,329 applicants from all domiciles accepted a place at a UK institution; 33,472 of these have deferred entry to 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184W.5/2">Limited information is held on the extent of deferred entry to 2012 in the current application cycle. Applicants can make up to five choices on their application form and this can include courses which start in 2011 or 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184W.5/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-21">21 February 2011</phrase>, 604,705 people had applied for courses in the current application cycle, 18,711 of these applied for at least one course beginning one year or more after September 2011. At the equivalent point in the previous cycle, 587,857 people had applied, 28,075 of these applied for at least one course beginning one year or more after September 2010. In the 2011 application cycle the main deadline for universities and colleges to guarantee consideration of applications for those domiciled in the UK and EU was <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-15">15 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184W.5/4">The new support arrangements we are introducing from the 2012/13 academic year will apply to all students starting university in that year, including those who have deferred entry. When the new arrangements were announced, UCAS informed deferred entry applicants that had applied prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November 2010</phrase> about this by email. The email informed applicants of the implications of the new finance arrangements and advised them to check the BIS website for further information and contact individual institutions to discuss individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184W.5/5">English institutions wishing to charge more than &#163;6,000 per year will need first to have their plans for sustaining or improving access and student retention approved by the Office for Fair Access (OFFA).
