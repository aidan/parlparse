	<p pid=".13W.5/1">The Department does not collect data on fire sprinkler systems.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/2">If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and subsequent regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.5/3">To help schools manage fire safety, the Department published Managing School Facilities Guide 6, &quot;Fire Safety&quot;, in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risk of fire, including identifying hazards and carrying out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.</p>

The percentages shown below will reflect LEAs' spending levels relative to their SSAs as well as their propensity to delegate within the LSB, and will also be affected, year to year, by changes in the scope of the SSA.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.12/1">I regularly receive reports from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), who maintain a record of the number of cases resulting in a judge-ordered or directed acquittal and capture a broad analysis of the reasons underlying the failure of the case.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.12/2">The figures shown in the table contain an analysis for the year ending March 2002. The figures in column one represent the number of defendants whose case resulted in a judge-ordered or judge-directed acquittal together with the reasons for the outcome. The figures in column two express these as a percentage of completed Crown Court cases (not including cases dealt with under its appellate jurisdiction).</p>
	<p pid=".22W.12/3">In the year 2001&ndash;02 a judges-ordered or directed acquittal in 13,306 cases, representing 15.8 per cent. of the total. Of these, the largest figure (4,515 cases) represents cases where a judge ordered acquittal because a prosecution witness was missing, or refused to give evidence, where a complaint was withdrawn, or where a witness was unable to give evidence. This category accounts for 5.4 per cent. of the total number of cases and 33.9 per cent. of the total number of judge-ordered and directed acquittals.</p>
	<p pid=".22W.12/4">A further 3,078 (3.6 per cent. of the total) resulted in a judge-ordered acquittal because of doubts over the admissibility, reliability or strength of evidence (other than identification evidence).</p>
	<p pid=".22W.12/5">A more detailed list of reasons for these outcomes will be available following the introduction of the CPS Compass Case Management System due to roll-out between April and December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.8/1">HMS Talent reached her maximum permissible commission length in mid-June and has been laid-up prior to entering a long overhaul period in Devonport dockyard in spring 2003. The delay in starting the overhaul results from a need to profile the work load of Devonport dockyard efficiently, to deconflict with the refit of HMS Vanguard, and to balance available funds with more high priority competing demands. Few, if any, savings will accrue. The Royal Navy manpower released will be deployed elsewhere. Minor savings that might be realised from reduced operating costs will be offset by charges for essential services during the lay-up period.</p>

Consequently, there is not yet a history of delivery of flying hours against the contract. The contract also provides flying hours to the Air Cadet Air Experience Flights and the Central Flying School at RAF Cranwell, to train instructions and also to conduct elementary navigator training. The contract provides 30,500 hours with an option to fly up to 50,000 hours. The additional hours are paid for only if used. In the year ending March 2002 just under 40,000 hours were flown.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.11/1">Elementary flying training for members of University Air Squadrons is undertaken to a defined syllabus and output standard. A direct comparison of University Air Squadron trained and Joint Elementary Flying Training School trained RAF pilots is seen at the point of streaming to aircraft type (fast jet, rotary wing, or multi-engine), which follows immediately after elementary flying training. At this point, there is no discernible difference between them. Historically, a comparison of success rates through to the more difficult fast-jet front line has shown a small advantage for University Air Squadron trained students.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.12/1">We have agreed a procedure with Spain and the Commission allowing aviation measures to be unblocked, without prejudicing any party's position on sovereignty, or affecting day to day operations at Gibraltar airport. When such a measure is brought forward, the Commission will judge whether or not it places obligations on airports. If so, the Council and Commission will agree to the insertion of the clauses suspending application until the implementation of the 1987 Joint Declaration of the UK and Spain on Gibraltar airport, which have featured in previous measures. If not, the text will not be amended. The Transport Council agreed Common Positions on the first measures subject to this arrangement, relating to occurrence reporting and aviation statistics, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-17">17 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.12/2">We are confident that suspension will have no material impact on the operation of Gibraltar airport.

	<p pid=".38W.12/3">The Government believes that this is the best way forward until a long-term solution is found. We have always made clear that we want Gibraltar to enjoy the full benefits of EC aviation measures, as is its right. But, since the <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> atrocities in particular, it is essential for British and other European air travellers, and the companies concerned, that EC measures to improve the functioning of the aviation sector, and especially to enhance aviation security, are taken forward quickly and effectively. It would be intolerable if all air travellers were denied the benefit of such measures because of delay caused by disagreement between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar and the refusal of the Government of Gibraltar to join discussions to resolve such problems under the Brussels process.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-01.66083.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-07-01.41W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="41W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020701/text/20701w10.htm#20701w10.html_spnew0">
	<p pid=".41W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June</phrase>, the Privy Council made the Consular Fees Order 2002, which sets out the new fees for UK visas with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/2">Members of the House will recall that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-17">17 June</phrase> the House approved the draft section 102 Order, made under The Finance (No. 2) Act 1987&mdash;following a debate in the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-11">11 June</phrase>. The section 102 Order provides the legal authority for the visa fee increase by allowing past deficits incurred in the costs of running the Entry Clearance operation to be taken into account when setting visa fees and for the cross- subsidisation of the costs of different entry clearance services.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/3">Most visa fees will go up by between 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. The main increases are:</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/4" class="indent">Standard visit visa: up 9 per cent. from &pound;33 to &pound;36</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/5" class="indent">The single entry visa has ceased to exist since the introduction in October 2000 of visas of leave to enter. The new standard visa for multiple entries valid for six months at &pound;36 is cheaper than the old six-month multiple-entry visa, which provided the same level of service at a cost of &pound;45.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/6" class="indent">Five-year multiple-entry visa: up 10 per cent. from &pound;80 to &pound;88</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/7" class="indent">Settlement visa: up 8 per cent. from &pound;240 to &pound;260</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, the long-term non-settlement visa fee will increase by 50 per cent. from &pound;50 to &pound;75.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/9">A new 10-year multiple entry visa priced at &pound;150 is also being introduced for the first time. There is growing demand for this kind of visa. Its introduction will provide an enhanced service to regular travellers to the UK, without compromising the integrity of the Immigration Control.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/10">The Consular Fees Order setting new visa fees is being made not only to cover current costs but also to recover past deficits of visa fees (from April 2000), caused by the increased cost of the entry clearance operation worldwide. It is intended that these increases will return the entry clearance operation to a self-financing basis by 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/11">We recognise that these fee increases will be unwelcome. However, we must make sure that the full cost of providing a visa service is covered by visa fees.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/12">To put these increases into context:</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/13" class="indent">These would be the first fee increase for visitor's visas since 1995</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/14" class="indent">The proposed increases still keep UKvisas within their Service Delivery Agreement commitment not to increase visa fees in real terms</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/15" class="indent">The standard visit visa at &pound;36 is still cheaper than the old six-month multiple entry visa which provided the same level of service at a cost of &pound;45</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/16" class="indent">Applicants now get more for their money. Since October 2000, the standard visit visa has not only allowed people to visit the UK on multiple occasions during the validity of their leave to enter, they also benefit from an enhanced and speedier immigration process on arrival.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.2/17">UKvisas is undertaking a range of measures to reduce costs and increase productivity. But these alone will not be sufficient to recover the deficit. The increases will enable UKvisas not only to recover past deficits, but also to cover the increased costs of the provision of visa services.</p>

	<p pid=".46W.11/1">The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries is a permanent committee set up within the European Commission as a source of highly qualified scientific assistance (particularly in the application of marine and fisheries biology, fishing technology, fishing economics or similar disciplines) in relation to the implementation of the Community system for fisheries and aquaculture. The committee holds two plenary meetings per year, plus ad hoc expert groups. The UK is currently represented by scientists from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and the FRS Marine Laboratory. The commission pays travel and subsistence costs: only the cost of the experts' time, as part of their broad duty to provide scientific advice, falls to national Governments. The committee draws up annual reports on the biological, technical and economic aspects of the fisheries resource situation and on work and requirements in relation to the co-ordination of research for the fisheries and aquaculture sector. It also provides advice to the commission on prospective proposals for action.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.11/2">As the committee's role is to provide scientific, technical and economic advice to the commission, there are no issues over accountability and transparency to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.9/13">The reduction in the number of households assisted by Warm Front reflects the introduction of the package approach of measures combining insulation and heating under the scheme.

	<p pid=".55W.0/2">Of these pollutants:</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/3" class="indent">(a) 1,3 butadiene is already one of the eight pollutants covered by the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000 (&quot;the Strategy&quot;);</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/4" class="indent">(b) we consulted in September 2001 on the possibility of adding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to the list of pollutants covered by the Strategy, and hope to make an announcement on this shortly. Levels of PAH in the UK are currently measured at 21 sites, and we hope to add a further 4 sites to the network as soon as possible;</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/5" class="indent">(c) we have no immediate plans to add cadmium, arsenic, nickel and mercury to the list of pollutants covered by the Strategy. Our monitoring shows that levels of these pollutants in ambient air in the UK are not generally a cause for concern, and the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) estimates that emissions of each have fallen significantly in recent years. Between 1990 and 1999, for example, estimated emissions of cadmium, arsenic, nickel and mercury fell by 71 per cent. 69 per cent., 47 per cent., and 65 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.0/6">We understand that the planned Fourth European Union Air Quality Daughter Directive may include proposals in respect of PAH, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and mercury. We intend to keep under review the need for separate national measures on these pollutants in the light of progress with negotiations on the Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.2/1">The Government are keen to ensure that consumers have clear and relevant information about the environmental effects of consumer products. It has appointed the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment (ACCPE) to look at opportunities for developing better quality environmental information, as part of the Committee's remit to advise on ways of reducing the impacts of consumer products on the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/2">The Government are considering a number of ACCPE's recommendations for improving product information. These include proposals for improving the quality of self-declared environmental claims, which are being explored further by the Department taking into account stakeholders' views. The Government are also considering ACCPE's proposals for developing a common label for homes, cars and domestic appliances, based on the format of the EU Energy label. In the case of homes, we are looking to develop a methodology for assessing the energy efficiency of existing homes more cost effectively, and this will include a look at the possibilities for comparative energy rating. A comparative label for cars is being considered by DfT in the light of the response to their recent consultation paper on this topic.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/3">ACCPE has also proposed setting up a new internet information service which could provide advice and guidance on the environmental impacts of products and the scope for making more sustainable consumption choices. It recommended that the Government should first commission a feasibility study into such a project, and this has been done. Having considered the results of this study, ACCPE have made further recommendations in their second report, &quot;Action for Greener Products: A toolbox for change&quot;, published in May, about the practicalities of piloting a new service. The Government are currently considering how a pilot can be taken forward. Copies of ACCPE's second report have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/4">The Department already publishes and promotes the Green Claims Code which gives best practice advice to business and the consumer on environmental information and labelling.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/5">We have also published, distributed and continue to promote a number of information leaflets to help business and consumers in this area. These include &quot;Hi I'm Green&quot; which is a guide to the most commonly occurring environmental claims and labels on products and explains how to ask for further information; &quot;Energy labels for refrigeration and washing appliances&mdash;helping you make the right choice&quot;, which outlines the EU energy label scheme; and &quot;Pick the flower&mdash;the ecolabel&quot; which explains the EU ecolabelling scheme. Copies of all these leaflets have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.2/1">The Department's Green Claims Code provides guidance on good practice in the making of environmental claims. It is intended as an introduction to the more detailed guidance in the International Standard ISO14021. The Department has no plans at present to revise the Code.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/2">There is no specific piece of legislation regarding environmental information for consumers, but trading standards officers have powers under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 to deal with claims that are demonstrably false. The Director General of Fair Trading can also take action against misleading environmental claims under the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988. The Government are committed to ensuring that the regulatory framework for tackling misleading green claims is effective and will keep the need for any new legislation under review.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/3">In respect of individual environmental labelling schemes, the European Community Energy Label must be displayed on all new domestic refrigerators, freezers and fridge-freezer combinations, washing machines, electric tumble dryers, combined washer-dryers, dishwashers and lamps displayed for sale, hire or hire-purchase. The UK and other member states have until <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> to transpose Directives 2002/31/EC and 2002/40/EC which will extend this requirement to household air conditioners and electric ovens. Details of relevant legislation can be found at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/mtp/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/mtp/ index.htm</a>#S3</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/4">A separate scheme, the European ecolabel award, is designed to encourage manufacturers to reduce the environmental impacts of a growing range of products, and to encourage consumers to choose products with the label. The scheme was set up in 1992 by EU Regulation 880&ndash;92, which was revised in 2000 by Regulation 1980&ndash;2000. As Regulations, these took effect automatically in UK law without further legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/5">Participation by manufacturers is voluntary, but under the Regulations member states are required to promote the scheme and to designate competent bodies to run it. In the UK the scheme is administered by the Secretary of State. DEFRA has a website giving guidance about the scheme <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ecolabel/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ecolabel/index.htm</a>, and has produced explanatory and promotional leaflets about it for business and consumers.</p>

The latest advice from the ACFM on deep water species is contained in the committee's report published following its meeting in May 2002. Broadly, the advice on most such species is that the balance of available evidence suggests that they should be subjected only to substantially reduced&mdash;or in some cases to very low&mdash;rates of exploitation.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.3/1">I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-11">11 June</phrase>, together with Ross Finnie, Minister for Environment and Rural Development in the Scottish Executive and Mrs. Brid Rodgers, the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/2">The commissioner gave an introductory presentation on his proposals for the future of the Common Fisheries Policy, as published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-29">29 May</phrase>. Negotiations on this are scheduled to take place during the remainder of 2002, with the aim of reaching conclusions by the year-end. Ministers took the opportunity to state their initial reactions. For the United Kingdom I said that, though of course we would have concerns to pursue on some issues, we could support the broad thrust of the proposals, aimed as they are at addressing the risk of stock collapse and creating a sustainable future for the fishing industry: I said the commission was right in particular to have proposed an end to subsidies for building new vessels, continued adherence to relative stability as the method of allocating fishing opportunities among member states, and the setting up of regional advisory councils to improve stakeholders' involvement in decisions on the management of fisheries. I also emphasised the need to examine the socio-economic impact of the commission proposals and to be ready in the short-term to help the communities that depend on fishing to respond to what will inevitably be difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/3">Some member states expressed similar broad support, while others indicated significant dissent, especially in relation to the reduction of fishing effort, the ending of construction grants and what they alleged was the failure of the commission's proposals to take account of the diversity of fishing operations across the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/4">There was a useful policy debate on the commission proposal for long-term recovery plans for threatened cod and hake stocks. Aspects covered included the methodology for setting recovery targets for these stocks, the need to limit fishing effort and the ways in which this might be done, additional funding for scrapping vessels, monitoring and inspection and the introduction of emergency measures to safeguard stocks. Various views were expressed: for the UK, I gave a qualified welcome to the commission's proposal, emphasising the need for engaging with the industry in a full debate on effort control and the importance of ensuring the permanent scrapping of excess fleet capacity rather than funding the temporary tie-up of vessels. The presidency referred the dossier back to working level for development.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/5">On the protection of deep water species, the Council considered a joint presidency/commission compromise and by qualified majority reached political agreement on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for certain stocks of black scabbardfish, blue ling, greater silver smelt, ling, orange roughy, red seabream, roundnose grenadier and tusk. It also agreed, again by qualified majority, a general approach on a measure introducing a permit requirement limiting fishing capacity in relation to certain deep sea species.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/6">I declared the United Kingdom's opposition to this pair of measures. The permit system and associated provisions for data gathering are welcome in that they may eventually facilitate the introduction of the effort limitation that is truly needed to give these fragile stocks the protection that they need. But we could not support the package as a whole because of the lack of urgency in bringing about effort limitation and because of the unsatisfactory measures to protect these species in the interim. We do not consider that these measures go anything like far enough to protect these fragile species, given the bleakness of the scientists' advice. Setting TACs and quotas, especially when some species are omitted and not all areas are covered, is not in our view an adequate response. I also thought the levels of TAC too high and not based on sound science.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.3/7">The Council also adopted, unanimously, conclusions reiterating its commitment to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing&mdash;a very welcome conclusion in view of the threat posed to sustainable management of global fish stocks by the activities of flag of convenience vessels.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.9/1">Based on 1985 diet data it is estimated that in 1998 240,000 tonnes of fish were consumed by grey seals and 75,000 tonnes by common seals. The predominant prey species of seals were sand eels, cod and whiting and most of the fish taken by seals are likely to have been juveniles. Given the high rates of natural mortality for these species, there is no guarantee that had they not been caught by seals, they would have survived to reach a size at which they would have been available to either commercial fishermen or anglers. We are currently funding the Sea Mammal Research Unit to undertake an update of this work.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.12/1">The MAGP IV programme covers the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>. The latest information available covers the situation up to <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>. During this period, a decommissioning scheme was operated in the UK in 1997 to permanently withdraw capacity and engine power from the UK fleet using public aid. This resulted in reductions in gross tonnage and engine power of 1,000 tonnes and 4,443 kilowatts for the beam trawl segment of the fleet, and nine tonnes and 97 kilowatts for the pelagic segment. Further reductions in the beam trawling segment are expected in 2002 as a result of the decommissioning schemes this year.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.12/2">In addition, there have also been reductions in capacity resulting from capacity penalties on licence transfers and aggregations, and action to correct discrepancies in engine power. These reductions are permanent and are included within the assessments made of the overall gross tonnage and engine power of the UK fleet. However, separate data on such reductions are not routinely produced, and could not be made available without use of a disproportionate level of resources.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.12/3">The MAGP IV programme uses a combination of targets for the total gross tonnage and engine power of different segments of the fishing fleet to be achieved by the end of the programme on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>, along with an alternative of effort control objectives for each year that can be used for certain segments of the fleet. Both need to be borne in mind when considering whether or not the UK has met its objectives under MAGP IV. As such, using the fleet situation as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase>, the UK was outside the targets for gross tonnage and engine power for the pelagic segment, but within the targets for the beam trawl segment. However, the UK was within the effort control objectives for both of these segments.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.2/1">Before a GMO, including a GM crop, can be released in the UK or the EU it must be assessed for safety to human health and the environment and be approved under either Part B or Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC on the Deliberate Release into the Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/2">Directive 90&ndash;220 has been updated and is being replaced by the new Directive 2001/18/EC, which must be implemented by member states by October 2002. My Department is currently consulting the public on draft implementing regulations for England. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Parliamentary libraries and are available on the DEFRA website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/index">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/index</a>). The Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department of Environment for Northern Ireland will make separate implementing regulations on issues for which they have devolved powers.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/3">Decision making on proposed non-commercial releases of GMOs under Part B of the directive (e.g. research trials) occurs at the member state level. In England, a person wishing to undertake such a release must apply to DEFRA for a Part B consent, whereupon DEFRA seeks independent expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Releases into the Environment (ACRE) before a decision is taken on whether to grant or refuse a consent. Where appropriate the advice of other experts, for instance the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, will also be sought. Directive 2001&ndash;18 clarifies and extends risk assessments to ensure that &quot;direct, indirect, immediate and delayed&quot; effects on human health and the environment are covered. It also introduces a new requirement for mandatory public consultation before decisions on Part B applications are taken. We propose that such consultation should last for a minimum of 48 days.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/4">Decision-making on proposed commercial releases of GMOs under Part C of the directive occurs at the EU level. A person wishing to market a GMO in the EU must apply for a Part C consent to a competent authority of one of the member states, and the competent authority must prepare a report recommending a course of action. If the report recommends that a consent is refused, the application is rejected. If the report recommends that a consent is granted it must be forwarded to the European Commission and other member states, which discuss the application and can ask for further information, make comments on, or present reasoned objections to, the proposed release. Under the new directive, the Commission must also consult the public (for two separate periods of 30 days) while the application is being considered, and responses are copied to all member states. The Commission and member states then make a collective decision on the application, and a Part C consent is either granted or refused.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/5">Directive 2001&ndash;18 also introduces &quot;post-market monitoring&quot;, under which any GMO which is granted a Part C consent must be monitored for unanticipated effects on the environment. The new directive (like its predecessor) ensures that if new information comes to light regarding the risks posed by the GMO to human health or the environment, the consent can be altered or revoked as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/6">GM crops are also subject to other legislation. Varieties of the main agricultural and vegetable species, whether GM or non-GM, cannot be marketed commercially until they have been added to the UK national list of plant varieties or to the EU Common Catalogue (a compendium of member states' national lists). Addition to the national list is dependent on satisfactory completion of a minimum of two years of listing trials, to establish that the variety is distinct, uniform and stable and, for agricultural species, has a value for cultivation and use in the UK. A GM crop cannot be formally proposed for addition to the national list until it has Part C marketing approval under the deliberate release directive (and Novel Foods authorisation where appropriate).</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/7">In addition to clearance of the crop itself, any foods obtained from a GM crop would have to be approved under the EU Novel Foods Regulation EC/258/97. The Food Standards Agency is the UK competent authority for this legislation. Furthermore, if the GM crop is a herbicide tolerant variety, the associated herbicide use would have to be approved under pesticides legislation.</p>

It is in no way affected by, or reliant upon, the powers available under the TSE (England) Regulations 2002, which make provision for the enforcement and administration of EU legislation on TSEs and consolidate previously existing domestic legislation.</p>

We support the harmonisation of government support given to industry for the disposal of animal wastes and fallen stock. The UK position is that the costs of the collection and disposal of livestock fallen on farm are the responsibility of the farming industry: an application of the so-called &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.</p>

	<p pid=".66W.5/1">1,800 hectares of energy crops have been planted in the UK. This is primarily short rotation coppice but includes about 50 hectares of miscanthus. This Department has allocated support of &pound;29 million to solid biomass crops through the Energy Crops Scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. Working with other Departments we have put in place schemes with funding of &pound;70 million which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. We are also working closely with the Countryside Agency which has launched the Community Renewables Initiative to help local communities develop renewable energy projects. The Renewables Obligation permits the co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels. The Government have also welcomed the publication of the Energy Review by the Performance and Innovation Unit, which draws attention to the key role of renewable energy sources, including energy crops, in moving to a low carbon economy. Consultation on the key recommendations of the report will lead to a White Paper in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.2/1">This Department co-ordinates government research into biomass energy crops and total public expenditure amounts to approximately &pound;2.75 million per annum and has been stable at this level over the last five years. The production technology for transport biofuels from UK grown crops is mature and this results in a low research spend. Expenditure by this Department in the current financial year amounts to &pound;20,000 on work in support of policy development. Expenditure in the previous four years was nil, although the Department does have a large portfolio of research, costing about &pound;6 million per annum, supporting the primary production of crops such as oilseed rape, wheat and potatoes which have the potential to be used for transport fuel production. It is not possible to separately identify the cost of promotion in respect of biomass energy crops and biofuels. The Department has included generic promotion of non-food crops in its work at agricultural shows. We have also organised and attended a small number of promotional meetings and seminars linked to the development of markets for solid biomass crops. The promotion of biomass crops also takes place through our work in support of the England Rural Development Programme, the Energy Crops Scheme forming one element of that programme.</p>

	<p pid=".67W.5/1">The replacement of one million tonnes of fossil diesel with biodiesel from oilseed rape would save between 500,000 and 700,000 tonnes of carbon. Research into the production of bioethanol from starch or sugar crops generally indicates that slightly less carbon is saved through replacing petrol with bioethanol when compared with replacing fossil diesel with biodiesel. In the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed the new duty rate for biodiesel set at 20 pence per litre below the rate for Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel. The Government have also launched a second round of the Green Fuel Challenge inviting bids for pilot projects for biofuels, including bioethanol, which would qualify for duty reductions. The Forum on the Non-Food Uses of Crops is studying the potential of biodiesel and bioethanol. The Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels.</p>

	<p pid=".68W.2/1">One hectare of biomass crops yielding the equivalent of eight tonnes per annum has the potential to save about two tonnes of carbon each year. Achieving these carbon savings depends on functioning end markets for the utilisation of biomass crops. Most plantings of purpose grown energy crops have, to date, been to provide fuel for the Arbre biomass power station near Selby which expects to begin full operation later this year. In April the Government launched the Bioenergy Capital Grant Scheme which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. Further funding will be available from a Community and Household Capital Grant Scheme which will be launched later this year. Officials are also working closely with the Local Support Teams set up by the Countryside Agency, through the Community Renewables Initiative, to develop markets for renewables.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.3/1">The Department does not keep a central record of recycling facilities. However, I understand that two local authorities in Gloucestershire collect plastic for recycling&mdash;Gloucester City Council and Stroud District Council. In addition, Stroud District Community Recycling group operates a kerbside collection of materials including plastic.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.3/2">We have set statutory performance standards for recycling or composting household waste for each local authority in England. Authorities are required, on average, to double recycling by 2003&ndash;04 and triple it by 2005&ndash;06. Future targets for local authorities will be even more demanding and many authorities will need to begin collecting plastic for recycling in order to meet these targets. It is up to local authorities to decide how best to meet their recycling standards, depending on local circumstances such as housing type. However, the Government is taking various steps which should help boost plastic recycling and create more facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.3/3">Last year the Government set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), with &pound;40 million of Government and Devolved Administration funding, to tackle the market barriers to increased recycling. WRAP has identified plastics as a priority area in its business plan to 2003&ndash;04 and they intend to award a grant to address the lack of plastics reprocessing infrastructure, which should result in an additional 20,000 tonnes per annum of post- consumer plastic bottles being diverted from the waste stream. New plastic reprocessing facilities will create more demand for local authorities to collect recyclable plastic.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.3/4">I recently announced the arrangements for the distribution of the &pound;140 million fund to assist local authorities in meeting their recycling targets. We expect this fund to go towards developing new and existing recycling schemes and in some cases money from the fund may well be used to extend collection schemes to include plastics. We have specifically earmarked a proportion of this funding for tackling more difficult waste streams such as plastic.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.5/1">Packaging waste recovery notes (PRNs) and packaging waste export recovery notes (PERNs) are the main method for businesses obligated under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) to demonstrate compliance with their recovery and recycling obligations. These regulations implement the recovery and recycling targets in the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste 94/62/EC which has both environmental and single market objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.5/2">Under this directive, businesses with recovery and recycling obligations may carry out that recovery/ recycling either in the UK or elsewhere, subject to the usual rules on the export of waste. In the same way, other countries may have their waste recycled by UK reprocessors.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.5/3">The PERN system provides a method for obligated businesses to demonstrate compliance with their obligations when they have recycling carried out overseas. In terms of operation, the PERN system is the same as the PRN system in that those issuing the PERN or PRN are scrutinised by the agency before they can be accredited, the system deters fraud, and allows resources to be directed at investment in the infrastructural development needed to meet targets.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.3/1">The costs to Annex 1 parties, including the UK, of meeting their emissions reduction and limitation commitments under the Kyoto protocol have been estimated as a reduction of less than 0.7 per cent. of GDP in 2010 according to assessments assessed by the Inter-Government Panel on Climate Change. If countries do not fully implement their commitments, this will have an adverse effect on the scale of the global effort to tackle climate change which could result in greater adverse impacts. Given uncertainties, these are not possible to quantify.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.6/1">The UK biodiversity action plan and subsequent individual action plans for 45 habitat and 391 species set out the measures to be taken to conserve biodiversity in the United Kingdom. The UK biodiversity group report &quot;Sustaining the Variety of Life&mdash;5 Years of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan&quot;, published in March 2001 detailed progress on the plan and made recommendations for its further implementation. The Government expect to respond to the group's report and recommendations shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.6/2">Within the UK framework, responsibility for implementing the UK action plan now lies with the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. In the Rural White Paper &quot;Our Countryside: the Future&mdash;A Fair Deal for Rural England&quot; the Government announced it would prepare a biodiversity strategy for England. Work streams have been established covering the major sectoral policy areas impacting on biodiversity in England including, agriculture, forestry, water and wetlands, marine and coastal, urban and development, and business. In addition, there are workstreams for the cross-cutting themes of education and local and regional action. We expect to publish the strategy later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.2/1">The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73&ndash;78) has an Annex on Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships. The UK ratified this Annex in 1995 and we are working to promote its entry into force.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.2/2">The UK, other member states and those countries seeking accession to the European Union are, or will be, obliged to implement the requirements of several directives to protect the water and marine environment from land-based sewage discharges.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.2/3">For example, the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive requires by 2005 at least secondary treatment for all discharges to coastal waters from sewage treatment works serving more than 10,000 inhabitants. In England and Wales this level of treatment will be provided by the same deadline for coastal discharges from treatment works serving more than 2,000 inhabitants.</p>
	<p pid=".75W.2/4">Furthermore the UK ceased sea dumping of sewage sludge (a by-product of treatment processes) in 1998 as required by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Such dumping is now banned in the north-east Atlantic under the OSPAR Convention. At the global level, the London Convention Protocol 1996 requires that sewage sludge may only be considered for disposal at sea following a detailed waste prevention audit, consideration of other waste management options and assessment of potential environmental impacts. The UK was one of the first countries to ratify the protocol and has been active in promoting its entry into force as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.2/1">We are continually looking for ways to improve the pension system. As the hon. Lady will know, we have already made good headway in improving access to private pensions. For exmple, we have introduced stakeholder pensions which are a straightforward way for people to save for their retirement. So far, over 800,000 stakeholder pensions have been sold. We have also improved the way the minimum funding requirement operates in advance of its replacement.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/2">But, of course we can do more. The current pensions regime is too complicated and that is in no-one's interest. So the Government have commissioned a number of reviews to look for ways of simplifying and improving pension provision and regulation. The Pickering review is looking at how we can cut red tape whilst making sure that scheme members are properly protected. Linked to this is the Quinquennial review of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) which is looking at how we can ensure that the regulatory rules we put in place are clearly understood by those who need to administer them and are well policed to ensure increased security and confidence. In addition, there is the Sandler review which is looking at how the commercial retail savings market might be made to operate more effectively and efficiently, to the benefit of consumers. The Inland Revenue is also carrying out a review of the tax treatment of occupational pensions and they will consult on proposals later in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/3">The Sandler and Pickering reviews will be published in the next few weeks with the Opra review publishing later in the year. We will consider the proposals in these reports once they are published as part of our deliberations on how best to simplify the administration of private pensions.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.6/1">The introduction of stakeholder pensions has extended access of private pension provision. It is clear, however, that individuals are not saving enough and more action is needed.

	<p pid=".83W.6/2">We have already extended access to private pensions in the UK with the introduction of stakeholder pensions and the requirement of employers to designate a scheme. Around 322,000 employes have already designated a stakeholder scheme and over 800,000 stakeholders have been sold. We are removing the disincentive to save for retirement that existed in the Social Security system with the introduction of the Pension Credit. We are also ensuring that individuals have the right information to make informed choices through the introduction of combined pensions forecasts, money purchase illustrations and our ongoing pensions education campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/3">There is a need to ensure that the regulatory system for pensions is appropriate and not unnecessarily complicated and that the retail savings market operates as it should. That is why we commissioned Alan Pickering to review pensions regulation and Ron Sandler to review the retail savings market. Both of these reviews are due to report shortly and we will respond to any proposals in the Autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.11/1">It is very early days yet but we are committed to making a real difference to the lives of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/2">The Pension Service, formally launched on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, will provide a modern, efficient and customer focused service, dedicated to combating poverty and encouraging saving for both today's and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/3">It will comprise centralised pension centres working with an improved local service nationwide which will operate in the community working with local partners to provide face to face contact for pensioners. To date ten pension centres are starting to establish themselves along call-centre lines as planned.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/4">A key aim of The Pension Service is to provide an excellent customer service by making use of the advances in new technology. This will be done through our call-centres. Customers can access us easily through a simple range of telephone numbers, and can get their claims and queries dealt with quickly by trained experts who understand state pensions and the needs of their customers.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/5">We fully recognise that not everyone can access the service using the telephone, post or internet&mdash;and for those customers there will be a community based local service.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/6">On current planning assumptions the local service is being introduced on a phased basis and should be in place nationwide by October 2002. It will be made up of two key elements. A direct local service, providing support directly to customers which will include a targeted visiting service both in the home and at third party locations, and a 'drop in' surgery service for outreach and take up activities; and partnership services provided with partners such as local authorities and voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.11/7">The Pension Service sees a key shift in emphasis from processes to people: their needs, what they want and the way they want it delivered. This improved service will be rolled out over the next few years. In the interim, our customers will continue to deal with their existing social security offices until they are contacted in writing about the new arrangements.</p>

These figures therefore cannot be added together, as the resulting figure would include double counting. This overlap had no impact on the final published results for the estimated overall value of monetary loss as analysts made compensatory adjustments, reducing the figures by around 1 per cent. of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.2/14">The average levels of monetary loss in cases of customer and official error are lower than those in fraud cases, as shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.5/1">The information requested is set out in the table. Our priority is to ensure that all pensioners have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. The basic state pension will remain the foundation of income in retirement. To achieve this, we have increased the basic state pension over the last two years above the level of RPI and we have provided extra help for pensioners through the minimum income guarantee, winter fuel payments and free TV licences for the over-75s. We have given a guarantee that the basic state pension will be increased by at least &pound;100 a year for single pensioners and &pound;160 for couples in 2003&ndash;04 and in future years by 2.5 per cent. or the increase in the September retail prices index, whichever is the higher.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.5/2">Compared with the 1997 system, an average pensioner household will be &pound;840 a year better off and around 1.8 million of the poorest pensioner households will be over &pound;1,000 a year better off, and the Government will be spending an extra &pound;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners this year. This &pound;6 billion includes &pound;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners, which is three times more than an earnings link since 1998 would have given them.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.5/1">Retirement pension (RP) and invalid care allowance (ICA) are income maintenance benefits. The former provides income replacement for those who have reached pensionable age, while the latter provides a measure of financial support for those who have given up the opportunity of full-time paid employment in order to care for a severely disabled person. It is a basic principle of the social security system that only one such benefit can be paid at any time because to pay both of them in full at the same time would amount to duplicate provision for the same need.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/2">The Regulatory Reform (Carer's Allowance) Order 2002, made on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-29">29 May 2002</phrase>, will enable older carers with little or no retirement pension to receive invalid care allowance, while those with low incomes will benefit by gaining access to the carer premium worth &pound;24.80 a week, paid with income-related benefits such as the minimum income guarantee. This follows the substantial increases to the carer premium and to the earnings limit for entitlement to invalid care allowance made in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/3">There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.8/1">We recognise that at the time of a spouse's death it is important for a bereaved person to know about the full range of benefits that he or she may be entitled to.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.8/2">Information about benefits that may be claimed is made available in a variety of ways. In the case of bereavement benefits, since March 2001 the Department has issued leaflets to doctors' surgeries, post offices and support organisations. Articles explaining the new benefits were placed in a variety of magazines prior to their introduction in April 2001. As with other benefits, information and a claim form can also be accessed through a number of Government internet sites.</p>

Any safety-critical information that comes to light will immediately be disseminated to the railway industry to prevent any further similar accidents in the future.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/2">In addition to its PSA targets, the former DTLR had a number of targets set in the supporting Service Delivery Agreement (SDA) agreed between the then DETR and Treasury Ministers following the 2000 Spending Review. (Those relating to the Fire Service were agreed with Home Office Ministers, whose responsibility the Fire Service then was.) Achievement against these targets is monitored by the Department's Finance Directorate and reported quarterly to Ministers and to the Treasury. The 19 SDA targets and progress against them were published in the DETR Annual Report for 2001 (Command 5105) and in the DTLR Annual Report for 2002 (Command 5405).</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/3">Each of the former DTLR's 10 executive agencies were set key targets for 2002&ndash;03 by Ministers. These were announced to Parliament through written answers, details of which are set out as follows. Each agency chief executive is accountable to Ministers for the performance of their agency. The Department also regularly monitors performance against each agency's targets. All DTLR agencies publish annual report and accounts at the end of every financial year, which report on their performance against their targets.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/4">I refer my hon. Friend to the answers on DTLR agencies targets as given on:</p>

	<p pid=".113W.5/12">Performance targets for executive NDPBs sponsored by the former DTLR, including outputs to be achieved, are normally agreed by Ministers and set out in the published business or corporate plan of the NDPB. Copies of such plans are available from the bodies. In most cases the Department monitors performance against these targets and for the more high profile bodies progress is discussed with Ministers. Outputs and achievements of each executive body are set out in its annual report. Copies of the annual report are available in the Library of the house.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/13">The Secretary of State has no powers of direction over the General Lighthouse Authorities' operational activities and those bodies are responsible for setting their own performance targets and the level of service required. A business plan for the Standards Board for England (created in 2001) is being prepared and performance targets will be agreed with the Department. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is required, by its Directions and Guidance from the Secretary of State, to work within its statutory framework to deliver the key rail targets set out in &quot;Transport 2010: the Ten Year Plan&quot; and to work with the rail industry to achieve substantial improvements in performance. Statistics in SRA's regular publications, &quot;On track&quot; and &quot;National Rail Trends&quot;, provide an indication of achievement.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/14">No performance targets are set for the former Department's advisory NDPBs. Each advisory body normally sets its own programme of work for each year within its remit to advise Ministers on the particular policy area and agree this with the Department. No formal monitoring of performance takes place for these advisory bodies but outputs are set out in each body's annual report.</p>

Responses from schools varied in their level of detail and so it was not possible to conduct a systematic analysis. However, the most frequently cited reasons related to the time demands the survey would place upon school staff and on the selected students.</p>

	<p pid=".122W.6/1">Statistics on playing field sales were not collected until our playing fields legislation came into force. Public concern about the loss of school playing fields led directly to the introduction in October 1998 of Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Before Section 77 was introduced, only grant- maintained schools were required to seek consent from the Secretary of State before selling land, including areas of their playing fields. Local authorities and other schools that owned their own playing fields were free to sell without restriction.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.6/2">The then Department for Education and Employment estimated that an average of 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way before October 1998. Their estimate is based on the number of playing field disposals at grant-maintained schools between April 1996, when the previous Government further encouraged the disposal of playing fields by relaxing the Local Authority Capital Finance Regulations which governed the use of sale proceeds, and <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase>, when section 77 took effect. During this 30-month period, some 64 grant- maintained schools were given approval to dispose of areas of playing field, which is an average of over two a month. Using the proportion of grant-maintained schools at that time compared with the number of other schools, the Department for Education and Skills estimate the total number of playing field disposals each month to have been around 40.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.2/1">Ground source heat pumps (GSHP) are a proven and reliable technology that can be commercially attractive in certain situations. DTI helped fund the establishment of a UK heat pump network in 1999 to promote the technology. The Government now encourages the development of this technology through the Carbon Trust's &quot;Action Energy&quot; programme, which is supported by DEFRA, the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office, the National Assembly for Wales and Invest Northern Ireland. The Carbon Trust currently supports the following GSHP activities:</p>

The list does not include projects for which ECGD has solely provided overseas investment insurance and other insurances since such cases are treated as commercial in confidence.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.5/2">In estimating the value of carbon emissions it has been assumed that, upon completion, the stations will operate for 60 per cent. of the time (5,256 hours per year). It has also been assumed that carbon makes up 27.3 per cent. of the atomic mass of CO <sub>2</sub> and that coal produces CO <sub>2</sub> at 0.687 tonnes per MW per hour.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.5/3">These assumptions are taken from the greenhouse gas protocol website <a href="http://www.ghgprotocol.org">www.ghgprotocol.org</a> and are the 1999 average values for power plants in &quot;Economies In Transition&quot; (i.e. markets where ECGD most commonly provides guarantees).</p>

	<p pid=".133W.5/2">The Government are committed to promoting a positive and strategic approach to regional planning for renewable energy development in the UK. Last year, we initiated the preparation of regional studies, including regional assessments of the potential for renewables and targets, representing the practical capacity achievable in regions by 2010. These studies have now been completed and the findings were published by Oxera in February 2002. These findings have also been channelled to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's office, who are currently revising the Planning Policy Guidance Note, PPG22, to give local planning authorities more up-to-date guidance on renewables planning.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.5/3">I have also announced the allocation of &pound;1.7 million worth of work in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to take forward the facilitation of renewable energy planning. In addition, the Scottish Executive will continue to work with local authorities in Scotland on renewables planning. This is the first tranche of funding from the &pound;2.5 million for planning announced by the PIU energy review. In addition to the DTI funding, the bids we received showed that matched funding of over &pound;2 million can be expected from local organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.5/4">That is a real boost to this work and a very encouraging indication of the interest being taken at local level in renewables planning. This fund will be used to support the development of sub-regional targets and to take forward initiatives such as good practice guidelines and further stakeholder engagement in renewable energy developments.</p>
	<p pid=".133W.5/5">The Renewables Obligation, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, is the main instrument through which renewable energy development will be supported. The Obligation will be backed up by direct Government funding worth over &pound;260 million for the period 2001&ndash;04, including the allocation of &pound;74 million for the development of offshore wind projects, &pound;78.5 million for the establishment of energy crops and biomass schemes and &pound;20 million to kick-start a major solar PV demonstration scheme.</p>

The Government of Sudan reassured us that there were no plans to legalise the practice. The embassy also works closely with Sudanese civil society groups in advocating the eradication of FGM. It forms part of the campaign for ratification of the UN Convention on the Eradication of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in which we have actively supported the growing women's rights movement and UN attempts to address these issues. In particular, our embassy has ongoing contact with UNICEF. We have also funded various projects aimed at eradication of FGM, including the national advocacy campaign for 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".141W.2/1">Latest forecasts from the World Bank suggest that globally, meeting the 2015 target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty is attainable. There has been progress. During the 1990s, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world fell from 29 per cent. in 1990 to 23 per cent. in 1999. This was mainly due to the substantial progress made during the 1990s in east Asia and, in particular, China.</p>

The proportion of children completing a full course of primary school increased from 68 per cent. to 73 per cent.; the under-five mortality rate decreased from 88 to 84 deaths per 1,000 births; and the proportion of people with access to an improved water source increased from 73 per cent. to 79 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.2/3">However, to meet all of the 2015 targets we must do more. The sub-Saharan African region presents the biggest challenge to meeting the 2015 targets. We therefore need to make an enormous effort internationally to accelerate progress in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.2/4">A detailed description of progress towards all the 2015 targets is contained in a recent World Bank publication: &quot;World Development Indicators 2002&quot;, which can be found at the following website: <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/data/wdi2002/worldview.pdf">http://www.worldbank.org/data/ wdi2002/worldview.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid=".141W.8/1">There are difficulties both in the coverage and the timeliness of primary education data compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and published by the World bank, for some of the major UK development partner countries.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.8/2">The problems with coverage which we have encountered in reporting against the Public Service Agreement targets are due partly to the difficulty of calculating net primary enrolment rates (ie proportion of children of primary school age in school), often due to lack of data on the ages of children in school. Gross enrolment data (which use the total number of children in school regardless of age) are relatively easy to obtain for most countries, but do not give a clear picture of the number of children who are out of school.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.8/3">In some countries the reliability of the pupil data is also questionable due either to lack of technical capacity, poor school record keeping, or, in a few cases, political manipulation of the figures. Calculating net enrolment rates also requires figures for the population of school age children, which are often based on out-of-date census data. Where there are doubts about the reliability of either the pupil or population figures, UNESCO can often either decline to publish figures for a country, or revise earlier figures.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.8/4">For most countries, it can take a long time for data produced at country level to be provided to international bodies (principally the UNESCO Institute for Statistics), be verified by them and published in international reports. For example, the latest officially published net primary enrolment figure for Uganda is 57 per cent. although we knew from our work in country that the figure is much higher and is probably over 85 per cent. This published figure is more than five years old.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.8/5">We are working at country level and with the World bank and UNESCO Institute of Statistics to improve the availability of timely data on primary education to assist with policy making, both for developing countries and for bilateral donors and the international community.</p>

	<p pid=".144W.5/1">The food security situation throughout Afghanistan remains grave, as a result of decades of conflict and four years of drought. These shocks have overwhelmed the capacity of Afghan communities to cope with the loss of agriculture and livestock production, unemployment and burgeoning debt burdens. Afghanistan currently meets less than half of its national grain requirements, and around half its population is dependent on food aid. However, improved security and political stability will help provide a better environment for the efforts to improve food security in the country. Since October 2001, my Department has contributed &pound;7 million to the World Food Programme and &pound;2 million to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, for the provision of both emergency food aid and measures to increase food security.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.0/1">The ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, often referred to as the Cotonou Agreement, was signed in Cotonou on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-23">23 June 2000</phrase>. Pending ratification by all member states and two thirds of the ACP states, it will enter into effect.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.0/2">The Cotonou Agreement is the successor to the Lom&eacute; Conventions. It marks the most important revision of the relationship between EU and the ACP states since the first Lom&eacute; Convention was signed in 1975. It provides an overall framework for political dialogue, development co-operation and trade relations with 78 developing countries. Together with the wider on-going reform of EC development assistance, the Cotonou Agreement is a step towards improving the European Community contribution to the meeting of the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.0/3">Most importantly, the Cotonou Agreement has established poverty reduction as its central aim. Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law together with the importance of good governance underpin the agreement and have been given much more emphasis than in past relations. A process for consultations and possible action has been defined if these basic elements of the agreement have been breached. The principle of partnership between EU and ACP states has also been reaffirmed in the agreement, supporting the emphasis on mutual responsibility and dialogue. Likewise, consultations with civil society in all aspects of the implementation of the agreement have been put to the fore.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.0/4">One of the most important aspects of Cotonou is the new trade deal between EU and the ACP, whereby ACP's access to the EU market will be maximised while promoting their gradual integration into the global economy. The EU is now committed to open its markets to a substantial block of developing countries.</p>

The scheme started on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-06">6 May 2002</phrase> for those centres with the appropriate infrastructure in place.

	<p pid=".155W.2/17">A report of a suspected reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the medicine. As the scheme is voluntary, not all adverse reactions are reported.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.2/18">It is generally recognised that the reporting rate for medicines supplied over the counter is lower than for prescription medicines. Therefore, data obtained on suspected adverse reactions associated with herbal medicines through the yellow card scheme, cannot be directly compared to reporting for licensed pharmaceutical medicines. With herbal medicines in particular, consumers often do not tell their general practitioner or pharmacist that they are taking a herbal remedy.</p>

	<p pid=".158W.2/2">Stroke sentinel audits 1999&ndash;2001 carried out by the Royal College of Physicians, showed that the number of people treated in a stroke unit had increased. However, none of the data identify individual hospitals. The next audit will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/3">The monitoring of the national service framework stroke standard, April 2002 milestone, requiring the development of integrated stroke services will be available shortly.</p>

The Department has contributed towards the funding of this study. The study is being conducted in over 100 general practitioners practices in the UK covering nearly 33,000 people aged 75 years or over registered with participating practices. It will determine both the cost effectiveness of these different strategies of assessment and management and their effectiveness as measured by mortality, hospital admissions and quality of life.

	<p pid=".172W.2/2">The Lord Chancellor is committed to the principles of equality of opportunity and appointment on merit and is keen to see an increasingly diverse judiciary. The number of women and minority ethnic judges should be seen in the context of the composition of the profession from which judges are drawn. In 2000&ndash;01 5.4 per cent. of barristers with over 15 years' experience were of ethnic minority origin (there were no comparable figures for solicitors) and 14.4 per cent. of barristers with over 15 years' experience were women and 15.5 per cent. of solicitors with over 15 years' experience were women. The average length of time lawyers are in practice before being appointed to first rung judicial appointments is between 15 and 20 years. Those appointed to the more senior levels have much longer experience in the profession.</p>
	<p pid=".172W.2/3">The proportion of ethnic minority and women judges in post has been steadily increasing over the years. For example, in April 1998 the proportion of women in the main tiers of the judiciary was 10.3 per cent. This had increased to 14.4 per cent. by April 2002. The proportion of ethnic minority judges in post in April 1998 was 1.6 per cent.; in April 2002 it was 2.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".174W.3/1">The IAA is not currently planning to shut the existing hearing centre in Leeds&mdash;they are opening an additional centre in Bradford which was identified from possible options in the Yorkshire area. This is part of the publicised expansion of the IAA to deal with 6,000 asylum cases per month from November 2002. Consultation on the new site has taken place within the IAA, and with the Home Office and Legal Services Commission. Staff and adjudicators will be given the option of moving to the new site in Bradford if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".174W.3/2">As part of the expansion of the IAA the emphasis has been placed on larger hearing centres. Small satellite courts, consisting of only one or two hearing rooms, have less flexibility in relation to listing and hence lower efficiency. As a result, it is intended that the IAA will cease to use its small satellite courts as the new centres come on stream. The hearing centre at Leeds is not, however, classified as a satellite court.</p>

The review completed last year (which did not lead to any significant change of policy or practice) was conducted by means of communications between Ministers and officials, and legal advice to Ministers.

Friend the Deputy First Minister and Minster for Justice for Scotland, and my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Filkin, represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/2" class="italic">A points</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/3">The A points were approved as in document 9825/02 PTS A 31 and ADD 1 and COR 1 (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), except points 23, 24, 25 and 45.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/4" class="italic">Terrorism</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/5">The Council noted a terrorism threat assessment document, Europol reports on security measures taken since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> and extremist terrorism, and a report on the current list of terrorist organisations. The Director of Europol reported on the work of the Europol Counter-Terrorism Task Force, noting that the provision of information to Europol had improved but remained insufficient and that more could be done to improve co-operation with the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/6">Activities of the Spanish presidency on the subject of violence against women, to be submitted by the Ministers of Education, Justice, Home Affairs and Health at forthcoming Councils:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/7">The presidency presented a study on measures adopted by member states to combat violence against women and a guide to good practice to mitigate the effects of and eradicate violence against women.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/8" class="italic">Illegal immigration and external borders</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/9">During a general debate on illegal immigration and asylum, I called for the Seville European Council to deliver concrete results so that citizens could see the relevance of a European Union (EU) approach. I said that the message should not be one of fortress Europe but a coherent policy which opposed racism, welcomed legal inward migration, protected refugees and ensured that each member state accepted its responsibilities. I supported common action to work to protect the European Union's external frontier, arguing that this should be achieved through the use of joint operations at weak points in the border, extensions of the immigration liaison officer network and greater use of Europol's expertise, rather than through the establishment of a new border police. I also supported the need to complete work on common asylum measures and co-operation with third countries in a spirit of &quot;positive conditionality&quot;, involving the provision of assistance to support returns and develop migration infrastructures.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/10">The Council also noted a presidency report on progress made in the fight against illegal immigration, agreed conclusions on measures to be established for the prevention of and the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings by sea and agreed a plan on the management of external borders.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/11">Proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member state responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member states by a third-country national:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/12">In discussing key aspects of the draft Dublin II Regulation, the majority of member states, including the United Kingdom, said that the existing Dublin Convention criteria should be taken as a starting point but that procedures should be improved and time limits shortened. Two member states with difficult external frontiers argued that they should not be penalised by virtue of their geographical position. Two other member states also opposed the proposed new criterion on tolerated illegal presence.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/13">Proposal for a Council Decision on the implementation of specific measures for police and judicial co-operation to combat terrorism in accordance with Article 4 of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/14">The Council reached a general approach on the Council Decision. Portugal, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom maintained parliamentary scrutiny reserves on the text.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/15">Proposal for a Council Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/16">The Council reached a general approach on the majority of the text. However, member states were divided by a proposal to permit the imposition of lower penalties for trafficking in small quantities of drugs. The presidency concluded that discussions on this item would continue under the Danish presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/17">Proposal for a Council Directive to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid and other financial aspects of civil proceedings:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/18">The Council agreed that the scope of the draft Legal Aid Directive should be limited to cross-border claims.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/19">Proposal for a Council Regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested claims:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/20">The Commission presented its proposal for a European enforcement order. This would abolish, in uncontested cases, the requirement for a court to examine the procedure by which a judgment was issued in another member state before recognising the validity of that judgment.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/21" class="italic">Civilian aspects of crisis management:</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/22">The presidency reported that member states had met the targets set by the Gothenburg European Council for the provision of officials and judges to international missions intended to strengthen the rule of law in third countries.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/23" class="italic">Any Other Business</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/24">The Commission presented its revised scoreboard on the implementation of the Tampere European Council conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/25" class="italic">Mixed Committee</p>
	<p pid=".179W.9/26">The Mixed Committee with Norway and Iceland met at ministerial level in the margins of the Council. It noted the existence of two negotiating mandates for the association of Switzerland with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, the Dublin Convention and Eurodac acquis; of a general approach on the proposal for a Decision amending Article 40 of the Schengen Convention, subject to parliamentary scrutiny reserves from Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; of conclusions concerning the new requirements for the Schengen Information System (SIS) and a technical solution for the participation in the SIS by the United Kingdom and Ireland, reflecting the partial participation of the United Kingdom and Ireland in Schengen; and of a plan on the management of external borders.</p>

There was widespread consultation prior to the introduction in April 2000 of the regime, the provisions for which are contained in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. There was further consultation when the regime was extended first to rail freight trains and then to freight shuttle trains. Industry representatives and other interested parties have been informed about the proposed changes to the legislation and have been sent copies of the draft code of practice for determining the level of penalty.

Samples can only be used for purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.2/1">&quot;Through the Prison Gate&quot; was the first joint thematic report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation on the theme of resettlement. The two chief inspectors have provided an authoritative and thoughtful analysis of what the prison and probation services are doing together to reintegrate offenders back into the community and so reduce re-offending, and of what more both services need to do. I am very grateful to them for this analysis, much of which is reinforced in the report &quot;Reducing re-offending by Ex-Prisoners&quot; published today by the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU).</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/2">Both of these reports recognise the importance of identifying the factors which need to be addressed for individual offenders if the risks of them re-offending are to be reduced. They also recognise the importance of developing an integrated approach to the management of offenders throughout their sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/3">The chief inspectors' report makes recommendations on the need for:</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/4" class="indent">a national resettlement strategy;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/5" class="indent">the position of short-term prisoners to be taken into account when reviewing the sentencing framework;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/6" class="indent">the Prison and Probation Services to develop the what works strategy and to achieve consistency and continuity in preventing re-offending and reintegrating offenders into the community;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/7" class="indent">a case management approach, and for the Prison and Probation Services to review the respective roles of their staff at different stages of a prison sentence;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/8" class="indent">the Prison Service to develop a strategy for prisoners to be located closer to home;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/9" class="indent">the Prison and Probation Services to develop a co-ordinated partnership plan as part of their what works resettlement strategy;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/10" class="indent">both services to develop a joint strategy for drug and alcohol misuse;</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/11" class="indent">both services to provide guidance on the role of home detention curfew (HDC); and</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/12" class="indent">both services to ensure that a national public protection policy is developed for the assessment and management of risk in all cases.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/13">Many of these issues are also picked up in the SEU report. The Government will now be producing an action plan setting out our proposals for taking forward the recommendations. In drawing up that action plan we will also take account of the recommendations made by the chief inspectors.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/14">As the chief inspectors acknowledge, the Prison and Probation Services have made progress in developing and co-ordinating their resettlement policies under the what works approach. However, there is a need for greater overall strategic direction including greater sharing of good practice and performance targets.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/15">We have already taken steps to provide greater strategic direction by making arrangements for the establishment of the Correctional Services Board, which will bring together the heads of the Prison and Probation Services and the chair of the Youth Justice Board. Outside experience and skills will be provided by non-executive members. Early priorities for the board will include the development of a strategic plan for the correctional services, with a particular focus, as the report recommends, on improving provision for those sentenced to less than 12 months, and, in particular, 18 to 20 year old offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/16">In taking forward both the chief inspectors' and the SEU reports we will also be developing a national resettlement strategy. Details will be set out in the action plan which will now be developed.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/17">That action plan will also include proposals for developing and piloting a case management approach, as recommended by the chief inspectors, building upon the pilot schemes which the Prison and Probation Services are already running.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/18">&quot;Through the Prison Gate&quot; draws attention to the benefits of keeping prisoners closer to their homes in the months before release and to the benefits of home detention curfew in helping prisoners prepare for release. We believe that HDC can play an important part in helping offenders to settle back into the community in a controlled way.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/19">We also recognise the advantages for resettlement of prisoners being able to serve their sentences closer to home. Although the increasing prison population makes it difficult to achieve this we will continue to explore both nationally and regionally what more can be done to minimise the number of prisoners held outside their home area.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/20">The importance of tackling drug and alcohol problems is highlighted in both &quot;Through the Prison Gate&quot; and the SEU report. A good deal of investment has been made by both services in this area, but there is clearly more to be done, particularly in ensuring continuity of care and of provision in the community. We will be addressing this issue further as we take forward the planning and implementation of our resettlement strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/21">&quot;Through the Prison Gate&quot; also highlights the importance for a national public protection policy of the assessment and management of risk in all cases. The effective management of dangerous offenders is a priority for both the Prison and Probation Services. Both services have a detailed programme of work in support of their public protection objectives, and are represented on the Home Office Dangerous Offenders Advisory Group. The establishment of multi agency public protection panels has placed a statutory duty on police and probation services to make joint arrangements for the assessment and management of sexual, violent and other offenders who may cause serious harm. These panels work closely with the prison service and other agencies in managing the risk presented by such offenders. In addition the National Probation Service is working with the Police Information Technology Organisation on the development of a joint police/probation database, which will cover all offenders falling under the public protection duty placed on the police and the National Probation Service by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/22">Both services are also working together with the Parole Board to develop revised guidance on the setting of licence conditions to ensure a more consistent approach and are piloting the use of electronic monitoring as a licence condition, focusing in particular on dangerous offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/23">A detailed commentary on all the recommendations contained in the inspectorates' report describing work currently in hand by the Prison Service and the National Probation Service has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/24">&quot;Through the Prison Gate&quot; together with the SEU report, has set out a challenging set of tasks and the new Correctional Services Board. We will in due course be publishing an action plan setting out our detailed proposals in response to the SEU report, and the recommendations of the chief inspectors.</p>
