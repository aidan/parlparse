	<p pid="c.2167W.10/2">For individuals and families, work is the best route out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.10/3">Pathways to Work will be rolled out across Britain by April 2008 and this will support the introduction of the new Employment and Support Allowance later in 2008. Both of these measures will encourage and support incapacity benefit claimants into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.10/4">Furthermore, our Welfare Reform Green Paper &quot;In work, better off&quot; Cm7130, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July 2007</phrase>, sets out how the Government aims to continue to move towards full employment, giving everyone the chance to work and contribute to society.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.10/5">Earlier this year DWP published Working for Children, our strategy for parental employment, and this year's Budget announced that the child element of child tax credit will rise by &pound;150 from April 2008. This, along with a package of reforms to the personal tax and benefit system in Budget 2007, will help lift 200,000 children out of poverty by 2008-09. As part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review, DWP is working closely with HM Treasury, the Department for Families, Children and Schools, and other government departments on producing a child poverty Delivery Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.10/6">For pensioners, our strategy is to target help on the poorest pensioners, while providing a solid foundation of support for all. This approach has been successful but we are not complacent, and realise there is more to do to ensure that pensioners get the money they are entitled to by raising awareness and encouraging people to claim.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.10/7">We also intend to strengthen State Pensions as a credible foundation for private saving. The Pensions Bill, which is currently before Parliament, will make State Pensions more universal and more generous, and will include a commitment to uprate the Pension Credit Minimum Guarantee in line with earnings growth, locking in the gains made in combating poverty.</p>

	<p pid="c.2168W.3/1">The UK has an existing three-year &pound;24 million community recovery programme in three provinces in DRC, which started in April 2007 and is being implemented by three international NGOs (the International Rescue Committee, the International Foundation for Care and Self-Help (IFESH) and CARE). The programme includes work on local governance and will support the creation of community level development committees that collectively plan and manage development projects such as re-building clinics, schools and bridges destroyed by fighting.</p>
	<p pid="c.2168W.3/2">DFID has established a central Governance and Transparency Fund which will commit up to &pound;100 million to civil society organisations working in the area of governance and transparency. Overall, civil society organisations are developing nearly 300 projects and final selection will take place later this year. The DFID office in DRC has been active in encouraging civil society organisations based in DRC to apply to this fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.2168W.3/3">We are also working with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to develop a democracy and accountability programme of around &pound;40 million. Through this programme UNDP will establish a mechanism to provide sustainable funding to a range of civil society organisations (local, international and faith-based) working on governance and democracy themes. We expect this to become operational in 2008.</p>

It is a modern scheme and provides fair and simple arrangements, which focus help on the more severely disabled. For the first time, a tax-free lump sum is payable in-service to personnel to compensate for pain and suffering based on a range of tariffs graduated according to the seriousness of the condition. A tax-free inflation proof guaranteed income payment, payable for life, is also payable on discharge for those who suffer the more serious injuries. This has the potential to be worth many hundreds of thousands of pounds over the lifetime of the claimant.</p>
	<p pid="c.2171W.2/2">We continually monitor the scheme in order to ensure that we provide the best of care for our serving personnel and veterans. As a part of this monitoring process, and in light of recent operational experience I have commissioned a review that is looking at one aspect of the scheme, which is the rules relating to the compensation paid to those personnel who receive multiple injuries as a result of a single incident. I hope to be able to announce the outcome of the review shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.2174W.6/2">Overwatch is a term used by UK military planners in Multi-National Division South-East to describe the force posture by coalition forces within a given province in Iraq, in relation to the progressive transfer of security responsibility to Iraqi security forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.2174W.6/3">There are three phases of overwatch: tactical, operational and finally strategic. As each province passes through these phases, the division of responsibility between coalition and Iraqi security forces is adjusted to take account of the changing security situation and increasing capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.2174W.6/4">In the UK's area of responsibility in Iraq, three of the four provinces (Al Muthanna, Dhi Qar, and Maysan) are currently in the operational overwatch phase. Security in the fourth province, Basra, will remain the responsibility of coalition forces until the conditions are appropriate to transfer responsibility to the Iraqi Security Forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.2175W.2/1">The NATO Pipeline System was developed to ensure that NATO's requirements for petroleum products and their distribution could be met at all times. The system comprises 10 separate fuel storage and distribution systems with a total of 12,000 km of pipeline linking storage depots, air bases, civil airports, refineries and ingress points. Of these systems, two are multi-national systems and eight are national systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.2175W.2/2">One of the eight national systems, the Government Pipeline and Storage System (GPSS), is owned by MOD and operated by the Oil and Pipelines Agency, a non-departmental public body. Although owned by MOD, the GPSS is a key element of the UK's critical national infrastructure. GPSS irreducible spare capacity is exploited for commercial use with military/commercial throughput split approximately 20:80. On the basis of commercial receipts, the MOD moves and stores its aviation fuel at no cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.2192W.11/5">Unitary charge payments are projections covering more than the repayment of the capital value of a project and are conditional on the performance of the private sector contractor. The unitary charge payments often cover maintenance, cleaning and other services.</p>

	<p pid="c.2193W.0/2">It is Government policy to work with BAA and other relevant bodies to see whether the further development of Heathrow is possible within strict environmental limits. It would be impossible to assess the viability of the further growth of Heathrow without the input of the airport operator. We expect to be consulting publicly later this year and for the reasons already explained in correspondence with the hon. Member, we do not believe it is in the public interest to release information on draft documents ahead of that consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.2196W.5/1">The inclusion in the Road Safety Act 2006 of the repeal of the exemption from private hire vehicle (PHV) licensing requirements of contracts lasting for a period of not less than seven days was motivated by the paramount need to ensure the safety of those being carried under contracts for the hire of a PHV.</p>
	<p pid="c.2196W.5/2">PHV licence fees are set by local licensing authorities and vary widely from area to area. Making reasonable assumptions about the total numbers of currently unlicensed drivers, vehicles and operators likely to be involved, and about average licence fees, we estimate that the total cost across all those sectors using PHV contracts will be about &pound;1 million. We have not made a separate estimate of costs likely to be borne by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2196W.5/3">It should be noted that many contracts will already be carried out by drivers, vehicles and operators that are already licensed or to whom the contact exemption did not apply. Furthermore, the proportion of licensing costs which will be passed on to those awarding contracts will depend on contracts terms in each case.</p>

	<p pid="c.2198W.8/2"><i> </i>The flags, patron saints and the national anthem of the United Kingdom are not a separate element of the citizenship curriculum and there are currently no plans to change this. However, understanding the origins and implications of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom is an important part of citizenship curriculum, which has been statutory for 11-16 year olds since 2002. Following the recommendation in Sir Keith Ajegbo's recent review of &quot;Diversity and Citizenship in the Curriculum&quot;, from September 2008 the revised citizenship curriculum for secondary schools will include a new strand entitled &quot;Identity and Diversity: living together in the UK&quot;. In this context, pupils will have the opportunity to explore what it means to be a UK citizen and the unique qualities that are part of our shared identity. They may consider the political, religious, social and constitutional systems that affect their lives and communities and that may include learning about the flags, patron saints and the national anthem.</p>

	<p pid="c.2203W.8/2">The Department began co-ordinating voluntary twice-yearly national truancy sweeps in May 2002. Each sweep focused local authority activity within the three-week period on which our data collections were based.</p>
	<p pid="c.2203W.8/3">We took the decision in January 2007 to end this national co-ordination and data collection. Many local authorities had by then established local sweeps which were better aligned to local police service schedules, operating more frequently and effectively than within a centrally prescribed three-week period.</p>
	<p pid="c.2203W.8/4">Having given local authorities the flexibility to make more effective local arrangements, we do not attempt to closely monitor these but instead gather and share their effective practice with others. Since April 2007, police community service officers have the power to remove absentee pupils from a public place. Later this month, we will publish updated guidance on effective practice in planning and undertaking truancy sweeps to reflect these powers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2211W.2/1">Education and training of healthcare staff, including the prevention, detection and treatment of pressure ulcers, is the responsibility of their employers. Tissue viability is a vital component of nursing care for patients, and one in which there is a strong body of evidence about effective treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/2">Nurses receive training in this during their preparation for registration, and as part of their continuing professional development. They have access to specialist tissue viability nurses who provide training as well as expert advice in the care of individual patients. To reinforce the necessity for continuing learning, regulatory bodies, such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council, require healthcare professionals to maintain competence in their field of practice as a condition of their continued registration.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/3">There are no central plans to require healthcare staff to report incidents of pressure sores. However, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on tissue viability requires that pressure ulceration over grade 2 be treated as a local clinical incident. Tissue viability is considered a nurse-sensitive indicator and is viewed by trusts as an important pointer to the quality of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/4">&quot;Essence of Care&quot;, published in 2003, sets benchmarks for pressure ulcers in health and social care settings, and helps healthcare professionals to devise appropriate care plans. NICE has published detailed clinical guidelines on pressure ulcer management in primary and secondary care. It is the responsibility of local health bodies to ensure that this guidance is implemented.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/5">In respect of care homes, regulation 13(6) of the Care Home Regulations 2001, states:</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The registered person shall make arrangements, by training staff or by other measures, to prevent service users being harmed or suffering abuse or being placed at risk of harm or abuse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/7">In addition, there are other general training requirements in regulation 18 to ensure staff receive training appropriate to the work they perform, including, where relevant, the prevention and treatment of pressure sores.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/8">Under regulation 17 of the Care Homes Regulations 2001, care homes for adults are required to keep a record for each service user, which includes the incidence of pressure sores and of treatment provided to the service user.</p>
	<p pid="c.2211W.2/9">The requirements in the regulations are further clarified in the National Minimum Standards. The relevant standards are standard 30 in the Care Homes for Older People standards and standard 35 in the Care Homes for Adults standards. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> over 71 per cent. of older people's care homes and care homes for adults met the relevant standards.</p>

The Government support the approach taken by responsible dog owners who voluntarily have their pets permanently identified and registered on nationwide databases. The effectiveness of a dog licensing system is questionable; in the last year licences were administered (1988) only 44 per cent. of dog owners applied for a licence. There is no evidence to suggest that the opinion of dog owners has changed and that any new scheme introduced would be adopted by the majority of dog owners.</p>

	<p pid="c.2216W.8/4">Our application for the European Union Solidarity Fund European was submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-20">20 August</phrase>. A provisional assessment of damage caused by the June and July floods lies at above &euro;4 billion. While this is currently the best working estimate based on work with local authorities and other agencies, the final and confirmed costs will not be known for some time.</p>
	<p pid="c.2216W.8/5">Data on the economic impact on the agriculture and horticulture industries of the summer 2007 floods are not yet available. I understand that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) have commissioned work to estimate the value of immediate crop and livestock losses from flooding, and will publish this when it is complete later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2216W.8/6">Following the floods 50 local authorities have registered for assistance from the Bellwin Scheme for June and 52 have registered for July. 20 local authorities have registered for both schemes. Once we have assessed the claims from these local authorities we will have information on the uninsurable costs they have incurred as a result of the floods. For the last nationwide flooding scheme in 2000, we paid out &pound;21 million to 76 local authorities. We do not know yet what the level of costs will be this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.2216W.8/7">A full estimate of the costs to the tourism industry of the floods has not been completed. It is of the nature of tourism that the impact on future holiday bookings will take time to emerge. However, the British Holiday and Home Parks Association estimates losses of around &pound;25 million. Worcestershire estimates losses of between &pound;100 to &pound;150 million and Advantage West Midlands have reported losses of &pound;20 million. Data on Hull and East Yorkshire suggest tourism costs of &pound;4.75 million. A full assessment of the total impact on the tourism industry will not be available for some time.</p>

	<p pid="c.2219W.3/2">Licences issued by DEFRA to laboratories which handle specified animal<i> </i>pathogens under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) 1998 impose strict requirements in relation to biosecurity. Under the Animal Health Act 1981, it is an offence to breach a term of a licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2219W.3/3">No such offences have been confirmed, and so no penalties have been imposed, at a Government-funded laboratory conducting research into infectious animal diseases, whether funded by DEFRA or another Department, in the last five years. Regular inspection and ongoing liaison with SAPO-licensed laboratories seeks to ensure that potential deficiencies in biosecurity are identified quickly and remedial action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.2219W.3/4">The Health and Safety Executive has published a report on potential breaches of biosecurity at Pirbright following the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Surrey. This report is available from the DEFRA website and the Libraries of the House. SAPO legislation is enforced by local authorities. Surrey county council are now urgently considering the contents of the reports and will determine what action, if any, is necessary.</p>

In 2006, 5092 apiary visits were carried out. Many inspectors conducted around 100 to 150 visits, and some 200 to 250 visits, per season. In addition, regional bee inspectors are available all year and can carry out inspections outside the traditional season. Inspections are targeted in areas where disease risk and colony density are highest and about 10 per cent. of the total number of apiaries is inspected each year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2222W.3/11">A progress report, published in June 2007, showed no statistically significant change to these figures. However, this is only the first progress report on the target and this Department is intensifying its work with Arts Council England to broaden access and increase engagement with the arts among under-represented groups. Progress on the target will be monitored on a regular basis until the final assessment is available in late 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.2225W.8/2"><i> </i>Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) will buy and manage up to 2,000 direct contracts with businesses who will in turn manage up to 50,000 agreements across their own supply chains. The ODA estimates that approximately half of the contracts that have been awarded to date have gone to SME's and intends to issue details of the exact number and an analysis of contracts issued in the near future. Contracts will be awarded to those judged to be the best suppliers and service providers. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is mobilising its full range of business support tools, such as its Business Link services, available in all English regions. Similar support services are available in the devolved Administrations. This helps those companies who wish to get fit to supply, not just games-related contracts but also the &pound;125 billion per annum public procurement opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2225W.8/3">All businesses can register their interest in these contracts on the business section of the ODA's website <a href="http://www.london2012.com/business">www.london2012.com/business</a> which details all contract opportunities and includes advance notice of future opportunities. The ODA published in June 2007 its Supplier Guide for businesses interested in pursuing Olympic-related contracts, also available online.</p>

	<p pid="c.2229W.6/1">Between 2002 and 2007 the Treasury has received a total of 63 complaints regarding the non-acceptance of Scottish bank notes in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.2229W.6/6">The four banknote denominations issued by the Bank of England account for around 90 per cent. of banknotes issued in the United Kingdom. In contrast, the three commercial note issuing banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland collectively issue 39 banknotes designs. Consequently, some Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes may not be as readily recognised and accepted in England and Wales as Bank of England banknotes.</p>

This analysis is based on the Mandate survey which currently provides approximately 90 per cent coverage of Civil Service departments and agencies. For years prior to 2003 the coverage is lower. For comparison purposes, employment numbers for the Yorkshire and Humber region are therefore presented alongside the statistics for York i) as published for the total Civil Service and ii) as available from the Mandate survey.

(155571)</p>
	<p pid="c.2238W.2/4" class="indent">Visits to the UK by overseas residents are estimated from data collected on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). A visit is defined as being a stay of less than 12 months. The survey is conducted at major airports, and on major sea and tunnel routes, and the data collected are weighted up to national passenger figures provided by CAA and BAA, Department for Transport, Eurotunnel and Eurostar.</p>
	<p pid="c.2238W.2/5" class="indent">The IPS is a continuous survey carried out throughout the year. Approximately 1 in 500 passengers passing through airports, seaports and die tunnel are sampled and both overseas residents and UK residents are interviewed. The survey measures the numbers of visits to the UK by overseas residents and overseas by UK residents and how much is spent on each of these visits. As it measures visits, any one person travelling a number of times will be counted each time they travel.</p>

	<p pid="c.2240W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what estimate <i> (a)</i> direct and <i> (b)</i> indirect taxes as a percentage of gross income for households with an income (i) lower and (ii) higher than (A) 95 per cent of all households, (B) 99 per cent of all households, (C) 75 per cent of all households and (D) 25 per cent of all households for each year since 1997. (155376)</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of household income and payments of direct and indirect taxes appear in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2005/06 was published, on the National Statistics website on 17th May 2007 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a> The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a survey of approximately 7,000 households in the UK. The estimates of direct and indirect tax payments for the groups of households requested, have been calculated from the data underlying the annual taxes and benefits analyses., and these estimates appear in the table below.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/5" class="indent">Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes&mdash;these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/6" class="indent">Indirect taxes, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for those on lower income, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. Estimates of indirect taxes are estimated based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for low income households where average measured income is significantly lower than average measured expenditure. For these households, indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are not being met solely from current income, and so indirect taxes are very high when expressed as a proportion of gross income.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/7" class="indent">There are a number of possible reasons why for some households expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower income households in particular include some groups who have, or report, very little income, for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e,g. inheritance and severance payments are regarded as lump sums and therefore are not considered to be current income. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income because of timing differences.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/8" class="indent">The annual effects of taxes and benefits article is focused primarily on the differential effect of taxes and benefits on different parts of the income distribution, rather than on changes over time. There have been some changes to the way in which the figures are compiled. Up until 2001/02, charges for water, environmental and sewage services were treated as local taxes, whereas from 2002/03 onwards they were excluded. The local tax category now just includes council tax and Northern Ireland rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/9" class="indent">There was also a change to the way that tax credits were treated. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits. From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits remains greater than or equal to zero for each family. So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments are still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. The effect of these changes would be a small reduction in the calculated tax burden in the years following these changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2240W.2/10" class="indent">Figures for the top 1% of households in particular should be treated with some caution, as they are based on a small sub-sample of the survey. These estimates will be more affected by sampling variability.</p>

	<p pid="c.2244W.8/1">Probation service national standards require that the first work session is undertaken within 10 days of sentence. Data are collected nationally about the first appointment only where it is designated as a pre-placement work session, that is, an induction and briefing session. For those probation areas where it is available, the average number of days in the period January to June, between this session and joining the unpaid work groups is set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.2257W.2/1">Mediation is a widely used term which covers a number of activities related to the resolution of disputes or the management of conflict. ACAS staff are involved in working in a number of areas which sit under this umbrella term. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/2" class="indent">Conciliation in employment tribunal cases</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/3" class="indent">Conciliation in collective disputes</p>

	<p pid="c.2257W.2/5" class="indent">Mediation in collective disputes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/6" class="italic"> Conciliation in employment tribunal cases</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/7">In almost all cases where a claim is submitted to an employment tribunal, ACAS has a statutory duty to promote a resolution that both sides find acceptable instead of going to a tribunal hearing.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/8">In 2006-7 ACAS received a total of 105,177 employment tribunal claims for conciliation. During the same period 38 per cent. of claims were subject to a legally binding settlement brokered by ACAS, 31 per cent. of claims were withdrawn following discussion of the case with the ACAS conciliator, and 27 per cent. of claims proceeded to an employment tribunal for hearing. 4 per cent. of claims were disposed of in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/9">During the period, and in addition, ACAS brokered a resolution to 57,476 potential claims, of which 56,159 were potential local authority equal pay claims.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/10" class="italic"> Conciliation in collective disputes</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/11">ACAS also assists parties to resolve their differences where a dispute arises between an employer and trades union or other work force representation group, or between groups of workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/12">In 2006-07 ACAS was involved in 912 collective disputes. During the same period, 835 were completed, 91 per cent. successfully.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/13" class="italic"> Mediation in work  place disputes</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/14">In 2006-07 ACAS accepted 134 individual work place disputes for mediation. 99 of these were resolved through mediation, and in a further eight cases progress was made, giving a total success rate of 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/15" class="italic"> Mediation in collective disputes</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/16">Where a collective dispute is resolved by means of a reference to an independent mediator who is empowered to write a formal report making recommendations, ACAS will appoint a mediator from its list of independent arbitrator/mediators.</p>

	<p pid="c.2260W.2/1">The Renewables Obligation does not pay a direct subsidy to generators but instead places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specific and annually increasing proportion of their sales from renewable sources. Suppliers meet their obligation by presenting Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) which are issued to generators for eligible renewable generation; paying a buy-out price; or a combination of both. Money from the buy-out fund is recycled pro-rata to suppliers presenting ROCs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2260W.2/2">The ROC price is therefore set by the market but a nominal value of the ROC to the supplier can be calculated by adding the buyout price to the recycled buyout fund attributable to each ROC. Multiplying this by the number of ROCs issued for wind generated renewable electricity gives an indication of the support provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.2260W.2/3">The Renewables Obligation came into force for 2002-03 so figures are not available before that date. For 2002-03 to 2004-05 the figures are finalised and for 2005-06 the figures are estimated. The figures going forward are based on estimated wind generation and ROC price as part of a modelling framework developed for us by Oxera Consulting Ltd and published alongside our recent consultation on reform of the Renewables Obligation.</p>

	<p pid="c.2261W.6/3" class="italic"> Letter from Duncan Gilchrist, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-13">13 September 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As the Chief Executive is currently on annual leave I am responding, with his authority, on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps are in place to enable hon. Members to raise their dissatisfaction with the work of the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/6" class="indent">There is not one specific route for a Member of Parliament (MP) to take should they want to raise their dissatisfaction with the work of the Child Support Agency (CSA). The route taken would depend on the circumstances or reasons for the dissatisfaction, and the avenues that had previously been used.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/7" class="indent">MPs can write to the CSA Chief Executive or contact the CSA MP Hotline. If these options have been explored, the following options are available:</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/8" class="indent">Write to the Minister with responsibility for Child Support. The MP can decide to write to the Minister at any time, by-passing the Agency's complaints process entirely. The Minister will reply for policy issues. Any operational or case specific enquiries are referred to the Chief Executive to reply as he is in the best position to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/9" class="indent">The case can be raised with the Independent Case Examiner (ICE). In order to raise a case with the ICE, the Agency has to have had the opportunity to answer the complaint, usually through a response from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/10" class="indent">Raise the case with the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.6/11" class="indent">Raise a Parliamentary Question.</p>

	<p pid="c.2265W.3/1">The estimate of the cash requirements for the agency both historically and in the future is determined as part of the overall cash requirement for the Department. The overall estimate is not broken down on an agency basis, but is instead derived from overall departmental spend against its bank account, on a historic basis. We are therefore unable to provide the separate cash costs of running the agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2265W.3/2">The following table provides details of Child Support Agency actual and forecast net administration costs from 1996-97 to 2007-08 including, from 1999-2000, the costs of child support reform and the operational improvement plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.2265W.3/3">From 2008-09 the Government intend that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will undertake the agency's activity. The exact future steady state costs of that organisation will depend on what choices parents make; how the Commission will finally configure its services; and the details of the transitional arrangements to the new scheme. All of these factors are subject to significant uncertainties. Consequently, precise year-by-year estimates are not currently available. It is estimated that, in steady state, the statutory maintenance service is expected to lead to a reduction in administrative costs of around &pound;200 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="c.2266W.5/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Duncan Gilchrist, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As the Chief Executive is currently on annual leave I am responding, with his authority, on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many staff were allocated a Child Support Agency enforcement worker in each quarter from 1997 to June 2007; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/5" class="indent">We contacted your office to clarify your question and were advised that you wanted to know the numbers of people working in enforcement activities in each quarter from 1997 to June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/6" class="indent">The information available is set out in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/7" class="indent">Prior to the Operational Improvement Plan (OIP), the Agency had a small centrally managed team engaged in legal enforcement work which involved the Civil Enforcement of debt following the failure of Bailiff action, 3<sup>(rd)</sup> Party Debt Orders, Charging Orders and Orders for Sale and their Scottish equivalents. This also involved committal to prison or driving license removal.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/8" class="indent">Debt Enforcement is responsible for the initial handling of cases when payment breaks down or is not achieved. This involves Deduction from Earnings Orders when appropriate and secures legal recognition of debt through obtaining Liability Orders as well as initiating bailiff action in respect of those debts. Historically, this was carried out by a variety of different teams throughout the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/9" class="indent">The first year of the OIP focused on organisational and operational restructuring, and the training of our people to increase capacity and capability.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/10" class="indent">In the OIP we committed to increasing the resource on both types of enforcement work by 600 people. This was achieved by July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/11" class="indent">This is the first step to meet the OIP commitment to quadruple the number of people deployed on enforcement work by March 2009. The Agency has contracted out the recovery of debt on 50,000 cases, effectively increasing the total resource devoted to enforcing Child Support maintenance and getting more money to more children. The largest proportionate increase has been in the Agency Legal Enforcement Teams, which have also taken on a greater workload; there has been a substantial increase in the amount of court based enforcement activity in the first year of the OIP. The Agency now has 2861 people (Full Time Equivalent) working in our new Enforcement lines of business; Debt and Legal.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/12" class="indent">More investment in enforcement activity will continue as we make progress in clearing uncleared applications and are able to re-deploy more people on to this work.</p>
	<p pid="c.2266W.5/13" class="indent">I hope you find this response helpful.</p>

At June 2007 there were 22,600 uncleared applications with an 'unknown' Local Authority. This equates to 13% of all uncleared cases in June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2269W.2/8" class="indent">Figures are rounded to the nearest 10. As the quality of the management information within the Agency improves, the figures are subject to revision and information in the table, therefore, may differ slightly from previously released figures.</p>

	<p pid="c.2272W.8/1">With the increased focus on voluntary arrangements and the ending of the requirement that parents with care on benefit be treated as applying for child maintenance, not all of the current Child Support Agency caseload will choose to use the statutory maintenance service. In many cases parents will choose to make voluntary arrangements supported by an information and support service. Since these arrangements are a matter for parents to agree upon it is not possible to estimate the proportion of non-resident parents whose child maintenance payments will rise by more than certain percentages.</p>
	<p pid="c.2272W.8/2">Where parents do choose to use the statutory maintenance arrangements the proposed statutory maintenance formula has been chosen to broadly replicate the current system. Figures on the amount paid under the second child support scheme and statutory maintenance arrangements under different income levels and for different family sizes can be found in table 2, page 19 of the regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the Child Maintenance and Other Payment Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.2276W.0/12">The Department entered into a 20 year PFI Contract with Land Securities Trillium (LST) in 1998 known as the PRIME Contract, which was expanded in 2003 following the merger of Department of Social Security and the Employment Service. The contract is for the provision of fully serviced accommodation and the Department pays an all-inclusive unitary charge to LST for this provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.2276W.0/13">This unitary charge includes the provision, if required, for mobile air conditioning units. Therefore, the costs identified are for the provision of a unit that falls outside of the scope of the PRIME Contract, and is therefore relatively small. An example of a requirement outside the scope would be a site not included within the PRIME portfolio, where facility management responsibility is retained by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.2286W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking whether there are plans to close Jobcentre Plus offices in Scotland. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.8/4" class="indent">Over the last five years Jobcentre Plus has undertaken a programme of major refurbishment to modernise its office network and introduce improved business processes to support customers. This programme commenced in 2002 when Jobcentre Plus integrated the services formerly provided by the Employment Service and parts of the Benefit Agency. We inherited around 1,500 offices from these two organisations, many of which were unsuitable for Jobcentre Plus either in terms of their location or their physical structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.8/5" class="indent">I can confirm there are definite plans to close three Jobcentre Plus offices in Scotland; Portobello; Dundee (Seagate); and Perth. These offices currently deal with benefit processing only and therefore are not open to the public. The work is being migrated to our Benefit Delivery Centre network.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.8/6" class="indent">Since its inception Jobcentre Plus has continuously improved its services to customers through modern telephony and e-services. This allows us to review our network of offices to focus our resources where they are most needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.2288W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus offices provide comprehensive advice on all benefits. General advice can be obtained through a range of leaflets available online, in our offices and by post. Benefit information is also available face to face and by telephone. For customers who are hard of hearing or have speech difficulties, a textphone is available. Interpreting services are also available when required.</p>
	<p pid="c.2288W.8/5" class="indent">When a customer telephones Jobcentre Plus to make a claim to benefit, or has a meeting with a Personal Adviser, we are able to provide more personalised advice on jobs and benefits. Of course, a customer's entitlement can only be determined when a claim to a benefit has been properly made.</p>

	<p pid="c.2289W.2/4" class="indent">Over the last five years Jobcentre Plus has undertaken a programme of major refurbishment to modernise its office and introduce improved business processes to support customers. This programme commenced in 2002 when Jobcentre Plus integrated the services formerly provided by the Employment Service and parts of the Benefit Agency. We inherited around 1,500 offices from these two organisations, many of which were unsuitable for Jobcentre Plus either in terms of their location or their physical structure. In drawing up local Service Delivery Plans for our modernisation programme the offices considered &quot;unsuitable&quot; were earmarked for closure. I attach a list of offices closed in Scotland in the last five years, stating whether they were full or part time.</p>
	<p pid="c.2289W.2/5" class="indent">Since its inception Jobcentre Plus has continuously improved its services to customers through modern telephony and e-services. This allows us to review our network of offices to focus our resources where they are most needed. I am committed to consulting local people and other stakeholders if this means we have to revise our original Service Delivery Plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.2291W.8/1">The Green Paper &quot;In Work, better off&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July 2007</phrase>, sets out Government proposals on the next steps towards achieving full employment. A key element of this is a new partnership with employers, through Local Employment Partnerships (LEPs). These do not aim to create new jobs but to open up more of the many job opportunities already coming up in the economy to long-term unemployed people and other priority jobless groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.2291W.8/2">LEPs will prepare individuals for the world of work, provide the chance to apply for a wider range of jobs and help with the skills and motivation needed to be successful. The detailed design of the programme is currently being developed. However, in conjunction with other initiatives such as DWP's 'city strategy', an important element of Government policy is to promote sustainable and cohesive communities. This means tackling the concentrations of worklessness in certain areas and raising employment rates by enabling more local people to take up the jobs coming up in a local area. This will allow individuals to better support themselves and their families and play a full role in society, as well as supporting wider goals around eliminating child poverty and improving health and well being.</p>

	<p pid="c.2300W.8/1">No specific assessment has been made. The number of cognitive behavioural therapy-trained staff in each area varies according to local needs and how the condition management programme (CMPs) are delivered. Referral to the CMP will not be necessary for all incapacity benefit customers, nor will it be the first option to consider. Referral will only be appropriate if the customer feels that they cannot return to work yet because of their condition. The incapacity benefit personal adviser will discuss the range of other appropriate therapies and support available to the customer at work focused interviews. Regular contact between the CMP Manager and the Pathways to Work manager is designed to improve the delivery of the programme and enhance the customer experience.</p>

	<p pid="c.2301W.8/1">The Pension Service is undertaking a wide range of steps to encourage eligible pensioners to claim pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/2">In our 2007-08 direct mailing programme, we plan to issue over 1 million letters to encourage and remind potential eligible pensioners to apply for pension credit. This will coincide with press advertising and leaflet inserts in newspapers and magazines, which will be aimed at securing the support of friends and family to encourage take-up of pension credit in areas with relatively high numbers of potentially eligible non-recipients.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/3">To provide a better insight into our customer base, the Pension Service is making use of advanced data analysis techniques to target eligible pensioners to pension credit. The Department sourced data from Experian, a private company who are the UK's largest originators and owners of geo-demographic consumer data, and linked 15 million older peoples' accounts to provide better insight into our customer base. This tool will help us reach customer groups with low pension credit take up.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/4">We are continuing to expand our partnership working through Joint Working Partnerships between the Pension Service local service, local authorities and the voluntary sector. The Pension Service currently has 180 operational Joint Working Partnerships with primary tier local authorities with a further 22 agreed or in the implementation stages. These partnerships help us to identify harder to reach customers and deliver a full and joined up services to older people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/5">We are also working in partnership with local authorities and the voluntary sector on our alternative office network. Alternative offices operate through partnership agreements between the Pension Service, local authorities and the voluntary sector. These offices accept applications from people aged 60 or over for social security benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/6">In addition, our local service plan to carry out around 680,000 face to face visits during 2007-08, offering a full entitlement check to the poorest and most needy older people. We will also carry out an extensive outbound telephone campaign to those who fail to respond to written invitations to apply, or who drop-out part way through the pension credit application process.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/7">All of this activity will be supported by information on the Pension Service, DWP and DirectGov (the UK Government's digital service for all public service information and services) websites about our products and services, and continued close working with national and regional press officers to make the most of publicity and media opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.8/8">Finally, as part of the transformation of the Pension Service, people can now claim state pension and pension credit over the phone. If a customer is eligible for pension credit we can also take an application for housing benefit, council tax benefit and carer's allowance during the same phone call. As part of the future programme of transformation, state pension customers will be encouraged to claim pension credit, if appropriate, when they call to notify key changes of circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.2304W.8/1">The Secretary of State is required by law to review the levels of state pension and to increase those levels at least in line with prices. It has been the practice for many years to increase state pension in line with the September Retail Prices Index although for some years in the recent past it has increased by more.</p>
	<p pid="c.2304W.8/2">In calculating the Retail Prices Index, account is taken of variations in a wide range of goods and services to reflect the typical change in costs, both increases and decreases, that people face from year to year. This includes average council tax bills for households in Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.2309W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what progress has been made on the provision of employment advisers in GP surgeries to advise on sick notes for statutory sick pay and what evaluation has been made of the pilot. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2309W.2/4" class="indent">We are currently piloting a Pathways Advisory Service (PAS) in GP surgeries within some Pathways to Work districts. The intention of this pilot is to test a gateway service where the personal adviser based within the surgery will provide advice on a range of work-related issues which patients may raise, and signpost them to appropriate Jobcentre Plus or external provision. Access to the PAS is voluntary, by self-referral or recommendation from a health professional and is open to any patient, although it is focused primarily on those claiming incapacity benefit or statutory sick pay. The PAS is being piloted in eight locations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2309W.2/5" class="indent">While Jobcentre Plus advisers will support customers on statutory sick pay, they do not give advice on sick notes. They do not become involved with the individual's health situation or discussions around sickness certification, other than that which the individual is happy to divulge.</p>
	<p pid="c.2309W.2/6" class="indent">The PAS is being evaluated by an independent research partnership, the University of York's Social Policy Research Unit and the National Centre for Social Research. The evaluation is due to report early in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.2329W.3/2">Since the original proposal for the establishment of a working group, we have concluded that this would not be the best way to move forward the specific concerns raised by local authorities and other steps have therefore been taken. The Border and Immigration Agency has carried out a formal public consultation on the arrangements for unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC) which includes specific proposals addressing local authority concerns about arrangements for leaving care support for former UASC. On concerns relating to local authority support for people with no recourse to public funds, the Agency has been working closely with the No Recourse to Public Funds National Network (NN NRPF) which was established to address the challenges faced by local authorities in dealing with the NRPF issue. In 2006-07 the Border and Immigration Agency provided the network with a funding grant towards the cost of setting up and co-ordinating network activities and work is in progress to further enhance our relationship and partnership working with the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.2329W.3/3">The Border and Immigration Agency liaises with authorities locally through the offices of its new Regional Directors. At the national level, the Border and Immigration Agency has established a Local Authority Taskforce, working in partnership with a number of individual local authorities focussing on issues related to people subject to immigration control, and also engages with local authorities through the National Asylum Support Forum and the LGA (Local Government Association) Asylum and Refugee Task Group.</p>

The UK is already largely compliant with the provisions of the convention but part of the ongoing work is to establish exactly what legislation, guidance and training is required to make us fully compliant. As we develop implementation options we will consult with stakeholders within and outside Government, including via our established non-governmental organisation (NGO) stakeholder group, chaired by myself and the Solicitor-General. It is recognised that it will take some time to move from signature to ratification of the convention as the Government are committed to implementing the convention fully and in accordance with our ongoing strategy on trafficking outlined in the UK's Action Plan on Tackling Human Trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="c.2337W.3/1">The process for matching DNA from individuals with that from crime scenes is as follows. When someone is arrested for a recordable offence a sample is taken, usually by means of a cheek swab, which is sent to a laboratory. The sample is analysed to produce a numerical code which represents a number of areas of the individual's DNA. This code is sent to the National DNA Database. If it passes quality assurance checks it is loaded onto the database, together with demographic information such as the person's name and date of birth. Crime scene investigation leads to discovery of traces of biological material such as semen, blood or saliva, which will in some cases allow a numerical code representing DNA from an individual who has left that trace at the crime scene to be produced. A match may occur either when a profile from a crime scene is loaded onto the database and is found to match a profile from an individual, or vice versa. Matching may also occur between profiles from different crime scenes, indicating that the same person was present at more than one crime scene, even if that person cannot yet be identified. The database operates continuously and matches are automatically notified to police forces electronically or by fax as soon as they are made. The question is understood to refer to the length of time a crime scene profile or a profile from an individual remains on the database before a match occurs. Data on this is not recorded.</p>
