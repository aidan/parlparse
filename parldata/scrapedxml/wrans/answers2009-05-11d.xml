	<p pid="d.497W.0/1">The Northern Ireland Office budget is split into two cost areas&mdash;programme and administration. In relation to the Bloody Sunday inquiry, administration costs are the costs relating to the salaries and other associated costs of the civil servants staffing the inquiry, and various costs associated with the running of the inquiry's offices. I am advised that the Bloody Sunday inquiry has spent &pound;11.5 million on such administration costs since its establishment to the end of March 2009. Programme costs, which relate more directly to the costs of the inquiry itself (e.g. IT infrastructure costs, legal fees, tribunal costs etc.) are not included in this figure.</p>

	<p pid="d.497W.7/1">A new area of the Parliament website is due to be launched this summer which will focus on Parliament's heritage. This will replace and expand on the historical information that is currently available on the site and cover the building and its collections, the evolution of Parliament and key pieces of legislation that have transformed society. This area will also provide the opportunity to embed or link to a variety of different content including relevant audio files. Having run a successful pilot the web centre is planning to release a number of podcasts over the coming financial year. These recordings will cover, among other topics, the history, art and architecture of the Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="d.498W.13/1">The Department for Transport's latest forecasts of unconstrained demand in the UK in 2030 are given in table 2.10, page 44 of &quot;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 Forecasts&quot; published in January 2009. The central estimate is 465 million passengers per annum (mppa). Table 2.10 of the report also reports the Department's forecasts of unconstrained demand under a range of sensitivity tests, including one which reflects the GDP forecasts announced at the time of the 2008 pre-Budget report (referred to as 'PBR Nov 2008 GDP forecast').</p>
	<p pid="d.498W.13/2">The Department published the errata on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-17">17 March 2009</phrase> following the discovery of an input error to the 'PBR Nov 2008 GDP forecast' sensitivity test. The corrected forecast of UK unconstrained demand in 2030 for this sensitivity test given in the errata is 435 mppa (revised down from 445 mppa, given in the published report). The central case forecast and other sensitivity tests were not affected by the errata.</p>
	<p pid="d.498W.13/3">The Department has not yet updated its forecasts to reflect the 2009 Budget report. It aims to publish updated forecasts when there is a policy need, as it did recently alongside the announcement of policy decisions on the future development of Heathrow airport.</p>

	<p pid="d.503W.6/1">No such estimates have been made yet. However, recent evidence considering the decline in species richness of both bumblebees and solitary bees suggests a significant decrease in the number of bee species for which data was available in England. In recognition of this, the Secretary of State recently announced additional funding of &pound;4.3 million for bee health which includes supporting the implementation of the initial phase of a 10 year plan to improve and protect the health of honey bees in England and Wales. This additional funding will allow DEFRA to contribute &pound;0.5 million per annum over five years to a wider research programme on pollinator decline which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April</phrase>.</p>

On top of its current &pound;1.3 million per annum, an additional &pound;2.3 million will be provided to the National Bee Unit (NBU) (part of the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA)) over the next two years to implement the first stage of the plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.2/2">This involves producing a more accurate national picture of the numbers and distribution of beekeepers, and the health status of their colonies. Our improved understanding of the national position will allow the development of a new robust disease control and surveillance programme for implementation from 2011 onwards. In addition, FERA is bidding for funding under the EU Framework Programme 7, to establish a consortium of researchers who will investigate the main factors leading to colony losses.</p>

	<p pid="d.504W.5/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-03">3 November 2008</phrase>, all of Great Britain became a single confluent protection zone for Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8). Animals can be moved freely within this protection zone, and to and from other BTV-8 protection zones in Europe provided that they meet the generic import/export requirements and are accompanied by an Export Health Certificate which has been signed by an official veterinarian.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/3">Movements of susceptible animals from Protection Zones for different serotypes are subject to the restrictions set out in Annex III of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 (as amended).</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/4"><i> (b)</i> DEFRA has a number of scanning and targeted surveillance measures in place to monitor Bluetongue in the UK as detailed in the UK-wide Bluetongue Control Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/5">With specific regard to imports, DEFRA conducts post-import tests on all susceptible animals imported from continental Europe for all Bluetongue serotypes. From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, this was increased to double testing to ensure that disease is picked up in both its early and late stages. DEFRA also urges industry to consider the risks and check the health and vaccination status of animals when sourcing any animals, from within the UK or abroad.</p>
	<p pid="d.504W.5/6">Spread of BTV-8 is additionally controlled through the use of vaccine. DEFRA underwrote 28 million doses of BTV-8 vaccine in 2008, enough for all susceptible animals in England. 12 million of these doses formed the supply at the start of 2009. This along with free market vaccine supplies from the three manufacturers authorised to market vaccine in the UK, Intervet, Merial and Fort Dodge should meet the demand for BTV-8 vaccine in 2009.</p>

The current English LFA scheme&mdash;the hill farm allowance (HFA)&mdash;is being replaced with an agri-environment scheme, uplands entry level stewardship (Uplands ELS). Eligibility for Uplands ELS, as well as the make-up of the single payment scheme regions, is determined by domestic classifications, principally severely disadvantaged areas (SDA), rather than the LFA classification, so would not be directly affected by the Commission's proposals, which are unlikely to be implemented in the current rural development programming period.</p>

Activities will also aim to increase public awareness of the various faith communities of the UK, focusing on the contribution which their members make to their neighbourhoods and wider society. Local, regional and national inter faith initiatives will be able to raise their profile. We hope the week will also increase understanding between people of religious and non-religious beliefs.</p>

	<p pid="d.514W.11/1">The English House Condition Survey (EHCS) was run every five years from 1971 until 2001 but moved to a continuous survey from 2002. From 2008 the survey merged with the Survey of English Housing to form the English Housing Survey (EHS) which is also run on a continuous basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.514W.11/2">The basic EHCS survey methodology remained unchanged from 1997. A smaller 8,000 annual clustered sample was introduced in 2002 (compared to a 17,000 un-clustered sample used for the five yearly survey) to reduce fieldwork costs. Minor changes have been made each year to the survey content and reporting to reflect the changing information needs of government. From 2006 assessments were collected under the Housing Health and Safety Rating system (which replaced the Fitness Standard as the statutory tool for enforcing minimum standards).</p>
	<p pid="d.514W.11/3">Under the EHS interviews are now conducted with 17,000 households a year. A surveyor subsequently conducts an inspection of 8,000 of these homes using a new automated method of data collection to further reduce costs and improve data quality.</p>
	<p pid="d.514W.11/4">The EHCS/EHS continue to provide Government with an essential source of information on the changing condition and energy performance of the housing stock. Further information about the EHCS, including annual methodological reports, can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.521W.3/1">Following publication of the long-term National CCTV Strategy in October 2007, good progress has been made in moving towards implementing the 44 recommendations. The recommendations targeted action from the police and local authorities to work together to improve public safety. The National Policing Improvement Agency took over responsibility for the Strategy in spring 2008. A National CCTV Strategy Programme Board has been established and has delivered five of these recommendations. The recommendations that have been implemented as at April 2009 are:</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/2" class="indent">Recommendation 3:The Home Office Scientific Development Branch and the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) now have a seat on National and International standards bodies.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/3" class="indent">Recommendation 4: Publication of a revised Operational Requirements Manual on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, along with a new CCTV image quality test target, will help educate and inform purchasers and end users regarding critical issues such as image quality.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/4" class="indent">Recommendation 16: The BSIA's new &quot;Get Licensed&quot; Booklet (published October 2008) means that all BSIA licensed operators should know how to use CCTV correctly and are vetted to the appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/5" class="indent">Recommendation 24: New protocols mean that all police forces now have the capability of sharing Airwave telecommunications with local CCTV Managers and a significant number of police forces share intelligence with CCTV Control Centres. Such partnership working leads to the operation of public space CCTV providing best value to communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/6" class="indent">Recommendation 29: An evaluation of camera to archive network access and data archiving has led to a recommendation for the police and the wider Criminal Justice System to move towards the use of managed secure servers for the long-term storage and archiving of CCTV and other forms of digital evidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/7">Since January 2009 the board has been reviewing the recommendations made in the Strategy. It is clear that, since the Strategy was written and published, some recommendations are either no longer appropriate or need reviewing. Therefore, in addition to the five already implemented, a further 12 will be implemented by the end of 2009 and an additional six by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.521W.3/8">The remaining 21 recommendations are currently being reviewed to take account of comments and changes in technology since publication. Once that review is completed, I shall write to the hon. Member and let him know the outcome.</p>

	<p pid="d.522W.2/1">The Independent Forensic Science Regulator was appointed in February 2008 to regulate forensic science quality standards. He has published his &quot;Review of the Options for the Accreditation of Forensic Practitioners&quot; and &quot;Quality Standards for the Providers of Forensic Science Services to the Criminal Justice System&quot; and proposes to move to a more robust model of standards regulation that moves the focus from just forensic practitioners to include standards for organisations, practitioners and the science methods used. The forensic science laboratories are already accredited to testing international standards; accreditation that includes assessment of practitioner competence by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). The accreditation option is available to all practitioners. Registration with the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners was a voluntary process that left the majority of practitioners either choosing not to register or not able to register (front-line scientists in the laboratories who are covered by the UKAS accreditation could not register with the Council).</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.2/2">The Regulator was consulted prior to the decision not to provide transition funding. The Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners received in total some &pound;2.9 million grant in aid with a clear requirement to be self-financing by March 2010. Police withdrawal of support removed up to 70 per cent. of the Council's income.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.2/3">The chief executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency wrote to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February 2009</phrase> notifying his intention to cease any further funding.

	<p pid="d.527W.2/1">The Government welcome the work done by industry to block images of child sexual abuse, resulting in 95 per cent. of consumer broadband lines being covered by blocking. The UK now hosts less than 1 per cent. of the total number of child abuse image sites on the internet, and when one is identified they are quickly closed down. We are currently looking at options to progress the final 5 per cent. and the Government will be setting out actions and time scales in due course.</p>

The study will cost up to &pound;100,000. This work is being carried out in parallel with the public consultation on the proposition launched in April. If the study shows that there is a supportive business case, a prospectus will be developed for publication later in the summer through which formal expressions of interest will be invited.

	<p pid="d.537W.0/1">Vehicle excise duty (VED) for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) has been frozen since 2001, to provide support to the road haulage industry. HGVs with a Reduced Pollution Certificate qualify for a reduced rate of VED, for achieving early compliance with mandatory European Union air quality standards. VED rates for each category of HGV are set out in DVLA form V149.</p>

	<p pid="d.537W.0/21">VED for HGVs is set according to the weight, chassis type and number of axles on a vehicle. Minimum levels of tax for HGVs as set out in directive 1999/62/EC are set according to similar variables. However, the weight limits in VED do not correspond to the weight limits as set by the directive. Furthermore, the directive sets different rates for vehicles depending on their suspension type, whereas rates of VED are not dependant on suspension type. In order to set all HGV VED rates at the minimum level permitted by the directive, it would be necessary to reform the entire structure of HGV VED. The Government have therefore not calculated the potential revenue effect of reducing VED rates for HGVs.</p>

Information prior to that date is held locally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.544W.12/12">The Ministry's policy is that air travel should only be used where there is a cost advantage from savings of subsistence and official time or if urgency justifies the additional cost. Staff are expected to travel economy class on flights up to 2.5 hours. On flights in excess of 2.5 hours staff at senior civil level (directors) and above may travel business class and other staff economy class. Where it is necessary to fly both outward and inward flights in one day or the flight lasts longer than four hours, budget holders have discretion to authorise a higher class of travel.</p>
	<p pid="d.544W.12/13">The Ministry does not have a specific policy on the use of British Airways. The travel management company engaged by the Ministry is required to identify the most cost effective means of supplying the requested journey, taking account of the timing of flights and the cost of official time. The cost-effectiveness of flights supplied is actively monitored to ensure that value for money is obtained.</p>

	<p pid="d.552W.2/1">Insecurity in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), including Swat district, has a major effect on both the provincial government's capacity to deliver services and the international community's ability to provide development assistance. We are monitoring the situation closely and are in discussion with the provincial government and other development partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.2/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) do not currently have projects that are specifically focused on Swat or neighbouring districts that are most affected by conflict. We are providing support across the province for the delivery of services, including education, health, water, sanitation and micro-finance. In some places these services have been significantly disrupted, although in most of NWFP services are still being provided as normal. As we design new programmes, we undertake detailed assessments of conflict, security and risk in order to develop effective approaches to the delivery of basic services in conflict affected areas. In direct response to the consequences of conflict in NWFP and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas we have so far provided &pound;12 million of humanitarian assistance to help those who have been displaced from their homes.</p>

	<p pid="d.553W.3/1">There are no figures available for the number of people who have died of starvation in Zimbabwe in the last 12 months as public record-keeping systems have, in many cases, broken down. According to the most recent UN nutritional assessments, malnutrition rates have continued to remain below emergency levels. Death from disease (including HIV/AIDS, TB, cholera and other gastro-intestinal conditions) is far more likely than starvation.</p>

	<p pid="d.555W.0/1">I apologise for the delay in responding.</p>

	<p pid="d.555W.0/3" class="italic"> (a) Flexible working practices for carers including the definition of carer in flexible working legislation</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/4">The Work and Families Act 2006 extended the right to request flexible working to carers of adults where the person cared for is a relative or lives at the same address. This definition covers approximately 80 per cent. of carers. BERR will review the definition of carer in relation to flexible working once the impact of the current extension has been evaluated. This is part of the short to medium-term commitments in the Carers Strategy to be undertaken by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/5" class="italic"> (b) Awareness among employers and carers of flexible working</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/6">The Government are actively promoting the right to request flexible working, focusing primarily on employers, carers and parents. Activities are being spread over 12 months encompassing media opportunities, ministerial events and using publications to reach the various target audiences. The campaign is both raising awareness of the individuals' right to request flexible working and helping employers understand how to handle such requests through more effective use of tools and advice available on BusinessLink.Gov.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/7">Improved guidance on the Businesslink website aims to help employers implement flexible working and provides all the information they need to comply with the law including free online forms and guidance tools to help deal with requests&mdash;helping save time, money and stress.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/8">The Directgov website provides practical information and advice for individuals including their rights under the law and how to make a request.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/9">In the run up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> the Government contracted 890,000 SMEs to highlight the change in the law and to publicise the guidance available at</p>

	<p pid="d.555W.0/11">This aimed to make sure businesses knew where to find the free help available and could avoid having to pay for professional external advice, thereby making the implementation of flexible working in the workplace easier and simpler to manage.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/12">Also in the run-up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> Directgov ran a campaign encompassing magazine advertorials, radio slots and television advertising, and highlighting the guidance and advice available on</p>

	<p pid="d.555W.0/14">Flexible working messages were included as part of this campaign. The Government also engaged with key stakeholders including Working Families, CarersUK, the Scouts and the TUC to promote the flexible messages to employees.</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/15" class="italic"> (c) The production of a good practice guide for employers on supporting carers</p>
	<p pid="d.555W.0/16">Employers for Carers, facilitated by Carers UK and led by a core group of employers, was formally launched in January 2009. Their work includes identifying and promoting the business benefits of supporting carers in the workplace and offering employers practical support to develop and benchmark good practice. They aim to create a culture that supports carers in and into work. Government are working with groups such as Carers UK and Employers for Carers to assess the best way of disseminating and promoting a good practice guide as agreed in the Carers Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.559W.5/3">The helpline provider was selected following a competitive tendering process which assessed bids against a number of factors including value for money, evidence of a high level of operator skills, a track record in delivering sensitive services on behalf of the public sector, and flexible IT systems and skills. I expect the successful tenderer to deliver a high quality service for vulnerable workers and for the different workplace enforcement bodies that stand behind the helpline.</p>

	<p pid="d.566W.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) maintains a longstanding and continuing programme of research into the health effects of asbestos exposure.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/2">Since 1968 the HSE has maintained the Great Britain Mesothelioma and Asbestosis Registers which document annual deaths from these conditions giving vital data for research.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/3">Since the early 1970s HSE has maintained a long term research study of more specific groups of workers in the British asbestos manufacturing industry, now including the current asbestos removals industry, to monitor their long term health status, in particular, their cancer and mortality rates, and to evaluate the effectiveness of legislation protecting their health.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/4">Most recently the HSE (with Cancer Research UK) commissioned Professor Julian Peto of the Institute of Cancer Research to measure the lung asbestos content in individuals with the asbestos-related cancer, mesothelioma, and those with and without it, including young men only potentially exposed more recently, to better assess the level of past exposure associated with disease and predict the future impact of current exposures. This follows HSE-funded research by Professor Peto on mesothelioma risk in specific occupations and from other potential sources of exposure.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/5">The programme enables the HSE to document and predict overall trends in the occurrence of key asbestos related diseases; identify changing patterns of occupational risk; monitor the long term health of those working in occupations covered by legislation on asbestos exposure at work; collate scientific information to improve knowledge about risk from different types of asbestos and at different exposures; and improve, and evaluate preventive measures.</p>
	<p pid="d.566W.2/6">Further details of the HSE's research programme are available from the HSE website.</p>

	<p pid="d.568W.5/2">Inquiries about employment and support allowance use the same modem telephony infrastructure as do inquiries to other DWP services. This ensures that we can satisfy our customers' needs in an effective and efficient way.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.5/3">DWP's executive team agreed last year that initial calls to inquire about and claim benefit should be free, so we should use 0800 numbers to ensure that the most important&mdash;and longest&mdash;calls are free to the majority of our customers. Subsequent calls for other reasons, such as offering further information or progress on the claim, take less time to resolve and should be charged at a standard rate for the majority of customers, so we should use 0845 numbers.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.5/4">The telephony market is constantly changing but it would be unreasonable to expect customers to continually keep up with alterations to our telephone numbering in order to allow us to match the latest pricing by different service operators. Costs of calling 0845 numbers remain lower than many alternatives, but we keep the market under review. Using BT landlines to call 0845 numbers is usually the lowest cost option. BT account for two-thirds of landline provision and recent research shows that over 80 per cent. of our customers contact us using landlines. Therefore, we concluded that 0845 numbers offered the best solution for the majority of our customers. The Department receives no revenue from use of any of our numbers, including 0845.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.5/5">Alternatives to the service are for the customer to use the free phones provided in jobcentres to make inquiries. In the event the jobcentre does not have a free phone available, local arrangements are in place to provide the customer with the opportunity to use a standard Jobcentre Plus phone.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.5/6">Where a customer is unable to use a landline and asks for us to call them back we will always do so.</p>

	<p pid="d.568W.11/1">The Budget has made an additional &pound;2.8 billion available to DWP, on top of the &pound;1.3 billion funding announced in the pre-Budget report, which will ensure that over the next two years we can continue to expand our support to jobseekers through the economic downturn. Among other initiatives, this extra funding will enable us to guarantee a job or other meaningful activity to young people and certain disadvantaged groups from the 12-month point of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.11/2">The Government are investing &pound;0.5 billion over two years to support people through an expanded range of work and training options to provide jobs through recruitment subsidies, support to start a business, work-related training and volunteering opportunities. This extra help was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> and is available to all those who have been out of work and claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.11/3">Jobseeker's allowance customers can train for up to 16 hours per week alongside active job search. Jobseekers may also undertake up to two weeks of full-time training in any 12-month period, without jeopardising their benefit entitlements. Additionally, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase>, anyone who has been unemployed and claiming benefits for more than six months can study full time for up to eight weeks on a job-related training course approved by an employment adviser.</p>
	<p pid="d.568W.11/4">The introduction of the flexible new deal in phase 1 areas from October will establish a new, unified approach for longer-term jobseekers, whatever their age, skills or barriers to work. The flexible new deal will deliver work-focused support, tailored to each individual's needs and local labour market requirements.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-11d.265946.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-11d.571W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="571W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090511/text/90511w0016.htm#09051148002495">
	<p pid="d.571W.5/1">With the abolition of tariff income rules for pension credit and housing benefit and council tax benefit (for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) while keeping the current upper capital limits in housing benefit and council tax benefit, approximately 710,000 pensioner households would receive higher income-related benefits at a cost of approximately &pound;560 million (2009-10 prices) per year.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/2">The tariff income rules are not intended to represent a rate of return that could be obtained from investing an individual's capital. They are a simple method of calculating the weekly contribution that customers with capital in excess of &pound;6,000 are expected to make to their normal living costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/3">The Government believe it is right that people with capital should contribute towards their own living costs, and right that support is targeted on those that need it most. That is why the current rules ignore the first &pound;6,000 of savings (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes) and why those with savings above this are expected to contribute a small amount to their weekly expenses.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/4">In the 2009 Budget, the Chancellor announced that the capital threshold for pension credit (and housing benefit and council tax benefit for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) will be increased from &pound;6,000 to &pound;10,000, bringing it into line with the threshold for those living permanently in care homes. This change will take effect from November 2009 and will allow these customers to retain up to &pound;10,000 of capital before it affects their benefit. This change represents a generous increase in the capital thresholds for pension credit recipients and a significant simplification to the benefit. Half a million pensioners stand to gain from this change, with an average weekly gain across all benefits of &pound;4.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/5">With these new capital rules, around 480,000 pensioner households would receive higher income-related benefits at a cost of approximately &pound;440 million (2009-10 prices) per year from the abolition of tariff income rules referred to in the question.</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/6" class="indentitalic"> Note:</p>
	<p pid="d.571W.5/7" class="indent">These estimates have been calculated using the Policy Simulation Model (PSM) which uses data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). Estimates are subject to sampling and modelling uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="d.572W.2/6" class="indent">We do not attempt systematically to record job outcomes achieved for former employees of particular employers: to do so would be prohibitively expensive.

This will allow the customer in conjunction with their personal adviser to agree activities that are tailored to their individual circumstances and will best help them move closer to work. As Professor Gregg suggested, work-related activity could include training, skills and job-related support as well as wider measures such as volunteering, undertaking parenting programmes or visiting a debt adviser.</p>

	<p pid="d.582W.3/2">The consultation, 'Family Legal Aid Funding from 2010', was published by my Department and the Legal Services Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December 2008</phrase>. The consultation paper was accompanied by a detailed impact assessment which considered the impact of the changes on lawyers and the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.3/3">The consultation proposed that in future the provision of guardians ad litem for children separately represented in family proceedings would be solely the responsibility of the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS), and could no longer be considered a legal aid disbursement. This is because these are not legal expenses. The proposal was put forward following discussions with CAFCASS, who confirmed that subject to suitable resources being available they agreed with the point in principle. The consultation responses are now being analysed since the close of the consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April</phrase>. We will have further discussions with the Legal Services Commission, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and CAFCASS, in the light of the evaluation, to agree a response to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="d.584W.6/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase>, governing bodies of all maintained schools and maintained nursery schools in England have been required, under section 29 of the Education Act 2002, to have in place a procedure to deal with complaints relating to the school and any community facilities or services that the school provides. The law also requires the procedure to be publicised. Parents may also approach Ofsted, which has powers to investigate and if necessary conduct an inspection of the school. In addition, parents' views are sought and considered as part of all school inspections.</p>

	<p pid="d.593W.2/25">As the table above shows, we have made substantial progress in raising GCSE attainment in secondary schools over the last 10 years. Although the rate of progress in the number of pupils achieving five or more good GCSEs in Coventry has exceeded national rates over the same period, more is needed to reduce the gap in attainment still further. Under the National Challenge, the Department is providing wide-ranging support to eight of the authority's schools this year. The National Challenge supports schools with the lowest GCSE results, so that by 2011 in every secondary school at least 30 per cent. of students will achieve at least five GCSEs at A*-C including English and maths.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/26">The National Strategies also provides support to schools in Coventry and this includes support and challenge in relation to school improvement, English, maths, science, behaviour and attendance, SEN and ethnic minority achievement. The strategies have also supported the provision and delivery of city-side GCSE English and maths revision courses (held at the Ricoh stadium) for year 11 pupils (April 2009).</p>

	<p pid="d.595W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/4" class="indent">Table A shows how many pupils with and without special educational needs attended mainstream schools (including nursery, primary and secondary schools and excluding special schools and pupil referral units) that were in special measures at the end of each academic year since 1997/98. Table B shows these figures as percentages.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/5" class="indent">Special measures is an Ofsted category, defined in the Education Act 2005, meaning that a school is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement. Please be aware that the framework for inspecting maintained schools changed in September 2005. As a result, there has been no consistent 'inadequate' category over this period. These tables are, therefore, limited to those maintained schools placed in special measures, as this category has been in place throughout the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/6" class="indent">Pupil numbers have been calculated using information from the Department for Children, Schools and Families' School Census (pupil-level) on pupils registered at one school only, and on pupils registered at two schools, but using their main school as recorded on the census, taken in January of each year.</p>
	<p pid="d.595W.2/7" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.598W.2/2">In all other cases of early retirement, benefits payable from the Teachers' Pension Scheme are automatically reduced to take account of the fact that they are put into payment before the scheme's normal pension age and therefore have the same actuarial value as if they had been paid at normal pension age.</p>

	<p pid="d.601W.5/1">The Technology Strategy Board (TSB), an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by DIUS, is the main national provider of innovation support in the UK. Through the TSB, 25 companies and three higher education establishments in the Coventry area are currently involved in 34 Collaborative R&amp;D projects and five Knowledge Transfer Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.5/2">The Collaborative R&amp;D projects and Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, which enable companies to work with the UK knowledge base to develop new products, processes and services, are jointly funded by business and have a total value of nearly &pound;100 million. Of this, &pound;41 million is grant funding from the TSB.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.5/3">Advantage West Midlands (AWM) also funds the Innovation Network project, which is managed by Coventry University. The network provides businesses with the desire to innovate the opportunity to collaborate with other businesses and access funding of between &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.5/4">AWM has also invested &pound;1.4 million in the first phase of the transformation of the Gosford Gate area into a vibrant trading gateway and centre for creative enterprises. The area will focus on arts, IT and design companies, which will feed off and support each other as well existing businesses. It is expected to become the cauldron of creative talent in the city and beyond. The scheme is a partnership between AWM, Coventry city council, Coventry Warwickshire and Solihull Partnership, Far Gosford Street businesses and residents, Heritage Lottery Fund, and local developers Complex Development Projects Ltd. It is one element in the radical &pound;2.2 billion transformation of Coventry into a 21st century city.</p>
	<p pid="d.601W.5/5">Coventry is also able to benefit from regional innovation projects including the INDEX innovation voucher scheme and the Innovation Advisory Service available through Business Link West Midlands, and from national programmes such as the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), which supports universities to work with business and public services and drive innovation. For example, HEIF funding has been used to support Coventry University's Institute of Creative Enterprise and Serious Games Institute.</p>

The RAE informs the allocation of the quality related block grant research funding, which is awarded on the basis of excellence. Funding on the basis of excellence gives institutions an incentive to drive up the quality of research. The 2008 RAE identified that 55 per cent. of research in England was either &quot;World Leading&quot; or &quot;Internationally Excellent&quot;.

	<p pid="d.604W.2/1">Higher education institutions (HEIs) are classed as public authorities in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA). As such they are legally required to meet both the general duty and specific duties to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people in higher education (HE). Compliance with the law is the responsibility of institutions themselves and enforcement the responsibility of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.604W.2/2">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has provided guidance to HEIs on supporting disabled students. In 1999, jointly with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales it published &quot;Guidance on base-level provision for disabled students in higher education institutions&quot;. The base level provision document contains information that is still useful and relevant today.</p>

This review includes an appraisal of its support to the sector in meeting the needs of disabled students and research commissioned jointly with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales. The research will look at the sector's support to disabled students and the progress that has been made since the publication of the guidance. HEFCE will be publishing an outcomes document in the summer outlining the results of the review and HEFCE's future policy and strategy for supporting the sector in this area.</p>
	<p pid="d.604W.2/4">The Department has published its progress report on disability equality in December 2008. The report's focus was on looking across the Department's policy areas to provide an assessment of progress towards disability equality. It did not focus on the compliance of our partners or stakeholders. The full report can be accessed here:</p>

	<p pid="d.604W.2/6">The report reflects that there has been significant advancement in the support provided to disabled students in HE, and in their ability to access HE, through the funding provided to HEIs to support such students and via the direct provision of disabled students' allowances.</p>

There has also been a significant increase in expressions of interest through the Armed Forces Recruitment Offices and through on-line applications, which is attributed in part to the current economic circumstances and rising unemployment. Taking the armed forces as a whole, retention rates are stable and we have seen no sudden outflow of personnel. There is real concern, however, that in some important areas exit rates are too high. These areas are continuously reviewed and the Department has put in place a wide range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the armed forces including: career management, improvement to conditions of service and work/life balance, extensions to normal engagement lengths, commitment bonuses and targeted Financial Retention Initiatives. Examples of schemes and incentives in place are: Golden Hellos, Commitment Bonuses, Recruit Bounty Schemes and targeted Recruitment and Retention Incentives. Each incentive is tailored to meet specific Service requirements.</p>
	<p pid="d.609W.0/3">The following tables show the pinch point trades liability, shortfalls, outflow and voluntary outflow (VO) in real numbers and percentage figures for quarter 3 of the Operational and Manning Pinch Point statistics. These are the latest available figures.</p>

	<p pid="d.614W.8/1">The Army Rejoin Bounty was introduced in November 2002 to offer a partial solution to critical manning shortfalls in certain Career Employment Groups. The scheme was then expanded in November 2003 as part of the wider Pinch Point Financial Incentive Scheme. It has been agreed to further expand the scheme under the Exceptional Action Measures to increase the amounts payable and widen the eligibility of those who qualify.</p>
	<p pid="d.614W.8/2">The extensions to the range, value and eligibility of these bounty payments, as well as data coding problems in the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) tool, have resulted in both the historic and current information not being held in the format requested and it could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

An additional three months' stock, calculated at three months' regular usage and amounting to around 8,000 masks and 48,000 pairs of gloves, is held by the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA), to provide stock for operations overseas and ships afloat.

	<p pid="d.619W.7/3">Information on the incidence of clinical depression in England is not available in the requested format. There is no information available for 1997, only for 1993, 2000 and 2007, through the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys. Information relating to those aged 65-74 only became available in 2000 and has therefore been excluded from the reply. In 1993, 2.2 per cent. of all adults in England aged 16-64 experienced a depressive episode, in 2000 2.8 per cent. and in 2007 2.6 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.623W.2/1">Revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) for 2009-10 and 2010-11, the remaining years of Comprehensive Spending Review 2007, were announced in December 2008. The allocations represent a &pound;164 billion investment in the national health service, &pound;80 billion in 2009-10 and &pound;84 billion in 2010-11. PCTs will receive an average increase in funding of 11.3 per cent. over the two years, a total increase of &pound;8.6 billion.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-11d.272544.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-05-11d.630W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="630W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090511/text/90511w0031.htm#0905124002109">
	<p pid="d.630W.2/1">Lorenzo release 1.0 provides functionality for clinical documentation, and requests and results. Of the three Lorenzo release 1.0 early adopter sites, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust is currently using the radiology requests and results functionality in its general surgery and urology wards, and has begun making plans for its use for inpatient, outpatient, and accident and emergency discharge summaries. South Birmingham Primary Care Trust (PCT) has a number of podiatrists using the system, working in eight different physical locations in the PCT. Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust went live for radiology results and requests in a nurse-led orthopaedic clinic at the end of March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/2">In London, three acute trusts, Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals, Queen Mary's Sidcup and Barts and The London NHS Trusts, are live with the first phase of the Cerner Millennium system. In June 2008 the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust went live with the next phase Cerner Millennium which features a link to the NHS spine. The trust uses the system to manage patient admission, transfer and discharge details and is linked to accident and emergency, theatre scheduling, maternity, therapies, as well as electronic radiology and pathology test ordering and reporting.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/3">In October 2008, following a review of the progress of the deployment of the Cerner Millennium system, an improvement programme was set up to concentrate on resolving the issues that were being experienced by the live trusts. At the Barts and The London NHS Trust some unresolved issues are being tackled as part of a wider comprehensive improvement programme that is addressing identified weaknesses in the trust's information management and administration systems. At the other three trusts improvement programmes have been substantially delivered.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/4">Due to the good progress made with the improvement programmes and greater confidence in the functionality and stability of the system, the London Acute Programme Board recommended in January 2009 that the implementation of Cerner Millennium should continue in London.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/5">In the south, eight health communities have to date gone live with the Cerner Millennium system. Each health community typically comprises an acute trust and the associated primary care trust sites in its area. The acute trusts are Winchester and Eastleigh Healthcare NHS trust; Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS trust; Weston Area Health NHS trust; Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation trust; Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre NHS trust; Milton Keynes General Hospital NHS trust; Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS trust; and Worthing and Southlands Hospitals NHS trust.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/6">Since the local service provider contract with Fujitsu was terminated in May 2008, new arrangements to support and develop the services in the eight live sites in the south, together with agreement to deploy the Cerner product to a further four acute organisations have been agreed with BT. Under these arrangements, the eight live sites in the south will first be transferred to a BT data centre and then upgraded to the post- improvement programme configuration of the electronic patient record software that has been developed for London Cerner trusts. The transfer to the BT data centres and the subsequent upgrade of software are expected to be completed for the live sites by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.630W.2/7">Further planned Cerner Millennium implementations at trusts in both London and the south are being informed by the lessons learnt from the improvement programmes at the live sites, and will enable more localisation and tailoring of the system, as well as close working between clinicians and solution experts as the system is being built for each trust.</p>
