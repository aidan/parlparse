	<p pid="b.1379W.9/9">DEFRA has a programme in place to deliver operational carbon dioxide savings across its estate, with initiatives specifically targeted at improving energy efficiency:</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/10" class="indent">DEFRA has installed 33 voltage regulation units on its estate. This technology significantly reduces energy consumption of a whole building by regulating the voltage level entering the building. Average electricity consumption has reduced by 12 per cent. per site as a result of installing this technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/11" class="indent">Other energy efficiency projects which have been implemented include upgrades to more efficient lighting, improvements to motor energy controls and gas boiler sequencing controls, all of which have delivered significant savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/12" class="indent">Thermal imaging surveys have been undertaken at a number of DEFRA properties. The results of the surveys will inform a programme of works to improve the thermal efficiency of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/13" class="indent">DEFRA is currently upgrading its electricity, gas and water meters to 'Smart meters' which will provide accurate and up to the minute consumption data. These data will be used to monitor and identify excessive consumption, providing a focus for strategic consumption reduction. The Carbon Trust estimate that savings of between 5 and 10 per cent. can be achieved through the identification of waste through Smart metering.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/14">To further improve operational efficiency, DEFRA has recently revised its requirements for facilities management (FM) provision to incorporate a more sustainable approach to the FM service. The recent Sustainable Workplace Management contract awarded to Interserve, will further enhance DEFRA's capability to further embed sustainability in its operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379W.9/15">DEFRA has adopted the Carbon Trust's Carbon Management Programme and the entire DEFRA estate, including laboratories, was awarded Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme (EEAS) certification in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1382W.3/1">Robust action is being taken by the Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) to ensure business continuity during the period of relocation of its headquarters to Tyneside and in preparing for the establishment of a new Marine Management Organisation. This includes plans for the timely recruitment of new staff to replace existing staff who will not be relocating. This recruitment will take into account the need for some periods of parallel running between the Tyneside and London offices for a number of teams to allow for training and knowledge transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1382W.3/2">Recognising the need to retain key staff during the transition period in order to ensure the necessary knowledge transfer, the MFA has instigated a 'Transition Allowance'. This will be payable to those MFA HQ staff identified as being in key roles and/or with specialist knowledge/skills who have opted not to relocate with their posts and who are prepared to delay their redeployment to another civil service post. It recognises the need to retain key people within the agency's HQ for an extended period to ensure business continuity and help train new staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.1383W.0/1">There is an established scheme by which non-departmental public bodies, such as the new Marine Management Organisation (MMO), can be accredited to have access to civil service vacancies. My officials are applying for such accreditation on behalf of the MMO to become effective when the organisation is vested. Initial enquiries reveal that there is no reason why this should not be granted. This will enable MMO staff to apply, on merit, for civil service posts via the civil service 'Jobs Online' facility.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383W.0/2">MMO staff will be able to apply for DEFRA vacancies that are advertised on the 'Jobs Online' site in the same way that MFA staff currently can.

	<p pid="b.1383W.0/3">The Cabinet Office Statement of Practice (COSOP) which governs the transfer of civil servants between Departments, suggests that departments should provide an opportunity for staff to return to their original department if they wish.

Any relocation of existing staff from London to the new HQ site, or transfer of posts to be filled by newly recruited staff in Tyneside, will be progressed in line with this plan. Current thinking is that relocation and recruitment would take place between July and November 2009. This is a broad timeline and some individual relocations may need to happen either earlier or later in order to reflect, where appropriate, personal circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1385W.5/1">The work to prepare for the establishment of a new Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and to relocate the Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA) Headquarters are two separate projects. The relocation of the MFA Headquarters would be taking place regardless of any decisions to create a new MMO. Both projects are being delivered by an Implementation Team based in the MFA. The breakdown of posts currently in the implementation team provided below reflects resourcing of both activities and includes the Programme Management Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1385W.5/15">Support for creation of the MMO, including preparations for cross-Government sponsorship arrangements, is also being provided by a further Grade 7 post based in DEFRA. Some limited specialist HR expertise is also being provided by DEFRA to support the recruitment of staff in Tyneside and redeployment of existing MFA staff where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385W.5/16">The Implementation Team has changed in size and profile at various stages of the project to reflect changing workloads, but broadly speaking a core project team consisting of six to eight posts has been in place in the MFA since the beginning of 2008-09. Additional resource has been recruited to the project since the beginning of 2009 to support activity during this implementation year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385W.5/17">Three of the above posts are being delivered by members of staff who are receiving Temporary Additional Responsibility Allowance (TARA), all of which have been granted for longer than six months. The decision was taken not to fill these posts permanently with members of staff at the substantive grade required because of the relocation of the MFA Headquarters and the time-limited need of the implementation work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1392W.15/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>

	<p pid="b.1392W.15/6" class="indent">This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392W.15/7" class="indent">The new foundation learning materials consist of 14 learning and development products. The suite of products includes elements of mandatory and non mandatory learning and development materials, depending on an individual's job role. Line Managers in consultation with an individual will agree a pathway of foundation learning targeted at addressing their job role requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392W.15/8" class="indent">In April 2008, the foundation learning was reviewed and revised and therefore any historical information would not accurately reflect the number of individuals who undertook foundation learning over the last 24 months. Our systems are not set up to capture this type of management information, and it would need to be compiled clerically, which would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392W.15/9" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus management and leadership development programme (called &quot;Managers who deliver&mdash;Leaders who inspire&quot;) is a relatively new programme that was piloted in September 2007 and rolled out nationally from early 2008. It was designed to incorporate the skills required by the Professional Skills for Government (PSG) framework so the two are inextricably linked. There is no separate learning intervention on the PSG framework itself in relation to the middle managers covered by this development programme, however PSG is a framework that is integrated into the appraisal and development planning for such managers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392W.15/10" class="indent">The available information regarding &quot;Managers who deliver&mdash;Leaders who inspire&quot; is attached at Annex 1. The volumes and costs data is broken down by region and operational arm, rather than just by Customer Service Directorate region and district as requested. This is because the Benefit and Fraud and Contact Centre Directorates do not have the same district based organisational structure. Information on how much was budgeted for this training is only collated at national level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1398W.7/2"><i> </i>Tax credits is an annual system which is designed to be responsive to changes in families' circumstances. This is particularly important when income falls and around 355,000 households who were living on a lower income in March receiving on average &pound;35 more per week in tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398W.7/3">HMRC calculates an initial award for claimants based on their income for the previous year and their current family circumstances. Awards can be adjusted if claimants tell the Department of a change in their circumstances during the year. After the end of a year, HMRC sends tax credits customers an annual renewal pack asking them to provide or confirm details of their income and circumstances. This information is necessary to determine whether claimants have received the correct amount of tax credits in the tax year just ended. Tax credits customers can complete the process by returning the annual declaration and renewal forms or by calling the tax credits Helpline, usually by <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-31">31 July</phrase>. Detailed information can be found on the Department's website at</p>

	<p pid="b.1400W.0/1">Section 62 Finance (No. 2) Act 1987 retrospectively restored the principle that double taxation treaties do not affect a UK resident's liability to UK tax on their income or gains. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) does not believe that any tax avoidance schemes were permitted under that legislation&mdash;although the tax avoidance schemes in question here purported to circumvent it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.0/2">Evidence emerged that a large number of people were using the scheme and in light of a number of factors (including the widespread use, aggressive nature and artificiality of the scheme, the deliberate attempt to flout the clear intention of Parliament in 1987 and the need to ensure fairness and certainty for all taxpayers), the Government introduced legislation at section 58 Finance Act 2008 to put beyond doubt that none of the schemes worked&mdash;and never had done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.0/3">Although, like the 1987 legislation, it is indefinitely retrospective, HMRC is not aware of any relevant schemes prior to 2001. Any tax paid late will be subject to interest in accordance with the relevant legislation on late payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.0/4">Formal impact assessments are not published in respect of measures where the impact is only on those who are avoiding tax and thus one was not published for this particular measure. Such decisions on the production of an impact assessment are taken on a case-by-case basis. As indicated in the 2008 Financial Statement and Budget Report, it is estimated that the tax at stake on the schemes that purported to circumvent the 1987 legislation is around &pound;200 million. Those who used those schemes are, like ail other UK taxpayers, required to pay tax on the profits that they earned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1402W.2/1">To help provide support for individuals who have been made redundant, the Budget announced a one-off increase of &pound;30 in the level of statutory redundancy pay, increasing the weekly rate to &pound;380. Redundancy pay is a right for all employees who have worked continuously for their employer for two years and are made redundant. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform intends to implement this increase on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1402W.2/2">This builds on existing support such as the tax credit system, which is designed to respond quickly to changing circumstances, and has helped 355,000 households living on a lower income to receive an average of &pound;35 per week more in tax credits. The pre-Budget report in November 2008 also announced a substantial package of support. This includes extending the Rapid Response Service, which provides a range of on-site personalised support through Jobcentre Plus; extending Local Employment Partnerships to assist the recently unemployed in their local labour market; and enhancements to Support for Mortgage Interest, to better help people out of work to meet the interest payments on their mortgage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1415W.0/1">No fault compensation for disorders caused by service before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> is provided by the War Pensions Scheme. Its legislation sets out the method of assessment and provides that disablement pensions are paid where disablement is assessed at 20 per cent. or more. For hearing loss this equates to 50dB loss in each ear averaged over 1, 2 and 3 kHz.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.0/2">The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme applies to disorders caused on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. This scheme is tariff based with lump sum awards linked to specific descriptors. For more serious disorders there is an additional Guaranteed Income Payment payable for life. The lowest award for hearing loss alone is the descriptor 'bilateral permanent hearing loss of 50-75dB averaged over 1, 2 and 3 kHz with mild or no tinnitus'. In addition a Guaranteed Income Payment becomes payable where hearing loss alone exceeds 75dB averaged over 1, 2 and 3 kHz in each ear.</p>
	<p pid="b.1415W.0/3">The Ministry of Defence's approach to the assessment of service related sensorineural hearing loss for both the War Pensions Scheme and Armed Forces Compensation Scheme is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This approach has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts.</p>

However, latest reporting suggests that her condition has improved. Mrs Suu Kyi was reported to be in good spirits during a visit by an assistant to her regular doctor on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-11">Monday 11 May 2009</phrase>. We have also received reports that she appeared to be in good health on arrival for her trial on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-18">18 May 2009</phrase>. Nonetheless, we remain concerned that Mrs Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for a considerable period and has not had the level of medical care that can be enjoyed by a free individual. In striking contrast, senior military leaders go out of Burma for medical treatment whenever the need arises.</p>

GH purchases replacement stock, for example purchase of china in 2004 to replace 50-year-old dinner plates, produced by Wedgewood as a special commission. GH also buys new stock items when required for one-off occasions, for example the G8 summit in 2005 at Gleneagles.</p>

	<p pid="b.1432W.8/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA), speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom, has made a number of proposals in relation to the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation aiming to achieve consumer protection through proportionate controls and help minimise the cost to UK industry. Highlights of these proposals include better definition of the scope of the regulation, focusing only on beneficial claims in a commercial context; a solution to dealing with trade marks that are also claims with effective transitional arrangements; elimination of disproportionate prohibitions of claims about general well-being, references to psychological and behavioural functions, slimming and weight control, recommendations by health charities and claims aimed at children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1432W.8/2">The UK argued for a process to reduce the burden of authorisation of health claims already on the market, and for new claims pushed the European Commission to meet its duty to make available technical guidance and tools to assist small and medium sized businesses in the preparation and presentation of applications for assessment of health claims by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). More recently, the UK proposed better transparency of EFSA's scientific assessment of health claims and secured a commitment from the Commission to improve access to the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1432W.8/3">Guidance to interpretation of the regulation from the Commission has helped industry understand how to apply some of the more ambiguous areas of the regulation and this grew from the FSA's own detailed guidance to compliance, which is used widely across the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.1432W.8/4">We have also been successful in achieving appropriate transition periods to allow industry to adapt to the new regulations and we continue to champion better regulation as unforeseen issues arise during the implementation of this complex measure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1434W.0/1">Redundancies that occurred as a result of the implementation of the capacity improvement programme did not impact until after March 2008. Since then, there have been 686 redundancies resulting from the implementation of the capacity improvement programme. It is not possible to provide a precise figure on the number of redundancies defined as 'compulsory' because of the complex criteria agreed for achieving the reduction.</p>

There are plans for prescriptions dispensed by dispensing doctors and prescriptions personally administered by doctors to be processed on the new system from July 2009.

	<p pid="b.1435W.5/1">Nitrazepam belongs to the class of medicines known as benzodiazepines. It is licensed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia which is considered to be disabling or subjecting the individual to unacceptable distress, where daytime sedation is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/2">Nitrazepam acts in 30 to 60 minutes to produce sleep lasting six to eight hours. The half-life is, on average, 24 hours but depending on the individual can range from 16 to 38 hours. As a result nitrazepam has a prolonged action and may give rise to residual effects the following day, and repeated doses tend to be cumulative. Shorter acting agents are therefore preferable for the majority of patients requiring treatment for insomnia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/3">The half-life of a drug intended for use as a sleeping tablet is only one of many factors that influences the safe use of a medicine. Information to aid the safe use of nitrapezam is provided in the product information which consists of the Summary of Product Characteristics for healthcare professionals and the Patient Information Leaflet. These are available on the internet at</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.medicines.org.uk/">www.medicines.org.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/5">Additional prescribing advice is provided in the British National Formulary, which is sent to all doctors within the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/6">Guidance on the safe use of benzodiazepines has been issued by the Department on a number of occasions; the focus of this advice has been on the need for restriction of use to short-term only. In the case of nitrazepam the recommended treatment period varies from a few days to two weeks with a maximum of four weeks including the tapering off process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1435W.5/7">Based on information obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis database it has been estimated that 1,172,799 prescription items of nitrazepam were dispensed in the community in England during 2008. This figure does not include items which may have been dispensed within a hospital setting.</p>

	<p pid="b.1436W.12/1">DIUS collects a variety of information which in theory is capable of being analysed at lower layer super output area (SOA) as it includes the postcode of the business, provider or learner (see Table 1). In many cases, however, the data is not suitable for analysis, or not routinely made available, at this geographic level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1436W.12/2">Lower layer SOA is generally only used as a building block to aggregate data to higher level geographies. Very few datasets allow for meaningful analysis to be produced by lower layer SOA (there are over 32,000 lower layer SOAs in England). Even where this is possible, significant work may be involved in establishing a suitable method for presentation and in resolving other statistical issues such as avoiding disclosure. Therefore, data may not be fit for purpose at lower layer SOA under National Statistics protocols.</p>
	<p pid="b.1436W.12/3">Table 1 provides details of education and skills data collected by, or on behalf of, the Department which includes information by postcode of business, provider or learner. It also provides information on the level of geography which is currently released.</p>

	<p pid="b.1438W.5/1">The requested information is shown in the table, the proportion of those given various disposals is shown as a percentage of those sentenced. Lags in time between conviction and sentencing may mean that the total numbers convicted and sentenced in a year may not match. Data held by the Ministry of Justice record the age of the offender at the time of sentencing, the figures show all offenders aged over 21 and over at that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.5/2">There is no specific offence of 'child abuse'. The term 'child abuse' describes harm caused to a child arising from emotional, physical and sexual abuse or neglect caused by a parent or carer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.5/3">The statistics provided in this answer are for those offences currently identified as such, including causing or allowing the death of a child, sexual assaults against under 16s, and cruelty or neglect of a child. Not included are other forms of abuse for which there is no separate legal category, offences where the victim cannot be identified as a child from the type of offence, and cases of abuse which cannot be identified because they were proceeded against under more general offences such as physical assault.</p>
	<p pid="b.1438W.5/4">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="b.1445W.5/1">We have not reduced the family legal aid budget. The cost of family legal aid increased by 46 per cent. from &pound;399 million in 2001-02 to &pound;582 million in 2007-08, while the number of funding certificates fell by 11 per cent., from 129,000 to 115,000 over the same period. We clearly stated our intention to make reforms to family fees in 'Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead', published in November 2006, following Lord Carter's review of legal aid procurement. The 'Way Ahead' proposals were subject to Cabinet committee clearance and were integral to MOJ's spending review settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.5/2">My noble Friend, Lord Bach, announced changes to the Family Graduated Fee Scheme for barristers in February, following a 30 per cent. rise in costs in just five years. The consultation response included a full impact assessment. More recently, the consultation, 'Family Legal Aid Funding from 2010', published by my Department and the Legal Services Commission, closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-03">3 April 2009</phrase>. The Legal Services Commission is currently analysing the responses. The consultation covers two payment schemes, the 'Private Family Law Representation Scheme', and the 'Family Advocacy Scheme', which will cover representation by solicitors and counsel in independent practice. This consultation document included a draft impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.5/3">Our aim is to help as many people as possible within existing resources. In both cases the impact assessments have demonstrated that failing to address the significant increases in fees paid in recent years could risk leading to reductions in services for clients.</p>

	<p pid="b.1460W.8/1">In the Home Office HQ and the UK Border Agency, non-consolidated performance related payments are awarded to individuals at Grade 6 and below who have made an exceptional contribution throughout the year. Under the current arrangements up to 35 per cent. of staff in these grades may receive a non-consolidated performance related payment. The total amount paid to staff in 2008-09 was &pound;3,486,925 and the number of payments made was 6,036 (relating to staff performance for the year 2007-08). The total pay bill was c.&pound;750 million, of which 0.5 per cent. was used for non-consolidated performance payments to staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1460W.8/2">Staff in the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) can receive end of year corporate non-consolidated performance related payments and change agent payments (for Grade 6 and 7's only). The total amount paid to staff in 2008-09 was &pound;1,537,113 and the number of payments made was 4,054 (relating to staff performance for the year 2007-08). The total pay bill was &pound;103,690,330 of which 1.48 per cent. was used for non-consolidated performance payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1460W.8/3">Staff in the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) do not receive end of year performance related payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1460W.8/4">The criteria for awarding senior civil servants with end of year non-consolidated performance payments are set by the Prime Minister following independent advice from the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB). The level of these payments takes into account a number of factors including individual performance against agreed priority business objectives and targets. The total amount paid to SCS staff in the Home Office and its Agencies in 2008-09 was &pound;1,264,000 and the number of payments made was 128 (relating to staff performance for the year 2007-08). The total pay bill was &pound;14,330,946 of which 8.6 per cent. was used for non-consolidated performance payments. The Government have responded to current economic conditions by freezing the size of the SCS non-consolidated pot (for 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="b.1460W.8/5">All such non-consolidated performance related payments in the Home Office and its agencies are funded within existing pay bill controls, have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined performance standards and targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1472W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question asking what data the Office for National Statistics gathers on the level of voter registration. (276405)</p>
	<p pid="b.1472W.9/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics collects annual counts of the number of people who are registered to vote - in Parliamentary, European and Local Government Elections - from Electoral Registration Officers in each local authority in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472W.9/5" class="indent">In Scotland the counts of registered voters are collated by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). In Northern Ireland the counts are collected by the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI).</p>
	<p pid="b.1472W.9/6" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics collates all these data to produce annual Electoral Statistics for the UK by Parliamentary Constituency and Local Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472W.9/7" class="indent">ONS also produces annual estimates of the mid-year resident population of the UK. These figures can be compared to annual estimates of the mid-year resident population to provide an approximation to voter registration rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472W.9/8" class="indent">This is not a precise figure for voter registration rates because not everybody who is usually resident is entitled to vote and on the other hand some people may be registered in more than one area (e.g. some people with more than one address).</p>

	<p pid="b.1476W.5/6" class="indent">The attached table shows the number of employee jobs for transport, storage and communication activities (Section I of the Standard Industrial Classification 2003) in each UK Government Office Region (GOR) from 2007Q1 to 2008Q4, the most recent estimate available. The quarterly series are not seasonally adjusted and so estimates for 2007 have been included in order to produce series of annual change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1476W.5/7" class="indent">These estimates are produced from employer surveys and are subject to sampling variability. They exclude self-employed jobs and government supported trainees, which are not available by region by industry. Section level is the lowest industry level available by region for quarterly employee jobs. Section I has been deemed to best represent the 'logistics sector' and this includes land transport, water transport, storage, warehousing, post and telecommunications. A more detailed breakdown of employee jobs by industry by region is available from ONS's Annual Business Inquiry, although the most recent estimates are for 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1480W.2/1">If the UK were to achieve the estimated potential for the use of biomass for heat and power, as set out in the Renewable Energy Strategy consultation 2008, and assuming that biomass is carbon neutral, this could save around 20 Mt carbon dioxide compared to the fossil fuel alternative. This methodology does not account for losses of carbon dioxide during production, processing and transport, whose impact will vary on a case by case basis. Some of these savings will occur within the Emissions Trading Scheme. On nitrogen oxides, Government has modelled the potential impact of an increase in use of biomass in the domestic sector against a range of scenarios. We estimate this could result in an additional 0.8-9.1 ktonnes NOx over a baseline for 2020 of 87.1 ktonnes, depending on the amount of heat produced and the level of performance of the biomass unit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1482W.2/2"><i> </i>In future, the Carbon Reduction Commitment will incentivise all private and public sector organisations that consume at least 6,000 MWh of half hourly metered electricity per year, including private building companies, to reduce their CO2<sup>( )</sup>emissions. The final details of the scheme are currently subject to public consultation which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June</phrase> and it will come into force in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.2/3">The Department for Communities and Local Government (Communities) is responsible for setting minimum standards for the energy and carbon performance of building works through the building regulations in England and (currently) Wales. Communities has announced that all new homes in England will be NET zero carbon from 2016, with progressive tightening of part L of the Building Regulations towards that outcome in 2010 and 2013. Communities expect to consult shortly on part L changes for 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.2/4">Government have also announced their ambition for new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019. Communities has recently consulted on the definition of zero carbon homes and non-domestic buildings. The need for new legislation to give effect to these policies will be considered at a later stage. The devolved Administrations are working on their own proposals for low and zero carbon development.</p>

	<p pid="b.1482W.5/1">The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the HSE is in the process of assessing EDF/AREVA's UK European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPR) as part of their Generic Design Assessment (GDA). During this process the NII has informed officials from DECC's Office of Nuclear Development (OND) that it has raised issues with EDF/AREVA on the Control and Instrumentation (C&amp;I) systems of the EPR design.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.5/2">The NII has raised this matter with EDF/AREVA, both verbally and as a Regulatory Issue (the highest level of technical issue that can be given under GDA), sent on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-16">16 April 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.5/3">Having a GDA process in the UK allows the regulators to raise these types of issues at an early stage of the assessment process, which is what the NII has been able to do. This then allows the company involved to identify solutions that can be implemented at an early stage of the conceptual design, prior to construction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482W.5/4">We expect the GDA process to be completed by June 2011.</p>
