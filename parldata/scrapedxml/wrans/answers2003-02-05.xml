Generally speaking the grid connection, operational and other costs associated with assimilating renewables on to the system increases the cost to consumers. However, regulation initiatives can mitigate some of these costs to some consumers.</p>

	<p pid=".259W.2/1">The current difficulties in the insurance market have a particularly adverse impact on a predominantly small and medium enterprise-based economy such as that in Northern Ireland. Three initiatives are under way to address various aspects of current difficulties: Government are conducting an urgent review of employers' liability to assess the scale and nature of the current difficulties; the Office of Fair Trading have launched a fact finding study to examine the reasons for premium increases and the Financial Services Authority are consulting on proposals for regulating the sale of general insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".259W.2/2">In Northern Ireland the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has conducted a business survey on insurance costs. It indicates significant rises particularly (but not exclusively) in employers' liability and property insurance. The results of this survey will be fed into Government's current review in which my officials are participating. The outcome of the review will be reported to Ministers by the end of March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".264W.8/1">As part of the preparation of the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan the Department of the Environment has appointed consultants to assess the potential need for additional retail floor space within the Plan Area up to 2015. The terms of reference also require the consultants to advise on where any additional floorspace should be located, and if it should be phased, how it should be phased and why it should be phased.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.8/2">The Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan covers Belfast, Carrickfergus, Castlereagh, Lisburn, Newtownabbey and North Down Council Areas. The Retail Study will inform the policies to be included in the Draft Plan, which is programmed to be published in September 2003. The findings of the Study will be published with the Draft Plan and all policies and proposals will be open to objection. Unresolved objections will be considered at a Public Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.8/3">The Regional Development Strategy (RDS) acknowledges the vital role that retailing plays in the development of Northern Ireland. In particular it emphasises the need to create a thriving Metropolitan Area centred on a revitalised Belfast, through the enhancement of the role of the city, by supporting and strengthening the city centre as the leading regional shopping centre and maintaining the city centre as the primary retail and office location in the region. The RDS also advocates the development of the complementary role of the suburban districts of Castlereagh and Newtownabbey, and the development of the city of Lisburn, and the towns of Bangor and Carrickfergus and strengthening the multi-functional role of their town centres.</p>
	<p pid=".264W.8/4">In recognition of this, the Department for Regional Development is currently preparing a new planning policy statement on Retailing and Town Centres (PPS5) to replace the current retail planning policy statement, which was first published by the Department of the Environment in June 1996. The purpose of this new policy is to assist the implementation of the Regional Development Strategy. In addition, it will provide strategic planning guidance to assist the Department of the Environment in the preparation of development plans and the determination of planning applications. Roger Tym and Partners were commissioned by the Department for Regional Development to carry out evidence-based retail research to guide the Department in the preparation of the new retail planning policy statement. The final draft report of the retail consultancy is due to be issued within the next few days. The new draft planning policy statement is scheduled to be issued for full public consultation during the next few months.</p>

Our contractors abide by the industry guidelines of &quot;Forests Forever (A Campaign For Wood) Environmental Timber Purchasing Policy 2000 following the commitment given by DEFRA in July 2000 that timber used on the Government Estate should be derived from sustainable sources.</p>

The North West experienced a narrowing of the pay difference between men and women by half a percentage point compared to 2001. Unfortunately it is not possible to obtain figures for Bolton.</p>

The decision to close Newcastle Central Station at 11.30pm, after the last passenger service has departed, was taken in 1990&ndash;91 by the British Railways Board and was continued by Great North Eastern Railway. The station does partially re-open during the night to cater for passengers arriving and departing on overnight services. The BTP advised in 1993&ndash;94 that the taxi rank on the station concourse should move to council property after 11.30pm because the station was no longer open and the rank was attracting large crowds that had no connection with the station.</p>

	<p pid=".275W.3/1">The implementation of competition in street lighting connections is the responsibility of the DTI and Ofgem. But my Department is in discussions with them to see what can be done to speed the process up, since competition in this area will greatly assist in tackling the backlogs in street lighting which we are committed to remove under the 10-Year Plan for Transport.</p>

	<p pid=".278W.2/2">The UK is a member, through the EU, of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), a United Nations body established to, among other things, &quot;achieve a reasonable balance between world supply and demand on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of coffee at fair prices to consumers and markets for coffee at remunerative prices to producers to facilitate the expansion and transparency of international trade in coffee&quot;. The ICO, therefore monitors the world coffee market on an on-going basis and provides its members with market statistics and reports.</p>
	<p pid=".278W.2/3">The UK contributes to the ICO's examination of its world coffee statistics and reports and to the development of its policies. A major plank of the Organisation's current activity is the Coffee Quality Improvement Programme, which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase>. It requires exports of unprocessed coffee from member countries to comply with minimum standards which should have a positive effect upon supply and demand and, in turn, producer prices. Discussions are also under way within the organisation about how exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.8/2">The River Thames is the primary drainage channel conveying river flows through the Thames Valley. Along the stretch of river between Reading and Teddington (the effective tidal limit) the Environment Agency report that there are no riverside flood defence structures that are in worse than good condition. The weirs that primarily control water levels for navigation also have an important function in flood level control, however the condition of the weirs did not contribute to the flooding in the Thames Valley in the New Year period. The Agency advise that eight of these weirs are in worse than good condition and their reconstruction is either in progress or planned in the medium term. These weirs, with provisional reconstruction dates, are listed in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".282W.15/2">Sugar beet has potential for the production of bioethanol and the Government announced in the pre-Budget report that it intends to introduce a 20p per litre reduction in duty on bioethanol compared to ultra low sulphur petrol. Industry and other stakeholders are being consulted about when this incentive should be introduced. Production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials is likely to offer additional environmental advantage and the Government will consider best how to give it further support. There is potential to exploit other molecules from sugar beet, some of which have high value, and this is already known to the industry. The Government-Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops was set up in 2001 to review market opportunities for non-food crops and make recommendations to Government on policy affecting their use. The Forum has looked at several non-food crop applications, including bioethanol.</p>

In addition they are bound by the terms of the Official Secrets Act. Breach of the forgoing may result in termination of appointment and in certain circumstances criminal or civil proceedings.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.9/1">It remains Government policy that the fabrication and assembly of new warship hulls for the Royal Navy should be undertaken in United Kingdom shipyards, and this, of course, applies to the construction of the future aircraft carriers. However, the policy does not apply to all of the vessels' sub-systems.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.9/2">As the Defence Industrial Policy Paper published last October, made clear, competition remains the bedrock of our procurement policy, although the benefit to the UK economy from MOD contracts is taken into account when assessing bids. In order to provide the Armed Forces with the equipment they require at the best value for money for the taxpayer, prime contractors are expected to use competition extensively to select sub-contractors. British industry is well-placed to compete for the equipment and sub-systems that will be required for the future aircraft carrier.</p>

First, 30 aircraft will be upgraded to GR7A standard by the integration of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus Mkl07 engine. This will provide improved performance, particularly for carrier borne operation. This programme is due to be completed by the end of 2005 at a total cost of approximately &pound;150 million.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.0/2">The OWP includes a comprehensive communications element to enable deployed Service personnel to remain in contact with their families. This will entitle personnel to 20 minutes of publicly-funded telephone calls per week, and they will also be able to purchase additional telephone minutes. The cost of additional minutes will vary between locations, reflecting the varying types of communications system that will be installed. However, in most cases, the rate will be lower than that charged by commercial mobile telephone companies.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.0/3">The OWP will also allow Service personnel to send and receive emails, to access the internet and to send and receive free forces aerogrammes (blueys) and electronic blueys. Finally, deployed personnel and their families will be entitled to concessionary mail and parcel charges, which will allow them to send and receive letters and parcels at subsidised rates.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.2/1">Maritime assets are extremely flexible. The decision to deploy HMS Ark Royal in the Landing Platform Helicopter role reflected contingency planning. However, she is capable of operating both naval FA2 Sea Harriers and RAF GR7s and could reconfigure while on deployment. The naval task group includes an escort force matched to the size of the task group. That escort force is able to provide air, surface and underwater protection. Merlin and Sea Kings with their early warning systems are also available. In addition, in the Gulf, force protection is provided jointly across coalition forces. Royal Navy ships have the necessary equipment to ensure that they are able to achieve a high degree of integration with coalition assets. Force protection is an issue that is well practised and understood. The threat to any United Kingdom asset is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid=".290W.5/2">The Type 45 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyer, fitted with the 4.5 inch Mk8 Mod 1 gun, will provide the same Naval gunfire support as the current surface fleet capability. However, it is designed and built with significant space and weight margins to enable incremental acquisition should an emerging requirement necessitate a different equipment fit. Under such circumstances, the design could be modified to incorporate improved land attack capabilities including a larger calibre gun or a land attack missile system.</p>

Proposals for the inclusion of provisions relating to devolved matters in a UK Bill, and therefore the need to invoke the Sewel Convention, arise at the initiative of either the UK Government or the Executive, but in every case, require a process of discussion and agreement between the two Administrations.

This may be due to a number of factors indicating that the crisis goes beyond food alone. There have been few recorded deaths that can be attributed directly to starvation. However, mortality among those already sick, particularly people suffering from AIDS, have increased as a result of poor nutrition.</p>

	<p pid=".296W.0/1">A combination of drought in the south and flooding in the north of Madagascar has led to a shortage of the country's staple food, rice (additionally, in the north, the lack of clean water and latrines increases the risk of disease). The World Food Programme (WFP) has said that substitute foods, of which algae is one, are becoming scarce.</p>
	<p pid=".296W.0/2">The lack of rice and dietary substitutes means that the potential for a humanitarian crisis exists in Madagascar. The WFP is presently in discussion with partners to identify the most appropriate response to the worsening situation.</p>
	<p pid=".296W.0/3">The United Kingdom's membership contributions to the United Nations and European Union form part of the resources which the WFP draws upon in such a crisis.

	<p pid=".307W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to respond to your questions regarding appeals in respect of Disability Living Allowance from deaf people and their access to a qualified British Sign Language interpreter at the oral tribunal hearing where requested.</p>

Where such a request is made the Appeals Service will meet the associated costs and aim to provide a qualified, registered interpreter. No information is available on the number of appeals by deaf appellants in respect of Disability Living Allowance. During 2001&ndash;02 over &pound;363,000 was spent on the provision of interpreters but this includes language translation where someone is not able to understand English.

	<p pid=".313W.6/1">The New Deal has gradually reduced the hours worked by junior doctors since its inception in 1991. However the New Deal targets have changed and become tougher, making direct comparison across the years misleading.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.6/2">In 1991, to comply with the New Deal a junior doctor had to work less than 82 hours a week; in 1993, 72 hours a week and in 1995, 56 hours a week. The introduction of stricter rest requirements in 1998 and of the new junior doctors' pay system in December 2000 led to temporary increases in non-compliance. The overall trend, however, has been a substantial reduction in the hours worked by junior doctors from 73 per cent. complying with the 82 hour limit in 1991, to 70.6 per cent. complying with the 56 hour limit in 2002. This has been accompanied by a steady increase in the number of junior doctors working for the national health service: 23,875 in September 1991; 31,777 in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.6/3">Implementation of the New Deal has been supported by New Deal task forces and their successor bodies, the regional action teams, who have worked with trusts to tackle long hours.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.6/4">By the summer of 2003 approximately &pound;31 million will have been made available to the NHS over three years, to support initiatives to help reduce junior doctors' hours and improve their living and working conditions. In addition, &pound;150 million was made available over the same three-year period to support the introduction of the new junior doctors' contract, which was designed to incentivise trusts to comply with New Deal hours and rest requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.8/1">Research carried out in 1998 by the University of Sheffield and the psychological therapies research centre, University of Leeds, suggests that the incidence of work related stress in national health service employees is in the region of 26 per cent. The causes most strongly associated with stress were, work demands; ability to influence work; lack of feedback and role conflict.</p>

More recently, we took new powers to deal with noxious substances. Sections 54 and 55 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (as amended in Section 120 of the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001) make it an offence to provide, receive or invite another to receive instruction or training in the making or use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. In addition, section 113 of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 makes it an offence to use any noxious substance or thing with the intention of causing serious harm to public or property, and section 114 creates an offence of hoaxing using alleged noxious substances.

The new system assumes a national council tax that is close to what authorities actually charged in 2002&ndash;03 plus a small extra amount for inflation so that high need, low taxbase authorities are not unfairly penalised.</p>

NASS does not have a central record of hotels used by local authorities providing housing for asylum seekers. Some people who were transferred from Sangatte are being temporarily housed in the Gatwick area.</p>

	<p pid=".324W.3/1">Immigration officers at ports of entry would normally seek to verify any address which is provided by an asylum seeker as his or her place of residence in the United Kingdom. If the asylum seeker will be staying with friends or relatives, every effort is made to contact the person concerned. In addition the friend or relative's personal details and address may be checked against Home Office records, including the Warnings Index. Similar checks are run on applicants who claim in-country.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.3/2">The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) also requires its accommodation providers to confirm in writing that an asylum seeker has arrived at accommodation which is being provided as part of a support package.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.3/3">All claimants' addresses are entered on the Case Information Database (CID) which includes a postcode check mechanism to double-check the address.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.3/4">The onus is on all claimants to notify any changes of address which will be entered on CID.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.3/5">The ability to maintain contact with all asylum seekers is a primary objective of measures in the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and through the establishment of induction, accommodation and reporting centres. Asylum seekers will be informed of their obligations to provide up-to-date address details, and to report as required, during the induction process. The Immigration Service will actively manage the contact process: through the eight designated reporting centres, by using police stations and by visiting asylum seekers at their accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.2/1">All police forces in England and Wales operate within the Health and Safety (Police) Act 1997 and must, therefore, conduct (and maintain) risk assessments into the roles of their officers. Where a risk is identified, body armour is one of the measures that should be considered. There are a variety of levels of protection which can be offered according to the perceived threat and a risk assessment will normally establish the level of protection required. The use of protective equipment is ultimately a matter for chief officers of police.</p>
	<p pid=".325W.2/2">All forces in England and Wales have access to dual-purpose body armour (knives and ballistic) either as a general or pool issue. All firearms units in England and Wales have access to overt heavy-duty body armour. In May 2002, the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch set up a database to record instances when body armour has saved an officer from death or serious injury.</p>

Steps that we are taking to help to reduce violent crime, anti-social behaviour, and fear of crime as well as youth crime would all impact on helping to reduce transport related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.6/3">The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the Commissioner for Transport for London have set up a Transport Operational Command Unit. The unit has specific responsibility for policing agreed corridors on the London bus network.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.6/4">A partnership has also been formed to fight crime on buses and coaches in England and create a safe environment for crews and passengers. The panel, entitled Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel (STOP) has brought together bus operators, unions, transport and local authorities, the police, passenger groups and officials from Government Departments, including the Home Office. It is charged with considering how to combat assaults, anti-social behaviour and vandalism on vehicles and property.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.6/5">The British Transport Police (BTP) work with Transport for London, London Underground, local police forces and other agencies to deliver a safe railway environment free from disruption and the fear of crime. The BTP also play a key role in the Secure Stations Scheme which encourages train operators, including London Underground, to improve security and gain national accreditation. London Underground has a number of its stations accredited under the scheme. Central funds amounting to &pound;1.36 million have also been provided to the BTP to support their participation in the Street Crime initiative. This will help BTP step up operations on and around transport, targeting stations and their car parks, station approaches and concourses as well as on tubes and trains.</p>

	<p pid=".327W.2/2">Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.2/3">The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides national trend information on the number of incidents of domestic violence. The BCS figures are derived from a sample and so are subject to sampling error. Moreover, the BCS is carried out by face-to-face interviews and some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.2/4">The 1996 BCS included a self-completion component on domestic violence to encourage disclosure. Results were published in Home Office Research Study No. 191; copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.2/5">The BCS defines domestic violence as all violent incidents, excluding mugging, in which the offender is a current or former partner, household member or other relative. For the 1996 self-completion module the coverage was limited to violence involving current or former partners.</p>
	<p pid=".327W.2/6">The national BCS figures are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".327W.2/16">BCS figures for west midlands are available only for 2001&ndash;02 BCS interviews as the sample size in previous BCS reports was too small to provide reliable regional results.

	<p pid=".330W.0/3">The Government welcomes the recognition by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that they must work to reduce the number of collisions involving police vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.0/4">Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, launched in December 2000, which introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations, such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect. Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off. In addition, all forces have adopted some or most of the recommendations from the 1998 Lind Report on Police Pursuit Driver Training.</p>
	<p pid=".330W.0/5">ACPO are working closely with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to identify why there appears to be an upward trend in police vehicle collisions and how this might be reversed. Useful information can be expected from the increasing use by forces of Automatic Data Recorders (ADR) and Vehicle Accident Data Recorders (VADR). These operate in a similar way to aircraft black boxes, providing data on such issues as speed, gear changes, braking, and the use of blue lights.</p>

	<p pid=".335W.2/1">We have this month published progress on the recruitment of minority ethnic officers in &quot;Race Equality-The Home Secretary's Employment Targets&quot;. Progress is measured against the 10-year employment targets published in the Dismantling Barriers document, which are intended to ensure that forces are representative of the communities which they serve by 2009. There is annual monitoring of performance. Joint Home Office and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reviews of those forces facing the biggest challenge to meet their targets are under way with the objective of agreeing action plans with the Chief Constable by <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/2">Further impetus is provided by the work of one of the sub-groups of the Lawrence Steering Group, looking at the recruitment, retention and progression of minority ethnic staff. The group is looking at current force performance, identifying and addressing any barriers to success and the identification and dissemination of good practice employment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/3">We are developing national procedures for recruitment which ensure that objective, role related criteria are used at all stages of the process. The associated information makes it clear that the police service welcomes applications from all sections of society and offers case studies of minority ethnic, mother returner and part time officers.</p>

	<p pid=".336W.2/1">Under the Police Act 1996, a police authority is responsible for ensuring an effective and efficient police force for an area. It sets an annual policing plan and a three-year strategy setting out the priorities and targets for the policing of the local area. In doing so, it must consult local people and have regard to the National Policing Plan issued by the Secretary of State. The Chief officer of police is responsible for the direction and control of the force to enforce the law and to deliver the objectives of the local policing and three-year strategy plans. Local policing policy is a matter for both the police authority and the chief officer. Operational direction and control resides with the chief officer of police. The Secretary of State, consulting where appropriate, sets strategic priorities for policing in England and Wales in the National Policing Plan. He may issue regulations, codes of practice and non-statutory guidance where he believes this to be in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of the police.</p>

	<p pid=".338W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary launched a three-year safer custody programme in April 2001 aimed at reducing deaths, self-harm and violence in prisons. The programme targets the highest risk prisoners in the highest risk locations, concentrating on six pilot sites. As part of this programme the Prison Service is considering how it can improve and strengthen investigation procedures into deaths in custody to determine not only what happened in an individual case but also how practice might be improved in future to try to prevent further deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.0/2">The Prison Service has conducted a wide-scale consultation exercise, considering a number of options (including asking Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons to conduct such inquiries) to make investigations into deaths in custody more independent. Ministers are also considering whether to give responsibility for investigating deaths in prison custody to the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the interim, the Prison Service is working to strengthen and improve the current system of investigating deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".338W.0/3">Section 5A(4) of the Prison Act 1952 permits the Home Secretary to refer specific matters connected with prisons and prisoners to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and direct her to report on them. Similarly, the Home Secretary can ask the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman to investigate and report on any prison matter.</p>

	<p pid=".339W.2/1">Information is not collected centrally on the number of court cases postponed due to late probation reports. However, I am aware that in the last eight months the Avon and Somerset probation area has had difficulty in meeting the demand of the magistrates courts for court reports</p>
	<p pid=".339W.2/2">The National Director of the National Probation Service has recently issued revised guidance on the prioritisation of work and the Chief Officer and the Probation Board of the Avon and Somerset probation area are carefully monitoring the position. Action has been taken by the Chief Officer to manage and improve the situation, including prioritising certain categories of case, redeploying some staff from other service delivery areas and recruiting and training new staff subject to budget limitations. The Probation Board reviews the probation area's performance at regular intervals and received a report on the provision of reports to court at it's meeting in January and will receive a further report on progress being made in April.</p>

	<p pid=".343W.3/1">The application of statutory planning regulations is a matter for local planning authorities in the first instance. In the case of polytunnels, where they are placed temporarily, without any permanent fixings, on agricultural land and used for horticulture, they may be deemed to be a use of land for agriculture and therefore exempt from planning controls under the provisions of section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/2">Where the erection of polytunnels is deemed to constitute 'development' under the provisions of the 1990 Act, 'permitted development rights' under part 6 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) 1995 may be available. In certain cases, these permitted development rights cannot be exercised unless an application has been made to the local planning authority for a determination as to whether their prior approval will be required for certain details relating to the siting, design and appearance of the development.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/3">In other cases where the erection of polytunnels is deemed to be 'development' and permitted development rights cannot be exercised, an application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority. The authority will determine the application in accordance with policies in the development plan, taking account of national planning policies.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/4">The Government's national planning policies on development related to agriculture, including horticulture, are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 7 (PPG 7), &quot;The Countryside&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".343W.3/5">Whether the erection of any particular polytunnel is deemed to constitute development will depend on the facts of each case. Ultimately, this is a matter for the courts who are likely to place weight on several factors that may indicate the degree of 'permanence' of the structure. These factors are reflected in the advice given in paragraph C11 of Annex C to PPG7.</p>

	<p pid=".344W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December 2002</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced that all three-year-olds will be entitled to receive a free part-time early education place from April 2004. This is six months earlier than originally planned. Currently around 70 per cent. of three-year-olds are able to access a free place.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/3">Funding for the provision of free early education places is made available to local education authorities on the basis of financial, rather than academic, years. During the 2002&ndash;03 financial year, we have made &pound;275 million of Nursery Education Grant funding available for the provision of free places for three-year-olds. Funding has been allocated to local education authorities primarily according to their position on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Index of Multiple Deprivation. East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been allocated &pound;1,353,198 to fund 1,111 places. Local education authorities are responsible for devising eligibility criteria for the distribution of free places in their area according to social need and without exceeding their allocation.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/4">At the end of the autumn term, the Department for Education and Skills reallocated Nursery Education Grant funding from authorities who were unable to use their full allocation to authorities who were able to use additional funding. East Riding of Yorkshire received anadditional &pound;283,794 as a result of this exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/5">Also, the audit of Nursery Education Grant in the East Riding of Yorkshire for 2001&ndash;02 showed that there was an underspend of &pound;198,670 which ought to be returned to Department for Education and Skills. In light of the circumstances currently faced by East Riding of Yorkshire Council, the Department for Education and Skills has exceptionally allowed them to carry over this amount to 2002&ndash;03. Therefore, East Riding of Yorkshire Council has received a total of &pound;482,464 additional funding for the spring term 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".344W.2/6">From the 2003&ndash;04 financial year, funding for the provision of free places is being transferred into Education Formula Spending as part of an overall &pound;500 million transfer of DfES grant funding into general funding. A total of &pound;319 million Nursery Education Grant funding is being transferred into the under fives sub-block. The funding for authorities such as East Riding of Yorkshire who have not yet achieved universal provision is being calculated to ensure that they have sufficient funding to provide a free place for 85 per cent. of their three year old population. 85 per cent. is the DfES planning assumption for universal provision for three-year-olds.</p>

	<p pid=".350W.5/1">Since 1998 all local education authorities (LEAs) have been under a statutory duty to provide a free part-time nursery education place for all four year olds whose parents want one. Funding for three year olds provision was made available in 1999. A PSA target was set for increasing the number of nursery places for three year olds to 66 per cent. by March 2002, this target was met in advance of the agreed date. Significant progress has been made to achieving universal provision for three year olds, currently around 70 per cent. of three year olds are able to access a free place.</p>

The remaining authorities are responsible for devising eligibility criteria for the distribution of free places in their area according to social need.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/3">The Secretary of State recently announced that all three year olds will be entitled to receive a free place from April 2004. This is six months earlier than our manifesto commitment of September 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.2/1">Specialist schools are a central part of this Government's overall framework for raising standards in secondary education in England. The Specialist Schools Programme helps schools to establish distinctive identities through their chosen specialisms and achieve their targets to raise standards. Besides their specialist work, specialist schools are working to raise levels of achievement across the curriculum and collaborating with other schools and the wider community for the benefit of all pupils. We are challenging schools to deliver high quality plans and targets that drive improvement, whether they are new entrants to the scheme or seeking to renew their status.</p>

	<p pid=".353W.2/3">We maintain our commitment to ensuring that during their period of compulsory education, all young people should follow a broad and balanced programme. We intend to introduce greater flexibility and choice in the Key Stage 4 curriculum so that schools can offer programmes that better meet young people's individual needs and strengths, whilst ensuring they acquire the core of general learning and experience essential to later learning and employment.</p>
	<p pid=".353W.2/4">We have announced a Working Group, to be chaired by Mr. Mike Tomlinson, to advise us on three key areas of long term work: the need for a much stronger vocational offer; the requirement for more manageable assessment, which recognises all of a young person's achievements; and the aim of broadening choice and stretching students, with a unified framework of qualifications designed to provide opportunities for young people of all abilities.</p>
