	<p pid="e.338W.2/1">A cross-Department energy from waste (EfW) project led by DEFRA and the Department of Energy and Climate Change was established last year. The overarching aim of the project is to consider the role of EfW in waste management and renewable energy generation. As part of that, the project is considering the current state of the EfW market, the relationship between EfW technologies and feedstock choice, the contribution EfW can make to the green economy and how best to communicate EfW policy. We intend to bring forward policy proposals towards the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.338W.2/2">It is the responsibility of local authorities not central Government to decide how waste is best managed in their respective areas. Local authorities need to be free to adopt such technologies as part of an integrated waste management solution if they deem it appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="e.341W.0/1">The Government Equalities Office has arranged for the following documents and information to be published in Welsh: Equality Bill:</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/2">Framework for a Fairer Future; Equality Bill Consultation (Age)-Easy read; and Public Appointments cards.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/3">The Government Equalities Office has also arranged for the Forced Marriage fact sheet in Urdu and Arabic; and the Female Genital Mutilation fact sheet in Somali.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/4">The translations were produced in the appropriate language because the documents provide advice or policy statements that could have a bearing on those people whose first language is not English. The estimate cost of the above translations is &#163;19,251.24.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/5">The Women's National Commission (WNC) has arranged for documents to be published in Welsh at the request of WNC partners as part of our regular outreach activities. In September-October 2007, two Welsh events were held which required the translation of some documents for use on the day. This work amounted to &#163;69.45 in total. In February 2008, event documentation was translated into Welsh costing &#163;178.70.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/6">The Equality and Human Rights Commission uses its Welsh Language Scheme to assess the need to publish documents in the Welsh language. Publications are assessed on a case by case basis. Criteria used will include the extent to which publications are to be used by the general public and stakeholders in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/7">On average the Commission spends between &#163;120,000 and &#163;140,000 per year on all Welsh translation.</p>
	<p pid="e.341W.0/8">The Commission rarely translates its publications into other languages. This is again assessed on a case by case basis, with consideration given to the objectives of the project and needs of the target audience. For example, the Commission's recent inquiry into employment and recruitment in the meat processing industry took evidence from migrant workers who predominantly only spoke eastern European languages. Therefore additional translation of materials was undertaken. The cost of this translation was less than &#163;5,000 in total.</p>

	<p pid="e.342W.6/1">Armed Forces Day is an annual opportunity for the nation to show their support for the men and women of the armed forces community: from currently serving troops to service families; and from ex-service personnel to cadets. This year the national event will take place in Cardiff and will begin with a parade from Cardiff castle to the millennium centre followed by many other events, including: a drumhead service; a fly past from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Red Arrows; a Campaign Reunion centre; displays and exhibitions from the Royal Marines Commando display team; as well as many non-military, family orientated activities, culminating with a firework display in Cardiff Bay.</p>

Retail flags and window stickers are available to members of the public, there will be uniform to work and uniform to school days, and a special magazine is being produced. We are also making use of the internet and are happy to be supported by platforms such as Twitter, Flickr and YouTube, among others.</p>

	<p pid="e.343W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence's Defence Health Strategy (DHS) has as one of its targets the promotion of sexual health across the armed forces. This makes an important contribution to the aim of maximising the number of personnel fit to perform the tasks required of them. Within the Surgeon General's Department (SGD), the Defence Sexual Health Working Group provides guidance and promotes a range of promotional initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="e.343W.2/2">Since August 2008, SGD has held a health promotion budget to support the DHS, and has spent a total of around &#163;80,000, &#163;45,000 in 2008-09 and &#163;35,000 in 2009-10, on provision of condom machines in service clubs and messes, as well as on individual packages of condoms for distribution throughout the armed forces. Further campaigns may have been funded by the single services, or even more locally at unit level, but expenditure in these areas is not readily available and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

This new capability marks a further step forward in the support to our armed forces and will ensure the best possible care and management is provided to our wounded, sick and injured personnel.</p>
	<p pid="e.344W.0/2">The MOD has committed &#163;30 million over the next four years to manage and deliver the Army Recovery Capability in partnership with the Royal British Legion and Help for Heroes, who have both generously committed &#163;20 million towards the operational and build costs.</p>
	<p pid="e.344W.0/3">The Army Recovery Capability will bring together a range of separate services, such as the NHS, the charitable sector and other Government Departments, into a single coherent programme and will either return individuals to duty or prepare them for civilian life, however long that takes. For those who leave the armed forces, it will provide the right training, civilian employment advice and work placements.</p>
	<p pid="e.344W.0/4">A key element of the concept is the provision of purpose built centres. These will build on the experiences of the Pathfinder Centre that was established in Edinburgh on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-17">17 August 2009</phrase>. It is currently envisaged that there will be four centres, in Colchester, Catterick, Tidworth/Bulford and in Edinburgh. They will be located near or in Army garrisons to allow personnel the use of Army facilities and support from the Army. Members of all three services will be able to access them.</p>

The impact on any specific equipment projects, including the Astute programme, will be announced in due course. Furthermore, the Astute programme is currently being re-baselined, so the delivery timetable can only be confirmed once detailed joint planning and cost analysis work has been completed.</p>

	<p pid="e.357W.3/1">Government Hospitality (GH) in Protocol Directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has responsibility for the management of the stock in the Government wine cellar. Apart from beverage wines that are bought on an ad hoc basis, GH usually buys new stock on two or three occasions each year, as advised by the GH Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine. GH buys wines young, when first available in the retail market and relatively less expensive, and stores them until they are ready to use. It purchases throughout the year according to its requirements, market rates, availability and value for money. Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</phrase> Government Hospitality has spent &#163;17,698 on new stock for the cellar. None of these wines has yet been used.</p>
	<p pid="e.357W.3/2">Careful management of the Government wine cellar enables GH to provide wine for high profile events at significantly below the current market rate, making substantial savings for the taxpayer. Government Hospitality is also able to recoup money from other Government Departments for events it manages on their behalf, helping to offset the costs of new stock. In financial year 2009-10 GH was able to reclaim &#163;47,000 of the total annual expenditure on the cellar of &#163;80,662. This was itself a reduction on the 2008-09 figure of over 30%.</p>

	<p pid="e.359W.5/1">It is difficult to provide a precise figure for the number of fans that will travel to South Africa for the World Cup. It is likely to be in the tens of thousands. We anticipate this number will be bolstered by last-minute bookings if England reach the later stages of the tournament.</p>
	<p pid="e.359W.5/2">The safety and welfare of British nationals is our paramount concern. We launched the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 'Be on the Ball' travel safety campaign in November 2009. This campaign's objective is to provide clear, concise travel advice and tips to travelling fans and to inform them what consular staff can and cannot do to help them. We have also encouraged fans to visit our webpage</p>
	<p pid="e.359W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/worldcup">www.fco.gov.uk/worldcup</a></p>
	<p pid="e.359W.5/4">This provides further information ranging from advice on the rules of the road and crime avoidance to what to do on match days.</p>
	<p pid="e.359W.5/5">Since October 2009 a dedicated football liaison officer at the British high commission in Pretoria has been working closely with the South African authorities, the Football Association, supporters groups and the UK police to ensure that arrangements are in place to help visiting fans. The consular network in South Africa has been reinforced with additional staff from the region to deal with an expected increase in consular cases, such as lost passports and victims of traffic accidents or crime. A mobile consular team will travel to each of the venues that England will play in, to enable staff to respond quickly as issues arise.</p>
	<p pid="e.359W.5/6">While we expect the majority of problems to be routine, we are also prepared to respond in the event of a larger incident. Our high commission in Pretoria and the consulate general in Cape Town took part in a World Cup specific exercise in February that tested their preparedness to respond to a major incident. We also have on stand-by in London a rapid deployment team of specially trained staff who can be sent out to South Africa quickly, to reinforce the response capability of our team on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="e.360W.5/1">We understand the particular reverence the people of Thailand have for the monarchy. The Government attach importance to freedom of expression and the respect of fundamental human rights. It should be possible to discuss political reform without fear of coming under the purview of laws that were designed for non political purposes. Human rights groups continue to raise concerns about the use of the 2007 Computer Crimes Act to interfere with the internet on grounds of national security, which has been deemed to include criticism of the monarchy. A significant number of websites were also blocked during recent political unrest under the provisions of the State of Emergency. Our ambassador in Bangkok has raised the issue of freedom of expression a number of times with the Thai authorities. We welcome statements by the Thai Prime Minister that l&#232;se majest&#233; laws should not be used inappropriately.</p>

	<p pid="e.361W.0/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reasons the upper earnings limit for Child Support Agency assessments has not been uprated since its introduction; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/5" class="indent">The upper limit for the statutory child maintenance schemes is a net weekly income of &#163;2,000 per week. It was set at a level sufficiently high to ensure that all children benefit from a reasonable level of maintenance and only those who are already likely to have more complicated financial arrangements are affected. In these cases, the courts are able to make a top-up of maintenance order. This is an important safeguard to ensure that children continue to share in the living standards of non-resident parents when the non-resident parent's income exceeds the upper limit.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/6" class="indent">Whilst inflation has meant that a greater number of non-resident parents earn more than the upper earnings limit, their number is still very small and it has therefore not been thought necessary to amend legislation.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/7" class="indent">As a consequence of moving from net to gross weekly income in the future scheme we propose that the maximum amount of weekly income taken into account in a maintenance calculation will increase to &#163;3,000. This is broadly the same as the current cap in net income terms and in keeping with the objective that there should not be major differences in liabilities when comparing current scheme and future scheme rules.</p>
	<p pid="e.361W.0/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="e.365W.9/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 places a duty on providers of services in the public sector [as well as those in the private and voluntary sectors] to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, which includes deaf children and the duty to make reasonable adjustments has been carried forward in the Equality Act. My Department is working with the Government Equalities Office to ensure that service providers are provided with appropriate advice and guidance on how to fulfil their duties under the Equality Act when it is implemented</p>
	<p pid="e.365W.9/2">The Disability Equality Duty (DED) requires public authorities to have due regard to disability issues when carrying out their functions and delivering their services. The DED applies across the full range of public sector activity and it means that public authorities should consider the impact of their work on disabled people, and take action to promote equality.</p>

	<p pid="e.366W.2/1">We strongly believe that the welfare state should combine rights with responsibilities. All benefits have basic entitlement conditions (for example, recipients of jobseeker's allowance have to be available to take up full-time work immediately). Those receiving income support or employment and support allowance who are able to prepare for work or make themselves more work-ready are expected to do so as a condition of receiving benefit.</p>
	<p pid="e.366W.2/2">Where the customer fails to satisfy the conditions for receiving benefit a Jobcentre Plus Decision Maker will consider whether a sanction is appropriate. The decision maker is impartial and considers evidence from both the adviser and the customer set against regulations, case law and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="e.366W.2/3">Sanctions are only applied to the individual's personal benefit entitlement-additions for a spouse or partner and premiums for disabled children are not affected; nor is entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit. Child tax credits are unaffected by any sanction. Jobseekers in vulnerable groups who are sanctioned may be entitled to hardship payments, where their jobseeker's allowance is paid at a reduced rate. Vulnerable groups include households where there is a dependent child who may be affected by the imposition of a sanction.</p>

	<p pid="e.387W.2/1">We need to increase the number of successful rape prosecutions and send more rapists to jail. The current conviction rate in cases of rape proceeded against in court stands at 38%.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.2/2">As we have made clear, the victim in rape cases remains our priority and we welcome many of the improvements introduced by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in recent years, intended to improve both victim care and the number of cases reaching court. These include specially trained officers and prosecutors, dedicated rape units within police force areas and investment in Sexual Assault Referral Centres for the improved collection of forensic evidence and provision of immediate crisis and medial care to victims.</p>
	<p pid="e.387W.2/3">It is important, however, that victims have access to longer term support and we have therefore committed to providing sustainable support for rape crisis centres.</p>

The Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships, in particular advanced apprenticeships, to meet the needs of employers in an advanced modern economy. We know also that the demand from young people and adults for good quality employer-owned apprenticeships is high. The Government's decision to redeploy &#163;150 million of Train to Gain funds for 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality skills. Apprenticeships are founded on partnerships so it is important that employers, including those in manufacturing and engineering, take up these new opportunities and offer apprenticeship places to secure a new generation of highly skilled employees and we will be encouraging them to do so.</p>

That would amount to the exclusion, in every case involving a bilingual jury, of about four fifths of the population of Wales.

	<p pid="e.397W.12/1">It is beneficial to victims who would otherwise have to give evidence, if defendants who are guilty plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. The main means of encouraging defendants to do so is the long-standing practice of recognising timely pleas of guilty with a reduction in sentence. It is not possible to plead guilty before the first appearance in court, but it is open to suspects to co-operate when they are interviewed by the police. It is of considerable advantage to the whole Criminal Justice System, witnesses and the taxpayer if suspects co-operate in this way. There is a case for treating those who do more favourably and it is open to the Sentencing Council to consider this.</p>

	<p pid="e.399W.2/1">Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the regulatory arm of the Law Society. The use of advertisements and other forms of publicity by solicitors is regulated by its Solicitors' Code of Conduct 2007. The Code provides that firms are generally free to advertise their services, subject to the requirements of rule 7. Rule 7 of the Code permits solicitors to publicise their firms in a number of ways-ensuring that clients and the public have appropriate information about the firm and the way it is regulated; but prohibiting misleading publicity and inappropriate approaches for business.</p>
	<p pid="e.399W.2/2">Prisoners' incoming mail is examined for illicit enclosures but is not routinely read. There are no specific rules relating to unsolicited correspondence to named prisoners from law firms advertising their services.</p>
	<p pid="e.399W.2/3">Prisons do not distribute unsolicited mail that is not addressed to a named prisoner. Advertisements from law firms are commonly carried in specialist prisoner newspapers which are made available for prisoners to pick up in communal areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.402W.6/1">Decisions to notify the police of allegations of abuse of a resident in a care home are taken locally by safeguarding adults boards, depending on the nature and severity of individual allegations. The Department does not consider it would be appropriate to introduce a requirement that all such allegations, regardless of circumstances, should be automatically referred to the police.</p>
	<p pid="e.402W.6/2">The transfer or sale of care homes by councils to independent operators is a matter for local consultation and determination. Local councils are free to decide how best to provide care services for their populations, having regard for local need and their budgets. All care homes, whether in the independent or public sectors, must be registered with and regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).</p>
	<p pid="e.402W.6/3">The Department has no plans to meet with Essex county council to discuss the findings of the Essex Safeguarding Adults Board into the performance of the Greenways Care Home in Colchester. The Department has received no other recent representations about the standard of operation by Excelcare, either nationally or at the Greenways Care Home in Colchester.</p>
	<p pid="e.402W.6/4">We are informed by CQC that 35 services operated by Excelcare, including 33 residential care and nursing homes, are registered with it. CQC meets with Excelcare regularly to discuss the quality of care services operated by the company.</p>
	<p pid="e.402W.6/5">At the most recent meeting, in late February 2010, 28 of 35 Excelcare services were rated &quot;good&quot;, five &quot;adequate&quot; and one was yet to be rated by CQC. One was rated &quot;poor&quot;. In the case of this service, CQC was content with the company's action plan for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="e.402W.6/6">The last Government commenced a review of the safeguarding guidance No Secrets. We are considering how to proceed with the review, and will ensure that the case raised by the hon. Member is taken into account. We will make further announcements with respect to No Secrets and safeguarding in due course.</p>

	<p pid="e.406W.6/1">The Government, along with many other European Union member states, support the idea of codifying existing European Court of Justice case law relating to article 56 of the treaty on the funding of the European Union. The Government's assessment of the Council of Ministers draft of the EU cross-border healthcare directive is that it delivers a number of key aims as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.6/2" class="indent">to protect the right of the home member state to decide entitlements to health care, whether locally or nationally;</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.6/3" class="indent">to ensure that member states can operate a meaningful system of prior authorisation for hospital care and other specialised care;</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.6/4" class="indent">to maintain the 'gatekeeper' function (i.e. to maintain the UK Commissioner, general practitioner and consultant determination of entitlements to treatment through the national health service); and</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.6/5" class="indent">to avoid the extension of EU competence, whether through the active text of the directive (e.g. EU-wide health care standards) or through powers delegated in the directive (e.g. legally binding measures on eHealth).</p>
	<p pid="e.406W.6/6">The Department launched a consultation on the European Commission's proposals for a directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border health care in October 2008 and published the response in April 2009. A partial impact assessment was also published in October 2008, which estimated that demand was low and therefore the cost to the NHS would be limited. Further consultation will follow when a final directive is agreed with the European Parliament.</p>

In these cases, the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy and other National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence-compliant therapies is the recommended treatment. Services for these clients is largely provided by psychology departments in specialist mental health trusts. The implementation of &quot;improving access to psychological therapies&quot; services for people in community settings with mild to moderate conditions will reduce the number of referrals to specialist mental health trusts and enable them to focus on providing services to those with severe and enduring mental illness.</p>

We are currently analysing information from strategic health authorities about the priority accorded to supporting carers by primary care trusts (PCTs). In addition, we will consider how local authority direct payments and personal budgets can be used in ways that enable both carers and the people that they care for to access community support, including respite.</p>
	<p pid="e.409W.3/3">It is this Government's policy to enhance freedom for local government and PCTs as much as possible by reducing the ring-fencing of monies, freeing up resources to concentrate on local priorities and the delivery of essential frontline services. However, it is important that local government and PCTs ensure that they account locally for the priorities they determine.</p>

	<p pid="e.419W.2/1">There is no prohibition on retired civil servants returning to work. Many Government Departments have chosen to operate a policy of &quot;partial retirement&quot; such that older workers may apply to restructure their jobs so that they are drawing pension and a reduced salary. This enables Departments to retain skills and enables staff to extend working lives by moving gradually into retirement.</p>
	<p pid="e.419W.2/2">To protect public funds, the civil service pension scheme operates a policy of &quot;abatement&quot;. This means that, where people are receiving both a civil service pension and pay in respect of a contract of service, their pension will be reduced so that the total of pension and pay does not exceed the pay they were receiving before drawing their pension.</p>

We have committed to extend disclosure to the rest of the senior civil service and to those paid by non-departmental public bodies at rates in excess of the minimum applicable to the senior civil service. These disclosures include non-executives and similar appointments.</p>
