	<p pid="a.567W.6/1">We want to give lone parents the opportunity to plan a better future for themselves and their children and we know that child care availability is of vital importance to lone parents returning to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.6/2">In June 2007 the stock of registered child care stood at over 1.28 million places, which is more than double the 1997 total, and the aim of the Government's national child care strategy for England is that by 2010 there will be a child care place for all children aged between three and 14, between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm each weekday, all year round. By that date there will be over two million sustainable child care places for children up to the age of 14. The strategy is given legislative underpinning by the Childcare Act 2006 which requires local authorities in England and Wales to secure child care to meet the needs of working parents in their areas. The Scottish Executive have committed to extending access to child care that meets the needs of working parents even though the legislative requirements of the Childcare Act do not apply there.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.6/3">Every Jobcentre Plus district has a child care partnership manager (CPM), with additional resource in new deal plus for lone parent pilot areas. CPMs have a key role to play in helping to improve access to child care and overcome child care barriers to work for unemployed parents and a fundamental part of this is gathering intelligence about the local child care market and customer needs, and using it to ensure that key issues for disadvantaged parents seeking to move into work are addressed within local child care provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.6/4">Action is under way within Jobcentre Plus to ensure that all parents, not just lone parents, are routinely informed about formal child care and its benefits by Jobcentre Plus Advisers and signposted to further help and information, for example, from Children's Information Services.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.2/1">The principles of the basic maintenance formula under the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (C-MEC) will be based on the structure of the simpler formula introduced in 2003 with percentage rates based on the non-resident parent's income and number of qualifying children. The percentage rates strike the right balance between the needs of the child and the other expenses that non-resident parents have to meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/2">A reduction in the amount of child maintenance otherwise payable will continue to apply where the non-resident parent shares the care of a qualifying child for 52 or more nights a year. The Government have no plans to take account of daytime care. Childcare costs incurred by a working parent are recognised in housing benefit, council tax benefit and working tax credit.</p>

Generally, severely disabled people need help for their additional costs, which may include extra heating, all year round and not just in the winter months. Help is available for severely disabled people through the care and mobility components in disability living allowance and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits which have a substantially higher annual value than the winter fuel payment and are spread over a 52-week period.

Plans aim for the continuation of everyday activities as far as practicable, including the availability of sick pay and state benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.0/2">Appropriate changes to sickness certification, which balance the interests of patients, employers and the NHS, will be introduced as and when necessary to help achieve that aim. During an influenza pandemic, DWP will aim to continue services that support people into work, but will give priority to maintaining financial support. Customer payments, which are largely automated, will continue to be paid. DWP and HMRC have robust business continuity plans in place to ensure that the administration and key services that support these payments can be maintained during a pandemic.</p>

The decision was made in December 2006 to exercise this option and the lease arrangement will now expire in 2013.

	<p pid="a.601W.5/1">The development of measures to reduce the amount of traffic generated by the school run does not fall neatly into boxes that enable us to say what proportion of the Department's spending has been devoted to these in each of the last five years. This is because, in addition to the expenditure on centrally managed programmes, a considerable amount of expenditure is committed by local highway authorities that receive funding from the Department through the Local Transport Plan (LTP) settlement and determine their own priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.5/2">The Mayor of London also receives funding from the Department via a total transport grant through Transport for London (TfL) and bus operators receive Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) which makes bus services cheaper. The DfT integrated block element of the LTP settlement was worth &pound;547 million in 2006-07, while TfL received &pound;2.4 billion and bus service operators received &pound;380 million in BSOG.</p>
	<p pid="a.601W.5/3">In addition we can, however, identify the amount of funding allocated for regional and local authority school travel advisers through the &quot;Travelling to School&quot; project, for 'Links to Schools' and for other initiatives such as 'Bike It' that promote and support cycling to school. (Prior to April 2004, the Department awarded a number of bursaries to local authorities to enable them to employ school travel plan co-ordinators rather than school travel advisers.) The levels of expenditure in each of the last five years are shown as follows:</p>

At that time, the Severn Crossings will revert to the ownership of Government. There are no plans to terminate the concession agreement in advance of this. Current estimates are that ownership of the Crossings will revert to Government in 2016.</p>

Its funds enable local authorities to employ a network of around 250 school travel advisers and regional school travel advisers to work with schools to help them develop and implement school travel plans. Over 14,000 schools have already developed travel plans. It also supports capital grants for schools with travel plans which can be spent on, for example, cycle facilities.</p>

Through Cycling England, we are investing &pound;1.8 million this year alone in cycle training via local authorities and the Youth Sports Trust. We have also provided &pound;16.2 million for the 'Links to Schools' programme and &pound;1.6 million for the 'Bike It' scheme which works with schools to increase the number of young people cycling.

	<p pid="a.609W.3/2">No studies have ever been conducted by VLA in which cattle were fed with BSE infected material.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.3/3">Seven individual experiments have been conducted at VLA that involved the oral dosing of cattle with bovine brain tissue known to be infected with the BSE agent. The material, in the form of a suspension, was administered directly on to the back of the tongue with a syringe. These studies represent three clusters of experiments, with individual experiments within each cluster being related in terms of the objectives of the investigations conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.3/4">Two experiments investigated the susceptibility of calves to oral challenge to different doses of brain tissue, ranging from 300g to 1mg. A correlation was recognised between dose and the incubation period, but infection was achieved at all dose levels. Below a dose of 100g however, not all exposed calves became infected, and the efficiency of transmission declined with reducing dose. Although incomplete, data from these studies were published recently<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.3/5">Three other experiments investigated the pathogenesis of BSE in cattle, although the latest, and largest, was primarily intended to provide tissues and fluids at varying time points in the incubation period to enable the evaluation of diagnostic tests. These studies involved the sequential slaughter of cattle, and collection of tissues, during the incubation period, from shortly after exposure to the point of clinical disease. There have been several publications that have described the scientific outcomes of the first pathogenesis study, but the most recent<sup>(2)</sup> summarises all previous results. Additional data from a smaller study, and an opportunistic evaluation of data from the largest pathogenesis study, have also been published recently<sup>(3, 4, 5)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.609W.3/6">The last two experiments were established to enable the collection of fluids, such as blood samples, during the course of the incubation period to enable their investigation as potential targets for diagnosis of BSE before onset of clinical disease. These transpired to be negative studies, not only in terms of tests investigated at VLA but also when materials were shared with other researchers. As a result, there have been no scientific publications related to these studies.</p>

	<p pid="a.613W.2/2">There are currently 1,140 cattle herds in Gloucestershire. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September</phrase>, 249 herds (17.3 per cent.) of herds in the county were under TB movement restrictions.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.613W.2/3">We recognise that the level of bovine TB (bTB) in cattle in Gloucestershire and across Great Britain is unacceptably high, and that some areas of the country are becoming more affected. In line with the 'GB Strategic Framework for the Control of Bovine TB', we are tailoring our policies to take account of the regional variation of disease risk as well as reflecting emerging evidence. Working on these principles, we have introduced measures such as pre-movement testing for cattle moving out of high risk herds. We have also extended the use of the gamma interferon blood test (alongside the TB skin test) to improve the sensitivity of our testing regime and identify more infected animals more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.2/4">We will continue to work in partnership with interested parties to embed and monitor these measures. We have also recently developed revised TB husbandry guidance in association with the Bovine TB Husbandry Working Group, and published two free guidance booklets for farmers, to help them prevent bTB in their herds.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.2/5">Looking ahead, DEFRA funds a wide-ranging bTB research programme and we will continue to use emerging evidence to inform our policies for the future. In June, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB published its final report which adds to the scientific evidence base. We are now considering carefully the issues raised in the report and we will work with farmers, Government advisers and scientific experts in reaching final policy decisions on these.</p>

	<p pid="a.621W.2/2">As part of the Government's Climate Change programme, a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will be introduced in 2008. It will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5 per cent. of their fuel sales are from a renewable source by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.2/3">It is unlikely that the RTFO has had any discernable effect on crop prices to date. Current high cereals prices are due to global factors, including two successive lower world wheat harvests, low global stocks and increased demand for cereals from the food, feed and fuels sectors. Growing global demand for biofuels can be expected to increase crop prices but also the supply of crops in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.2/4">Analysis by the European Commission assessing the impact of the 10 per cent. (by energy) biofuel target for 2020 indicates that prices for agricultural raw materials in the European Union (EU) would increase by 3 per cent. to 6 per cent. for cereals and 5 per cent. to 18 per cent. for oilseeds. This took into account, potential in the EU to increase production in response to additional demand, and a future contribution from second generation biofuels which can use non-food feedstocks, including waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.2/5">The Government recognise that a balance is needed between using available land for food and non-food purposes. We will monitor how markets are affected by growing biofuel demand and will tailor policies accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.5/1">The Government has funded a number of research projects into the possible effects in humans of exposure to organophosphates (OPs), in particular OP based sheep dips. This research forms a key part of the Government's four point plan on OPs announced in December 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/2">The research was commissioned following the 1999 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) report entitled &quot;Organophosphates&quot; in which five recommendations for further research were made. The Government have asked COT</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;to advise on whether prolonged or repeated low level exposure to OPs, or acute exposure to OPs at a lower dose than causing frank intoxication, can cause chronic ill-health effects&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/4">In addition, Government R and D funds have also been used to commission several other projects on OPs and human health.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/5">On genetic susceptibility, COT recommended that research should be undertaken to show whether people with chronic disabling illness that is suspected of being related to OPs differ metabolically from the general population. The project on the genetic variation in susceptibility to chronic effects of organophosphate exposure has been completed and the final report is on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website:</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr408.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrhtm/rr408.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/7">A related study entitled &quot;Genetic and other sources of variation in the activity of serum paraoxonase in humans: consequences for the risk from exposure to diazinon&quot; has been published in Pharmacogenet, Genomics, <phrase class="date" code="">2005 January</phrase>; 15(1): p51-60.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/8">COT reviewed the research arising from their recommendations along with all other Government-funded research into OPs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-04">4 September 2007</phrase>. In reviewing the above work, COT concluded that the results may have reflected genetic differences in susceptibility to ill health, but that if so, these were unlikely to be related to organophosphate toxicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/9">COT noted that, as some of the research projects commissioned as a result of their 1999 recommendations had yet to be completed, they would need to revisit the work when all the final reports have been received. COT also advised that the final review should consider the Government-funded research in the wider context of all research on OPs and human health. Once the final review is received from COT, the Government will consider this and the need for any research which might be identified as part of an integrated programme of work. Currently, there are no plans to commission any further research on genetic susceptibility to nervous disorders as a result of using organophosphate sheep dips.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/2">The Home Office Simplification Plan published in December 2006 includes a target to reduce the compliance costs arising from the regulation of animal experiments by 25 per cent. by 2010, whilst maintaining proper provision for animal welfare. Work towards the target is being taken forward in a dedicated better regulation programme. This work includes looking at how we might reduce information requirements and streamline transaction processes for applications for project licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/3">Since January 2007, we have delivered a number of quick wins involving improvements to forms and processes and we have also completed preliminary work, including consultation with practitioners, to identify potential options for longer term improvements to our regulatory processes. Amongst other things, we are now working on the development of a new, shorter project licence application form and project licence templates and worked examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/4">We have not separately estimated the costs to the scientific community associated with applications for project licences. However, an administrative burden on business, excluding the academic sector, has been identified and priced at &pound;6.95 million per annum. These costs include those arising from all aspects of regulation under the 1986 Act, including personal and project licences, certificates of designation, local ethical review processes and training.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.5/1">From the information collected centrally on recorded crime, it is not possible to identify recorded cases of domestic violence. Such offences are not specifically defined by law and details of the individual circumstances of offences are not collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/2">Data for the number of recorded instances of rape and the clear-up/detection rate for these crimes is available for the 1997 calendar year and from 1998-99 in financial years. This followed a revision to the counting rules for recorded crime and the expanded coverage which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>. The figures were also affected by the revised detections guidance issued in April 1999 which formalised detection procedures, placing a greater emphasis on the evidential basis on which detections can be claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/3">The figures were also affected by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002, which required the police to record a crime unless there was &quot;no credible evidence to the contrary&quot;. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 also altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences, including rape. All of these changes mean that detection rates are not comparable over these time period.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/4">The Home Office carried out research published in July 2007 which found that the reduction in detection rates was likely to be largely due to changes in recording practices resulting from the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard, counting rules and detections guidance ('Investigating and detecting recorded offences of rape', Home Office Online Report 18/07).</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/5">New performance management arrangements have been introduced for the police and CPS on the investigation and prosecution of rape. The Home Office and Association of Chief Police Officers are also providing operational support to police forces on the implementation of recommendations from 'Without Consent', the rape inspection published in January 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.647W.2/1">The new statutory requirements for crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), contained in the Crime and Disorder (Formulation and Implementation of Strategy) Regulations 2007, state that each CDRP must hold one or more public meeting a year which can be described as 'face the people' sessions. These regulations came into force in England on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August</phrase> and in Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.2/2">The Home Office does not intend to assess the effectiveness of CDRP public meetings or 'face the people' sessions specifically. As part of the ongoing performance support provided to CDRPs, the Home Office will continue to review the effectiveness of all CDRPs as they deliver the new statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.647W.2/3">Guidance to support partnerships hold effective public meetings is contained within the recently published &quot;Delivering Safer Communities: A guide to effective partnership working&quot;. This gives advice and examples of best practice to help partnerships on all aspects of the new requirements including a section on holding public meetings. The guidance document is available on the Crime Reduction website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.674W.3/1">The following table gives the details of focus groups and other deliberative forms of public opinion research carried out by the Ministry of Justice since January 2006, including the month of the fieldwork and the total cost of the project. The Ministry of Justice has undertaken 18 projects involving focus groups, and two projects involving other deliberative forms of public opinion research.

	<p pid="a.674W.3/2">The Department undertakes research including focus groups and deliberative research on various subjects when this is the most effective and appropriate means of building up an evidence base to support the development and delivery of policy and public services. We particularly use focus groups and deliberative research when the issues considered are complex and require a more in-depth engagement with respondents to understand their perspective and views.</p>

	<p pid="a.684W.6/1">In July my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and planning published the Housing Green Paper &quot;Homes for the Future: more affordable, more sustainable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/2" class="indent"><a href="http://wwwcommunities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homesforfuture">http://wwwcommunities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homesforfuture</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/3">The Housing Green Paper committed to delivering two million homes by 2016 and three million homes by 2020 by raising supply over time towards the 240,000 per year target in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/4">The growth by 2016 will include 100,000 new homes in 45 towns and cities that make up the 29 new growth points. We have committed to investing &pound;1.7 billion for infrastructure in the growth areas over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/5">During this parliamentary session, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has brought forward a Housing and Regeneration Bill. The Bill received its Second Reading in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase>. It will create the new Homes and Communities Agency which will deliver more social and affordable housing, promote regeneration and facilitate the establishment of sustainable communities. The Agency will work with local authorities, housing associations and private developers to provide the housing and related infrastructure required. The Bill will also establish a new social housing regulator&mdash;the Office for Tenants and Social Landlords&mdash;which will drive up the quality of social housing provision by setting standards for housing associations, backed up by new intervention powers to secure improvements where landlords are failing.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/6">We are also providing at least &pound;8 billion over the next three years to invest in affordable housing&mdash;initially through the Housing Corporation and then through the new Homes and Community Agency. This new investment which is an increase of 50 per cent. compared to the previous three years will help to deliver 70,000 affordable homes a year by 2010/11 of which 45,000 will be for social rent. The Housing and Regeneration Bill will also make changes to the housing revenue account subsidy system to enable local authorities to keep rental income from new homes to incentivise them to build where it is shown to provide value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/7">Due to the positive response from local authorities and developers following the Green Paper we have increased the number of ecotowns schemes, by 2020 from five to 10. The entire community will be designed to reach zero carbon standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/8">We have also announced around &pound;l billion for Housing Market Renewal pathfinder areas. The investment is aimed to continue to help develop practical solutions to address housing market weakness and tackle high vacancy rates, high population turnover, low demand for social rented housing and low sales value.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/9">The Housing Green Paper reaffirmed the Government's commitment to ensuring both councils and housing associations maintain their focus on improving the quality of their existing accommodation and delivering decent homes. We also committed to at least &pound;2 billion investment in the Arms Length Management Organisation programme over the next spending period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.6/10">We are also making some &pound;10.2 billion available over the years 2008-11 through the regional housing pot. This is a very significant increase on the funding for the previous three years which totalled some &pound;7.8billion. The funding will underpin our commitment to decent homes and increasing the supply of affordable housing.</p>

For the Housing Corporation it will be a minimum requirement to build to Code Level 3 for the forthcoming 2008-11 Affordable Housing Programme. This ensures that Government-funded housing is leading the way in the drive towards sustainable housing. The energy requirements within Code Level 3 will become part of the Building Regulations in 2010.</p>

Following his meeting with Prime Minister Erdogan in October, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear the importance of seizing the election free window of opportunity for progress towards a settlement in 2008. In addition, we continue to urge both sides to show the flexibility necessary for the technical committees and working groups envisaged under this agreement to begin work, and to prepare the ground for folly fledged settlement negotiations as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.699W.8/1">The Government have not estimated the number of properties that have been built or which are under construction in northern Cyprus. However, property development in northern Cyprus has clearly accelerated since the rejection of the Annan plan, resulting in large numbers of new properties being built. The Government are concerned at the scale of such construction on Greek Cypriot owned land in northern Cyprus. Our high commission in Nicosia regularly raises the issue of property development with the Turkish Cypriot leadership. We believe that the difficult and complex issue of property is only likely to be fully resolved in the context of a comprehensive settlement and we urge both sides to engage constructively with the United Nations to enable settlement negotiations to start as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.699W.8/2">In our contacts with the Turkish Cypriot leadership, we recognise the Turkish Cypriots' need for economic development in support of reunification. But we urge them to ensure that any property development which does take place does so in a manner that is both environmentally sustainable and does not complicate an eventual solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.2/1">The Government have not made such an assessment. The history of the EU demonstrates the power of trade to promote economic prosperity and political reconciliation. The preliminary findings of the World Bank report from 2006 on the economy in northern Cyprus, were that the external constraints on access to EU markets for the Turkish Cypriot community were one of the two biggest constraints to economic development in northern Cyprus. I would endorse the conclusion that the long-term welfare of all Cypriots is in jeopardy if steps are not taken to ensure the convergence of living standards on the island. That is why we remain committed to supporting the Turkish Cypriots and the EU Commission in economic and regulatory reform, particularly through the aid regulation, and to supporting the EU presidency in its efforts to find a way for the Turkish Cypriots to trade directly with the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.11/1">Turkish Cypriots are European citizens. Our preferred means to enfranchise them would be a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem that enables them to elect representatives to the European Parliament in the normal way. We are making every possible effort to secure that outcome. Absent of a settlement, we welcome interest shown by Turkish Cypriots in the European Parliament; and by European parliamentarians in the Turkish Cypriot community&mdash;not least as oversight and encouragement of disbursement under the Aid Regulation by the Commission. It is for the Parliament to decide precisely what mechanisms to employ. But we will urge the Council to support any such initiatives, as complementing its own efforts to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to Europe, underlining what the two communities have in common, and help reunify the island.</p>

We believe that lifting the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, and bringing them closer to the EU, will help to build economic and cultural links between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and will make a future settlement less costly to accommodate.

	<p pid="a.707W.6/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that their local residents and people seeking services within their area are aware of the range of national health service services available. NHS dental services are a mainstream NHS service. Any United Kingdom resident (or visiting European Union resident under reciprocal arrangements) who is eligible for NHS care is therefore eligible for NHS dental services. PCTs methods of promoting NHS dental services range from leaflets to targeted local advertising campaigns. Most also run dental help lines providing advice on how to access services locally. The location and other details of NHS dental practices can be accessed nationally via NHS Direct and NHS Choices or from the local PCT, often through their Patient Advisory and Liaison Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.6/2">The Department works with the local NHS continually to improve patient communication. Improving the range and depth of information available via NHS Choices (previously NHS.UK) is one part of this ongoing work. The NHS Choices website is currently being enhanced to include a central contact number for each PCT through which potential patients can access information about the availability of services in their chosen area, in addition to the existing dental query helpline and out of hours contact numbers. We expect this improvement to the existing service to be available later this year, and further improvements will follow next year. The site can be accessed at:</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/homepage.asp">www.nhs.uk/Pages/homepage.asp</a>x</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.6/4">For those unable to access the information in this way the information is more widely accessible through computerised information systems in Libraries and other communal places. It is also anticipated that PCTs will continue to promote the availability of and entitlement to services in more traditional ways, using literature placed in other primary care premises e.g. general practitioners and pharmacies, in libraries and in Yellow Pages wherever possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.716W.8/14">As part of the process to address the challenges in audiology services the Department, working with key stakeholders, developed the national audiology framework, 'Improving Access to Audiology Services in England', which was published in March 2007. Since the publication of the framework a number of key steps have already been implemented; we have improved the data on audiology by collecting monthly data of all audiology assessments together with a quarterly census of waits for all diagnostic tests, including audiology. We are also currently piloting the collection of referral to treatment times for all direct access referrals into audiology. A good practice guide was published in June 2007 that includes model pathways for the delivery of care. An audiology advisory board has been created to support the implementation and to review progress on the key deliverables. Progress has been made on testing the new assess-and-fit technology which enables a hearing aid to be fitted on the same day as assessment. Work has also begun on the Audiology Transformation Project, which is aimed at ensuring the good practice guidance can be fully implemented and the potential gains in capacity realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.8/15">The strategic health authorities have provided assurance that their activity plans for 2007-08 aim to deliver the six-week maximum wait for all diagnostic tests, including audiology assessments, by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.8/16">With regard to the local position, a new joint &pound;3 million investment from Wakefield District PCT and Kirklees PCT has enabled the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust to cut the waiting times for digital hearing aid assessment to six weeks. The investment has been used to fund additional staff for extra clinics at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust and also to offer further services in the community. This means that more patients are being seen, and are having their digital hearing aids fitted as soon as possible, with the majority of patients having aids fitted within 12 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.5/3">Pre-launch (NHS Choices was launched in June 2007) a series of workshops were conducted with members of the public, general practitioners (GPs), health service workers, voluntary and public sector intermediaries designed to test the service vision. NHS Choices also carried out tactical 'scorecard' and 'naming' research among groups of C2DE internet users.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/4">Post Launch, three learning forums have been used to test the live site, site propositions and design and content prototypes with groups of internet users; drawn from all ages, genders and ethnic groups. Each session comprises of four groups; and lessons from these groups have been feeding into service development for subsequent releases.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/5">A representative survey of GP in practices in England has also been conducted in order to benchmark awareness and usage of the site, provide a broad site evaluation and test various service propositions. In addition, qualitative research has been used with GPs to understand in greater detail their engagement as clinicians with the site and again to test further developed service propositions.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/6">To engage with the national health service staff 10 road shows have been conducted across the country. This engaged more than 500 NHS staff from trusts, to primary care trust and practice managers.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/7">Product development has also involved a high level of engagement. The site's new GP profiles are designed around a three-year research programme by Manchester university, a pilot by the National Programme for Information Technology and extensive negotiations with the British Medical Association, Royal College of GPs and other professional bodies. New services, piloted across the country are also being evaluated with users, such as the qualitative research in Derby with young people to inform smoking cessation and physical health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/8">Further qualitative research is planned with young mothers and with those with long-term health conditions and their carers to specifically test proposed products such as NHS LifeCheck and condition pathways. NHS Choices' customer insight team are also about to conduct an on-line survey with GPs to further test 'score-card' content and GP service engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/9">NHS Choices will soon be scheduling on-line surveys with public users (some of whom with long-term health conditions) and continuing to provide qualitative or quantitative research to address product development needs. A nationwide survey of pharmacists will be conducted in the near future to benchmark their awareness and usage of the service as well as their broader evaluation of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/10">The Department is also carrying out a nationwide quantitative survey by Central Office of Information and Market and Opinion Research International benchmarking usage awareness of the service among the public as well as health information and service behaviours via the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.726W.5/11">NHS Choices has also worked with the Royal National Institute of the Blind to carry out an accessibility assessment on the site.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/12">We have provided funding through a variety of mechanisms, including programme grants to the Fairtrade Foundation and other fair-trade organisations such as the Co-operative College, and the Development Awareness Fund. Though all recipients of the above grants are UK-based, a number of them work with international organisations. For example, the Fairtrade Foundation works closely with the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation International. As a result, some funding reaches non-UK based NGOs, though the specific amounts may not be detailed in project proposals.</p>
