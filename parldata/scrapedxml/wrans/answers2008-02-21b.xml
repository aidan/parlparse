	<p pid="b.821W.6/1">In 2002-03, 21 per cent. of people responding to the British Crime Survey perceived high levels of antisocial behaviour (ASB) compared with 17 per cent. in the year up to September 2007. The Local Government User Satisfaction Survey which asked similar questions to the British Crime Survey in 2003-04 and again in 2006-07 showed a reduction in perception in 94 per cent. of areas. This reduction in perception has contributed to the Home Office meeting its PSA target on confidence and reassurance for 2005-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.6/2">The Home Office's twin track approach of enforcement and support has been shown to be effective by the National Audit Office's 2006 on antisocial Behaviour. The report concluded that the majority of people who received an ASB intervention did not re-engage in ASB.</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.9/1">The Home Office has always maintained that antisocial behaviour is not specifically a 'youth' issue&mdash;the vast majority of young people behave well and make a positive contribution to society.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.9/2">There is a range of tools and powers that have been in place for some time which can be employed when young people engage in crime and antisocial behaviour. Warning letters, acceptable behaviour contracts and individual support orders alongside antisocial behaviour orders specifically tackle behaviour. While parenting orders and contracts prevent problems in their child's behaviour and steer them away from becoming involved in antisocial and offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.9/3">The Government are putting even greater emphasis on ensuring that when young people engage in antisocial behaviour they receive the right balance of support, challenge and positive activities to help them change their behaviour and fulfil their potential, contribute to communities and avoid getting into further trouble. As part of this the work, the Youth Task Force will support the delivery of these services. This will be set out in the 'Youth Task Force Action Plan' to be published in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.9/4">We are also developing a renewed cross-Government approach to youth crime with the Department for Children Schools and Families and the Ministry of Justice. This work will result in a 'Youth Crime Action Plan' to deliver results across youth crime prevention, youth justice as well as cross cutting themes on youth victimisation and serious youth violence.</p>

The prospect of further UN sanctions, as advocated by the UK, combined with persuasion by the UN Secretary-General and others, played a part in the Government of Sudan agreeing to the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur in 2007. Currently, the UN Security Council is not actively considering sanctions but rather is focused on securing successful implementation of resolution 1769 on Darfur. But we continue to advocate in the Council that we must combine pressure and persuasion on all parties to make rapid progress in resolving the crisis. We are also making this point bilaterally, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister did with Chinese Premier Wen in January.</p>

	<p pid="b.832W.5/1">I can confirm that a fire destroyed Tristan da Cunha's fish-processing factory on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase>. The generators that provided the island's power were also destroyed. The cause of the fire has not been identified. Power is now being supplied from a back-up generator, until a new generator can be delivered to the island in March 2008. The hospital has 24 hour power.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.5/2">Tristan da Cunha's financial self-sufficiency depends on revenue from its fishing industry. Tristan's fishing season is ending so the immediate impact on the island's economy is minimal. But the island's Administrator is working with Ovenstone, the company that runs the lobster fishing concession, supplies the island's electricity and owns the factory, to minimise the economic impact of the fire. The main concern is to maintain the revenue that the industry generates for the island and to minimise potential loss of earnings for those employed in the sector. Ovenstone are preparing contingency plans for the next fishing season, which begins in July 2008. Ovenstone has insurance cover in the event of fire and is already making plans to replace the island's power plant and build a new lobster-processing factory.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.5/3">In addition, the Department for International Development has recently commissioned a review of options for Tristan to diversify its economy and increase its revenue.</p>

	<p pid="b.833W.12/2">The Inter-departmental Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence, on which I sit, monitors action on the National Domestic Violence Plan, which includes the delivery of support to victims and their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/3">A lot has been done to increase the support available for families affected by domestic violence:</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/4">Last year, the Home Office allocated just under &pound;6 million to tackle domestic violence including &pound;2 million to support and improve local delivery on domestic violence for victims and their children. It also funded for improved public protection arrangements for domestic violence victims and a matrix of help lines to provide advice and support to victims and their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/5">The Ministry of Justice allocated &pound;3 million for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers whose aim is the safety and support of victims and their children. This is in addition to annual court business costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/6">The Every Child Matters: Change for Children programme aims to improve the welfare of all children by putting in place arrangements for earlier and more effective assessment and intervention for vulnerable children, such as those affected by domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/7">The Department for Communities and Local Government has developed a range of accommodation options for victims including Sanctuary Scheme guidance, and 61 million of Supporting People funds were used by local authorities in 2006-07 to provide housing related support for victims of domestic violence and their families. Guidance for Jobcentre Plus staff provides advice about domestic violence and its potential impact on victims, explains the sorts of support they may need and provides advice on taking account of their particular circumstances when dealing with a benefit application. The guidance also has contact details of a range of organisations which provide advice and support to domestic violence victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/8">Financial support in respect of children, such as child benefit and child tax credits, is paid to the person who is responsible for those children and is often already paid directly to mothers. Where there is any family breakdown, the benefits will, where necessary, normally be transferred to the person with whom the children are living.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.12/9">Domestic violence tears apart families and always affects children. The Government recognise the strong links between child protection concerns and domestic violence. Victims leaving a violent relationship will often need a range of financial and practical support for themselves and their children. The Inter-departmental Ministerial Group will continue to monitor this aspect of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.6/1">In December 2006, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced an independent review of Government support for resolving disputes in the workplace which considered the options for simplifying and improving all aspects of employment dispute resolution. The review concluded in March 2007 and recommended complete repeal of the statutory dispute resolution procedures. The Government sought views on the way forward through its March 2007 consultation 'Resolving disputes in the workplace'.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/2">The Government laid the Employment Bill before Parliament in December 2007 to give effect to the main legislative changes needed to reform employment dispute resolution and pave the way for a simpler and more efficient system for employers and employees. The key reforms within the Bill are:</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/3" class="indent">Repeal of the statutory dispute resolution procedures and associated legislation relating to the role of procedure in unfair dismissal.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/4" class="indent">Introduction of a new principles based statutory ACAS Code of Practice which will be accompanied by fuller non statutory guidance to provide practical help for employers and employees.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/5" class="indent">Employment tribunals will take account of the statutory Code in making determinations and have discretionary powers to adjust awards by up to 25 per cent. If either party acts unreasonably.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/6" class="indent">Removal of time restrictions on ACAS' duty to conciliate after an employment tribunal claim has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/7">Additionally, the Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February 2007</phrase> that they were making up to &pound;37 million available to help prevent workplace disputes unnecessarily going to employment tribunals. This extra funding over three years, will allow ACAS to boost its helpline and advice services so that they may help at any stage of a dispute ensuring it is never too late for employers and employees to reach an informal resolution. The money will support increased availability of ACAS conciliation before an employment tribunal claim has been made, enabling the quicker, informal resolution of more disputes.</p>
	<p pid="b.839W.6/8">Other non legislative measures to improve and simplify employment dispute resolution will be outlined in the Government's response to the consultation which will be published in due course.</p>

However, the contracts for these two services come at considerable cost to the taxpayer. The Post Office card account contract, for example, will cost up to &pound;1 billion over its lifetime. Each payment into a Post Office card account costs around 80p and each cheque cashed around &pound;1.79. This compares to approximately 1p for each payment into a bank or building society account.</p>

	<p pid="b.850W.2/16">The Department has announced the individual local authority allocations for the next three years for the start up, sustainability and capital funding streams outlined in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.2/17">Information is not collected centrally on the number of schools which charge parents for their children to attend extended activities, and what the levels of charges are. Schools have different systems and variable rates around charging parents for services and activities. A cost benefit analysis carried out as part of the evaluation of full service extended schools, published in June last year, showed that there is some variability in the method of charging. It showed that with the exception of child care where schools made charges to cover costs, levels of charging tend to be ad hoc and small scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.2/18">The Government have issued guidance to schools on charging through the &quot;Planning and Funding Guidance: a guide for schools, local authorities and their partner organisations.&quot; This explains the law on charging and makes clear that school governing bodies must devise and publish a charging and fee remission policy in consultation with parents. It also explains how charging enables schools to enhance the quality and frequency of the extended opportunities they offer and to make these more sustainable and so more reliable for families in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.2/19">Parents on lower incomes may be eligible for help with meeting the cost of child care, through the child care element of the working tax credit. We are also making &pound;265.5 million of funding available, as part of the &pound;1.3 billion total extended schools funding, to ensure that children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are able to access high quality extended activities and are not prevented from doing so on grounds of cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.853W.0/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not collect this information broken down by subject and qualification. However, research carried out by the Scouts Association and the Duke of Edinburgh Award in 2005 found that 86 per cent. of primary schools and 99 per cent. of secondary schools offer pupils at least one residential education opportunity, outdoor education being by far the most popular type.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.0/2">Research into Education Outside the Classroom published by NFER in November 2006 also found that there has been little evidence of a decline in numbers of school trips in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.0/3">Fieldwork is and will remain a compulsory part of the geography curriculum in secondary schools, both at key stage 3 (ages 11 to 14) and in GCSE syllabuses. Fieldwork is not currently compulsory in A level geography courses but will be a specific requirement in the A level criteria from September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.0/4">The new key stage 3 science curriculum says that pupils should be offered the opportunity to experience science outside the school environment, including in the workplace, where possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.853W.3/1">Since April 2004 all three and four-year-olds have been entitled to a free part-time early education place for 12.5 hours per week for 38 weeks of the year. From 2010, this offer will be extended from 12.5 to 15 hours per week for 38 weeks of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.3/2">Figures for January 2007 show that virtually all four-year-old children receive some form of free entitlement. The figure for three-year-olds is 96 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.3/3">The latest figures on early education places for three and four-year-olds in England were published in Statistical First Release (SFR) 19/2007 &quot;Provision for children under five years of age in England: January 2007&quot;, available on my Department's website:</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.3/5">The 2007 Parents' Childcare Survey collected information about take-up of the free entitlement for three and four-year-olds to 12.5 hours of formal child care per week, by child and family characteristics, enabling an estimate of the proportion of three to four-year-olds who had taken-up this entitlement by social class, using the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) to be made. The findings from the 2007 survey are planned to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.3/6">Comparable estimates are not available for earlier years as specific questions about the take-up of the free entitlement to early years education for three and four-year-olds were not asked in previous surveys. The 2004 survey showed that take up of any early years provision (which would include the free entitlement, as well as other early years education) was lower among more disadvantaged groups. For example, 80 per cent. of three and four-year-olds in families with an annual income of below &pound;10,000 used any early years provision, compared with 95 per cent. of those in families with income above &pound;32,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.857W.5/1">Schools have a key role in supporting young carers. They have responsibilities to all their pupils including a new duty for maintained schools to promote the well-being of their pupils under the Education and Inspections Act 2006. We look to schools to create a supportive environment that responds flexibly to each child's personal circumstances. Within this context, the Government have made a commitment to improving the awareness of young carers' circumstances among teachers and others working in schools. For example, this year we are supporting the development of good practice guidance for those working with young carers and their families, which will include a section on what schools can do to identify and support them. Also, we are making sure that the particular needs of young carers are taken account of in our guidance for schools, such as that on behaviour, attendance and bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.857W.5/2">The cross-Government review of carers now under way is a welcome opportunity to re-assess the support available to young carers. Young carers have been consulted, and stakeholder bodies with knowledge of the issues are fully engaged.</p>

Over 85 per cent. of this budget is provided as funding to the research councils. The councils themselves decide within their respective budget allocations how much of their funding they spend on each of their programmes, and that determines which universities benefit from their expenditure. As announced in Budget 2006, the Government have designated the Science and Technology Facility Council's Daresbury Laboratory as a Science and Innovation Campus. The broader strategic role for Daresbury and its importance to the North West and its relationship with NW universities will be addressed as part of the Manchester Independent Economic Review to be chaired by Sir Tom McKillop which will specifically include Daresbury's contribution to the NW's scientific and economic base.

	<p pid="b.866W.11/2">The Government do not make projections about the number of students graduating from higher education. But increasing and widening participation in HE is a priority for social and economic reasons. To achieve a world-class skills profile for the UK, we will need to deliver higher-level skills training to adults already in the workforce, as well as continuing to take action to meet our existing commitment to make progress towards a 50 per cent. HE participation rate for people aged 18-30. We will aim for at least 36% of adults to be qualified to at least Level 4 by 2014, up from 29 per cent. in 2005 and 40 per cent. by 2020. We are on target to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="b.868W.2/1">The January 2008 Grant Letter to HEFCE set out our expectations for growth in student numbers. As a result of the 2 per cent. real terms increase in funding for HE we are making available over the next three years, and our decision to redistribute grant away from students doing second degrees or other HE qualifications at an equivalent or lower level in order to fund more first degree students, there is scope overall to fund significant growth. We expect a growth in core-fundable students of 20,000 new places in 2008-09, 35,000 new places in 2009-10 and about 60,000 new places in 2010-11 (on a full-time equivalent basis). The exact number of places to be filled by part-time first degree students will depend on student demand and the mixture of provision that institutions deliver, but our plans allow for a significant increase in employer co-funded provision where many students will want to study on a part-time basis.</p>

The Government have encouraged the sector to ensure that its work force is representative of the communities it serves and we have also instituted a number of measures to support HEIs in this area. The Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000) places a duty on higher education institutions to promote equality of opportunity. Through the Rewarding and Developing Staff initiative, we have supported HEIs in developing their human resource capability&mdash;recruitment and retention, and equal opportunities were two of the six priority areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.869W.5/2">The progressive re-distribution of institutional funding away from students doing equivalent or lower level qualifications (ELQs) to ones they already hold will enable us to widen Higher Education participation and support more of the millions of people of all ages without a first Higher Education qualification. Nobody has challenged that priority as a matter of principle or on grounds of fairness or social justice. In addition, the analysis in the Lord Leitch's report and comparative data from the OECD all support the conclusion that we are not producing enough graduates for our economic well-being. The ELQ policy sharpens the incentives in the system for HEIs to produce more of them to match our economic competitors. An extra 5 million people will need to go through university by 2020 if we are to be even on the edge of the premier league for world-class skills, with 40 per cent. of the work force with a first HE qualification. All of the &pound;100 million affected by this policy will be redistributed to support this goal.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.5/3">However, there will be transitional protection for existing ELQ students until they complete their courses and there will also be opportunities in future for students to pursue such qualifications through foundation degrees and employer co-funded provision. There will also be a review mechanism each year starting in December 2008 to look at individual subjects of particular economic or social importance. We are sure it would be wrong for us to rush into making special arrangements for any subjects, other than those which had already been identified, before any changes to ELQs, as requiring support in the public interest (such as medicine, initial teacher training teaching, science, technology, engineering and maths subjects, area-based studies, and modern foreign languages). But we are asking the Funding Council each year to look at levels of demand both for exempt or protected subjects and at any other subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance and advise us on the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.872W.3/1">We define &quot;functionally literate&quot; as having literacy skills at Level 1 or above and our public service agreement target for adult literacy from the comprehensive spending review contains a performance indicator for 597,000 people of working age to achieve a first Level 1 or above literacy qualification by 2011 towards our ambition of ensuring 95 per cent. of adults have a minimum of entry Level 3 numeracy and Level 1 literacy by 2020. Since the launch of the Skills for Life strategy in 2001, 1.759 million adults have improved their literacy, language or numeracy skills. The Skills for Life Survey in 2003 found that 19 per cent. of adults aged 16 to 65 in London region were below Level 1 literacy (approximately 190,000 people), compared to an average of 16 per cent. for England. We are currently planning to update the survey.</p>

Such grant funding is tied to the delivery of agreed contractual outputs and outcomes. The SSDA does not loan money to SSCs.</p>

	<p pid="b.875W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving the skills of the work force, and to delivering the world class skills ambition recommended by Lord Leitch in his independent review of our nation's skills. In 'World Class Skills: Implementing the Leitch Review of Skills in England', published in July last year, the Government set out how it will work employers, trade unions and individuals to deliver its world class skills ambition. As World Class Skills makes clear, this will require a significant increase in the number of people already in the work force who improve their skills, re-skill and gain new qualifications each year. 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force is already beyond the age of compulsory education.</p>
	<p pid="b.875W.2/2">Working in partnership with employers is vital to the delivery of the Government's skills ambitions. Through the measures set out in 'World Class Skills', the Government are giving employers the opportunity to exert real leverage and decision making over both the content and delivery of skills and employment programmes. The new UK Commission for Employment and Skills will strengthen the employer voice at the heart of the system. Reformed and re-licensed sector skills councils will be sharply focussed on raising employer investment, articulating the future skills needs of their sector and ensuring that the supply of skills and qualifications is driven by employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.875W.2/3">The Skills Pledge offers employers the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their commitment to investing in the skills of their employees and over 850 employers, covering over 2.3 million employees have already done this. To help employers of all sizes and in all sectors to identify and address their skills needs, the Government are expanding and improving the Train to Gain service, and expect to increase their investment through Train to Gain to over &pound;1 billion by 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.2/1">The Government's student finance package is designed to ensure that finance should not be a barrier to a higher education course. Student loans from the Government are not like commercial loans: interest is paid at the rate of inflation, so in real terms students only pay back what they borrowed. For income contingent loans available since 1998, repayment is linked to earnings and borrowers only repay if their earnings are over &pound;15,000; from April 2012 they will be able to take up to five years' 'Repayment Holiday' and those taking out a student loan from 2006 have their debt cancelled after 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/2">During the passage of the Enterprise Act in 2002 there was a growing awareness about student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt. There was a rise in the number of bankruptcies/Individual Voluntary Agreements (IVAs) notified in 2003. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. Provisions were therefore included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on bankruptcy. Currently student loans are not exempt from IVAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/3">The increase in student loan borrowers with bankruptcies and IVAs should be seen in the context of the increases in the general population. Figures from the Insolvency Service show that between 2002 and 2006 the number of individual bankruptcies in England and Wales more than doubled; the number of IVAs increased seven-fold.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/4">Until 2004 IVAs and bankruptcies were not recorded separately in SLC data. After the change in legislation, only IVAs are recorded, as student loans are excluded from bankruptcy debts and are not written off on discharge from bankruptcy.</p>

	<p pid="b.880W.0/1">The exact information requested could not be derived as a time series. Instead, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) was used to produce a time series with a slightly different qualification categories to those requested. The following table shows the estimates of unemployment rates by qualification held for adults aged 18-24 in England, using the LFS spring quarter (March to May) results between 1995 and 2005 and Quarter 2 results (April to June) for 2006 and 2007. The fact that there was a change in the reporting period of the LFS results means that the figures for 2006 and 2007 and not strictly comparable with those for earlier years as these estimates are subject to seasonality. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does publish on its website a seasonally adjusted time series of the unemployment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK. This shows for example, that the rate fell from 13.1 per cent. in spring 1997 to 12.0 per cent. in the last quarter of 2007.</p>

Training is delivered 'in-house', with specific apprenticeship requirements being interwoven with the training needs of the operational environment. In the vast majority of cases, apprenticeship programmes directly relate to specific service professions and have significant portability when personnel return to civilian life. In the last financial year the armed forces recorded over 7,300 funded apprentice completions. In order to meet their business needs, the armed forces continue to expand the variety of apprenticeship schemes available to their personnel. No changes are planned to apprenticeship schemes that are currently in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.8/1">Tackling homelessness is a key priority for this Government and we have made major progress, reducing rough sleeping by 73 per cent. since 1998 and ending the long-term use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families with children under the homelessness legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/2">We strengthened the statutory protection through the Homelessness Act 2002, providing one of the strongest statutory safety nets in the world for homeless families with children and vulnerable people. This includes a requirement for local authorities to have a strategy in place for tackling and preventing homelessness and ensuring that accommodation and support is available to people in their district who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/3">Under the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002, we widened the categories of people who have a priority need for accommodation under the homelessness legislation to include, among others, 16 and 17-year-olds and young people aged 18 to 20 previously in care at any time between the ages of 16 and 18.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/4">Since 2003, we have seen a year on year reduction (over 45 per cent.) in the number of households accepted under the homelessness legislation. The number of households in temporary accommodation is also reducing and local authorities are on course to meet the target of halving the number of households in temporary accommodation to 50,500 by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/5">We have provided significant investment for homelessness prevention. This includes our recent announcement of &pound;200 million homelessness grant funding for local authorities and the voluntary sector over the next three years. This represents the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness services and demonstrates the commitment that reducing homelessness remains a top priority for this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/6">We have also invested &pound;90 million capital funding in 2005-08, to improve hostels and day centres used by rough sleepers so they can move into education and employment and make the transition from the street to a settled home. A further &pound;70 million capital funding is being made available in 2008-11 to build on the success of improving hostels and day centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/7">We fund the National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS) which is a partnership between Citizens Advice and Shelter, to ensure high quality advice on homelessness prevention through the network of participating Citizens Advice bureaux and other voluntary agencies across England.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/8">The Supporting People Programme launched in 2003 has been helping the most vulnerable in society, including young people and people at risk of homelessness, to live independently by providing accommodation and support to help them make the transition to economic and social independence. Since 2003, we have invested Supporting People funding of over &pound;8.7 billion in local authorities to spend on the areas where they have identified need. To date, around &pound;1.3 billion has been allocated to clients who are either homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/9">In November 2006, we announced measures to further prevent and tackle youth homelessness. This includes a commitment that by 2010, no 16 or 17-year-olds should be placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by a local authority under the homelessness legislation, except in an emergency. The number of 16 and 17-year-olds in bed and breakfast accommodation has fallen by almost one-third from September 2006, when there were approximately 1,000 young people in bed and breakfast accommodation, to around 700 young people at the end of June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/10">We are also working to improve access to homelessness mediation across the country (including family mediation for young people), so that there is a universal expectation of such services and we are promoting the use of supported lodgings schemes and other supported housing provision to ensure appropriate accommodation, advice and support is available for young people who can no longer stay in the family home.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/22">The table shows the total capital receipts from RTB sales of local authority dwellings in England. The figures are net of discount and are as reported by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/23">The table also shows the value of capital receipts set-aside from 1997-98 to 2003-04 (the last year in which the set-aside regime existed). Under this regime, with-debt local authorities were required to set-aside a proportion of the capital receipt generated by the disposal of a Housing Revenue Account (HRA) asset, for the repayment of housing debt. When set-aside exceeds RTB receipts, it is because set-aside includes a proportion of receipts from not only RTB, but also whole-stock transfers, non-RTB dwelling sales, and sales of other HRA assets such as housing land.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/24">When capital receipts from the sale of a Government-owned asset are received, the sales reduce public sector net borrowing in manner such that the amount of sales is equal to the amount of the reduction. To the extent that a proportion of these receipts are retained and spent by the local authorities through pooling or set-aside, then that spending will offset the initial reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/25">Under the set-aside regime, with-debt authorities were free to use the proportion of their housing receipts that had not been set aside for any capital purpose they saw fit. Debt-free authorities were free to use the whole of their housing receipts for any capital purpose. The Department does not record when authorities actually spent these receipts.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/26">From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> set-aside no longer applied to most housing receipts. All local authorities, both with-debt and debt-free, paid over or &quot;pooled&quot; the same amounts to the Secretary of State which would have formerly been set aside. Until the introduction of the pooling regime, set-aside was the mechanism that allowed a proportion of housing capital receipts to be redistributed for investment elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/27">When an authority set aside an amount, the need for central government revenue support for that amount of borrowing through HRA subsidy disappeared, thereby enabling central to provide support for borrowing elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/28">RTB sales reduce public sector net borrowing and since receipts are cash and therefore interchangeable with all other capital receipts, they are not hypothecated to any particular spending at any particular time. However, the table shows that the Government have consistently invested more in housing than they have received in receipts. In 2005-06, the amount paid to Government from all housing receipts is estimated to have been nearly &pound;1.1 billion. The amount invested in housing was nearly &pound;5.2 billion, i.e. almost five times the amount received in receipts.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.0/29">The process of pooling is currently being reviewed as part of the wider review of housing finance.</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.2/1">Planning Policy Guidance note 13: Transport sets out the Government's overall policy on planning for transport. Its objectives are to integrate planning and transport at the national, regional, strategic and local level and to promote more sustainable transport choices both for carrying people and for moving freight. Planning Pollution Statement 23: Planning and Pollution Control, and its Annex 1: Pollution Control, Air and Water Quality set out how the planning system can contribute to improvements in water quality. The policy expects local planning authorities to take into account the diffuse pollution that could be created by a proposed development and any measures the developer proposes to mitigate the impact. Neither documents provide specific advice on vehicle washing and cleaning.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.2/2">The Environment Agency issued a revised Pollution Prevention Guideline 13 on vehicle washing and cleaning in October 2007. This is good practice guidance for all landowners and tenants to help prevent pollution from vehicle washing and cleaning using automatic wash systems, high pressure or steam cleaners and washing by hand. Local authorities should be aware of pollution prevention guidelines and implement them where it is appropriate to do so. The principal enforcement agencies for pollution prevention guidelines are the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Heritage Service for Northern Ireland and the water companies for pollution and trade effluent respectively. DEFRA is working with the Environment Agency to tackle non-agricultural diffuse water pollution as part of its work under both the water framework directive and 'Future Water', DEFRA's recently published Water strategy. In particular, DEFRA is considering the introduction of simple general binding rules, which will provide a new approach to regulating such activities along with proportionate forms of enforcement, such as fixed penalty notices. A DEFRA consultation on this issue is anticipated later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.2/1">The endemic nature of exotic diseases in many countries around the world results in a continuous but low risk of infected meat reaching the country through illegal routes. This means that all such seizures are treated as an animal health risk and destroyed, by incineration, in the shortest possible time.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.2/2">The risk of disease relates to the possibility that animals may consume infectious material in illegal imports. Very small amounts of infectious material may cause disease and are likely to form only a very small proportion of any illegal import.

Discovering whether any individual seizure is infected is unlikely to contribute significantly to the way that the restrictions relating to imports are enforced.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.8/15">In 2005, together with other Government Departments, DEFRA embarked on a programme to reduce the administrative burden of regulation by a net 25 per cent., by 2010. At that time, DEFRA's pre-existing administrative burden (i.e. the total cost to business of form filling, dealing with inspections and providing statutory information to third parties) was estimated by PricewaterhouseCoopers at &pound;527.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.8/16">DEFRA has published Simplification Plans in each year since 2005. The Department's latest Simplification Plan, Cutting Red Tape, was published in December 2007. It shows that, taking account of new Regulations that have added additional administrative burdens, the overall burden the Department imposes on business should be no more than &pound;395.8 million by 2010, a reduction of &pound;132 million or 25 per cent.</p>

The caimant is challenging DEFRA's decision not to re-test (using the tuberculin skin test) cattle within their herd that have had a positive reaction to the gamma interferon test. DEFRA has been put on notice that three other farm businesses are intending to issue proceedings on the same basis, but has agreed with those farmers that their animals will not be slaughtered pending the outcome of the judicial review. It is expected that this case will determine the issues in respect of all four complaints.</p>

The requirements vary according to the type of wine and the region of production. Wines imported into the EU are, in general, subject to the same requirements, although a number of countries, including the US, have concluded bilateral agreements, which provide for wine produced in conformity with national standards to be imported and marketed in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.942W.0/29">(a) The aforementioned table shows by specific region the number, weight and volume of seizures of meat made from non-EU countries by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) at British points of entry (and by staff funded by DEFRA until <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-11">11 April 2003</phrase>), those made by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland (DARDNI) at points of entry in Northern Ireland and those made by inland local/port health authorities where they were able to establish that the illegal products came from non-EU countries. HMRC have been responsible for anti-smuggling controls on products of animal origin (POAO) into Britain since <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-11">11 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.942W.0/30">On occasions more than one POAO product at a time will be seized (for example, meat, fish, dairy and honey). This is referred to as a 'multiple seizure'. Up until <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, this was only recorded as one seizure against the product of highest weight although the weight of the other products seized was included in the weight recorded for that product. However, the number of seizures by product for the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> reflect the number of times each product was seized including those from a 'multiple seizure'.</p>
	<p pid="b.942W.0/31">(b) Seizures of illegal meat imported into the United Kingdom (UK) are recorded by region rather than specific country. This is because in some cases it can be difficult to determine the precise country of origin for a particular product and people can often travel to the UK via another country (for example to catch a direct connecting flight to the UK). What is clear is that illegal imports of meat (and other products of animal origin) enter the UK from all over the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.942W.0/32">(c) Seizure figures are not recorded at the level of detail to determine the type of product (for example, chicken, pork etc.).</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.5/1">This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.5/2">The reasons for change in value of future claims settlements can vary from changed information on the specific damage caused to changes in the interpretation of case law and its impact on future settlements. The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) carry out a rigorous review at least twice per annum of all of our models which forecast claims not yet received and keep a constant review of all 'known claims' throughout their life. NHSLA's systems and processes are audited by the National Audit Office who have yet to offer any concern in relation to NHSLA's accounting treatment or indeed the quality of advice they are purchasing from either legal or actuarial professionals.</p>

	<p pid="b.958W.2/1">The Long Term Condition Whole System Demonstrators (WSDs) promised in the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; are exploring the effectiveness of telehealth and telecare in supporting integrated care for those with complex health and social care needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/2">The demonstrators involve the provision of integrated care supported by telehealth and telecare to thousands of individuals over a two year period. The demonstrators are charged with determining the business case for the effectiveness of this model of care. This is being facilitated by the development of a robust independent evaluation drawing upon relevant academic expertise.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/3">The development of the evaluation methodology, in conjunction with the three sites, has been complex and a number of research design and operational issues have had to be addressed. However, since a randomised control trial provides an unbiased, balanced, and reliable method for determining whether the complex intervention is effective we have allowed more time for the evaluation methodology to be developed than originally planned. There has also been a requirement for review by a multi-site research ethics committee. We have delayed launching services on a large scale until the evaluation methodology is approved because we want each installation to contribute to the knowledge base we are generating.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/4">Our revised timeline has the evaluated roll out of WSD services commencing in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/5">The three WSD sites will be subject to a single evaluation and as such the target population and evaluation methodology is common across all three sites. It is essential to clearly define the target population for the WSD programme so that the results of the detailed evaluation can be set in context. The criteria proposed for individuals in the trial is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/6" class="indent">individuals with health care needs of any age who are at risk of current or future hospital admission, due to at least one of the following conditions: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes. The detailed severity criteria is defined using quality outcome framework indicators.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/7" class="indent">individuals with social care needs aged 18 and over who:</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/8" class="indent">are currently in receipt of, or considered to have a need for night sitting;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/9" class="indent">receiving seven or more hours per week of home care or 3.5 or more hours per week of home care plus a meals service (defined by individual not household);</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/10" class="indent">receiving one or more days per week of day care;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/11" class="indent">have had a fall or who are considered at high risk of falling;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/12" class="indent">a live-in nearby informal carer facing difficulties carrying their current burden of responsibilities; and</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/13" class="indent">cognitive impairment/confusion people fulfilling this criterion who are unable to provide written informed consent and do not have a primary informal caregiver available or an advocate will not be approached to participate in the questionnaire study.-</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/14" class="indent">individuals with both health and social care needs as defined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/15">The evaluation has been designed to assess the impact of the addition of telehealth and telecare in an integrated care setting on:</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/16" class="indent">patterns of health and social care utilisation;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/17" class="indent">user reported quality of life, independence and psychological well-being;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/18" class="indent">carers' quality of life;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/19" class="indent">practitioners working lives and relationships with patients/service users;</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/20" class="indent">clinical effectiveness; and</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/21" class="indent">cost effectiveness of care.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/22">The WSD sites are being supported by the Department, and their project management partner KPMG, to ensure that each site manages to the principles outlined by the OGC's Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) guidance. All the sites have a requirement to produce and manage a consistent set of programme documentation. Each site has a dedicated WSD team and reports to the Department with a weekly flash report and a monthly progress report.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/23">A comprehensive list of planning and control documentation has been produced by each site. The nature of such documentation is that it evolves over the lifecycle of the programme and so there are multiple versions of many documents that reflect this evolution. For each of the three programmes, and their associated sub-projects, there are for example project initiation documents, project plans, risk/issue and dependency logs and communications plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/24">The planning documentation contains commercially sensitive information and so it would be inappropriate to place the information in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.960W.2/1">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, set out important new arrangements for the involvement of patients and the public in health and social care, including local involvement networks (LINks). LINks will enable local people to monitor local services irrespective of who provides them.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.2/2">LINks will build on the work of voluntary and community sector groups; and, enable genuine involvement of a far greater number of people than is currently available, ensuring local communities have a stronger voice in the process of commissioning health and social care and enabling them to influence key decisions about the services they both use and pay for.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.2/3">In order to ensure that independent sector providers&mdash;be they from the private or third sector&mdash;co-operate with LINks, we will make directions requiring primary care trusts and local authorities to ensure that their contracts with the independent and third sectors allow LINks entry to appropriate premises and access to appropriate information. This will ensure that LINks will have the same levels of access as they do in the public sector. These changes are aimed at promoting open and transparent communication between communities and the health service, and will develop trust and confidence, increasing accountability to local people.</p>

	<p pid="b.964W.3/10">Funding to support the delivery of improved care and support for people with long term conditions is included in PCTs main allocations.

	<p pid="b.975W.0/3">The majority of use of hand held mobile phone while driving offences are dealt with under the fixed penalty notices scheme. The fixed penalty notice is intended to be a quick and simple system in giving an offender the opportunity to resolve the matter without attending court. However, failing to pay the amount due within the specified time will result in the non-endorsable &pound;30 fine becoming &pound;45 and being registered as a fine at a local magistrates court. The tables do not include fixed penalty notices but do include cases where fixed penalty notices were originally issued but not paid and subsequently referred to court.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.5/1">Figures covering the whole of 2007 will not be available until after the end of the current financial year. However, 5,584 legally aided clinical negligence cases were closed in 2006-07. In 160 of these cases, the solicitors reported that the outcome was unknown, as the client had ceased to give instructions or was proceeding under other funding or as a litigant in person. Of the remaining cases, 300 resulted in an award of damages, and 1,708 in a settlement involving an agreement to pay damages or compensation.</p>

	<p pid="b.999W.2/1">The UK Government provide film tax relief for qualifying films. Foreign filmmakers working in partnership with British film companies may be eligible for such relief. In order to qualify their films need either to pass the UK's cultural test or qualify as an official UK co-production. Films should be intended for theatrical release, meet a minimum UK spend requirement of 25 per cent. and be made by a film production company within the UK corporation tax net.</p>
	<p pid="b.999W.2/2">In addition, the UK Film Council provides national lottery funding for film development and production projects, approximately &pound;19 million per year is available. Foreign filmmakers can access this funding by collaborating with companies that are registered and centrally managed in the UK or in another member state of the European Union or European economic area. The provision to allow companies registered in other states of the European Union or European economic area is to ensure compatibility with the general legality principles of the treaty on European Union (the Maastricht treaty).</p>

The Arts Council is committed to a policy of openness and transparency and makes information available to the public on a routine basis. Among others, this can include Council minutes, advice and guidance on funding programmes and research reports. The Arts Council's publication scheme gives details of what information is publicly available and can be found on their website:</p>

For example, the new South African National Strategic Plan (2007-11) for HIV and AIDS identifies HIV prevention as one of its four priorities. The plan includes the following targets: 80 per cent. on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by 2011; 50 per cent. reduction of new HIV infections by 2011; 70 per cent. of the adult population to be tested; and a target to reduce mother to child transmission to 5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008W.11/1">The UK is committed to ensuring that civil society organisations (CSO) are involved in the International Health Partnership (IMP). CSOs are not only a critical partner in delivering health services in many developing countries, but they can also play an important role in holding partners to account at the global and country level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.11/2">The UK has engaged with CSO partners both before and after the launch of the IMP. In October, DFID hosted a meeting in London with several CSOs. Since then the eight health agencies (H8) leading on the IHP have regularly consulted with CSOs and are currently developing a strategy for ongoing CSO engagement. A key meeting called by the H8 to review progress in developing country compacts will be held in Lusaka later this month, and several CSOs will be attending.</p>

	<p pid="b.1009W.5/1">DFID has recently changed its restaurant service provider, and detailed records are not available. However, we estimate that DFID has spent in the region of &pound;10,500 per annum over the last three years. Bottled water was provided for some official meetings in accordance with the principles of Managing Public Money. Since January 2008, however, we no longer purchase bottled mineral water, but instead use bottled filtered mains water that is prepared on site.

	<p pid="b.1009W.8/1">DFID's current financial management system does not record total resources spent on disaster risk reduction (DRR) centrally, because DRR programmes can be included under a range of types of assistance, from education (for example DRR education in schools) to infrastructure (for example earthquake proof building).</p>
	<p pid="b.1009W.8/2">However, DFID has a commitment to allocate approximately 10 per cent. of the funding it provides in response to each natural disaster to prepare for and mitigate the impact of future disasters, where this can be done effectively. Under this commitment, DFID has pledged &pound;7.5 million following the Indian Ocean Tsunami; &pound;5.5 million following the Pakistan earthquake and &pound;500,000 following the Yogyakarta (Indonesia) earthquake. Other examples of support for DRR at country level include: &pound;50 million for the Chars (river islands) Livelihoods Project in Bangladesh which aims to increase livelihood security for &pound;6.5 million vulnerable people in flood-prone districts; &pound;3.8 million to an insurance fund to provide Caribbean Governments with fast payouts after natural disasters; and &pound;2.9 million for a consortium of NGOs in Niger to help communities prevent food security crises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1009W.8/3">DFID also provides funds for multilateral and regional organisations working on DRR. We have provided: &pound;3 million for the United Nations international strategy for disaster risk reduction; &pound;4.38 million for the World Bank's global facility for disaster risk reduction; &pound;2.5 million for the ProVention Consortium; &pound;2.15 million for the International Federation of the Red Cross; &pound;3.3 million for the Pan American Health Organisation for DRR programmes; as well as some resources through its &pound;7 million annual contribution to the United Nations Development Programme's Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR).</p>

	<p pid="b.1010W.2/1">DFID is committed to supporting international and national efforts to prevent and mitigate the effects of natural disasters in poorer disaster-prone countries. DFID is providing &pound;3 million over three years (2006 to 2009) to the United Nations international strategy for disaster reduction (ISDR), which launched the global campaign &quot;Disaster Risk Reduction Begins at School&quot; in 2006. The campaign promotes the 'disaster-proofing' of school buildings, inclusion of disaster risk reduction (DRR) in school curricula and the active role children can play in promoting DRR in their communities. Examples of activities include: a consultative meeting in Kenya on DRR for Education Ministry officials from 19 African countries. This inspired the Mozambican Ministry of Education and Culture, with the support of the Mozambique Red Cross Society, to implement DRR training in 76 schools, reaching 4,400 children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010W.2/2">DFID also supports Action Aid's &quot;Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) through Schools&quot; project and Plan UK's &quot;Children and Young People at the Centre of Disaster Risk Reduction and Management&quot; project, for which DFID is providing &pound;2.8 million and &pound;2.9 million respectively over five years. In Bangladesh, Action Aid have funded an interactive learning kit for children on DRR, aimed at helping children learn about disaster risk and take action to reduce risk. In Sierra Leone, Plan UK is providing DRR training for 30 children's groups and 28 schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1011W.4/2">None of the organisations representing parents has raised these concerns with the agency, and the matter has not been the subject of any complaint the agency has received. Therefore very little evidence exists to suggest that non-resident parents are exploiting the current rules on pension contributions in a way which unreasonably reduces their child support liability. If such a case were to arise, the Child Support Agency is able to adjust liabilities in specified exceptional circumstances where the usual rules may not operate fairly. For example, in either child support scheme, it is possible to adjust the child support liability where the net income of the non-resident parent used in the calculation is inconsistent with their lifestyle. In such cases, this action will be considered by the agency following an application by the parent with care.</p>

	<p pid="b.1012W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1012W.0/5" class="indent">As part of the Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency contracted out some of its enforcement work to private debt collection agencies, Eversheds LLP and iQor, and the management of our clerical case load to Vertex Data Science Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/6" class="indent">Although the Agency has contracted out the maintenance of its clerical cases to Vertex Data Science Ltd, the performance targets set by the Secretary of State apply to all Child Support cases, regardless of whether they are clerical or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/7" class="indent">In addition, the Agency's Client Service Standards apply to cases maintained by Vertex Data Science Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/8" class="indent">Formal monthly governance arrangements are in place to measure and discuss Vertex performance against these targets and standards. Weekly meetings between Vertex and Agency operational managers also take place to track performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/9" class="indent">The number of cases that need to be processed clerically is larger than was initially expected. Consequently, in order to ensure we maintain a good standard of service to our clients, we returned some of the cases being handled by Vertex to our other centres. This process began in July 2007 and was completed in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/10" class="indent">The Agency now retains responsibility for clerical cases until the first payment stage, including processing some cases previously passed to Vertex (CSA Bolton) which were awaiting initial assessment and payment scheduling. Thereafter, these cases will be sent to CSA Bolton to ensure on-going maintenance compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/11" class="indent">These changes have allowed Vertex to focus on case maintenance, keeping more money flowing to more children, and have resulted in an improvement in the service offered to clients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.0/12" class="indent">The forthcoming upgrade to the CS2 computer system will result in a significant reduction in the number of cases that need to be processed clerically. The process will be re-assessed at that point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018W.8/1">The Health and Safety Commission set three targets to reduce the incidence rates of work-related fatal and major injury, ill health and working days lost as part of its 'Revitalising Health and Safety' strategy launched in 2000. This was the first time HSC/E had set national targets of this sort. These were not annual targets, but cover a 10-year period to 2009-10, using 1999 to 2000 as the baseline year, and sought reductions of:</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/2" class="indent">work-related fatal and major injury&mdash;10 per cent. reduction from the baseline;</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/3" class="indent">work-related ill health&mdash;20 per cent. reduction from the baseline; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/4" class="indent">work-related days lost&mdash;30 per cent. reduction from the baseline.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/5">HSE's current PSA targets (2005-06 to 2007-08, using 2004-05 as a baseline) are designed to contribute to these longer term targets&mdash;aiming for a 3 per cent. reduction in work-related fatal and major injuries, 6 per cent. reduction in work-related ill health and 9 per cent. reduction in work-related days lost over the life of the PSA. The following table shows the official published statistics for each year from 1999 to 2000 to 2006-07 against the PSA target for comparison purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/6">HSE has only had formal targets relating to major hazard for the current PSA period (2005-06 to 2007-08). The table shows the major hazards targets for 2007-08 and progress towards them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.8/7">All HSE's targets cover Great Britain as a whole; although regional statistics are published, the targets, and progress towards them, are not broken down regionally or locally.</p>
