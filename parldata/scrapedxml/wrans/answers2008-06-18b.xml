	<p pid="b.918W.4/2">It is a matter of public record that the dome was completed on time, that the final cost was just 4 per cent. over budget, that it was by far the most visited paying attraction in the UK in the year 2000 and that it helped regenerate a wide area.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.4/3">I am advised that English Partnerships spent &pound;33 million of Exchequer funding on decommissioning and maintenance of the millennium dome structure between 1999 and June 2007, with the expectation that these costs will be recovered from sale proceeds from the contract for the future use of the dome and redevelopment of associated land over the life of the project.</p>

Friends the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and I, as well as officials at the UK Representation in Brussels and across our European network, are in regular contact with EU partners and the European Commission on a full range of issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/3">The Government's position on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) health check is well established. We welcomed the publication of the health check proposals as a further step in the process of reforming the CAP. We are seeking an ambitious outcome that further cuts the trade distorting nature of the CAP, which has contributed to high food prices. We want reduced regulatory burdens to give farmers greater control over their business decisions and redirect more CAP spending away from direct farm payments towards delivery of targeted public benefits.</p>

This followed a meeting earlier this year between our ambassador in Tashkent and the Uzbek Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, which focused on cotton and child labour issues. We have also raised child labour and cotton issues with the local UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative.

	<p pid="b.929W.2/2">The Climate Change Bill Final Impact Assessment complied with the Better Regulation Executive's guidance on development of Impact Assessments. This states that HM Treasury's discount rates should be applied, as set out in their publication &quot;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&mdash;The Green Book&quot;. The Green Book sets out a declining discounting schedule which discounts costs and benefits for the first 30 years at 3.5 per cent. per annum, and costs and benefits for years 30 to 60 at 3 per cent. per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.929W.2/3">Professor Stern's Review did not apply a single rate of discount, but rather calculated the discount rate endogenously within the analysis, varying according to the scenario.</p>

	<p pid="b.929W.5/1">The Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC) undertakes research on trends in the area of Arctic sea ice, on behalf of DEFRA, through its Integrated Climate Programme. Within this programme, which is jointly funded by DEFRA and the Ministry of Defence, trends in the area of Arctic sea ice in the last 10 years were assessed as part of a comparison between modelled estimates of the minimum extent of summer sea ice and corresponding satellite records, for the period 1979 to 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.929W.5/2">The satellite observation record shows a long-term decline in ice extent at all times of the year over recent decades, which has accelerated in the last decade; with record summer lows in 2001, 2005 and now, 2007 (at 4.13 million km<sup>(2)</sup>, some 2.5 million km<sup>(2)</sup> less than a decade ago). Last year's record low in summer sea ice extent was partly explained by unusually mild weather conditions and warm sea temperatures. Most climate models underestimate this ongoing decline, but some with more sophisticated sea ice physics appear able to capture the general trend (but not recent dramatic seasonal falls in sea ice extent). The MOHC model, even though doing better than most other climate models in representing the long term decline, only predicted a drop of about 0.5 million km<sup>(2)</sup> in summer sea ice extent over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.929W.5/3">The strong year-to-year variability (due to short term weather factors) superimposed on this downward trend in summer sea ice area, means it is difficult to compare a single annual observed value with a long term trend in model simulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.0/1">The Memorandum of Understanding and associated documents establishing the Joint Ministerial Committee make clear that the Committee will be available to try to resolve differences, although they lay emphasis on resolution bilaterally or through the good offices of the appropriate territorial Secretary of State, and make clear that the JMC is not a decision-making body. The Committee has in recent years met only in its functional format dealing with European issues, in which there has been no need to invoke formal dispute resolution processes, and accordingly the arrangements for dispute resolution have not developed beyond those set out in the founding documents. Were a dispute to be referred to the Committee that affected a number of Administrations, it would be essential for all with an interest to be involved in its resolution.</p>

	<p pid="b.949W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.2/3" class="indent">Your question on the reviews of regulation conducted by the Audit Commission has been passed to me for reply. The Commission has not commenced any review of regulation since July 2007, but in 2006 we published two discussion papers on regulation&mdash;'Assessment of local services beyond 2008' and 'The future of regulation in the public sector'&mdash;and I am enclosing copies for your information. In addition to this, we have also contributed to reviews of housing and health regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.2/4" class="indent">In November 2007, we and several other inspectorates consulted widely on the scope and framework for Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) and will be publishing a further consultation later this year. CAA is the new assessment framework for local services required by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, Building on the demonstrable improvements in councils and other local public services in recent years, CAA will mark the cessation of several existing assessment regimes, including the Audit Commission's own Comprehensive Performance Assessment of local authorities and will significantly reduce the number of inspections of local public services. Where these are required, they will be proportionate, will draw on far fewer national performance indicators and will be coordinated between inspectorates. This regime of minimal inspection will be balanced by a more integrated and, therefore, often more challenging, judgement on the overall quality of services. We also intend to continue to add value by using our findings to share good practice quickly and accessibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.2/5" class="indent">I will be happy to discuss the Commission's work in any of these areas with you, if you would find that helpful.</p>

The latter sought the views of interested parties on the future direction of the CEAS, including the possible development of a European Support Office to oversee all forms of cooperation between member states. No proposals have been made as yet and when they are we will judge them on their individual merits. The European Commission will shortly present a policy plan on asylum for further discussion, a copy of which will be deposited with the appropriate Committees in both Houses for scrutiny.

	<p pid="b.970W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how much was owed in child maintenance arrears by non-resident parents in Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.5/5" class="indent">The Agency is only able to analyse the amount of child maintenance arrears outstanding by parliamentary constituency on cases maintained on the new computer system (CS2) from February 2007. The Agency is not able to estimate the amount of child maintenance arrears outstanding on the old system (CSCS) at parliamentary constituency level. At the end of March 2008, the total amount of child maintenance arrears owed by non-resident parents, living in Bexleyheath and Crayford was &pound;2 million compared to &pound;1.6 million at the end of March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.5/6" class="indent">This debt is owed by non-resident parents as a result of their failure to meet their responsibilities to their children. Debt recovery is very much dependent on the willingness of non-resident parents to co-operate with the Agency. Some non-resident parents do their utmost to avoid their responsibilities&mdash;for example by moving house or changing jobs whenever the Agency tries to collect maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.5/7" class="indent">The Agency has increased the amount of child maintenance collected or arranged over the first two years of the Operational Improvement Plan, collecting a record-breaking &pound;1 billion in the year to March 2008 of which &pound;126 million was arrears. In addition, internal Agency figures show that the rate at which child maintenance debt has been growing continues to reduce. In the year to March 2008, child maintenance debt grew at a rate of &pound;10 million a month, which is less than half the rate at which debt was growing in the year to March 2006.</p>

Under an agreement with HM Treasury, known as Easements, these, along with small value overpayments not considered cost effective to pursue, were recorded separately on the basis of estimated values. The value recorded in the easements initiative in shown for each year&mdash;although this is not broken down by benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/5">Prior to 2005-06 overpayments identified by the Recovery from Estates Unit were recorded separately. (The unit is responsible for the recovery of overpaid means tested benefits identified after death following check of probate records.) Unfortunately, these cannot be broken down by benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/6">Otherwise, the data supplied is based on actual values of official error and customer error detected and recorded by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/7">The Department also publishes estimates of overpayments in the Resource Account and in National Statistics publications.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.0/8">Copies of two recent such reports: Fraud and Error in the Benefit System from April 2006 to March 2007, and Fraud and Error in the Benefit System from October 2006 to September 2007 have been placed in the House of Commons Library. These are based on detailed examination of a random sample of benefit claims and are an estimate of all error, whether it was detected by normal departmental processes or not. The differences in definition mean that the two sets of figures are not comparable.</p>

A relevant qualification is any post A-level qualification that the school considers qualifies the teacher or teaching assistant to teach the subjects for which they are timetabled. We expect to see included, as a minimum, teachers' ITT qualifications. For teachers with a PGCE, we are also requesting data on prior degrees. Qualification subjects will be coded using the Joint Academic Council principal subjects code set which includes 'training teachers&mdash;special needs'.</p>

	<p pid="b.983W.5/1">The Department has not commissioned specific research on the developmental appropriateness of the early years foundation stage in the last three years. It has consulted publicly on the EYFS, and drew on evidence such as the effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) project. The EYFS carries forward the early learning goals from the existing curriculum guidance for the foundation stage. We have already made it clear that the EYFS will be reviewed as a whole in 2010, once it has had time to bed in. We will consider, as part of that review, whether further research needs to be commissioned.</p>

	<p pid="b.983W.8/1">The Education Act 1996 provides that school aged children have a learning difficulty if they have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of educational facilities generally provided for children of the same age, or if they have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of the same age. Children who have a learning difficulty which calls for special educational provision to be made for them, have special educational needs.</p>

The Government are committed to conducting an interim review of the stamp duty relief in 2010 which will examine the effectiveness of the relief in stimulating the innovation necessary to ensure that all new homes are built to a zero-carbon standard from 2016.</p>

	<p pid="b.992W.2/1">The relief reduces administrative costs for businesses, HM Revenue and Customs, the authorised postal carrier (Royal Mail), express carriers and consumers by removing the requirement to pay VAT on large volumes of low value packages.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.2/2">As set out in PBR 2006 the total cost of the low value consignment relief is estimated at around &pound;90 million. HMRC tentatively estimates that around three quarters of this cost is attributable to imports from the Crown dependencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.2/3">Although HMRC collects data on the total aggregate value of goods imported from many companies in the Crown dependencies these data are not broken down into individual products such as food supplements and herbal remedies or recorded music and films.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.2/4">As the then Paymaster General said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 146WH, it is not clear that the competitive pressures on small retailers are solely or even mainly related to the VAT relief enjoyed by offshore online retailers. It is difficult to disaggregate the effect of the relief from other factors, such as the substantial growth of supermarket sales, and rapid technological change in the case of the market for audio-visual products, which are increasingly sold in download form over the internet. The Channel Islands authorities have, however, applied their regulatory powers to prevent the establishment of new businesses on the Islands where these are simply attempting to take advantage of the relief, and in the case of Jersey have required several businesses to leave.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001W.0/1">Responsibility for issuing guidance to electoral registration officers on electoral registration lies with the Electoral Commission and thus my Department has not made any assessment of the level of compliance with guidelines for home visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001W.0/2">Section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 placed a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once and making house visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001W.0/3">The Act includes a provision for the Electoral Commission to introduce new performance measures for electoral registration officers. The Electoral Commission is currently developing these standards and the final standards will be published in July 2008, a copy of which will be laid before the House. This will give us a better understanding of the actions being taken to increase registration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001W.0/4">The Office for National Statistics has recently published electoral registration rates for the UK, following the 2007 annual canvass, which confirm that the number of parliamentary electors grew by 307,669 to 45,082,854; and the number of local government electors grew by 463,340 to 45,920,503.</p>

However, under section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, electoral registration officers are required to take all necessary steps to register eligible electors and were granted the powers to inspect records held by any person that the ERO is permitted to inspect.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002W.8/1">The information requested has been placed in the Libraries of the House. The Office of the Public Guardian is an agency of the MOJ, formed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>, replacing the Public Guardianship Office which was also an agency. Neither office has ever had a Press Office or press officers. Work is handled by the MOJ Press Office.</p>

So far, the UK has contracted for the delivery of two tranches, comprising 144 aircraft. Negotiations, with Partner Nations and industry, are under way on Tranche 3 and are expected to continue throughout this year. It would be inappropriate at this stage to release information which might prejudice our negotiating position. Decisions will be taken once these negotiations are complete.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018W.5/1">Civil service pay awards reflect an individual's outputs, results and performance against pre-agreed objectives. Under the delegated arrangements for staff below the senior civil service, Departments and agencies are required to have reward systems that include a close and effective link between pay and performance. For the senior civil service, for which pay is managed centrally by the Cabinet Office, non-consolidated payments (which have to be earned each year) are used to incentivise staff to deliver business objectives successfully.</p>

	<p pid="b.1027W.0/1">Ending unfair age discrimination is one of the many priorities for the Department. Therefore, action to address age discrimination in health and social care services is not new and was central to the &quot;National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People&quot;, published in 2001. Copies of this publication are available in the Library. The NSF set out to develop actions to address age discrimination in the first of the eight standards it set. Notable progress includes an increase in the proportion of older people receiving intensive help to maintain high quality, independent lives at home and a continuing improvement in specialist services for age-related needs such as stroke and falls.</p>

	<p pid="b.1028W.2/1">All national health service trusts make an informed choice regarding the appropriate percentage of single room provision in new or refurbished developments, based on clinical and operational considerations such as site restrictions and affordability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.2/2">Data is held centrally on 33 private finance initiative and public capital funded new hospital schemes currently under construction or in procurement (capital value over &pound;25 million and approved by the Department). Details of these schemes which have a total value of some &pound;6.5 billion, have been placed in the Library and show the percentage of single rooms being provided in the construction or proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.2/3">The Department's guidance for new hospital developments is that the proportion of single rooms should aim to be 50 per cent., but should not fall below 20 per cent., and must be higher than the facilities they are replacing. The policy and design guidance for the provision of single rooms in mental health accommodation is 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.2/4">For the existing health estate, the Department makes a retrospective collection of information about the number of available beds at each NHS trust site and the proportion of those beds that are in single rooms. This information has also been placed in the Library. As the data is collected on a site rather than a ward basis, it is not possible separately to identify the number of single rooms each trust may use 'specifically to deliver geriatric care, children's services, intensive care or maternity services. Information about single room provision in the specific trust types requested (acute, mental health and learning disability) has also been placed in the Library.</p>

Due to an error, the figure given for 2006-07 related to the position for England and Wales when it should have reflected the position in England for which the correct figure in 2006-07 is 28.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1031W.3/1">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has not been detected anywhere in the world since the last case in 2004. The Department works with its EU partners through the Health Security Committee, the European Commission's Early Warning and Response System and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to monitor emerging health threats and ensure rapid notification of any cases. The measures put in place during the previous global outbreak demonstrated that outbreaks of SARS can be contained and a global pandemic prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.3/2">The Department also works in close collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) which maintains vigilance to the possibility of re-emergence of SARS, and would co-ordinate the international response to an outbreak. Case definitions for SARS cases have been internationally agreed and through the Global Alert and Response Network the UK will be rapidly notified of cases of SARS occurring anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.3/3">The Department has developed a contingency plan in case this disease re-emerges, and has agreed the appropriate public health response for SARS. This plan is based upon our response to that outbreak and our generic preparedness for dealing with any infectious disease outbreak or newly emerging threat, and takes account of WHO guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.3/4">The integrated public health and health service response to any SARS cases occurring in the UK would focus upon rapid detection of disease, preventing person to person transmission, containing the outbreak and provision of appropriate patient care. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) also developed detailed advice for clinicians on the rapid detection and diagnosis of infection and treatment of patients. The plan and guidance documents are not currently displayed on the Department's or the HPA's website as the disease has not been present globally since 2004, but would be activated upon notification of a new SARS case anywhere in the world.</p>

In response, the Afghanistan Ministry of Education (MoE), the DoE and the Governor of Helmand agreed a joint education plan, which is now under implementation. The plan is financed by the Danish Government through the UK-led provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Helmand, with a budget of $6 million for 2008. As well as the construction of schools and dormitories and refurbishment of the DoE, the programme will provide teacher training and support to high school students from districts across Helmand.</p>

In Musa Qala one school has been opened with fifty teachers registered. The building of three more schools in Musa Qala has been contracted, and one is already under construction. There has also been an increased number of requests for the construction of schools in Lashkar Gah, Nahr-e Saraj (Gereshk), Nawa, Nad Ali and Garmsir.</p>

	<p pid="b.1033W.5/1">The Department for International Development is helping to combat malaria through our country programmes and through our support of international organisations and research.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/2">In Malawi, DFID is providing &pound;100 million to support the health sector programme in over six years. This includes support to Malawi's National Malaria Strategy, which prioritises malaria prevention, case management, treatment and education. To date, over 2.5 million insecticide-treated nets have been distributed. Over one-third of pregnant women and under-fives now sleep under bed nets, and the reported number of clinical episodes of malaria has declined by one-third.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/3">In Tanzania, we provide general budget support to Government. This amounted to &pound;105 million in 2007-08. Approximately 17 per cent. of the national budget was provided to the Ministry of Health which has a programme of action to tackle malaria. In addition, DFID has provided &pound;14 million over a period of nine years from 1998 to 2007 to the Smartnet programme, an initiative to increase the use and treatment of bed nets to protect people, particularly in rural areas from infection. A nationwide survey conducted in April 2007 showed that 63 per cent. of pregnant women and 69 per cent. of under-fives slept under a net the previous night.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/4">DFID does not have bilateral programmes in Senegal and Mali. However, some of the international organisations we support like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria work in these countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.5/5">DFID is one of the biggest contributors to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, which accounts for nearly 64 per cent. of all international financing for malaria. To date, the fund has approved a total of US $10.8 billion to more than 550 grants in 136 countries; it has disbursed US $5.5 billion. 25 per cent. of approved funding is for malaria programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1035W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not support projects which specifically target trafficking or child labour in the cocoa industry in West Africa. DFID supports a wide range of activities that tackle the underlying poverty which makes children vulnerable to trafficking and exploitative labour in cocoa production and other industries. In Ghana, one of the largest cocoa producing countries in the region, this includes support to ensure all children are able to go to school, helping the mainstreaming of children's concerns in key Government programmes and policies, and supporting the development of the national social protection strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1035W.6/2">We support the work of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) whose technical assistance programmes help governments to tackle trafficking and implement labour standards. In addition we work with civil society and business organisations to promote fair, ethical and sustainable trade.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036W.5/3">In the DRC, the Department for International Development (DFID) makes the bulk of its humanitarian contributions through the UN's global Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF), and through a national pooled fund.

For both funds, the decision as to how the money is spent is at the discretion of the UN.

Since 2000 DFID has spent &pound;42 million through our Rural Access programme and Rural and Rural Community Infrastructure Works programmes. The underlying rationale for this support is that roads provide people with the means to connect to markets, improve their incomes and escape poverty sustainably. According to the World Bank, the increased connectivity provided through this support has been a major factor in reducing poverty in Nepal from 43 per cent. to 31 per cent. in the past ten years. The economic rate of return for these investments is estimated at between 21 per cent. and 38 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043W.3/1">The Department for International Development has major ongoing programmes of support for universal primary education in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, and is currently developing a large programme of support in Pakistan where progress lags far behind. Our support in each country forms (or will form in the case of Pakistan) part of joint-donor support to national strategies and programmes for &quot;Education for All&quot;: these include increasing and ensuring greater equity of access to schools, improving the quality of children's learning experience and strengthening the overall management of education systems. We support improvements to, and actively engage in, monitoring so we and partner Governments are better able to measure progress and identify continuing challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.3/2">As a result of these national programmes, India has enrolled an additional 27 million children in primary schools since 2003; primary enrolment in Nepal stood at 87 per cent. in 2006, and there has been an 11 per cent. increase in enrolment between 2000 and 2005 in Bangladesh. Each of these three countries have also made significant progress on educating girls: Bangladesh has achieved gender parity; Nepal and India are close. Improved monitoring enables us to work with Government and others to meet remaining challenges. Despite the considerable progress noted in enrolment, achievement of universal primary education in South Asia remains threatened particularly by high drop out rates, low levels of learning achievement and inclusion of the poorest. These issues now receive increased attention in national education plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has engaged intensively with international partners about the funding problems being experienced by the World Food Programme's Humanitarian Air Service (HAS) in Sudan. We are encouraging the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) to provide longer term funding for HAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.5/2">In addition, DFID has urged the UN to consider the case for increased funding for the HAS. As a first step, an additional US$4m has already been made available and a further grant of US$2 million is under active consideration. These additional funds come from the Common Humanitarian Fund for Sudan, to which DFID has contributed &pound;40 million this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.0/1">Current estimates indicate around 1.4 million Zimbabweans have fled to neighbouring states; the vast majority (around one million) to South Africa, with Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia and Malawi taking the remainder. However, the true numbers are almost impossible to obtain, particularly as many travel illegally. The United Nations High Commission for refugees classifies the vast majority of these people as economic migrants rather than refugees.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.3/1">The World Food programme estimates that around 300,000 people will be dependent on food aid this month in Zimbabwe. However, many people are currently surviving on the recent harvest. With the start of the hungry season in August, numbers requiring food aid are predicted to increase to a peak of around &pound;4.1 million in January 2009. These figures reflect food aid needs only; they do not account for other forms of humanitarian assistance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.6/1">The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that around 1.5 million people are being affected by the Zimbabwe Government's suspension of NGO activity in Zimbabwe. If the suspension extends into July and beyond, this number will rise. The longer the suspension goes on, the more serious the impact on relief efforts. WFP's main feeding programme is due to scale up from August and should reach around four million people at the height of the hungry season in early 2009. Absence of large scale feeding programmes in the second half of the year could lead to high levels of malnutrition and increased mortality.</p>
