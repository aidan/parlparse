	<p pid="a.979W.3/1">DFID provides targeted project support to tackle leprosy through the Leprosy Mission in India and the Leprosy Relief Association in Brazil. This funding supports community based efforts to improve access to care, reduce stigma and rehabilitate those affected. DFID commitment to these projects for 2005&ndash;6 is &pound;196,453.

The European Union is also making a major contribution. Other leading donors include Norway and Sweden. So far the overall donor response has fallen short of levels of funding requested by the UN. We will be reviewing our own funding next week when the UN issues an updated and revised appeal. We hope that other donors will follow our lead.</p>

DFID supports programmes in this area, in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), both from DFID resources and from Her Majesty's Government Global and African Conflict Prevention Pools.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/2">For example, in the last year DFID has provided:</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Ongoing support to NGO network monitoring and reporting on children affected by armed conflict across the world, both as child soldiers and as non-combatants.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.5/6" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> In Uganda: support to war affected children and youth (including former child soldiers) in the northern areas through a variety of regional and international organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/7" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): support to UNICEF in a disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration (DDR) programme for children associated with armed groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/8" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> In Sudan: support to UNICEF in child soldier DDR and the return, reunification and reintegration of vulnerable children; support to a Preparatory Support Programme for DDR in Sudan, which will include a major focus on children associated with fighting forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.5/9" class="indent"><i>(g)</i> In Liberia: support to UNICEF for a programme on Education and Reintegration for Children Associated with the Fighting Forces, plus support to a broad-based Liberia Disarmament, Demobilisation, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Programme, which will include child soldiers.</p>

	<p pid="a.984W.2/1">In June 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and concluded that Lesotho's debt levels were sustainable. This means it does not classify as a heavily indebted poor country (HIPC).

	<p pid="a.984W.5/1">The UK cancelled all eligible bilateral aid loans to Lesotho in 1979 under the Retrospective Terms Adjustment programme. Only one loan remains outstanding to the UK, with &pound;329,000 due as the UK's share of a loan made with other, then European Economic Countries (EEC) member states through the World Bank. The UK is in the process of agreeing debt relief treatment on this loan with the other creditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.5/2">Lesotho does not have any outstanding debt to CDC (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation), but does have &pound;1.66 million of outstanding debts to the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). These cannot be cancelled by the ECGD outside of an international agreement by the Paris Club of Government creditors without full compensation to the ECGD by DFID. This would involve re-allocation of DFID's budget at the expense of other poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.984W.5/3">Lesotho is not a heavily indebted poor country (HIPC), and so is not eligible for the exceptional debt relief offered under the HIPC initiative. However, the UK is committed to ensuring debt relief for all low-income countries that can use the resources effectively for poverty reduction. DFID is currently providing assistance to the Government of Lesotho to strengthen its financial management systems. Once the country's public expenditure management systems are sufficiently robust to meet the entry criteria, the UK will begin paying 10 per cent. of Lesotho's debt service payments to the World Bank and African Development Bank under our multilateral debt relief initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.985W.2/2" class="indent">&pound;3.5 million to the World Food Programme's Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation (&pound;1 million in December 2005 and &pound;2.5 million in February 2006);</p>

	<p pid="a.985W.2/6" class="indent">&pound;500,000 (approximately) being emergency medical and nutritional work of existing programmes in the drought affected areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.2/7">On multilateral aid&mdash;most of the funding provided through UN agencies is earmarked to specific activities and is therefore included in the bilateral assistance above. The UK share of the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) expenditure is 17.25 per cent. Current ECHO expenditure in Somalia in response to the drought is &euro;1,358,233. The UK share is therefore &euro;237,689, or &pound;164,020.96. The UK also contributes to other multilateral organisations, some of which may have contributed in response to the drought&mdash;for example the African Development bank has said it will provide $500,000 to the World Food Programme (WFP) for its operations in Somalia. However as these agencies will not report expenditure incurred in 2006 until the end of 2007, it is not possible to calculate an imputed UK share at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.2/8">The UN issued a revised appeal for Somalia on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase> for humanitarian operations for 1.7 million people that the UN judges are in need of urgent assistance. Of these it is estimated that 915,000 are experiencing a humanitarian emergency in the drought affected parts of southern and central Somalia. The revised appeal raises the amount requested for humanitarian operations from $174 million to $327 million; just over half of this is for food aid. Current contributions and commitments amount to $95.3 million. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor after the US.</p>

	<p pid="a.986W.5/1">The political and security situation in much of south and central Somalia makes the provision of aid very difficult. Our assessments are led by the impact of:</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/2" class="indent">competition for food, pasture and water that are made scarce by drought;</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/3" class="indent">political conflict in the Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs);</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/4" class="indent">conflict for relief supplies and the contracts to provide them; and</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/5" class="indent">inter-clan/faction conflict such as that in Mogadishu.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/6">To minimise the risks, DFID works closely with other donors to support UN-led activity. Somaliland and Puntland are better governed and more secure, making delivery of assistance easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/7">However, the establishment of the Transitional Federal Institutions provides the best opportunity for bringing lasting peace and governance to Somalia. The recent convening of the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) in Baidoa, is a positive step forward after almost a year of political division. Parliament is the only institution which can give legitimacy to the transitional process and, as the most inclusive body of the TFIs, it needs to begin to operate. The parliamentary session in Baidoa marks the start of the resumption of the process of restoring central governance to Somalia. The international community agrees that supporting it is a priority, and we, with other donors, are providing funds for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.986W.5/8">The recent outbreak of heavy fighting in Mogadishu threatens the wider reconciliation process. I hope that those involved will stop the conflict and reach a settlement. Such fighting, together with the drought, currently worst affecting the south, demonstrates again why Somalia so badly needs a new government to bring stabilityA; and restore human rights and dignity to the people. DFID has responded to the drought with contributions totalling &pound;7 million since December 2005; and our wider programme to help rebuild Somalia's destroyed social and governance sectors, and those in Somaliland, continues. This includes support to the restoration of public safety and security in Somalia, focusing on the re-establishment of policing, with &pound;600,000 this year through the United Nations Development Programme. We also support the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in developing the National Security and Stabilisation Plan requested by the UN Security Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.987W.2/1">The immediate cause of the current crisis in Somalia is an unusually severe drought. However, Somalia has been without a recognised central Government since 1992, and has seen repeated political conflict. This has certainly contributed to the severity of the current crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/2">An effective central authority could:</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/3" class="indent">target resources to the worst affected communities;</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/4" class="indent">help ensure the provision of basic services; and</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/5" class="indent">could contribute to the safety and security of relief operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/6">A government could also play a key role in co-ordinating development efforts in the country to reduce the impact of natural disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.2/7">The UK is helping to end the political instability by assisting with the establishment of the transitional federal institutions. The Transitional Parliament is currently meeting in Baidoa. Although there are considerable risks, as demonstrated by the continuing fighting in the capital Mogadishu, we believe this is the best opportunity yet for moving Somalia forward.</p>

We have received advice from the South East Regional Transport Board on its priorities for funding major transport schemes within its indicative allocation. The Board has given a high priority to this scheme, and recommends it receives funding for construction from 2008&ndash;09 onwards. We are currently considering this advice, and expect to set out decisions on the way forward later in the spring.</p>

It should be noted that in some circumstances an individual plan may be for more than one port or harbour. 63 of these plans have been updated in the last 5 years in order to obtain re-approval under the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.6/1">There are a range of chemicals that may have endocrine disrupting effects, and these can come from a variety of sources. Many chemicals considered to be endocrine disrupters (EDCs) have been subject to bans or other regulations for some time, such as the pesticide dieldrin. Measures have already been taken on antifouling paints based on tributyltin (TBT) compounds that were found to cause endocrine disrupting effects in some marine organisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.6/2">More generally, where particular chemicals have been strongly implicated as EDCs, the UK has proposed that these should be subject to a full risk assessment under European Regulations, so that where risks are identified European-wide measures are taken to control them. Endocrine disrupting chemicals will also be considered for authorisation under the new REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.6/3">My Department has also invested in research and development to improve our understanding of the risks to the environment of endocrine disrupting chemicals from other sources. In addition, an Endocrine Disruptor Demonstration Programme is soon to commence aimed at testing the effectiveness of various measures to remove EDCs from the effluent of sewage treatment works and informing future regulatory decisions.</p>

A further study, part of the EDIT (Endocrine Disruption in Invertebrates and Top Predators) Programme, costing around 0.5million in total, has been conducted on the top predator, pike. A new collaborative research programme (EDCAT-Endocrine Disruption in Catchments) has recently been commissioned to look into possible impacts of endocrine disrupting sewage discharges on roach and sticklebacks at the population level; EDCAT will cost around &pound;1.4 million in its initial phase alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/3">We have established specific programmes of research on endocrine disruption in the marine environment, including the &pound;1.5 million EDMAR (Endocrine Disruption in the Marine Environment) Programme, which conducted studies on flounder, goby, blenny and migratory trout and salmon. Additional research has focused on cod.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/4">Work is now being conducted to develop an understanding of the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals upon sensitive stages in the development of fish and to establish international test protocols for screening new chemicals for endocrine disrupting effects using the stickleback.

	<p pid="a.1003W.6/1">The fact that the full complement of Apache Attack Helicopter (AH) pilots will not be achieved by the target date of July 2006 is due to a combination of factors. The main reason was a shortfall of qualified helicopter instructors (QHIs). This has been an enduring issue that has had a marked impact on the quantity of pilots being trained for front line operational units. The original assumption (based on our experience of Lynx and Gazelle training, and advice from subject matter experts) was that a single instructor could train two AH students. However, once training began it became apparent that this assumption was unworkable and the training effort had to be switched in order to generate more instructors. This effectively reduced the pilot delivery rate to the field army. The plan to generate more instructors was further undermined when six QHIs elected to leave the Army shortly after the expiry of their four year time bar. Given that it takes up to 11 months to train an AH instructor, as opposed to six months to convert a pilot, the output of AH qualified pilots has remained lower than planned. Other factors, such as aircraft availability and weather, have exacerbated the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1007W.12/1">Site investigations are currently being carried out to characterise the nature of the ground conditions and the level of contamination. These investigations will be carried out in accordance with current industry best practice to identify the exact type and concentrations. The investigations are following the principles set out in the Intrusive Investigation Method Statement approved by the London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest, the Environment Agency and British Waterways. I am arranging to have copies of the statement placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.12/2">The London Development Agency has been informed by the London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest that there are no part IIA designated contaminated sites within the Olympic Park boundary. The boroughs have been consulted throughout the preparation of the environmental impact assessment, during the site investigation phase and will continue to be consulted throughout the development of the remediation and validation works.</p>
	<p pid="a.1007W.12/3">Generic site specific soil target values have been generated and are detailed in a Global Remediation Strategy which has been reviewed and approved by the same regulators noted above. Once the site investigation is complete, detailed remediation strategies, including generation of site specific clean up targets, will be prepared and agreed with the regulators as appropriate prior to implementation and validation. All of the sites to be remediated will be subject to detailed planning applications.</p>

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) was consulted in December 2002 about the memorials design, and in June 2004 was asked to advise on any further safety measures that should be taken before the memorial was opened to the public. RoSPA's recommendations were implemented.</p>

It also consulted The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) which advised that, because of the unusual nature of the site, safety measures would need to be closely monitored during the first months of operation until patterns of visitor behaviour became clear. When a persistent problem was identified, The Royal Parks acted swiftly to close the Memorial while designers, engineers and health and safety experts revised the management of the site.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013W.8/1">The total number of people who have received cold weather payments so far in the winter of 2005&ndash;06 in Great Britain is estimated to be 650,000. A breakdown by parliamentary constituency is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.8/2" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.8/3" class="indent">1. This figure is rounded to the nearest 1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.8/4" class="indent">2. If the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0&deg;C or below over seven consecutive days at a weather station, then a cold weather payment is triggered&quot; for all eligible customers whose postcode is linked to that weather station.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013W.8/5" class="indent">3. The number of people who are estimated to have qualified because the weather station linked to their postcode has triggered was obtained from the benefit systems at the end of October 2005. It excludes people on income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance who qualified because they had a disabled child aged five or over and who received support for that child via child tax credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the chief executive. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Hilary Reynolds</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive is currently unavailable as he is communicating the Operational Improvement Plan to all Agency staff. I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the average time is for the Child Support Agency cases to spend in <i>(a)</i> the pre-application stage <i>(b)</i> the application stage <i>(c)</i> the information-gathering stage and <i>(d)</i> the calculation and collection set-up stage before first payment is received for (i) cases from parents with care receiving income support or income related jobseeker's allowance (ii) cases from parents with care not on income support or income-related jobseeker's allowance and (iii) all cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/5" class="indent">The CSA does not collect data in exactly these categories but such information as is available is set out in the tables attached, together with notes describing each category.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/6" class="indent">The Agency defines an application as having cleared the overall application process if a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non resident parent is in place. Additionally, since not all Child Support Agency applications result in a calculation, an application is also defined as cleared if the case is closed, the parent with care is identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision, or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case as opposed to a new application.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/7" class="indent">The time from application clearance to first payment represents the first stage of the compliance and enforcement part of the process, as by this point the onus will now be, to a large extent, on the non-resident parent to accept financial responsibility for their children and comply with the request for maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/8" class="indent">As you will notice, many of the cases yet to clear individual stages of the process are more than a year old, a level of performance which is clearly unacceptable to our clients. In the Operational Improvement Plan announced by the Secretary of State on 9th February 2006, the Agency set itself a target of reducing the backlog of uncleared new applications to the point where, by March 2009, 80% of applications will be cleared within 12 weeks and there will be no backlog in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/9" class="indent">I hope you find this information helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1016W.2/64">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/65">1. Intake type refers to the parent with care's (PWC) benefit status at the time that their application is received, and not their current benefit status nor the status at the point when the case is cleared. The PWC's benefit status may change during the course of their application being processed and these figures make no provision to take account of such changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/66">2. The pre-application stage is where a potential application is screened to establish whether it is valid. Pre-application clearance is where the case either progresses to the application stage, a reduced benefit decision (RBD) is applied, good cause is accepted, or the case is closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/67">3. A case enters application stage where it has been accepted as valid at the pre-application stage. An application clearance occurs when a calculation is carried out, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted or the case is subsequently closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/68">4. A case enters post calculation stage where clearance at the application stage results in a calculation being carried out. Post calculation clearance is where a collection schedule is set up, an MD arrangement is set up immediately after calculation, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted, the case is subsequently closed, or the calculation is classified as being a nil liability meaning that no further action is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/69">5. The first payment stage is the time between a collection schedule being set up and a first payment being made to the PWC, or a maintenance direct arrangement being put in place. There are an additional 2,000 cases where payment was made to the PWC prior to a schedule or maintenance direct arrangement being agreed (i.e. voluntary payments), which have been excluded from the first table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.2/70">6. For those cases that do not result in a calculation, clearance of the overall application process can occur at any stage. Cases can also have cleared individual stages, but still be part way through the overall process. This means that, mathematically, neither the average time to clear the whole application process, nor the age of all uncleared cases can be obtained through summing the components presented in the table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019W.2/6" class="indent">Since March 2003 Child Support applications have been dealt with under the new scheme. The new scheme introduced the Child Maintenance Premium, this is a &pound;10 per week disregard of maintenance when calculating parent with care entitlement to Income Support. The Child Maintenance Premium was introduced to provide an incentive to parents with care to co-operate with the Agency and also to selectively target additional support to children in the poorest households. A consequence of child maintenance premium has been a reduction in the amount of maintenance collected by the Agency and paid to the Secretary of State to offset the annual cost of Income Support administered by Job Centre Plus.</p>

	<p pid="a.1026W.5/1">China and Iran have significant mutual energy interests. Iran has approximately 9 per cent. of the world's oil reserves; China imports around 13 per cent. of her oil from Iran. In October 2004, China and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on exploiting the Yadavaran oilfield in southern Iran, which has proven crude reserves of more than 30 billion barrels. According to official Chinese media, this provides for Chinese commercial involvement in developing the field on a buyback basis, and for China to purchase from Iran 10 million tons of liquefied natural gas a year over 25 years. The details of commercial arrangements between China and Iran are a matter for those two countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1027W.0/1">We continue to have serious concerns at Iran's treatment of religious minorities including the Baha'is. The Baha'i International Community report a marked deterioration in the situation of their co-religionists in Iran during the past 12 months. Baha'is have reportedly faced arbitrary detention, harassment, destruction of property and a hostile campaign in the media. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, Asma Jahangir, expressed concern about an alleged instruction by Iran's Supreme Leader ordering the command headquarters of the armed forces to identify Baha'is and monitor their activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1027W.6/1">The UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, Asma Jahangir, said in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase> that a confidential letter from the chairman of the command headquarters of the Iranian armed forces had been brought to her attention. According to Ms Jahangir, the letter says that Iran's Supreme Leader has instructed the command headquarters to identify persons who adhere to the Baha'i faith and to monitor their activities. In the letter the command headquarters reportedly requests that the Ministry of Intelligence, the revolutionary guard and the police force collect any and all information about members of the Baha'i faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027W.6/2">We share Ms Jahangir's concern at this letter, and hope that the Iranian authorities will clarify their policy towards the Baha'i community as a matter of urgency. There can be no justification for the Iranian authorities to monitor individuals simply because they adhere to a particular religion. The alleged letter adds to the evidence that discrimination against the Baha'i community in Iran is increasing. Reports suggest that Baha'is have been subjected to harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrest and a hostile campaign in the media. Iran's Chambers of Commerce have also reportedly been ordered to create lists of all Baha'i businesses. In December 2005, a Baha'i, Mr. Dhaibullah Mahrami died in custody in unclear circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027W.6/3">Ministers and officials have pressed the Iranian authorities on many occasions to address the discrimination suffered by the Baha'i community.

	<p pid="a.1029W.3/1">The nature of Maoists' clandestine organisation and operations makes it very difficult to assess how many insurgents there are in Nepal. A very approximate estimate, drawn from a number of sources, including open source material, would suggest that the core cadre of active armed insurgents is about 8,000&ndash;12,000 strong. However, we estimate that there may be up to 20,000 or 30,000 other activists who may not be armed but will be heavily involved, for instance in detonating small bombs, organising logistics, carrying out extortion. In addition to this, there are probably thousands more political supporters and sympathisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.6/1">One of the main aims of the caution, as stated in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders Circular 30/2005 issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform is to reduce the likelihood of re-offending. It is not possible to set out definitive rules on the circumstances in which cautions are appropriate, because their use involves the exercise of discretion by the police who have to take into account a number of considerations in each case. These considerations include whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.6/2">The circular advises that both national and any locally held records must be checked before a caution is given. If the suspect has previously received a caution, then a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), then a caution can be used. If evidence of repeat cautioning, of the kind referred to in the hon. Gentleman's question, suggests this is an issue in a number of other areas, we will consider revisiting the guidance on this point.</p>

	<p pid="a.1035W.11/2">The new strategic police authority will need to take the particular needs of North Wales into account in its resource planning. It will be for the authority to ensure that it meets the policing needs in all of its constituent areas. The roll-out of neighbourhood policing teams to every area of England and Wales underpins the restructuring programme, and strategic forces will help to safeguard local policing by reducing the need to abstract officers from neighbourhood policing teams. Therefore people will see a significant improvement in their local police service, whatever the eventual overall structure.</p>

This built upon the strategy developed since 2001 that included: Over &pound;26 million invested in safer custody arrangements, through the Safer Local Prisons Programme. 2,650 'Listeners' (Samaritan-trained prisoner peer supporters) recruited across the estate. Suicide Prevention Coordinators (or their equivalents) placed in all prisons to provide a focal point for and increase the profile of suicide prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1038W.5/2">The strategy is aimed at protecting all prisoners, though the Government recognises that prisoners are particularly at risk of self-harm and suicide in their early period in custody, whether sentenced or on remand. Prisoners in early custody are therefore subject to a number of policies and practices designed to enhance their safety. These include health screening upon arrival that includes an assessment of risk of suicide or self-harm, the use of peer supporters ('Insiders') to offer information and support to new prisoners, and First Night and Induction procedures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-29a.60745.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-29a.1040W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" colnum="1040W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060329/text/60329w17.htm#60329w17.html_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/1">I recognise the important economic and cultural contribution that international students make to the United Kingdom. We welcome genuine students and do not want to dissuade them from coming to the country. There is no evidence that potential students are attracted to apply for a course in a particular country because they are eligible for a right of appeal should they be refused entry clearance. We do not, therefore, believe that the removal of appeal rights will be a disincentive to student applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/2">There is no right of appeal against refusal of entry clearance in many other countries, for instance Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Under the new points based system, students will be granted entry clearance on the basis of transparent and objective criteria. At the moment entry clearance officers are required to make subjective judgements in accordance with the immigration rules. For example, the officer must assess an applicant's intention and ability to study.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/3">The points based system will abolish this requirement, and an offer from an approved institution will act as a proxy for intention and ability. This will be made possible by the Home Office and education institutions working in partnership to share the responsibility of ensuring that genuine students can come to the country while preventing abuse of the immigration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/4">Appeal rights will be removed simultaneously with the introduction of the points based system. We plan to implement the new system in phases. This will mean, for example, that as tier four is implemented, and so appeal rights for students will be removed. The systemic improvements brought by the points based system will facilitate the removal of appeal rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/5">In lieu of a full right of appeal, people will be able to apply for administrative review of the refusal of entry clearance. If a person is refused, the entry clearance officer's notice will set out precisely why the decision has been made, referring back to the criteria for which points are awarded. When applying for administrative review the applicant must set out which aspect of the decision, as justified in the refusal letter, was incorrect. Administrative review will provide applicants with a swift and effective remedy where a factual error has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/6">We are taking additional steps to ensure that there is a high quality of entry clearance decisions. The role of the Independent Monitor will be enhanced, for example, to provide greater oversight of the operation. More resources are also being invested in training entry clearance officers and their managers, and a network of regional managers has recently been recruited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/7">An amendment was also made to the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill at Lords third reading stage. This will require a report to be laid before Parliament on the entry clearance operation and administrative review within three years of the removal of appeal rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.1051W.9/1">Government support for concessionary fares is funded via the revenue support grant settlement. Revenue support grant is an unhypothecated block grant. This means that authorities are able to spend the grant on any service. It is not therefore possible to say how much grant an authority received for a particular service.</p>

Primary care trusts and national health service trusts together with strategic health authorities are expected to use this to determine into which category an individual service falls. The current definition is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/2" class="indent">Type one A&amp;E department, which is a consultant led 24-hour service with full resuscitation facilities and designated accommodation for the reception of A&amp;E patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/3" class="indent">Type two A&amp;E department, which is a consultant led single speciality A&amp;E service, for example ophthalmology or dental, with designated accommodation for the reception of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/4" class="indent">Type three A&amp;E department, which is other type of A&amp;E or minor injury units with designated accommodation for the reception of A&amp;E patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/5">A type three department may be doctor led or nurse led. A defining characteristic of a service qualifying as a type three department is that it treats at least minor injuries and illnesses, for example sprains, and can be routinely accessed without appointment. A service mainly or entirely appointment based, for example a general practitioner practice or outpatient clinic, is not a type three A&amp;E service even though it may treat a number of patients with minor illness or injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/6" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1057W.2/7" class="indent">Type three services include all NHS walk in centres and other open access treatment services offering at least minor injury/illness services, whether located alongside a main A&amp;E department or at another location.</p>

	<p pid="a.1061W.2/2">The original target to have at least 9,000 workers in the drug treatment sector has therefore already been reached. There is steady progress being made towards achieving the new revised target of 11,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/3">These figures include all permanent and temporary staff whose primary function is drug treatment in the community. It does not include shared care general practitioners or drug workers in prison or all staff working in drug intervention programmes (DIP).</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/4">Prisons have approximately 1,500 specialist drug workers in prisons who may potentially undertake drug assessments. This comprises of 850 counselling, assessment, referral, advice and through care workers and 650 drug treatment programme staff. These figures are the total number of staff who may potentially undertake drug assessments. However, it may be the case that assessment work is undertaken by some staff and not others depending on team arrangements. The figures for how local or individual teams arrange their working practices are not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/5">Additionally, there are drugs workers in every custody suite, as part of the drug intervention programme, who, where necessary, conduct required assessments for offenders. Part of the planning for the implementation of the 2005 Drugs Act included working with local drugs teams to ensure that sufficient resources be available to conduct these assessments for offenders. As part of this process all areas implementing the Required Assessment provisions of the Drugs Act 2005, the drug intervention programme intensive areas, were asked to quantify the extra drug workers required to deliver this and additional funding has been allocated. Funding was allocated for some 370 new workers to deliver these required assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/6">We do not hold figures for GPs involved in assessment centrally but the percentage of GP practices recorded by the Healthcare Commission in 2003&ndash;04 within a shared care scheme for problem drug misusers was 35 per cent. The NTA set a 2005&ndash;06 target of 35 per cent. of GPs working within shared care. The results of this target will be published in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1061W.2/7">In addition, by September 2005, 1,894 health care professionals had completed the Department funded Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) drug misuse e-learning module, 562 had attended face to face training arising from this, and 776 GPs had attended the more advanced RCGP certificate. A further 130 GPs were attending the course in September 2005. Over the same period nearly 300 other primary care staff, for example nurses and pharmacists, have attended the certificate training.</p>

Regulation 3 of the Water Fluoridation (Consultation) Regulations 2005 no. 921 requires SHAs to publish details of the proposal in one or more newspapers circulating in the area and in such other accessible media as the SHA considers appropriate to bring the proposal to the attention of individuals affected and bodies with an interest. SHAs are also required to give notice of the proposal to every local authority affected by the proposal. They are also required to seek the views of their local authority at every step of a consultation on fluoridation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062W.2/11">The response to the consultations will indicate the extent of support for a proposal and SHAs are required to take account of the cogency of the representations and their relevance to health arguments. A SHA cannot base its decision solely on a simple count of the representations for or against the proposal. In making its decision, the SHA should consider publishing a summary of responses, any changes made to the proposal as a result, a summary of the next steps and the reasons for the decision in line with the Cabinet Office code of practice on consultations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065W.6/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is unable to provide reliable figures for more recent assessment of Type II variations due to transitional implementation issues associated with the introduction of a new information management system. Overall approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases. However, urgent cases are being processed promptly. The MHRA is aware of the impact these delays are having on pharmaceutical company business and is taking a number of steps to improve its service levels. These include organisational restructuring, re-training of staff, voluntary schemes for extended working hours and information system performance enhancements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.2/1">It is for the Healthcare Commission to decide whether to undertake such an audit. Incontinence is distressing for children and young people and can be indicative of both physical and emotional problems; it can lead to bullying at school and cause emotional and behavioural problems. Standard six of the national service framework for children includes a section on paediatric incontinence. The standard recommends integrated paediatric incontinence services and endorses the existing guidance. The standard is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.2/3">The Commission is in discussions with departmental officials about its role in assessing the implementation of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services, which includes quality of care in incontinence services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.2/4">The modernisation agency produced a benchmarking tool for primary care trusts (PCTs) to evaluate their paediatric continence services, benchmark with other PCTs, and to share good practice. This is available online at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.6/1">Bishop Wulstan Catholic School in Warwickshire is a poorly performing school&ndash;only 12 per cent. of pupils achieved 5 A*-C grades at GCSE last year-that has experienced falling rolls-only 22 pupils are due to enter the school in September. Officials at my department have had a number of conversations with Warwickshire county council and the Archdiocese of Birmingham about the options available to secure better education for the pupils attending the school over the past few months. As the school has not been deemed by Ofsted to require special measures, the decision as to the future of the school is for the local authority to make rather than the Secretary of State, and therefore I can give no indication on the timing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.9/1">The assessment of the delivery of education business link activities falls under the remit of the Learning and Skills Council. Mark Haysom, Chief Executive of the LSC has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/3" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question about assessing the effect of business cooperating with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/4" class="indent">Preparing young people for the world of work and ensuring the country has the skills it needs are crucial goals for the LSC. That is why business and employer engagement with learners, and a step increase in vocational learning in our schools, are key objectives for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/5" class="indent">We are a key partner with the DfES in taking forward the Government's 14&ndash;19 agenda. This agenda has a vision of making all young people better prepared for their future employment, and giving them a wider choice of quality vocational qualifications than has been the case to date. The LSC is committed to putting this vision into effect through the 14&ndash;19 Implementation Plan published three months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/6" class="indent">Clearly, we need to do this together with all our partners and stakeholders, including business and employers. We already, of course, fund a wide range of school/business link activity through Education Business Link organisations, and there has been a number of evaluations and assessment of that activity. We also fund the Enterprise Adviser Service, and are close to completing an evaluation of that Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073W.9/7" class="indent">The Implementation Plan refers to our forthcoming consultation on education business link activity and the way we can support and promote greater and even more productive engagement between employers and young learners. We expect that consultation to gather the widest possible range of views on how we achieve our aims&mdash;for the benefit both of learners and of business. Should you have views on this issue that you would wish to share with us, I would be delighted to hear them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.0/1">The total number of secondary school initial teacher training places will reduce by 1,000 in each of the next two years. Places will fall for all subjects except maths and science in which subjects there are still the highest numbers of school vacancies. This reflects the projected fall in the secondary pupil population, which is expected to decline by about 30,000 pupils per year for the next 10 years</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.0/2">In setting the numbers of training places for PE, we take into account a number of specific factors affecting the subject, for example the extra demand for PE teachers from the creation of specialist sports colleges and the National School Sport Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.0/3">The latter creates demand for school sport co-ordinators in secondary schools, primary link teachers in primary schools, directors of sport in specialist sports colleges and partnership development managers for school sport partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080W.0/4">PE is in a relatively strong position having had a substantial increase in the number of training places allocated to it, most notably in 2003/04. It also has a lower than average national classroom teacher vacancy rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1083W.5/1">It is for individual schools and local authorities to determine staffing levels, having regard to the number of children with special educational needs, the range and complexity of SEN represented with a given school, the resources available and other relevant factors. School decisions will be informed by the Education Act 1996 which contains the current legal provisions applying to SEN, the SEN Code of Practice (2001) which provides statutory guidance, the associated SEN toolkit and other relevant publications, such as The Management of SEN Expenditure&quot; (DfES, May 2004), which gives detailed guidance on matters such as financial delegation, the division of responsibilities between schools and local authorities, maintained special schools and additionally resourced provision, and expenditure on independent and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083W.5/2">Previously, the then Department of Education and Science did issue a circular in December 1990, numbered 11/90 and entitled Staffing for pupils with special educational needs&quot;, outlining considerations local authorities and schools might bear in mind when determining staffing levels for pupils with SEN. Following representations to withdraw this on the grounds that it had become outdated and misleading, the Department signalled formally, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-20">20 September 2005</phrase>, its intention to withdraw 11/90. Comments and objections were invited from interested parties, namely the teacher associations, local government interests and special school organisations. In the light of these, which revealed no major objections, the Department confirmed its intention to withdraw the circular.</p>
