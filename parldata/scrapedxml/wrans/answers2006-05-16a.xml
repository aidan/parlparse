	<p pid="a.823W.3/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty'.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/2">The Department for Transport is currently assessing its policies in accordance with the duty and the results of this exercise will be included in its Disability Equality Scheme (DES). The DES will set out how the Department intends to meet its duty to promote disability equality including the arrangements in place to assess the impact of its activities together with an action plan outlining how it intends to improve outcomes for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/3">The Department for Transport is committed to an accessible public transport system in which disabled people have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/4">A great deal has already been achieved in this area. For example, we have introduced regulations under part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) making all new rail vehicles, buses and coaches accessible. Over 4,400 compliant rail vehicles are already in service and almost half the bus fleet is accessible. These improvements have already had a significant impact on the day-to-day mobility of disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/5">We are also implementing the transport provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The new Act contains measures amending the rail vehicle accessibility regime and will extend part 3 of the DDA 1995 (which deals with access to goods and services) to the operators of all land-based public transport, vehicle hire and breakdown services from <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.3/6">Transport infrastructure, such as stations and airports, is already covered by these provisions which require service providers to remove obstacles that mean disabled people find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to access services. Policy initiatives, such as the recently announced &quot;Access for All&quot; fund (a &pound;370 million ring-fenced resource available to improve access to railway stations) will provide further improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.825W.0/1">We will continue to monitor experience in other countries that introduce legislation requiring drivers to wear reflective vests when leaving their vehicles at the roadside following a breakdown or accident. If clear evidence starts to emerge that it is beneficial, we would look again at the need to legislate.</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.0/2">The Highway Code advises motorists and their passengers what action to take when leaving a vehicle at the roadside in the event of an accident or breakdown. The Department has also produced a leaflet, &quot;A Guide to Safer Motorway Driving&quot;, which also covers breakdowns. This advises drivers and their passengers where to stand after a breakdown, so that they are least vulnerable to being hit by other vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.0/3">We have reviewed this advice as part of the current major revision of the Highway Code. The public consultation, which began on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase> and ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-12">12 May</phrase>, includes proposed new advice to motorists in the section on breakdowns, which says</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;help other road users see you by wearing light coloured fluorescent clothing in daylight and reflective clothing at night or in poor visibility&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.0/5">We will now be considering all the responses to the consultation and the revised code should be issued next spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.825W.0/6">No assessment has been made as to whether motorists follow the guidance in the Highway Code on actions to be taken following an accident. Although failure to comply with the non-statutory rules in the code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, the code may be used in any court proceedings under the traffic acts to establish liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.827W.3/1">No specific assessment has beenmade of the effectiveness of SPECS time-over-distance cameras. However the independent four-year evaluation report of the national safety camera programme covered any SPECS cameras operating between April 2000 and March 2004. The independent academics concluded that SPECS cameras were equally as effective in reducing collisions and casualties as other fixed and red-light cameras. They also concluded that SPECS cameras have been particularly effective at reducing excessive speeds, which aredefined as 15 mph over the speed limit.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.13/1">Costs of processing early-day motions (EDMs) include the time of Clerks in vetting motions, costs of staff entering the data and costs of printing and publishing, which depend on the number of times motions are reprinted. EDMs vary in length and complexity and the number of names to them may be one or many. Processing and printing EDMs is only one of a number of tasks carried out by the staff involved and no realistic disaggregation can be made which can give a cost for all aspects of processing a single EDM. The best estimate available of the overall costs of printing and publishing early-day motions in 2005-06 is &pound;627,000, giving an average printing and publishing cost per EDM of &pound;290.</p>

In Africa there has been a reduction in the numbers of people living in poverty and in child deaths, increasing economic growth, and more children getting into school. HIV is also falling or stabilising in some African countries. Much more needs to be done, however, particularly on maternal mortality, girls' education and HIV. In Asia there has been progress in reducing income poverty. The number of children dying before their fifth birthday is decreasing and the number of children being cured of tuberculosis is increasing in many Asian countries. More progress is needed, however, if all the MDGs are to be achieved in Asia, particularly on gender equity.</p>

	<p pid="a.833W.5/1">The arrangements for mass disposal of carcases in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza are laid out in our Exotic Animal Disease Generic Contingency Plan. Commercial fixed plant incineration or rendering will be the first options for mass disposal of carcases. If incineration and rendering capacity has been exhausted, it may be necessary to consider the use of approved commercial landfill or on-farm burial. Mass pyres will not be used. My Department has already put in place arrangements with animal incinerator and rendering companies to ensure the minimum delay should there be an outbreak of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.833W.5/2">The disease control policies are set out in the Contingency Plan and it is our policy to cull birds only where this is justified and on the basis of sound veterinary, epidemiological and scientific advice. Any estimate of the number of birds which would need to be culled depends on these factors and the nature of this advice at the time. Key factors will include the virus strain, its pathogenicity, the location of the 'disease outbreak and international developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.833W.5/3">The available incineration and rendering capacity at any time will depend on the location of the outbreak, the time of year, breakdowns and other demands. Some 2,500 tonnes per week (equivalent to approximately 1.25 million chickens) would be available very quickly and a further 10-15,000 tonnes per week could be brought on stream within about two weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.834W.2/1">The infection rate within a flock will depend on the stage at which infection or disease is detected. The rate of spread and local epidemiology within a poultry population will be dependent on many factors, but once the virus is introduced into a holding its rate of spread within the flock will be strongly influenced by the host species, the virus strain and the production type. These factors are consistent in their impact for rates of infection in terms of different virus serotypes where rates typically approach 100 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.843W.3/2">Under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities have a duty to check their areas periodically for existing and potential statutory nuisances, and to take reasonably practicable steps to investigate complaints of statutory nuisances, including any dust, steam, smell or other effluvia arising on industrial, trade or business premises and being prejudicial to health or a nuisance. A &quot;premises&quot; may be a dwelling, place of business, land, beach, vesselor sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/3">Once satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists, or may occur or recur, a local authority must issue an abatement notice requiring that the nuisance be ceased or abated within a specified timescale. It is an offence to breach or fail to comply with an abatement notice. Upon summary conviction through the courts, fines of up to &pound;5,000 for domestic premises and &pound;20,000 for industrial, trade and industry premises may be issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/4">Some plants and processes that have the potential for emissions of offensive odours are regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, which are enforced by either the Environment Agency or local authorities depending on the type of installation. Plants and processes that are covered by these regulations are not subject to the statutory nuisance regime, in order to remove double jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/5">Defra recently published the &quot;Code of Practice on Odour Nuisance from Sewage Treatment Work&quot;. This aims to provide a framework under the statutory nuisance regime in England and Wales within which the appropriate regulators and sewerage undertakers can operate to minimise the likelihood and nuisance from odours. The code is available on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/6">In addition, Regulation (EC) 1774/2002 (enforced by the Animal By-Products Regulations 2005) lays down the rules for the collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and use or disposal of animal by-products in order to prevent these products from posing a risk to animal and public health. Plants that process material of animal origin are required to be approved by the Secretary of State in accordance with the regulation. The regulation also requires that animal by-products be transported in sealed new packaging or covered leak-proof containers or vehicles and that they be processed without undue delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/7">Vehicles on public highways are not &quot;premises&quot; within the statutory nuisance regime on odour. Emissions from new vehicles are regulated by means of the Motor Vehicles (EC Type Approval) Regulations 1998 or the Motor Vehicles (Type Approval for Goods Vehicles) (Great Britain) Regulations 1982. Emissions from in service vehicles are regulated by means of Regulation 61 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 as amended.</p>
	<p pid="a.843W.3/8">In addition, vehicles driven in a careless or anti-social manner (that is causing or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress) may be seized by the police under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002.</p>

	<p pid="a.846W.0/1">The First Air Quality Daughter Directive (1999/30/EC) sets binding limit values for nitrogen dioxide; a one hour mean (200 microgramme/m<sup>(3)</sup>) and an annual mean (40 microgramme/m<sup>(3)</sup>) to be met by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.0/2">Action is being taken at international, national and local level to tackle air pollution.

Local authorities have a duty to review and assess the air quality against nationally prescribed air quality objectives for seven main air pollutants. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the air quality objectives is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>

The system is used by Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff in the processing of SPS claims and is available to them from 6am to 9pm weekdays and 8am to 6pm at weekends. In 2005 RPA implemented a three-shift work pattern to maximise the utilisation of the system and thereby help address the demands of processing the first year of SPS claims.</p>

The prominent role we play within the Commission ensures no country can be in any doubt as to the importance we attach to whale conservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.2/2">I have written to new members of the IWC refuting the spurious claims that whales have a detrimental effect on fish stocks?an argument often advanced by whaling countries in support of whaling operations. I personally raise the issue of whaling with my international counterparts at every appropriate opportunity. I have also written to fellow UK Ministers with international contact urging them and their officials to take such opportunities as arise to raise the issue of the conservation of cetaceans in appropriate bilateral meetings, or in the margins of meetings.</p>

	<p pid="a.855W.2/1">In 1991, in what was then the Social Chapter, the EU provided for member states to reach agreement on certain aspects of social policy. The UK exercised its right to 'opt out' from the Social Chapter. In 1997 the UK Government decided it no longer wished to 'opt-out' of provisions in the Social Chapter. As a result the contents of the Social Chapter were incorporated into the Amsterdam treaty, coming into force in May 1999. The Statutory Instruments introduced by the DTI, implementing the four Social Chapter measures already agreed by the other member states prior to the UK ending its 'opt-out', are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/2" class="indent">Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination and Burden of Proof) Regulations 2001 (implementing Directive 98/52 which extended to the UK Directive 97/80 on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex). These provide that once a prima facie case of sex discrimination has been made in an employment tribunal claim, the burden of proof is placed on the defendant (usually the employer) who will need to demonstrate that sex discrimination has not occurred;</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/3" class="indent">The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (implementing Directive 98/23 which extended to the UK Directive 97/81 on the framework agreement on part-time work). These provide for entitlement of part-time workers to the same pro-rata terms and conditions of employment as full-time workers;</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/4" class="indent">The Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (implementing Directive 97/75 which extended to the UK Directive 96/34 on the framework agreement on parental leave). These provide for parents to have the right to 13 weeks unpaid leave for the purposes of caring for a child. The leave must be taken by the child's fifth birthday, or within 5 years of the child's placement for adoption;</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/5" class="indent">The Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 (implementing Directive 97/74 which extended to the UK Directive 94/45 on the establishment of European Works Council). These require companies with at least 1,000 employees in total across the member states and at least 150 workers in each of two or more of those member states, to establish structures for consulting workers on issues that affect them.</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/6">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in 1999, further Directives and Regulations have been adopted under Articles 136-139 of Title XI of the EC Treaty, i.e. the &quot;Social Provisions&quot; Chapter.</p>

	<p pid="a.856W.11/1">There is no proposed Management Buy Out (MBO) of the UKAEA and the UKAEA is not for sale. However, the Board of UKAEA is overseeing a fundamental restructuring of the organisation in line with Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA)'s published strategy and in accordance with UKAEA's published 2005 Corporate Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.11/2">UKAEA's Board is now transforming UKAEA into three distinct publicly owned entities. UKAEA will in part, continue as a non-departmental public body (NDPB) responsible for fusion research and development at Culham and the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus (HSIC). Secondly, UKAEA's nuclear sites at Dounreay, Harwell, Winfrith and Windscale will become companies able to be competed by the NDA. Thirdly we are creating a commercial subsidiary, NewCo, which with its Alliance industry partners CH2MHI11 and AMEC will compete in the future decommissioning market.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.11/3">The UKAEA Board is considering various options for NewCo's continuing commercial development. Any decisions in this regard will not impact on the HSIC which will continue to form part of the ongoing NDPB.</p>

The DII (F) contract was deliberately structured to allow for a level of change as it recognised that the impact of initiatives such as the efficiency review and the Ministry of Defence's own change programme would require a level of flexibility from the DII (F) Deliver Partner, ATLAS Consortium.</p>
	<p pid="a.862W.0/2">MOD and ATLAS are currently discussing the impact of the revised rollout schedule. However, the changes introduced so far are not significant, and we expect that the rollout of the first increment of DII (F) will remain within its financial approval envelope. Both the DII project team and the ATLAS consortium are working hard to meet the originally forecast 'Last User Live' date and are confident that the predicted benefits will be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/2" class="italic">Domestic water charges</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/3">From April 2007 unmeasured household charges for water and sewerage will be introduced. Both charges will consist of a standing charge (estimated at around &pound;55) and a variable element based on the capital value of each property as determined by the Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA) for the purposes of domestic rating. The Government intend to set the new household charges during the three-year period to 2009-10 to achieve the average level of charges that will apply in England and Wales in 2009-10. There will also be a low-income protection scheme. The Government's broad objective is to ensure that low-income households should not need to spend more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage charges. To achieve this a new affordability tariff will be available for those households which are eligible. This tariff will be based on income and will be set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person's pension credit guarantee as updated by Parliament each year. Additional protection in the form of lower caps will be set for those with properties valued at less than &pound;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/4">As many as 200,000 households (30 per cent. of all households) in Northern Ireland who presently qualify for rate rebate, housing benefit or the new Northern Ireland Rate Relief Scheme should benefit from this scheme. The affordability tariff will also extend to all 16 to 17-year-old householders and to children leaving care up to the age of 21.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/5">The new charges will be phased in over a three-year period, with households paying one-third of the full charge in 2007-08, two-thirds in 2008-09 and the full amount in 2009-10. The changes to the non-domestic regime will be introduced on the same basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/6">Also from April 2007, meters will be available to pensioner households who apply. Meters will also be installed in all new properties and first time connections. Where meters are installed, both water and sewerage charges (where appropriate) will consist of a standing charge and a variable element based on consumption as registered on the water meter. Those households receiving a meter bill will pay a standing charge similar to that of unmeasured householders.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/7">This approach to metering will be subject to a review after two years when the extension of the metering option to further groups will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/8" class="italic">Non-domestic water charges</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/9" class="italic">Metered customers</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/10">Charges will continue to be made up of a standing charge (currently around &pound;50) and a volumetric charge based on the volume of water consumed. All metered customers connected to the public sewer will receive a new sewerage bill of around the same magnitude as their new water bill (except in the case of trade effluent customers).</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/11" class="italic">Un-measured customers</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/12">Water Service is undertaking a programme of extending metering more widely throughout the non-domestic sector. However for those non-domestic customers who remain on an unmeasured supply, water and sewerage charges will both be made up of a standing charge (at a similar level to unmeasured domestic standing charges) plus a variable element based on the rateable value of the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/13" class="italic">Trade Effluent Charges</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.2/14">Trade effluent charges will be extended to all businesses which discharge trade effluent. The calculation of these charges will continue to be on the basis of the Mogden formula and will be brought fully into line with practice in GB.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.8/1">In 2003 and 2004, our embassy in Rangoon sent five official notes formally requesting the Burmese Government to transmit a request to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for our ambassador to meet her. This was at a time when the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) claimed she was not under detention but inaccessible &quot;for security reasons&quot;. No official response was forthcoming, but when pressed, Burmese officials claimed that Aung San Suu Kyi had not agreed to a meeting. We believe that the requests were not, in fact, submitted to her. The last formal written request to meet Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was made on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-21">21 September 2004</phrase>. Again, our embassy was orally informed that a meeting would not be possible. At the end of November 2004, the SPDC clarified that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi had been put under house arrest, citing Section 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Law. After the SPDC confirmed that she is, in fact, in detention, our embassy has not sought consular access to her, since she is not a British citizen. However, we continue to press for her release and the release of all political prisoners in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.893W.2/5">A global arms and investment embargo can only be imposed on a state under a Chapter VII Resolution of the UN Security Council. At present there is no agreement within the Security Council, including among the Permanent Members, to add Burma to the Council's formal agenda, which is a pre-requisite for adopting such a resolution. Our UN mission in New York has regular discussions with the UN and Security Council partners on Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.894W.9/1">Opportunities arise on an ad hoc basis. In normal circumstances we do not expect members of staff to work beyond their normal retirement age. There is provision in our retirement policy for exceptional circumstances where we could agree to re-employing a member of staff at home. For example, there might be operational reasons why we needed to re-employ someone with specialist skills. Normal retirement age for Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff is 60 and it is assumed that staff will want to retire at 60 unless they notify the FCO to the contrary six months in advance. However, staff in Band A (clerical or secretarial officers) can choose to retire between the ages of 60 and 65 and staff in Bands B to D (junior and middle managers) between 60 and 63.</p>

	<p pid="a.908W.6/1">Where a local authority or governing body plan to close a school they must first consult interested parties, then, after considering views, and if they wish to proceed, must publish statutory proposals. Following publication, and a period for representations, the proposals will be decided by the local authority (if they published the proposals and there are no objections), the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or the Schools Adjudicator (if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision). The Department is not routinely informed of consultations but must be provided with copies of published proposals and the final decisions taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.6/2">I have placed two tables in the House Library. Table A lists the 378 schools for which the Department has been informed statutory proposals for closure have been published and approved. Table B lists the 75 schools for which the Department has been informed statutory proposals for closure have been published but has not yet been informed of a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.6/3">Both tables include schools that are closing, or have been proposed for closure, for a range of reasons. These include cases where the schools proposed for closure are: to be replaced by another school, sometimes on the same site (for example by an academy or a school with a religious character); amalgamating (for example, infant and junior schools) or are part of another local reorganisation. The tables exclude special school and nursery school closure proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.908W.6/4">Standard numbers were abolished by the Education Act 2002. They were replaced by a net capacity formula which assesses the capacity of the school and derives an indicated admission number. When setting the admission number for the school, the admission authority must have regard to the indicated admission number however they can set a number that is higher or lower if they wish. If they set a number that is lower, they must publish a notice to inform local parents. The Department does not maintain a central record of proposals to lower admission numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.909W.2/1">Of paramount concern is the safety of pupils, teachers and other users of schools, and regulations are in place to ensure the risk to life posed by school fires is low. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.</p>

The latest figures we have from DCLG are for 2003-04 and show that 1,359 school fires were attended by local authority fire and rescue services. This is broadly in line with the previous year and a drop of around 130 on 2001-02. Using ODPM's latest Cost of Fire Estimates, published last year, the total cost of property damage due to school fires in 2003-04 amounted to just under&pound;62 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.909W.8/1">All new building work at schools is subject to approval under the Building Regulations. These regulations do not currently require the installation of sprinklers in schools, but that does not stop local authorities from specifying their use. In our Managing School Facilities Guide 6, &quot;Fire Safety&quot;, we give the example of a school in an area of high arson risk as being a suitable candidate for having sprinklers installed (see <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire">www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire</a>). However, we recognised the need to provide more detailed guidance than before.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.8/2">We work closely with colleagues in the new Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and, liaising with them, we produced new draft guidance on fire safety&mdash;Building Bulletin (BB) 100, &quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. It stresses the value of using risk assessments to determine what sort of fire detection and alarm systems should be used in each school, and whether or not sprinklers should be installed. While saying that a building designed in accordance with the guidance in Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the Building Regulations, will achieve a satisfactory standard of life safety, it also suggests ways of improving property protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.8/3">Public consultation on the draft BB 100 was completed in November last year, to the same timeframe as DCLG's consultation on its review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations. An analysis of the responses is almost complete and we aim to publish the final version of BB 100 in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.8/4">We are also doing specific work on sprinklers.We have commissioned the Building Research Establishment to carry out a cost benefit analysis of installing sprinklers in schools. Work on this is due to be completed shortly and it should provide robust figures for installation costs, and how these might be partially offset, together with a set of tools to help those carrying out risk assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.6/1">No magistrates have been disciplined for their sentencing decisions in the past 10 years. Like other judicial office holders, magistrates are independent and their decisions as such can only be challenged through the courts, not through a disciplinary process. If a higher court considering an appeal from magistrates was concerned that a sentencing decision appeared to have been reached on an improper basis involving misconduct, whether because of discrimination or for other reasons, it would be possible for the court concerned to refer the conduct of the magistrates, as opposed to their decision, to the Office for Judicial Complaints to be considered on behalf of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice. Similarly, if in the</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.6/2">course of a case magistrates make discriminatory comments or otherwise behave in a way which suggests that they are acting improperly, it is possible for a complaint about their conduct to be made to the Office for Judicial Complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.913W.6/3">The Office for Judicial Complaints was created on<phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase>. Previously complaints about magistrates' conduct were made to the Lord Chancellor. During 2005, 89 complaints were referred to him, of which he upheld 63.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.5/3">This Government introduced the carers grant in 1999 to support councils in providing breaks and other services for carers in England. The grant is not paid to individuals but paid each year to councils as a specific formula grant. There are no conditions attached. Individual carers have a right to an assessment of their ability to provide and continue to provide care under section 1 of the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000. Services are not subject to a means test, though local authorities are able to charge for the carers' services they provide. However, carers cannot be charged for community care services provided to people they care for, including the services provided to enable carers to take a break from caring.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.5/4">Although there are no conditions attached to the carers grant funding for 2006-07 and 2007-08, the Commission for Social Care Inspection's delivery and improvement statement will monitor the provision of services to carers. As a result, the Department issues guidance to councils to remind them that the policy intention behind the grant is to support carers.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.0/1">Through the Pensions Education Fund, the Department for Work and Pensions is undertaking an initiative from January 2006 to March 2008 offering funding to local and national not-for-profit organisations (such as trades unions, charities, trade associations and the voluntary sector), to use innovative ways to increase financial awareness and encourage working people to provide for their retirement. The objective of the fund is to deliver better retirement planning information to individuals in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.0/2">The Department for Work and Pensions is making &pound;5.5 million available to fund initiatives, selected through the Pensions Education Fund bidding process. Projects will be delivered in the period January 2006 to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.0/3">As part of the Government's strategy to increase access to affordable credit, we are introducing the Growth Fund from summer 2006. The Growth Fund will be used to increase the availability of affordable personal loans to financially excluded people, and will be delivered by low cost lenders from the not-for-profit and private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.0/4">We will also introduce arrangements whereby lenders meeting certain criteria will be able to apply for deductions from a range of income replacement benefits to repay loans in the event of default.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.0/5">As part of the Government's strategy to increase access to banking, we introduced universal banking and the Payment Modernisation Programme during 2002-05. This resulted in more than 10 million people receiving information from us about the types of account available prior to moving from payment by order book to payment into an account and, importantly, using their account on a regular basis to conduct their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.0/6">Implementation costs of the deductions scheme and the Growth Fund are funded by the Financial Inclusion Fund. Final figures for the deductions scheme are not yet available but we do not expect to spend as much as the &pound;10 million allocated for both initiatives.</p>

Friend may be interested to know that in 2004 the Chief Fire Officers Association developed an Equality Impact Assessment Toolkit to support fire and rescue authorities (FRAs) in complying with the requirements of the Race Relation (Amendment) Act 2000 to ensure that all new policies, procedures, plans and practices have been assessed for impact with regard to race. It included a template for review and update of FRA race equality schemes. In 2005 the toolkit was circulated so that all FRAs could carry out equality impact assessments and a number of regional workshops were held to provide training for policy officers and equality and diversity professionals within the service.</p>

Each of the 10 sites chosen for the Design for Manufacture competition by English Partnerships is being sold to the successful developers in the usual way. Developers will be responsible for determining the final sales price for dwellings for full sale. Actual sales costs will be known once the homes are built on site and details finalised in accordance with market conditions at the time. Homes available through shared equity schemes on the first four sites are expected to cost &pound;55,000 to &pound;70,000 for a 50 per cent. share.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.0/1">No guidance on the use of fingerprints has been issued and there are no plans for using fingerprints as compulsory identifiers for patients. The Department is not aware of any general practitioners (GPs) having adopted this practice as a prerequisite for care provision, and would not find this acceptable. Some GPs, do however, provide facilities for patients to review the content of electronic health records and systems that enable this, for example the patient access electronic record system (PAERS), may use fingerprint biometrics to ensure that patients can only access their own records and not those of other patients. While the opportunity to review records in this way is generally welcomed by patients, patients are not compelled to use this sort of service and are legally entitled to be provided with paper copies of their records if they would prefer.</p>

We expect PCTs to discuss the options with patient groups before deciding which to make available.

	<p pid="a.939W.3/2">The national programme was established with four original core components&mdash;the NHS care records service (NHS CRS); the electronic booking service, now knownas choose and book; electronic transmission of prescriptions, now known as the electronic prescription service (EPS); and the new national network (N3). Delivery now also includes the following additional components: picture archiving and communications systems (PACS); the NHSmail e-mail service; and the quality management and analysis system (QMAS). The objective of the programme is to transform health care in England by the provision of pervasive digital information.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/3">There is no single national start or completion date for individual national programme systems and services. The aim is to achieve substantial integration of health and social care information systems in England under the national programme by 2010. Clearly, systems will need to be upgraded in the light of new technology and new national health service requirements beyond that date. The approach, in line with best practice, is to implement new services incrementally, avoiding a big bang approach, and by providing increasingly richer functionality over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/4">The first elements of the NHS care records service, to provide a transaction messaging service, a personal demograhics service, a spine directory service and secure access controls via smartcards, went live on time and to budget on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase>. The software to support choose and book is complete and went live on time and to budget, also on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase>. The software to introduce QMAS in support of the general medical services contract went live on time and to budget in August 2004 and was fully rolled out within three months, supporting payments to 100 per cent. of general practitioners (GPs) under the quality outcomes framework every month since then. The software to allow electronic prescriptions to be issued went live on time and to budget in February 2005. N3 is ahead of schedule and over 96 per cent. of GPs now have a broadband connection.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.3/5">The first PACS system under the programme was implemented in April 2005 and 31 systems have been implemented to date with over 25 million digital images stored. In the south of England, the infrastructure is complete and over 50 per cent. of hospitals have PACS systems. NHSmail was implemented on time in October 2004 and currently has over 170,000 registered users sending 500,000 e-mails per day and 70 million to date. The establishment of an accredited software integration environment is complete and has enabled existing system suppliers of GP, hospital, pharmacy and independent sector systems to gain compliance with the new national and local applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.940W.2/2">Extensive work was carried out during the 1990s to pilot electronic patient records through the health infomatics system (HIS) programme. This contributed to the publication, in 1998, of the Department's information for health strategy. Following publication, the Department piloted electronic records at 16 sites across the country under the electronic records demonstrator and implementation programme. Each project had its own focus, for example record sharing and confidentiality, and joint working between health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.940W.2/3">A series of outputs, evaluations and guidance reports from these projects, supplemented by lessons learned from projects in other countries, including the European Commission's advanced informatics in medicine programme, contributed to the specification of the NHS Care Records Service. A key purpose of the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) was to enable the benefit from the projects to be shared across the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.940W.2/4">During the early stages of the NPfIT procurement process, an electronic patient record pilot study with IBM at Warwick investigated primary care trust-level information gathering and reporting. Also during the procurement phase, detailed technical design studies were carried out and each supplier had to complete a series of proof of solution tests to ensure that they understood the national health service's requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.940W.2/5">Further trialling of NPfIT systems is always undertaken at user sites and in user-based environments to pilot usability before rollout. Systems are only made available locally after successfully passing through extensive national testing phases. For example, both the quality management and analysis system for general practice, and the system to support payment by results, operated in shadow form for a number of months before going live.</p>
	<p pid="a.940W.2/6">All this activity is in line with the recommendations of the 'Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action', to demonstrate that products work before they are deployed, and to avoid big bang implementations.</p>

Mannitol is also used widely as an excipient, that is an inactive ingredient, by the pharmaceutical industry in the manufacture of other medicinal products.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.2/3">There is an established mechanism to allow proper consideration of making drugs of misuse controlled. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, the expert body that advises Ministers, is made aware of problems posed by specific drugs, or where they are requested by Ministers to consider a specific drug, they will undertake a detailed assessment of whether or not a substance ought to be controlled and make appropriate recommendations to Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.946W.8/1">National health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) have delegated limits for capital investment up to which they may make capital investment decisions without seeking approval from their strategic health authority (SHA) or from the Department. These limits vary between &pound;1 million and &pound;10 million, depending on the organisation's turnover from provider activities and performance in the latest star performance ratings.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/2">Purchases of fixed assets and sales of fixed assets such as land and buildings are dealt with in the same way. Beneath its delegated limit, the PCT can sell assets and reinvest the proceeds without the approval of its SHA. Above the delegated limit, the PCT must seekits SHA's approval both for the sale and to reinvest the proceeds. In many instances, SHAs will approve the reinvestment of the sale proceeds by the selling trust or PCT but the SHA retains the discretion to specify another use.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/3">Where the transaction is subject to SHA approval, there will generally be SHA involvement at outline business case, where the main principles and parameters are established and preferred options are chosen, and full business case, where the details of delivering the preferred option are agreed. Even where formal approval by the SHA is not required, NHS trusts and PCTs may wish to draw on their SHA's technical expertise in estate and capital matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/4">PCTs are required by statute to operate within resource limits (revenue and capital) set by the Department as part of PCTs funding allocations. PCTs may use their revenue resources for any revenue expenditure permitted in law, including the commissioning of healthcare and community services and payment of rents.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/5">The sale of a fixed asset, such as a building, gives rise to a capital receipt that is a fixed asset financed by capital in the balance sheet is converted to a cash asset financed by capital in the balance sheet. Except to the extent of any profit on disposal, there is no increase in the resources available to the PCT to spend on revenue costs such as rentals.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/6">As a consequence, the sale of a correctly valued fixed asset would not release funds that could be spent on rentals.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.8/7">For the above reasons, proceeds from the sale of fixed assets are usually reinvested in buying other fixed assets. Where there is no local capital investment requirement, the cash may be repaid to the Department as a repayment of capital.</p>

	<p pid="a.948W.2/1">The Government recognise the disproportionate effect of poor sexual health on young people, and this was highlighted in both the national strategy for sexual health and HIV and the teenage pregnancy strategy, and subsequently highlighted in the 'Choosing Health' White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.2/2">Improving access to sexual health has been identified as a top priority for the national health service in the 'NHS in England: the Operating Framework for 2006-07' and all primary care trusts are now working towards providing access to genito-urinary medicine appointments within 48 hours. A national programme of screening for chlamydia, targeting 16 to 24-year-olds, will be rolled-out across the country by April 2007. A range of projects are also underway to inform the development of new models of service provision. These include HIV testing in community settings and one-stop shop services.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.2/3">The teenage pregnancy strategy encourages all young people to delay sex, but also seeks to ensure that they have access to contraceptive and sexual health advice if they are, or are thinking about becoming sexually active&mdash;to protect themselves against unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Efforts to improve access to services focus on making sexual health services more young people-friendly and delivering them in non- traditional settings, such as schools, colleges and Connexions one-stop-shops.</p>
