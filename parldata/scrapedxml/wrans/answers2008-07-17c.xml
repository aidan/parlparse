	<p pid="c.545W.3/1">All young offenders coming into prison undergo a health care committal screen on the first night. They are asked questions about mental health problems, drug and/or alcohol use or misuse and if they have any particular literacy problems. All inmates are also seen, on initial committal, by Opportunity Youth to identify any alcohol or substance misuse problems. If specific mental health problems are identified then they would receive onward referral to mental health support within health care.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/2">The first assessment will be carried out by a mental health nurse who will provide basic support but, if required, a further referral will be made to another specialist, such as cognitive behavioural therapists, Opportunity Youth or psychiatrists.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/3">A health care induction programme, aimed at providing inmates with information regarding the health services available to them whilst in custody, has been produced and is being delivered twice a week to all new committals. Inmates are informed of the clinics and support services available to them and how to access them. All staff, including the dental team, deliver the induction programme on a rotational basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/4">Wider research in the UK suggests that approximately 60-70 per cent. of prisoners have some mental health problem but detailed analysis has not yet been undertaken specifically in relation to the young offender centre population.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/5">Inmates are also given an education assessment within 20 days of committal which assesses literacy and numeracy ability and also tests for dyslexia. They are also asked to make the assessor aware of any other known learning difficulties, in particular ADHD.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/6">In the last three years 31 per cent. of male young offenders have shown some indicators for dyslexia, (this compares with a figure of approximately 10 per cent. in the general population). A pilot is under way to assess better learning difficulties among the young offenders and in particular ADHD, which will also develop and pilot appropriate interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/7">At present, education staff are able to assess but not formally diagnose specific learning difficulties, although they can and do identify indications for certain conditions and plan and deliver lessons accordingly. Prison Service will also consider a diagnosis of dyslexia, which is a more formal process than assessment and must be carried out by a suitable qualified individual, as part of the pilot.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/8">The Prison Service does not routinely have access to the academic, social care and other records of individuals before they come into custody. However, our own assessments on committal show that around 70 per cent. have literacy and numeracy skills below level 1, which is comparable to that of an 11-year-old.</p>
	<p pid="c.545W.3/9">Finally, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that lead responsibility for the provision of prison health care was transferred to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> and therefore I have copied these questions and my response to the Health Minister, Michael McGimpsey MLA.</p>

They are mapping all apprenticeship frameworks to see where Level 4 apprenticeships may be required.

	<p pid="c.556W.8/2">As part of this review the Director has already made a number of changes designed to strengthen the leadership team, improve staff training and to shorten the time it takes to get SFO cases into Court. The recommendations made in Jessica de Grazia's report which relate to the operation and management of the SFO are currently being considered very carefully as part of this, and further developments to build on the performance of the SFO will be introduced over the coming year.</p>

	<p pid="c.556W.11/1">The recently appointed director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has already stated on several occasions that one of his priorities is to enable cases to be brought to court more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.556W.11/2">In addition, in March 2007 the SFO established the Case Management Reform Programme (CMRP), which is a business change programme designed to contribute to the strategic aims and objectives of the SFO. In particular, the CMRP aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of SFO casework processes, thus increasing the probability that cases will withstand procedural challenge and be concluded within much shorter time frames.</p>

The Directive provides for the protection of clinical trial subjects, including minors, and sets out requirements for the ethical review of clinical trials.

On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May 2008</phrase> the Government amended UK legislation, following a public consultation, to allow minors to be entered into a trial prior to consent having been obtained from a person with parental responsibility or legal representative in trials of emergency medicines where and while certain conditions are met.</p>

	<p pid="c.574W.2/1">The Government have not made any estimate of the percentage of voter registration in each constituency and local authority area in England. The Electoral Commission estimated that 3.5 million eligible electors were not registered to vote in their report, Understanding Electoral Registration, which was published in September 2005. However the number of electors registered in England continues to grow and between <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-02">2 December 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-01">1 December 2007</phrase> the number of parliamentary electors grew from 37,588,775 to 37,817,466 and the number of local government electors grew from 38,223,259 to 38,599,775.</p>
	<p pid="c.574W.2/2">The Government have not set any target level for voter registration, as we believe that all eligible electors should be registered to vote. To support this aim we have taken a number of steps to increase voter registration rates. Section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 placed a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries and inspecting records that they are permitted to inspect. It is for the ERO to decide on the best steps to use in conjunction with their local knowledge to ensure that requirements for making contact with persons and maintaining the register are complied with. To support such activities we have made &pound;2.5 million available each financial year under our Participation Fund, which allows EROs to apply for additional funding to assist them in promoting electoral awareness within their areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.574W.2/3">The Act also includes a provision for the Electoral Commission to introduce new performance standards for EROs. The Electoral Commission is currently developing these standards and the final set of standards will be published during July 2008. A copy of these standards will be laid before the House and the information obtained from local authorities as a consequence will give us a better understanding of the actions taken to increase registration.</p>

	<p pid="c.577W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice has not issued any guidance to local authorities and/or police services on the use of restorative justice techniques as a way of preventing young people entering the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="c.577W.2/2">However Restorative Justice has been embedded in the youth justice system since the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act which recommends its use as part of existing disposals, if appropriate for the individual/s involved. Restorative justice approaches can be found in both out-of-court and in-court disposals-for example, in reprimands, warnings, referral orders-and will also play a part in the delivery of youth conditional cautions and the youth rehabilitation order which form part of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.577W.2/3">We announced in the children's plan that we will be piloting a new out of court disposal that will sit below reprimands and final warnings. This will be the youth restorative disposal which uses restorative techniques to allow a young person to apologise for committing an offence thus making them take responsibility for their actions at the scene of the offence.</p>

	<p pid="c.584W.3/1">Data on deprivation are no longer collected at ward level. However, the following tables provide details of the 100 most deprived lower super output areas (LSOA) in England for 2004 and 2007. LSOAs have between 1,000 and 3,000 people living in them and, in most cases, are smaller than wards. The tables provide the name of the ward in which the LSOA is situated, as well as the local authority district.</p>

	<p pid="c.587W.2/1">Regional spatial strategies (RSS) set out a vision for how a region can tackle housing shortages and affordability. New eco-towns could be part of how regions meet their housing shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="c.587W.2/2">The 15 shortlisted eco-town locations have only reached the first stage. Bids that have cleared the first hurdle will face considerably tougher tests ahead if they progress and will need to improve proposals still further. All the shortlisted locations will face further examination including public consultation and a detailed sustainability appraisal which will test the merits and challenges for each one. Importantly no new eco-town housing will be on the green belt.</p>
	<p pid="c.587W.2/3">All proposals for eco-towns will be subject to the planning process and subject to local planning decisions. However it is too early to speculate on what may happen in each local area and on local planning authority support.</p>

	<p pid="c.597W.3/1">Following a review of the partnerships provisions of the Crime and Disorder 1998 Act, the duties to produce three yearly audits and to report annually to the Secretary of State on a partnership's work and progress were repealed in 2007. They were replaced by new statutory requirements in 2007 to introduce minimum standards for partnership working based on six hallmarks of effective partnerships, providing clear statements of the core functions of crime and disorder reduction partnership or community safety partnership in Wales. These include producing a strategic assessment identifying local community safety priorities and a partnership plan which sets out the approach for addressing these priorities. Partnerships have a duty to publish a summary of the partnership plan in a format of their choice but in a way that makes it available to diverse groups in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/2">We do not intend to introduce a compliance regime to oversee the implementation of the standards or the hallmarks. However, we will want to carry out a programme to review whether or not the statutory requirements of national minimum standards are in place and produce a preliminary report later in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.3/3">We are also developing a self-evaluation toolkit so that partnerships can identify their own areas for improvement. Regional Government offices are also available to offer advice and assistance to partnerships and we are taking forward work with the Association of Chief Police Officers on how best to make available local crime information including mapping.</p>

	<p pid="c.598W.9/2">The curriculum already provides scope for the exploration of issues relating to domestic violence principally, although not exclusively, within personal, social and health education (PSHE), which includes sex and relationship education (SRE). It is important that we focus efforts on raising the overall standard of teaching in PSHE and SRE, where issues to do with healthy relationships, managing conflict and aggression would be addressed, and alerting schools to ways in which domestic violence can be used as context for exploring key concepts within the PSHE curriculum. To raise the standard of teaching we are already training teachers on PSHE, rolling out the Healthy Schools Programme and providing advice and guidance through bodies such as the QCA and PSHE Association.</p>
	<p pid="c.598W.9/3">We are also currently conducting two parallel reviews on how to improve the teaching of sex and relationships education and drug education within the context of PSHE.

	<p pid="c.600W.3/1">Benzodiazepines have been controlled as Class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 since 1986. The availability of benzodiazepines for legitimate medicinal use is regulated by the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. Most benzodiazepines are regulated under schedule 4, part 1 of the regulations, with the exception of temazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam which are regulated under schedule 3. Diazepam is also subject to instalment dispensing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.3/2">In 1998, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advised the Government that all benzodiazepines should be placed into schedule 3 subject to due consideration of the accompanying prescription and safe custody requirements under the regulations. In response to these concerns, the Government decided that rescheduling of benzodiazepines should be made on a case by case basis, with additional controls on the import, export and possession of all benzodiazepines. These controls were introduced in February 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.600W.3/3">In 2004, the Advisory Council concluded that the controls for the schedule 4, part 1 benzodiazepines were sufficient, endorsing the Government's response to its earlier recommendation.</p>

The UK position is that manufacturers that only produce a narrow range of products, while still being subject to challenging mandatory targets, should not be unfairly disadvantaged as compared to their competitors who produce a wider range of vehicle types. Our position on this is set out in more detail in the new car CO2 consultation document on the DfT website.</p>

	<p pid="c.621W.0/1">The Government recognise the need for national data which may be used to monitor whether the condition of roads is improving or deteriorating. But there has been mounting dissatisfaction over a number of years with the quality of CHART visual surveys, which are based on judgments of conditions by engineers, and a programme of work is taking place supported by the Department and the UK Roads Board to develop more sophisticated machine-based surveys.</p>
	<p pid="c.621W.0/2">The 2006 statistical report on road conditions stated that CHART data would not be collected in 2007 for classified roads. More extensive and detailed data would instead become available from machine scans of the road surface (SCANNER surveys), the same source used by local authorities for reporting best value performance indicators (BVPIs) on classified road condition. This same source will be used for authorities reporting against their local area agreements. The Department has commissioned research to develop appropriate methods for producing national estimates from these complex data, which should be available in 2009. At that point, it will be possible to produce several years' results at once to allow analysis of trends in the condition of classified roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.621W.0/3">Indicators from the BVPI reporting regime were also included in the statistical report &quot;Road Conditions in England 2007&quot;. These can be compared with the BVPI results which were reported in previous statistical reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.621W.0/4">CHART visual surveys for the unclassified network continued until 2007-08, but, following consultation with the LGA and with the UK Roads Board, have not been requested in 2008-09. Most local authorities rely on their own programme of inspection and asset management to determine the condition and maintenance needs of unclassified roads, and there has been a declining response rate to the request for CHART data to support the national survey, with only two-thirds of local authorities responding in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.621W.0/5">The Road Conditions in England statistical report published in June 2008 provided members of the public and highway officers with the latest information on road conditions. The next statistical report, intended for publication in 2009, will include several years' data on classified roads. For unclassified roads, DFT will continue to work with the UK Roads Board to determine how best to measure and survey road conditions with an intention of national surveys every three to five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.621W.0/6">Members of the public interested in the condition of their own authority's roads will have available annual indicators published as part of local area agreements. Many authorities also publish their own local data. We have encouraged authorities to prepare asset management plans for local authority, and have announced that at least &pound;15 million will be available to help them do so in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="c.623W.9/1">The Department has not carried out specific research on the impact that 20 mph zones would have on increasing walking and cycling. However, the hon. Member may be interested in our Links to Schools programme, which provides walking and cycling routes from residential areas to schools via the National Cycle Network. Our monitoring of these links shows twice as much cycling to school and 8 per cent. more walking to school. We have already spent over &pound;18 million on this programme since 2005 linking up over 600 schools and plan to extend it to a further 500 schools by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.623W.9/2">The Department has commissioned a new research project on local road safety policy and practice, and information about the implementation of 20 mph zones will be collected from local authorities as part of this study.</p>

	<p pid="c.624W.2/1">There has been no assessment of the effectiveness of 20 mph zones specifically in the vicinity of nurseries and schools. However, the Transport Research Laboratory conducted two reviews of 20 mph zones in 1996 and again in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.624W.2/2">The 1996 review found that 20 mph zones which incorporated traffic calming measures achieved an average 9 mph reduction in vehicle speeds, annual accident frequency fell by 60 per cent. and overall reduction in child accidents of 67 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.624W.2/3">The 1998 review looked at wider issues in terms of vehicle speeds and included 20 mph zones and 20 mph limits where there was lesser or no traffic calming. This found reductions in vehicle speeds were minimal without traffic calming.</p>

	<p pid="c.627W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not undertake its own assessment of regions that will be worst affected by land degradation. However, we work closely with organisations, funded by DFID, that have expert capacity in this area (such as the International Institute for Environment and Development). We also draw on recent international assessments; for example, the Food and Agricultural Organisation's Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (GLADA) that was released on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-02">2 July</phrase>. Based on quantitative analysis, and use of satellite imagery, this identifies southern Africa, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia and south China as areas particularly affected by degradation. 1.5 billion people depend on degrading areas for their livelihoods. The 2007 United Nations Environment Programme's Global Environmental Outlook 4 (GEO-4) included an assessment of land degradation and concluded that demands on land resources and risks to sustainability are likely to intensify.</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.2/2">Better land management can prevent and reverse degradation leading to improved agricultural production and availability of other resources such as forest products. The recent GLADA provides positive examples of land improvement such as land reclamation in north China. DFID has worked with the World Bank in its projects to better manage land and reduce poverty in the degraded and remote Loess Plateau region of north China. The World Bank funded improved land use and erosion control, boosting incomes for farmers, with DFID assistance focused on improved benefits for the poorest.</p>

	<p pid="c.627W.5/4" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> On climate change, the Hadley Centre's Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS), the Global Carbon Finance Model (GLOCAF), an economic model developed by the UK Office of Climate Change (OCC), and the impact assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>
	<p pid="c.627W.5/5" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> On water we use the UN's data for monitoring progress towards the MDGs, including financial models which estimate the cost of achieving the MDGs.

	<p pid="c.627W.5/6">DFID development policies and assistance are formulated mainly at country level.

	<p pid="c.629W.12/1">Since its introduction in 1999 the national minimum wage has increased by 59 per cent. It has helped to narrow the regional pay gap and had a positive effect on the earnings gap of disadvantaged groups such as workers with disabilities, women (around two thirds of the workers who stand to benefit from the October 2008 rise are women) and certain ethnic minorities. Through the introduction of tax credits and the NMW, this Government provided a minimum income guarantee for the first time. In October 2008 this will guarantee that every family with one child and one person working 35 hours a week will receive a minimum income of &pound;295 per week. For the similar families without children, this figure is &pound;225.</p>

	<p pid="c.635W.0/12">As part of the Department's programme to bring increased focus to the management and recovery of debt generally, the decision was made to transfer, from 2005, the management and recovery of Social Fund off-benefit cases to the Department's specialist Debt Management unit. Referring the outstanding Social Fund loans to Debt Management has enabled the use of their specialist skills in pursuing recovery from customers who are no longer in receipt of benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.635W.0/13">This transfer of cases to Debt Management is ongoing, and has already resulted in significant recoveries on loans from those no longer in receipt of benefit, without a need to refer for court enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="c.640W.5/13">We are also committed to working with our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce the amount of waste that is produced&mdash;for example by reducing packaging where feasible.

	<p pid="c.640W.5/14">Our rate of recycling has grown and remains well in excess of the 2010 target to recycle 40 per cent. of total waste. This has been mainly due to the implementation of the Total Paper Recycling Scheme across the estate over the last five years by Land Securities Trillium and their service partners. We also operate an intranet based &quot;Swap Shop&quot; which enables staff across DWP to redistribute surplus goods, which might otherwise have been sent to landfill. During 2008, 500 &quot;lots&quot; were found new homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.640W.5/15">A pilot is under way across the Yorkshire and Humber region to further enhance our recycling performance by introducing a new initiative &quot;Recycle It&mdash;DWP&quot; This will provide additional paper and cardboard recycling facilities, as well as providing opportunities to recycle other waste such as glass, cans and some plastic. If successful, it will be extended across the entire estate wherever viable.</p>

I apologise for this oversight.</p>
	<p pid="c.644W.3/3">Most claims to income support are paid on a weekly basis in arrears. However, income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for work is generally paid fortnightly in arrears (except where the case has been continuous since before April 1995). Customers receiving income support with widows or bereavement benefit are normally paid in advance.</p>
	<p pid="c.644W.3/4">From April 2009 all new claims to income support will be paid fortnightly in arrears in line with employment and support allowance (ESA) which will be introduced in October 2008.</p>

The concerns have been around the use of the ward type where the cot is located as part of the definition. This has caused confusion amongst some trusts about where to record their neonatal intensive care cots and has caused inconsistency in reporting.

	<p pid="c.682W.0/1">In 2008, Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff have reported on a number of countries where food price inflation or insecurity of food supply have been central to concerns about social or political stability. These include Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal and Yemen. In some other cases we believe that high food prices have been part of the cause of social unrest but it is often difficult to separate the impact of food prices from other factors, including rising fuel costs and existing social or political tensions. We also examine information from a variety of sources, including the Department for International Development's country offices and international organisations.</p>

These FM partnerships are critical in a country where direct listening to the BBC via short wave is neither popular nor cost effective.

In its discussions with UNSC partners and the UN on the mandating of peacekeeping missions, the Government carefully weighs political needs and capacity and budgetary implications. We believe that MONUC has the necessary resources to fulfil its current mandated tasks.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.0/1">Ofcom's report &quot;The UK Communications Market 2007&quot; shows that developments in technology have seen broadband reaching the majority of households and businesses in the UK and this has been reflected in widespread take-up (there are now over 16 million broadband connections in the UK). The UK has one of the fastest growing broadband markets in Europe and continues to have the most extensive availability, with 99.8 per cent. of households able to access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.0/2">Statistics show that 53 per cent. of all UK adults lived in households with a broadband internet connection in Q4 2006&mdash;up from 39 per cent. in 2005 and seven times the 2002 penetration level.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.0/3">The rising take-up of bundled services has contributed to the falling costs of all telecommunication services. The UK's 16 million broadband households are paying 36 per cent. less than they were four years ago, while headline connection speeds are up to 16 times faster&mdash;although actual speeds are often far slower than advertised. Competition has seen service providers differentiating in terms of price, speed, quality and in terms of product bundles.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.0/4">52 per cent. of people in the UK with broadband purchased it in conjunction with another communications service, often receiving heavy discounts on the price of stand alone broadband. Some suppliers now offer standalone broadband for under &pound;10 per month, while others provide free broadband when customers buy additional communication service, the cost of the broadband being subsidised by other services in the bundle. Prices for broadband will continue to fall as competition for subscribers intensifies.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.0/5">I would be delighted to hear from industry about any plans they have to make broadband more affordable, including for the elderly or disabled.</p>
