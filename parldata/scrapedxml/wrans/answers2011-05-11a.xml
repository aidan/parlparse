	<p pid="a.1210W.9/1">European legislation came into effect in January 2007 requiring all new goods vehicles above 3.5 tonnes gross mass to be fitted with an enhanced &#8220;wide-angle&#8221; mirror on both sides and an enhanced &#8220;close proximity&#8221; mirror on the passenger side of the cab. For new vehicles over 7.5 tonnes gross mass a &#8220;front&#8221; mirror above the windscreen is also required. Vehicles where the &#8220;close proximity&#8221; and &#8220;front&#8221; mirrors cannot be fitted over 2 metres from the ground are exempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1210W.9/2">Further European legislation came into effect in March 2009 that requires existing goods vehicles above 3.5 tonnes gross mass first registered from January 2000, to be retro-fitted with improved mirrors on the passenger side, to provide a similar field of view to that required for new vehicles. This measure applies to all member states of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1210W.9/3">The Department for Transport is completing research investigating whether more could be done to reduce vehicle blind spots. This may lead to further requirements for new vehicles in the future.</p>

As well as funding from the Treasury raised from taxation, the DfT has a number of income streams such as from tolls and the European Union. The DfT does not attribute specific revenue streams to the Highways Agency. Similarly local authorities have a number of revenue streams and it is not possible to say which of these they use to fund their road networks alongside the funding they receive from central Government.</p>

To qualify for incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called a personal capability assessment: Under the employment and support allowance (ESA) regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the basis of &#8220;obesity&#8221; would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to physical and mental function, assessed by the personal capability assessment/work capability assessment. 3. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance in October 2008. 4. The Great Britain figure for those claiming ESA with a diagnosis of obesity is 230 therefore analysis by each London borough is not appropriate. 5. &#8216;&#8212;&#8217; denotes nil or negligible. <i>Source</i>: DWP Information Directorate 100% WPLS.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1240W.5/1">The Government&#8217;s Welfare Reform Programme aims to transform the effectiveness of the regime for helping people find work. The Work Programme will put in place, starting next month, innovative support for the hardest to help, with, payment by results; and the plan for Universal Credit, ensuring work always pays, will bring together provision currently separated between DWP, HMRC and local government; covering both people in and out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.5/2">At the same time, the resources for the corporate centre of the Department will reduce by 40% over this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.5/3">In this context, the Department is reviewing its structure and senior management responsibilities, to ensure the reform programme and savings are delivered safely. An initial announcement has been made about the roles of the Executive Team, whose members report directly to the Permanent Secretary, which will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-01">1 October 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1240W.5/4">Work is now under way to determine the rest of the organisational design, including the respective responsibilities of senior management of the front line and in the corporate centre. Further details will be announced once the work is further advanced. The Government are, of course, committed to ensuring that constituency queries continue to be handled effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1243W.2/1">Work is for most people the best way out of poverty. The benefit cap will restrict the total amount of welfare a household can receive to broadly the level of the average earned income after tax for working households. By doing this the policy will improve work incentives for those on benefits and sit alongside the other measures announced in the spending review to make the system fair and affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.2/2">Any measurement of the effect on child poverty will be driven by individual behavioural response to the policy. We are putting in place the Work programme, the biggest single welfare-to-work programme this country has ever seen, which will give unemployed people unprecedented levels of personal support to get them into the workplace. The benefit cap supports our plans to make work pay as when someone in a household enters work and begins to receive working tax credit they will be exempt from the new measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1248W.0/1">For most people, work is the best route out of poverty. We believe that it is important that people who can take up paid employment are given help and encouragement to do so. Conditionality has an important role to play to help prevent parents from becoming distanced from the labour market, and therefore is reducing child poverty levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248W.0/2">For example, as set out in the recent impact assessment entitled &#8216;Conditionality Measures in the 2011 Welfare Reform Bill&#8217;, it is estimated that increased conditionality for lone parents with a youngest child aged five and six will result in 20,000 to 25,000 extra lone parents in work, which in turn could help reduce child poverty. Compared to a child of a lone parent who is not working, a child of a lone parent who works part-time is over 2.5 times less likely to be living in poverty. A child of a lone parent who works full-time is over four times less likely to be living in poverty<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248W.0/3">We have estimated that universal credit will have a substantial positive impact on poverty and could lift as many as 350,000 children out of relative income poverty. This is a combined impact of all measurable universal credit factors, and does not identify the specific impact of the conditionality or sanctions.</p>

Future funding will increasingly flow from graduate contributions&#8212;that was the principle behind Lord Browne's recommendations. Universities will be able to secure an equivalent flow of income if their course provision remains attractive to students. Universities must consider, therefore, how to structure their arts courses in ways that make them as attractive as possible to students.</p>

	<p pid="a.1260W.11/1">The Government are committed to encouraging the public to resolve their issues out of court without recourse to public funds, using simpler, more informal remedies where they are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/2">A new Pre-Application Protocol for Family Mediation Information and Assessment meetings came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase>, This will help to promote awareness and understanding of mediation and begin to harmonise the position between self-funding and publicly funded individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/3">In 2009-10, we spent &#163;14.4 million pounds on publicly funded family mediations. In our recent legal aid consultation paper we proposed that most family private law proceedings&#8212;other than cases where domestic violence or forced marriage is involved and child abduction cases&#8212;be removed from the scope of legal aid. Crucially, however, as we believe that supporting families at their most difficult moments is vitally important, it is proposed that free mediation for the types of dispute that previously were in scope will continue to those who are eligible. This will mean that those vulnerable people who need support will be able to benefit from mediation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/4">We also look forward to receiving the final recommendations from the independently-chaired Family Justice Review panel this autumn. This will help us to consider how the use of dispute resolution could be further encouraged across the family justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/5">As far as civil justice is concerned, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-29">29 March</phrase> we issued a consultation document &#8220;Solving disputes in the county courts: creating a simpler, quicker and more proportionate system&#8221;, which seeks views on a range of proposals to reform the civil justice system, including greater use of mediation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/6">In particular, we are consulting on introducing automatic referral to mediation in small claims cases, and mediation information sessions in higher-value cases. This is to help people avoid the anxiety and expense of court where possible, although court will still be an option for those who mediation cannot help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260W.11/7">This builds on the current service offered by the courts, where over each of the past two years some 10,000 small claims have been mediated with nearly three-quarters reaching successful conclusion. The vast majority of these mediations take place over the telephone&#8212;saving people the time and expense of having to attend a court.</p>

	<p pid="a.1274W.9/1">The most significant disease of pines in England is red band needle blight caused by a fungal pathogen. This disease was first reported in the 1950s, when it was rare, but the disease has become more widespread since the late 1990s. The Forestry. Commission has carried out extensive forest surveys over the last 10 years and the disease is now found across the whole of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1274W.9/2">The Forestry Commission&#8217;s research programme-includes annual disease surveys, increasing our understanding of the fungal biology to aid management decisions, tests on the susceptibility of alternative species, and studying the impact of changing forest management practices on the incidence and severity of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.1274W.9/3">A full pest risk assessment has been undertaken. The disease is most damaging on Corsican and lodgepole pine, while the native Scots pine is moderately susceptible. The impact of the disease is to reduce tree growth rates, which can occasionally result in mortality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1274W.9/4">There is a moratorium on planting Corsican pine on the public forest estate and the use of lodgepole pine is minimal. Future policy and research is directed by a Great Britain programme board that includes representation from the forest industry.</p>

In a small number of cases, constituents or hon. Members noted that policies would not apply in Wales, but were concerned about the implications for people who live near the border, or concerned that the policy for England might set a precedent which would then be followed in Wales and so asked for a UK Government response.</p>

	<p pid="a.1288W.6/2">The Green Book is HM Treasury guidance for central Government on the appraisal and evaluation of all policies, programmes and projects. In addition to the Green Book itself which sets out the overall framework, there is already a range of supplementary guidance with more detail on how to assess the economic welfare or 'wellbeing' implications of particular types of policy impacts, eg &#8220;The Economic and Social Costs of Crime&#8221;, &#8220;Policy Appraisal and Health&#8221;, and &#8220;The Valuation of Ecosystem Services&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288W.6/3">This supplementary guidance is continually being expanded and updated to take account of the latest work and research from both within and outside of government. HMT is currently working with other Government Departments on a number of pieces of new guidance or early stage discussion papers for release later this year. A discussion paper is planned on the potential use of subjective wellbeing measures in Social Cost Benefit Analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288W.6/4">Subjective well-being measures look at the effect that a non-market good (such as the environment) has on people's reported overall life satisfaction in order to determine the value of that good. More traditional methods ask people to directly state their willingness to pay for the good, or observe their behaviour in related markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288W.6/5">These subjective wellbeing measures are different from measures of national wellbeing. Individual policies are not normally assessed in terms of their influence on national measures such as GDP or national wellbeing because of the difficulty of isolating the effect of one particular policy on such measures. Individual policies are, instead, normally assessed in terms of their &#8216;micro&#8217; level costs and benefits or economic welfare effects. National measures may help form part of the wider debate.</p>
