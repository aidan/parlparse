The National Play Strategy, which was published in December 2008, announced that Government would be accelerating the capital programme so that all of the remaining 89 top tier local authorities in England would receive funding from April 2009 as wave 2 of the investment programme. This means that all 152 local authorities will be receiving play capital, and associated revenue, funding during the 2009-10 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.8/3">The conditions of grant letter, issued in February 2009, outlined that local authorities would receive their capital and revenue allocations in two equal payments during 2009-10. By the end of May, local authorities received the first payment of this financial year. Tables which show the allocations for each local authority to the end of the current financial year have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

It would bring about change in as much as EU activities will be designed and implemented in ways that support democratic processes and strengthen democratic principles.

There they were able to assess the situation of the Tibetan people, and found that many monasteries were able to carry out daily religious rites without obvious interference, though there was clear evidence of continued government restrictions in matters such as the numbers of monks and reverence of the Dalai Lama. In general security force presence had returned to similar levels as before the riots in March 2008. The exception was in the old town of Lhasa where there had been a visible increase. Embassy representatives heard that in future access to Tibet for foreigners, including tourists and official visitors would continue to ease.

The NHS is therefore taking the lead for the six Community Mental Health pilots; the MOD has provided the start up costs for the six pilot sites and will meet the costs of the evaluation, &pound;0.5 million. Veterans are also designated as a Special Interest Group (SIG) in the Department of Health's &pound;173 million Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme. In addition, to assist those veterans not in the catchment areas of one of the pilots, we have expanded our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St. Thomas' hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms with operational service since 1982.</p>

Following a major investment in supercomputing it is already exploiting a new, highly detailed, forecast model that provides significantly improved support for the issue of flood related warnings. Building on this capability, in line with recommendation 3 of the Pitt review, the Met Office has developed a detailed research plan and started work which will further enhance its ability to forecast local-scale heavy rainfall events and further increase the amount of warning it is able to give to responders for such events. This research programme is due to be completed by summer 2012 in line with the timetable outlined by the Government in response to the Pitt Review, although some benefits will be realised before this.</p>

	<p pid="a.705W.5/1">Between September 2008 and October 2009, the fee increase percentage for a practical car test was 9.7 per cent. (&pound;56.50 to &pound;62); the increase for the on-road element of the motorcycle test was 25 per cent. (&pound;60 to &pound;75).</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/2">The main reason for the difference in increase was that the Driving Standards Agency implemented fee increases for its main activities, including practical car tests, in April 2008. Owing to the expectation of the changes being made to the practical motorcycle test later in that year, the fee increase for that test was delayed until the end of September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/3">A more appropriate comparison is therefore to compare fee levels in March 2008 and October 2009, which include two general fee increases for both activities. This shows an increase in car test fees of 28 per cent. (&pound;48.50 to &pound;62) compared to an increase of 25 per cent. (&pound;60 to &pound;75) for the comparable element of the motorcycle test.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.2/2">The Government issues operational guidance on the issuing of penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) to police forces under section 6 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. This guidance sets out the criteria which should be considered by police officers and makes clear that PNDs should not be issued where the offence is too serious and/or it involves aggravating factors, for example, where a theft has been planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.2/3">Following representations from the hon. Lady and retail trades, the guidance covering shoplifting is being revised to clarify further the type of theft offence for which a penalty notice may be suitable. The new guidance will be issued shortly. However, police officers are accustomed to distinguishing different circumstances in which offences are committed, and no specific guidance will be offered on distinguishing between opportunistic and planned theft.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.2/4">We are also considering the use of PNDs for retail theft and will report our conclusions to the House shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.6/1">The Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration Project team maintains a register of the risks to the competition. In the register, the Department records risks and associated mitigating factors openly and honestly, and away from the gaze of the bidders. The release of this information would not be in the public interest because it might have an inhibiting effect on the frankness and candour of the risk assessments or on the assessment of likelihood and impact of risks, and its release would also prejudice the Department's commercial interests, in particular, the Department's bargaining position and its ability to negotiate a competitive deal with the bidders.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.6/2">The risk register was originally created by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) but responsibility for it transferred to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) following its creation in October 2008. HM Treasury and Department for Transport indirectly contribute to the risk register through normal project governance. No other Government Departments have contributed to the risk register.</p>

	<p pid="a.718W.2/2">The UK has led the world in taking a strategic and long-term approach to the problem of climate change. Existing policies are already enabling &pound;50 billion of low carbon investment over the three years to 2011, and helping to support 900,000 jobs. Budget 2009 builds on these foundations and provides over &pound;1.4 billion of extra targeted support in the low carbon sector. Together with announcements made last autumn, these measures will enable an additional &pound;10.4 billion of low carbon and energy investment over the next three years. This will help protect investment and jobs in the low carbon sector in the short term and provide the foundations for strong growth in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.719W.8/1">DECC's analysis estimates that the benefits to the UK as a whole of measures to help avert climate change could outweigh the costs by more than 10 times. Where these measures lead to an international climate agreement consistent with delivering a 450 ppm stabilisation of GHG atmospheric concentrations, we estimate the total benefits at &pound;241.9 billion. This compares with total costs of &pound;20.6 billion. The Impact Assessment can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.719W.8/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that policies to avert climate change are cost-effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/4">For household consumers, approximately 12 to 14 per cent. of current average electricity prices is attributable to measures to implement commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (the Renewables Obligation, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target).</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/5">For household gas consumers, approximately 2 per cent. of the average gas price is attributable to the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/6">However the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target supports energy efficiency measures for households and so will deliver over time an overall saving on both gas and electricity bills greater than its total cost to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/7">For medium industrial electricity consumers, approximately 20 per cent. of current average electricity bills is attributable to measures to implement commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (the Renewables Obligation, EU ETS and the Climate Change Levy).</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/8">On gas, approximately 7 per cent. of current average prices for a medium industrial gas consumer is attributable to the Climate Change Levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.719W.8/9">Actual proportions for individual industrial consumers will vary from these estimated averages according to the considerable ranges of prices paid and of consumption sizes. Impacts will generally be lower for those companies which have entered into Climate Change Agreements. The revenue raised by the Climate Change Levy is recycled back to business, primarily through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in employers' national insurance contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.2/2" class="italic"> (A) Electricity:</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/3">The then Energy Minister initiated an in depth review into the resilience of electricity substations to flood risk shortly after the floods of summer 2007. This review was led by the Electricity Networks Association (ENA) and included representatives from DECC, all electricity network owners, the Environment Agency (EA)/SEPA, the Met Office and Ofgem. The Pitt review team also attended several meetings of the review steering group. As a result of this work we are now at a position where:</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/4" class="indent">The electricity network companies and the environment agency have completed a structured exchange of information that has enabled the companies to identify all the sites at risk to fluvial or tidal flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/5" class="indent">There have been improvements made in the provision of flood warning information between the EA and the electricity sector. In particular the network owners now receive a daily risk based flood warning bulletin from the EA which is sent by e-mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/6" class="indent">All the electricity distribution companies have submitted investment plans to Ofgem as part of their current five year price reviews which include proposals to improve the flood resilience of major electricity substations.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/7" class="indent">The Energy Networks Association (ENA) will shortly be issuing an &quot;Engineering Technical Recommendation&quot;, essentially an agreed industry standard, setting out best practice for network owners in managing flood risk at major substations.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/8" class="indent">Company business continuity plans for flood risk have been significantly improved by the information that has emerged during the ENA led review.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/9" class="indent">Electricity companies have also undertaken certain strategic investments to improve their resilience to flood risk in the short term. For example the substations in Gloucester that were impacted by the flooding, at Walham and Castlemeads, now have permanent flood defence barriers and a number of companies have purchased relocatable flood defence systems. In addition companies have reviewed the design of large new substations at risk to flooding and have taken steps to raise them above the level of potential flood waters where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/10" class="italic"> (B) Gas and (C) Oil.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.2/11">DECC has also completed a survey of both the gas and oil sectors to establish their awareness of flood risk and identify any significant risks to the continuity of supplies. Although inherently more resilient than the electricity networks, and with little evidence of supply problems due to flooding, a small number of residual risks were identified that could lead to local difficulties in the most severe flooding situations. The management of these risks is being progressed with the companies and their trade associations.</p>

	<p pid="a.727W.5/1">&mdash;The Government's current feasibility study has cost approximately &pound;3 million since 2008. A study by the Sustainable Development Commission in 2007 (which covered all UK tidal power) received &pound;400,000 of public funding. A report by Sir Robert McAlpine Limited in 2002 received &pound;50,000 funding, and approximately &pound;2.8 million was spent on a major study in 1987.</p>
	<p pid="a.727W.5/2">Severn tidal power has also been addressed at other times over the period as part of the wider assessment of UK marine energy potential. However there would be a disproportionate cost involved in obtaining accurate figures for spending related to energy from the Severn.</p>

	<p pid="a.728W.11/1">In line with Government targets for delivering 15 per cent. renewable energy by 2020, we do expect an increase in the deployment of renewable energy, including wind farms, over the next three years. The scale of the increase in wind turbines over this period will depend on how quickly the market brings forward projects, and developers are able to obtain planning consent or construct projects which already have consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.11/2">As an indication of the potential increase in the amount of wind energy over the next three years, 181 onshore and offshore wind developments (7393.4 MWe) have already received consent and are awaiting construction. A further 194 onshore and offshore wind projects (7316.8 MWe) are currently in the planning system<sup>(1)</sup>. Those in the planning system may or may not be consented. The timing of construction of those wind farms that have been consented depends on the developers' plans. Planning applications for further projects for wind farms may also come forward in this timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.11/3">The effect that new wind farms will have on UK annual carbon dioxide emissions will depend on the speed of the build rate. It is estimated that in 2007 wind power saved 501 tonnes of CO2 per GWh of electricity supplied compared with emissions from all fuel sources, including nuclear and renewables<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.11/4">Our Renewable Energy Strategy consultation last summer estimated that meeting the 15 per cent. renewable energy target could save about 20 Mt CO2 a year in 2020 outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and contribute around 50 to 55 Mt CO2 a year to meeting our ETS cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.730W.12/15">Awarding body data on GCSE examination entries is analysed by the Department for Children, Schools and Families as part of the Secondary School Achievement and Attainment Tables publication. However, this work only covers young people at the end of key stage 4. Therefore, we do not have information readily available on all learners being entered for GCSE Mathematics examinations.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.12/16">Due to the increased number of pupils taking and successfully passing a Maths GCSE at school, we would expect the volume of learners studying this qualification at a further education college to fall. In 1997, there were 534.7 thousand 15-year-olds (academic age) attempting GCSE Mathematics and 250.3 thousand achieving a C grade or higher (around 50 per cent. of those attempting the subject). In 2004, 606.0 thousand pupils attempted GCSE Mathematics at the end of key stage 4 with 318.9 thousand achieving a grade A*-C (around 53 per cent. of those attempting the subject). In 2008, 609.7 thousand pupils attempted GCSE Mathematics at the end of key stage 4, with 361.1 thousand achieving a grade A*-C (59 per cent. of those attempting the subject).</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.12/17">A GCSE may not necessarily be the most appropriate learning outcome for many learners and colleges have been encouraged to advise learners to study the most relevant qualification to them. Many learners who may previously have undertaken a GCSE in Mathematics now have their numeracy needs picked up through embedded learning in other courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.12/18">Over the past few years the Government have prioritised investment in adult skills towards those courses that best provide individuals with the skills to enter into sustained employment and progress into further learning. In 2007/08 464,000 learners achieved a Numeracy Skills for Life qualification.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.5/1">The NHS Information Centre for health and social care published the following report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-26">26 March 2008</phrase>: &quot;NHS Expenditure for General Dental Services and Personal Dental Services: England 1997/98&mdash;2005/06&quot;. This report has been placed in the Library and is also available on the NHS Information Centre website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/dentalexpend1997to2006">www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/dentalexpend1997to2006</a></p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/3">The report includes information on primary dental care expenditure per population by primary care trust (PCT) for 1997-98 to 2005-06 in tables A2 and B2 of annex 3. table A2 relates to 'gross' expenditure and table B2 relates to 'net' expenditure. 'Gross' expenditure refers to the full cost of the payments recorded; 'net' expenditure reflects the cost of these payments to the NHS after the deduction of income from NHS dental charges paid by patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/4">This information is based on the old contractual arrangements which were in place up to and including <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>. Further notes to aid interpretation of the information are shown in the 'Contents and Notes' page of annex 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/5">Data on primary dental care expenditure in 2006-07 and 2007-08 can be extracted from the notes of PCT accounts (accounts data for 2008-09 are not yet available) and per capita expenditure calculated. The data reflect the new contract framework for primary dental care services introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, and incorporate additional service costs such as the employers' superannuation contributions payable on behalf of primary care dentists. They also reflect the revised PCT structures introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. The new data series is therefore not fully comparable with the pre-2006 data provided in the NHS Information Centre report. Information on the gross and net expenditure per capita for each primary care trust in England is set out in a table which has also been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/6">As patients may attend dentists at any locality of their choice, the level of service provision in a PCT may not be directly related to the size of its resident population.</p>

	<p pid="a.739W.6/1">The National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) concluded, in November 2004, that Lyme disease was the most significant public health vector-borne disease in the United Kingdom. The Panel considered incidence and detection of disease in the UK and modes of transmission.</p>
	<p pid="a.739W.6/2">In 2006, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, asked Professor Brian Duerden, the Inspector of Microbiology and an assessor member of both NEPNEI and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP), to conduct an investigation into the use of unvalidated tests in the diagnosis of Lyme disease. His report &quot;The use of unorthodox and unvalidated laboratory tests in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis and in relation to medically unexplained symptoms&quot;, has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.739W.6/3">Since then, the Department has received regular advice on Lyme disease from Professor Duerden, the latest of which was in February 2009, confirming that the current guidance for clinicians on the detection, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease as published by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is entirely appropriate for the management of Lyme disease in the UK. Advice was also received confirming that only validated tests that conform to the internationally agreed criteria for the diagnosis of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease, should be used for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. This advice is consistent with that on the HPA's website.</p>

He is currently assisted by a core team of three staff in his office: counsel, private secretary and administrative support, and his team will be joined shortly by professional actuarial advisers. The Treasury keeps Sir John's resource requirements under review and will fund any additional staff for his office he believes necessary to meet his terms of reference in a timely way.</p>

The salaries of each member of the team constitute personal data and release of this data would breach the Data Protection Act 1998 as it would disclose personal financial information without public interest justification.</p>

The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 gives local authorities wide powers to provide assistance for repairs, improvements, adaptations and to demolish and re-construct homes. Local authorities must have policies in place setting out how they will use these powers and they must make summaries of their policy available.

However, all ratepayers with enough outstanding 2009-10 rates liabilities will be able to defer the amounts set out above, which will be deducted from their remaining 2009-10 instalment payments. Those whose outstanding rates liability is less than the amount they can defer will be able to defer whatever is remaining of their 2009-10 liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.0/1">Zimbabwe's social and economic decline has forced many Zimbabweans to leave the country during the last few years. The vast majority of those leaving do so by irregular means and do not request refugee status. They are viewed by neighbouring governments as illegal economic migrants and run the risk of deportation. It is therefore difficult to assess their numbers or provide assistance. Since 2000, oppressive policies and post-election violence have also seen hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans forcibly displaced within the country. However the Government of Zimbabwe denies the existence of internally displaced people and has thus refused a comprehensive national assessment of their numbers and needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/2">In Zimbabwe, the Department for International Development (DFID) is the second largest donor to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), providing &pound;5 million to deliver humanitarian assistance to 250,000 Zimbabwean deportees from South Africa and 30,000 from Botswana, at key border crossing points, as well as over 240,000 victims of forced internal displacement. The UK also provides further support to Zimbabwean migrants, including street children, in Zambia and South Africa. DFID will provide around &pound;49 million of humanitarian and other essential support to the people of Zimbabwe this financial year, none of which goes through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.2/1">Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show in the 2007/08 academic year 73,150 postgraduate enrolments listed their highest qualification on entry to their science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) postgraduate course as a first degree from a UK institution. This represents 41 per cent. of all STEM postgraduate enrolments whose highest qualification on entry is known. Equivalent figures for 1976 to 1980 are not available.</p>

The young offender is required to attend the panel with their parent/s and must agree a contract which includes reparation or restoration to the victim, or the wider community if there is no direct victim or the victim does not wish to be directly involved, and a programme of interventions and activities to address their offending behaviour. A referral order can be made for a maximum period of 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.5/1">Probation areas have been required to promote the unpaid work community sentence as Community Payback since 2005. This has been done in a variety of ways including the use of signs at Community Payback work sites and on vehicles. In addition Probation areas have also worked to generate local and national publicity in order to increase public awareness of the millions of hours worked by offenders to make reparation for the crimes and to improve local communities. To further increase visibility and public confidence the use of distinctive clothing, to be worn by offenders sentenced to Community Payback, was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase>. This followed the review, 'Engaging Communities in Fighting Crime', which proposed that community payback should be made increasingly visible. A survey of members of the public conducted as part of the review found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/2" class="indent">90 per cent. agreed that all punishments for crime should involve some payback to the community;</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/3" class="indent">77 per cent. agreed that people should be informed about when and where the work would be carried out; and</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/4" class="indent">a strong majority wanted work under community sentencing to be made more visible.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/5">The number of hours worked by offenders and the number of Community Payback work projects on which high visibility clothing is worn is recorded by the National Offender Management Service and in March over 400,000 hours of Community Payback were undertaken by offenders wearing the distinctive clothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.5/6">Community Payback has featured in the recent 'Justice Seen, Justice Done' campaign where the public were able to have their say on work offenders carry out in 54 local authority areas. The Community Payback work projects nominated will be announced in the near future. Further work will also be undertaken to determine the level of public awareness of Community Payback.</p>
