	<p pid="b.573W.6/1">The CPS is the only one of my Departments covered by this question. The CPS started a 10-year private finance initiative (PFI) partnership with LogicaCMG in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/2">The contract with LogicaCMG covers the provision, support and refresh of the hardware and software applications used by the CPS. At the start of the contract all CPS owned IT assets were transferred to LogicaCMG. The value of the assets transferred was &pound;21 million. The total service cost of this contract over the 10-year period is forecast to be &pound;250 million. This is a projection of the supplier. The unitary charge payment is conditional on the performance of the supplier. The unitary charge payments cover the cost of service provision, capital repayment, technical refresh and inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/3">The business case for the procurement of this contract compared two feasible options <i> (a)</i> a PFI/public-private partnership (PPP) approach. This meant that there was a single prime contractor for all ICT infrastructure and case management services and expenditure would be transaction and business outcome based and <i> (b)</i> a public sector comparator (PSC) approach. This was based upon a prime contractor for IT infrastructure services, a prime contractor for case management system services, a prime contractor for wide area network services, and a prime contractor for consultancy services. Expenditure would have been a mix of capital investment and running costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/4">A cost comparison of the two approaches showed that the total service costs (undiscounted) for the PFI approach was similar as the PSC approach (&pound;327 million) because the PFI option total cost of &pound;359 million contained a total of &pound;31 million for contingency, and to account for transfer of the CPS's IT assets to LogicaCMG.</p>
	<p pid="b.573W.6/5">One of the major benefits of the PFI approach was that risks would be transferred to the supplier. When risk allocations were taken into account, the PFI approach (&pound;359 million) was estimated to save &pound;41 million over the risk adjusted PSC approach (&pound;400 million).</p>

	<p pid="b.575W.3/1">At the last replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the UK agreed to provide an additional &pound;100 million if the World Bank made progress on harmonisation and conditionality. The first &pound;50 million was linked to the bank carrying out a thorough review of its practice and current thinking on conditionality. In September 2005 the bank's governors endorsed this review, whose five new good practice principles for the use of conditions accord well with the principles underlying the UK policy on conditionality.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/2">Bank management agreed to report to the board on implementation after the first year. The first progress report did not provide sufficient information. In September 2006, we told the bank that we would withhold our second contribution of &pound;50 million until we saw clear evidence that the principles were being applied. President Wolfowitz agreed to produce a fuller report, which was discussed by the bank's board on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. In our view, this thorough and candid report provided the evidence that the bank has made the satisfactory progress on conditionality that is required to release the second &pound;50 million contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/3">The report reiterates bank management's strong commitment to make further improvements in its use of conditionality. Its several recommendations include:</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/4" class="indent">avoiding conditions on sensitive policy areas if government ownership is uncertain or the political environment is fragile;</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/5" class="indent">early and more proactive disclosure of the bank's analytic work;</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/6" class="indent">reducing the number of benchmarks;</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/7" class="indent">specifying the progress expected so that an assessment can be made of the impact of the programme on the poor and the bank's contribution to that programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/8">Benchmarks set out the steps that a Government will take in implementing their policies and plans. They are not equivalent to conditions and do not affect disbursement. However, there is much misunderstanding and misinformation surround them. Feedback from developing country governments suggests that they do not always distinguish between benchmarks and conditions. Part of the bank's response should therefore be to ensure greater understanding of the nature and purpose of benchmarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/9">Further progress on conditionality will be a central consideration in our funding of the next replenishment of IDA, which begins in March. We asked the Bank to produce their next report on conditionality later this year and to consult with developing country governments in order to hear their views on how things are changing.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.3/10">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has a set of conditionality guidelines that are aligned with the principles adopted by the Bank. The IMF's most recent internal review demonstrated an improved focus of conditions within its area of core competence on macroeconomics. In addition a detailed report by the Fund's Independent Evaluation Office is currently being finalised. This will examine the IMF's use of conditions in areas such as privatisation and trade liberalisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.2/1">The provision of direct development support by DFID to a partner Government is dependent on a number of conditions, including commitment to poverty reduction, human rights and accountability. Compliance with these conditions is assessed regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/2">However, DFID endeavours not to let the poor suffer by reducing our development assistance as a consequence of their Governments' political choices or shortcomings. We will not put money directly through Government systems in countries where we have concerns about accountability or governance. We will, however, stay engaged in such countries where we believe our assistance can have a positive impact on poverty reduction. In these instances we will channel funds through NGOs or other development agencies instead.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/3">There have been a number of cases since 2005 where events have caused DFID to review its bilateral engagement in certain countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/4">In the case of Uzbekistan, where there were serious concerns about human rights, we took the view that our small programme was unlikely to have significant impact on poverty reduction in the current political environment. We therefore closed the bilateral programme in January 2006, but continue to support a Central Asia regional programme on HIV and AIDS that includes Uzbekistan. We also support the continued engagement there of multilateral agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/5">In Rwanda DFID considered interrupting UK aid at the beginning of 2005. This was a consequence of threats by the Government of Rwanda to send troops into the Democratic Republic of the Congo to attack the bases of hostile militia. After careful monitoring and assessment indicated that such attacks had not occurred, UK aid was provided without any reduction in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/6">In several other cases we have not reduced funding but delayed it, chosen not to proceed with planned increases, or altered the channel through which we support poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/7">Ethiopia&mdash;In June 2005 DFID put on hold a proposed increase in direct budget support from &pound;30 million to &pound;50 million in the light of human rights abuses, which occurred following the general election. In November the same year, we suspended all direct budget support to Ethiopia. DFID did not reduce the overall levels of aid to Ethiopia and has developed alternative programmes for delivering assistance to poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/8">Uganda&mdash;Of &pound;50 million allocated by DFID as direct budget support to the Government of Uganda in the Ugandan financial year 2005-06, &pound;15 million was not disbursed, following concerns about delays in political transition, the continuation of state financing for the ruling party, events surrounding the arrest and trial of the leader of the main opposition party, and a significant overrun in public administration expenditure. The &pound;15 million was reallocated as humanitarian assistance in conflict affected areas of northern Uganda. Of the &pound;35 million balance, &pound;5 million was initially held back and linked to the conduct of multi-party elections; this sum was subsequently disbursed following the holding of these elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/9">In the Ugandan financial year 2006-07, DFID's direct budget support remained at &pound;35 million due to governance and public expenditure concerns, rather than increase to a potential &pound;55 million previously indicated to the Government of Uganda. Again, overall levels of UK aid were not affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/10">Sierra Leone&mdash;in 2006, DFID withheld &pound;2.5 million out of a &pound;15 million allocation of direct budget support (&pound;10 million baseline and &pound;5 million performance-linked) following weaker than expected progress against mutually agreed benchmarks. The funds remained within the DFID programme for Sierra Leone and were reallocated as support to the election process.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/11">Nepal&mdash;In February 2005 following King Gyanendra's declaration of a State of Emergency and imposition of direct rule, I agreed new criteria for deciding on our aid programme in Nepal. In March 2005, projects that had been supporting the Police, Prime Minister's Office and Prison Service as part of the Enabling State programme were stopped on effectiveness grounds. All other parts of the Nepal programme continued and funding for 2005-06 was maintained at 2004-05 levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/12">It was decided that support through Government systems would continue in health and education, but individual payments would require ministerial scrutiny to reflect the high level of risk. As a result, the way funding was given to the Rural Access programme and Livelihoods and Forestry programme was revised and payments were made through direct support to these programmes rather than financial aid through the Government of Nepal's budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/13">We welcome the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase> by the Seven Party Alliance Government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the subsequent Agreement on the monitoring of Arms and Armies on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase>. The agreements are a major step forward and the UK stands ready to help support implementation. DFID is reviewing its strategy and programme in the light of recent developments to ensure that we continue to respond effectively to the changed political and conflict environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/14">Palestinian Territories&mdash;Following the election of Hamas in January 2006 the Quartet (US, EU, UN and Russia) set out three principles for the new Palestinian Government: renouncing violence, recognising Israel's right to exist and signing up to previous peace agreements. As a result of Hamas's failure to comply with these principles the UK, alongside most of the international community, withdrew direct financial and technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/15">DFID has not, however, stopped or reduced its support to the Palestinians, but is disbursing funds in a different way. This includes a commitment of up to &pound;12 million channelled to the EU-led Temporary International Mechanism (TIM). This provides aid directly to the Palestinian people to help meet their basic needs in areas such as health. DFID has also provided &pound;15 million this year for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. DFID is satisfied with the arrangements put in place to ensure its current contributions to the TIM and previous budget support contributions to the World Bank-managed reform trust fund are used for the purposes intended.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.2/16">Further information on programmes where we have reduced or interrupted our development assistance can be found in table 6a of DFID's departmental report 2006, (please note this only covers the period between April and December 2005), a copy of which is available in the library and on DFID's website at the following address; <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/departmental-report/2006/default.asp">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/departmental-report/2006/default.asp</a></p>

	<p pid="b.593W.5/1">Good progress has been made since DEFRA and the devolved administrations published &quot;Securing the Benefits&quot; in response to the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit landmark report, &quot;Net Benefits&quot;. In particular, in terms of modernisation of fisheries management, we have achieved the following results:</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/2" class="indent">(i) We have appointed a Regional Fisheries Manager for South West England to pilot the benefits of the role.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/3" class="indent">(ii) We have begun work to change the quota management system in the UK. We are developing options for change and will soon be consulting on these.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/4" class="indent">(iii) We have set up a Marine Fisheries Science Advisory Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/5" class="indent">(iv) We have continued to fund the Fisheries Science Partnership and, with industry involvement, identified projects for 2006-07 including work on North East coast crabs and lobsters, North Sea whiting and Eastern Channel cod.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/6" class="indent">(v) We have set up a new fund for science projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/7" class="indent">(vi) We have put in place registration of buyers and sellers of fish to strengthen the assurance that all fish are caught and landed in compliance with the relevant fisheries legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/8" class="indent">(vii) We have appointed regional advisers to help with applications for grants under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/9" class="indent">(viii) We have announced that modernised Sea Fisheries Committees (SFCs) will be given new powers, through the Marine Bill, to deliver improved management of fish stocks and the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/10" class="indent">(ix) We have announced an increased minimum landing size for bass which will offer greater protection to the stock while providing more and larger bass for commercial fishermen and anglers.</p>
	<p pid="b.593W.5/11">Further information on the progress that has been made over the last year is contained in DEFRA's progress report which was published as a supplement to &quot;Fishing Focus&quot; in October 2006 on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/fish/pdf/fishfocus1006supp.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/fish/pdf/fishfocus 1006supp.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.596W.8/1">The Report of the re-opened formal investigation into the loss of the FV Gaul made four recommendations for consultation with the fishing industry. In putting these recommendations forward, the Wreck Commissioner was aware that they were likely to have been superseded by improvements in design and working practices that had evolved over the 30 years since the loss of the FV Gaul. Nevertheless, he considered that, because of their fundamental importance to the safety of fishing vessels, they should be reviewed again.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/2">The recommendations stated that:</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;permanent openings into critical internal spaces of a vessel, that could be submerged periodically and that are required to be kept open for intermittent purposes during fishing operations can usually be avoided by design. Such openings that do exist should have effective and, ideally passive or automatic means of closure;</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/4" class="indent">automatic pumping arrangements together with water level alarms should be fitted to any space which may be vulnerable to flooding which would significantly reduce the vessel's stability;</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/5" class="indent">warning lights should be installed in the wheelhouse to indicate any openings, watertight doors or hatches which remain open&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/6">The issues covered by these recommendations were initially addressed by the Fishing Vessels (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975, which came into force in <phrase class="date" code="1975-05-01">1 May 1975</phrase>. For vessels built on or after <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase>, further safety requirements were introduced by the Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-01">1 December 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/7">The final recommendation was that a CCTV camera, with a monitor on the bridge, should be fitted to allow the officer of the watch to monitor continually any large working spaces that are vulnerable to flooding and which may be left unattended for relatively long periods of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/8">The Fishing Vessels (EC Directive on Harmonised Safety Regime) Regulations 1999 require all vessels to be fitted with an audio and visual alarm (not necessarily a CCTV camera). It is considered that this requirement ensures an equivalent level of protection against flooding of the spaces mentioned in the recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/9">Since the publication of the report on the FV Gaul in 2004, the Department's Fishing Industry Safety Group (FISG), which includes representatives of the fishing industry, has been conducting-a review of all Rules and Regulations applicable to vessels of 24 m registered length and over. This review will consolidate, update and enhance the current legislation into one Code of Practice, in line with Better Regulation principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.596W.8/10">The review is expected to be completed in the spring and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) will then undertake a consultation exercise on behalf of FISG. The intention is that the new Code will come into force in winter 2007-08, and will also take account of the four recommendations made in the FV Gaul report.</p>

	<p pid="b.599W.2/1">All the funding is for local transport capital and the &pound;8 billion total is for five financial years (2006-07 to 2010-11). It consists of three funding streams allocated in different ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/2">Firstly, funding for integrated transport improvements (approximately &pound;2.9 billion) is being allocated according to three factors:</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/3" class="indent">(i) a formula, which considers local transport pressures;</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) the distribution of the equivalent funding in the previous five years (of most importance for the earlier years); and</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) the Department for Transport's classifications of the quality of the forward local transport plans and the delivery of the previous plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/6">Secondly, funding for highways capital maintenance (approximately &pound;3.6 billion) is being allocated largely according to a formula which considers pressures for road, bridge and (from 2007-08 onwards) street lighting capital maintenance. A small proportion (less than 10 per cent.) of the funding is being allocated in response to bids from local authorities for specific projects, mainly for strengthening bridges on main roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.599W.2/7">Thirdly, funding for major projects (in almost all cases each costing more than &pound;5 million) is allocated in response to bids from local authorities. For 2007-08 onwards decisions about which projects are funded are being influenced by advice from regional bodies. The exact funding levels for local authority projects depend on the priorities in each region between trunk road and local authority schemes. On the basis of the previous distribution, &pound;2 billion to &pound;2.5 billion of local authority projects would be funded over the five years.</p>

A school may wish to obtain and hold such data for different reasons, so there may be different legal basis from one circumstance to another. However in obtaining and holding biometric data, the school is likely to rely on the broad powers contained in paragraph 3 of schedule 1 to the Education Act 2002 which gives the governing body of a school the power to</p>

Under the Data Protection Act consent is not the only condition for the collection and use of data and will not necessarily require schools to seek consent from parents about the use of biometric data, though it is for the school to ensure it is acting in compliance with the Act. However under the terms of the Act schools should provide notification of their use of data to individuals involved.</p>

The costs incurred on the second contract totalled &pound;348,682; these details were reported in the 'Notes to the Department for Education and Skills Resource Accounts for 2003-04 (Ref: HC 227), TSO, London January 2005'.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase>, the HEFCE Board decided that in future HEFCE funding should support the development of e-learning in universities and colleges&mdash;in effect the HEFCE terminated UKeU. &pound;50 million out of the Government's allocation of &pound;62 million had been spent on the project. An analysis of the project is given in the report: 'The House of Commons Education and Skills Select Committee (2005), UK e-University, Third Report of Session 2004-05 (Ref: HC 205), TSO', London.</p>

	<p pid="b.607W.2/1">We are not aware of any reduction in the demand from pupils for learning a musical instrument. The Survey of Local Education Music Services 2002 reported that</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;although the proportion of individuals learning to play an instrument is relatively small, demand for tuition is very high&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.2/3">A report to the QCA in 2002 indicated that about 40 per cent. of children not already playing an instrument wanted to learn. Encouraging pupil demand is not therefore a problem but we do want to improve access. The Government accept the value of learning to play and have pledged to ensure that over time every child at Key Stage 2 who wants to should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. &pound;30 million of additional funding is being made available over this year and next specifically to support instrumental and vocal tuition for Key Stage 2 pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.608W.2/2">However, improving access in schools to instrumental and vocal tuition for whole classes and year groups at Key Stage 2, which began with &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; pilots, has already had an impact in primary school provision. The Survey of Local Education Authorities Music Services in 2005 found that 13 per cent. of Key Stage 2 pupils were learning to play an instrument in school&mdash;a significant improvement on 2002 when the figure was 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.608W.2/3">We are now providing additional resources to ensure many more primary school children can benefit from learning to play an instrument.

	<p pid="b.611W.2/1">I have no evidence of schools asking that pupils be prescribed Ritalin as a condition of their remaining at school, or of putting pressure on them to take Ritalin and on their parents to ensure that they do. Schools do not have authority to request that pupils be prescribed any medicines, including Ritalin. Ritalin can be prescribed only by an appropriately qualified prescriber. In 2005 my Department issued guidance on &quot;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&quot; designed to help schools develop policies on managing medicines and supporting individual children with medical needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.2/2">The Department does not collect information on the number of children prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate). According to Prescribing Analysis and Cost Tabulation (PACT) Data issued by the Prescription Pricing Division of the NHS Business Services Authority, in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase>, 384,000 prescriptions for methylphenidate were dispensed in England to children aged 0 to15 years and those aged 16 to 18 years in full time education. This does not show how many children were prescribed the drug.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.2/3">The Department works closely and regularly with the Department of Health (DH) on children's mental health issues. While DH has responsibility for the clinical aspects of mental health conditions, including ADHD, DfES has taken a number of steps to raise the profile of mental health and emotional well-being issues generally across our educational settings and children's services.</p>

	<p pid="b.612W.2/1">Since 1997, the Department has approved 174 applications from local authorities and schools to dispose, or change the use, of areas of school playing fields which are capable of forming at least a sports pitch, that is, greater than 2,000 sq m. Such applications are considered initially by the School Playing Field Advisory Panel, which provides independent advice on the extent to which individual applications meet the published criteria. In providing its advice, the panel will have regard to any existing community use, including use by after-hours sports groups, and will ensure that any community users are fully consulted and their interests protected. The Department does not keep any records relating to the consultation with local authority and other users.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.2/2">The Department does not have comprehensive data as to how much revenue has been made from the sale of school playing fields. This may be because the sale does not actually go ahead or, even if it does, the Department is not necessarily informed. However, the estimated value of the land for which approval has been given is &pound;278 million involving an area of 273 hectares. The information requested about the use of the sale proceeds in relation to the private finance initiative and public private partnership schemes is not held centrally. There is, however, an expectation that all proceeds from the sale of school playing fields will be re-invested to provide, firstly, new or improved sports facilities at schools or, secondly, will be used to help raise standards by providing educational facilities. Almost half of the land for which approval has been given is at schools that have closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.2/3">Since 1997 the Secretary of State has approved the disposal of areas of playing field at 13 schools in London. These are:</p>

The use of commercial partners, which perform routine functions such as collection of fees, data entry and the checking of documentation has enabled entry clearance staff to concentrate on front-line work to meet targets and handle increased numbers of applications.</p>

The review confirmed that the representative did advise Mr. Sivka that he should only apply for a one year stay, which was consistent with the documentation that he had produced with his application. The review also concluded that the Setup Travel Agency representative was trying to be helpful and he gave this advice with the best interests of Mr. Sivka in mind. Notwithstanding this, however, further training has been provided to the representative to ensure that inappropriate advice is not given in future and the Visa Section will continue to monitor performance regularly.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.8/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Gentleman with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the total is of uncollectable Child Support Agency arrears broken down by uncollectable due to (a) death (b) move abroad (c) unknown addresses (d) incorrect maintenance assessment and (e) other causes; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/5" class="indent">The Agency is not able to provide a breakdown of uncollectable Child Support Agency arrears into the requested categories. However, following a debt analysis exercise in 2005/06, the Agency is now able to classify debt with greater clarity than in previous years.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/6" class="indent">The attached tables provide the distribution of debt by type found by the debt analysis exercise. The exercise used a sample of cases on both computer systems, and had, in total, just over &pound;130m of probably uncollectable debt, and just over &pound;150m of possibly uncollectable debt. The Agency decides the sample size for its Debt Analysis Exercise according to robust statistical principles. This takes full account of the relative complexity of cases on each of the main systems so that the sample is statistically valid and is representative of the Agency's whole caseload.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/7" class="indent">The amount of debt categorised as probably uncollectable in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 2005/06 is &pound;1.929 billion. This includes the value of suspended debt, which is classified as probably uncollectable for this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/8" class="indent">The amount of debt categorised as possibly uncollectable in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 2005/06 is &pound;818 million, against which the provision below was made.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/9" class="indent">Tables providing a breakdown of these amounts by type are attached.</p>
