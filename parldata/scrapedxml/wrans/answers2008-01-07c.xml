	<p pid="c.3W.9/1">It is not possible to determine how much was spent just on heating on the parliamentary estate in each of the last four years. Most of the buildings are heated by natural gas boilers which are not metered separately; most of the gas meters also record the gas used in hot water generation and in some buildings, kitchens, as well as in heating. The heating costs of a small number of buildings are included in the leasing charges and therefore they are not known.</p>
	<p pid="c.3W.9/2">The amounts spent on gas on the parliamentary estate in each of the last four years are given in the following table:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="c.3W.9/5"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.5W.2/1">The issue of independent monitoring of breaches of aircraft noise limits is a matter for individual airports as part of their day-to-day operational business.</p>
	<p pid="c.5W.2/2">I am aware of a number of cases where airports ensure that there is independent consideration of their noise and track keeping systems either by being certified to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard or having environmental policy and management systems subject to regular independent audit. In their environmental guidance manual for airports the Airport Operators Association acknowledge that the demonstration of a good environmental management system through externally certified management system can enable the airport to secure better relationships with customers, investors and the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.5W.2/3">In the &quot;Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper we said that our preference remains that local solutions should be devised for local problems wherever possible, and we expect airport master plans to describe the package of measures that an airport operator intends to apply to deal with local noise problems. We look to individual airport noise and track keeping groups and consultative committees to monitor airport operations such as track-keeping, noise mapping and observance of Continuous Descent Approach (CDA).</p>

	<p pid="c.9W.8/3">Such operations might involve longer aggregate journeys where there are a number of stops, particularly in rural areas, but such journeys should not normally exceed a radius of 50 kilometres from the place where a vehicle is normally based.</p>

	<p pid="c.22W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is committed to doing all it reasonably can to ensure successful transition to civilian life. On discharge, all ex-service personnel are provided with a medical summary record, and this can be presented at the GP's surgery when they register with a civilian doctor. If the doctor has a requirement for the full medical record, we will provide this upon request.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.2/2">For the vast majority of service personnel these procedures are sufficient to ensure a seamless transition to the NHS. However, for those who are medically discharged with significant ongoing physical or mental health conditions, the care is formally handed over to appropriate by MOD specialists as the patient is medically discharged.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.2/3">In the case of physical illness or injury, social work teams at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre or the single service welfare organisations ensure this seamless transfer. For those with ongoing mental illness, the specific Defence Medical Services mental health team who have been caring for that individual will begin a liaison with appropriate civilian healthcare providers (e.g. general practitioner civil mental health team) to ensure that transfer of care and patient history takes place. Additionally, we have specific mental health social workers who manage the individual's wider resettlement issues, liaising with relevant civil agencies such as local housing authorities, financial authorities, service welfare and charitable organisations. These MOD mental health social workers ensure that the individual's transfer into the civilian environment is as smooth as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.2/4">Since the beginning of 2007, we have also put in place arrangements for the Department's Veterans Welfare Service to monitor those discharged with a seriously disabling injury; this covers cases of both physical and psychological injury. While this monitoring is primarily focused on welfare matters, the service will also identify sources of medical assistance where appropriate. In cases where there is a mental health issue, this could include if appropriate a NHS/MOD Mental Health Pilot team, the Medical Assessment Programme at St. Thomas' Hospital London, or the charity Combat Stress.</p>

	<p pid="c.22W.5/2">The Defence Medical Services (DMS) are headed jointly by the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Health) (DCDS(H) and the Surgeon General (SG). They oversee the work of three separate organisations:</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/3" class="indent">(a) Defence Medical Services Directorate Headquarters (DMSD HQ);</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/4" class="indent">(b) Defence Medical Education and Training Agency (DMETA);</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/5" class="indent">(c) Defence Dental Services (DDS).</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/6">DCDS(H) and SG also produce medical policy for the three single services. However, the Royal Navy (RN), Army and Royal Air Force (RAF) Medical Services are responsible for delivering primary healthcare to their respective service commanders in chief and for providing the requisite medical support on operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.22W.5/7">The overall expenditure for the DCDS(Health) organisation for the financial year 2006-07 was &pound;268 million. The organisational structure of the DMS in its entirety means that comprehensive primary care and operational costs cannot be provided without disproportionate effort as they are disaggregated and embedded in individual military units' budgets.</p>

	<p pid="c.24W.2/1">The best method to prevent infection with influenza is by prior immunisation with an appropriate vaccine. The Department of Health (DH) has purchased a quantity of the H5N1 Avian Flu vaccine, which could be offered to key occupational groups when the risk of a pandemic increases as it may give a degree of protection should the pandemic strain be a variant of H5N1. Supplies of this vaccine are being held by the DH on behalf of the MOD and in the event of an outbreak will be deployed by MOD in accordance with DH guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.2/2">When an influenza virus is already circulating, therapeutic antiviral agents can help to lessen the severity of illness, reduce deaths and contain spread. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that during an influenza pandemic, patients with a flu-like illness should be treated with zanamivir (&quot;Relenza&quot;) or oseltamivir (&quot;Tamiflu&quot;). The DH has arranged for an appropriate stockpile quantity of Tamiflu to be purchased, which is also being held centrally, and includes an allocation for MOD. For armed forces personnel employed at one of MOD's Permanent Joint Overseas Bases (PJOBs), stockpiles of the Tamiflu antiviral have been pre-positioned within the PJOB logistics chain for rapid deployment if necessary. For those on operational deployment in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere, supplies are held by Permanent Joint Headquarters, and will be deployed to theatre as required.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.2/3">Supplies of face-masks are already held in-theatre and will be used with other appropriate preventative measures in the event of a pandemic outbreak of influenza.</p>

	<p pid="c.33W.5/1">Under Government Finance Accounting Regulations (Managing Public Money), there are no special arrangements for the treatment of charities, whether service or other. The fact that a charity is to be the main beneficiary of a good or service is not in itself sufficient justification to introduce a special charging regime or to set charges aside. There is the opportunity for abatement of full costs and this decision is on a case-by-case basic taking account of any special circumstances that may apply.</p>
	<p pid="c.33W.5/2">All privately-run events on departmental property, whether charitable or other are required to be covered by public liability insurance. This requirement is passed on to the organiser who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate cover is in place. Where commercial insurance is either not available or only at disproportionate cost, then organisers are charged under a Departmental Insurance Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.41W.0/1">Estimates of aggregate MOD cash expenditure in UK industry and commerce, by standard industrial classification (SIC), are published in the annual United Kingdom Defence Statistics, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. This analysis, however, is not fully compatible with the Treasury RfR framework, as it measures only cash expenditure and excludes non-cash costs such as depreciation; it includes both capital and resource expenditure; and it does not cover expenditure overseas incurred by the Department. It is likely also to include expenditure which may be claimed under RfR2 (Conflict Prevention). Identification of RfRl near cash expenditure by SIC could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

However, in 148 of these cases (5 per cent. of the total received), the delay was authorised by a legitimate extension of the 20-working day time limit, permitted under the Freedom of Information Act; the Department, therefore, answered 88 per cent. of requests for information 'in-time'.</p>

The remaining 10 per cent. of requests had not received a response at the time these statistics were collected, which is done by quarterly report.</p>

Additionally, the Defence Medical Services Department (DMSD) has issued periodic policy guidance to the Single Services, designed to inform defence medical professionals, beginning in October 2005 when &quot;Preparing for an Influenza Pandemic in UK&quot; was issued. In January 2006 DMSD produced &quot;Use of Influenza Vaccines and Anti-virals in the event of an Influenza Pandemic&quot;, and, in February 2007, &quot;Pandemic Influenza&mdash;Infection Control Guidelines for Military Settings&quot; was issued, produced by DMSD in collaboration with the HPA.</p>

Both PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service are seeking to develop models of best investigative practice so that more cases can achieve the evidential threshold for prosecution. Government are also currently consulting on draft legislation which would provide enhanced levels of public protection, including the introduction of robust new sentences for dealing with dangerous sexual and violent offenders.</p>

The strategy is scheduled to be published in early 2008. As part of that process we have already made significant progress, in partnership with the medical profession and voluntary sector, in developing proposals for a sexual assault referral centre (SARC) in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.64W.2/1">Government emissions reduction targets currently exclude international aviation emissions as there is no agreed way of allocating responsibility for these to individual countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.64W.2/2">However under the current proposal to include aviation in the EU ETS, emissions from the aviation sector would be capped at the level of average 2004-06 emissions, and carbon allowances would only be issued up to the level of this cap. Emissions over this cap will be covered either through mitigation within the sector or through the purchase of reductions that can be produced more cheaply and easily by other sectors. This would be the case regardless of whether this growth in emissions was from new airport capacity, the provision of new routes or extra services on existing routes. This approach means that growth in aviation (including Heathrow expansion) would be sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="c.66W.2/1">Tackling fly-tipping and wider waste crime is a priority for the Government. Our Waste Strategy for England, published in May 2007, makes clear that initiatives to boost waste prevention and recycling should be supported by fly-tipping strategies aimed at tackling the illegal dumping of waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/2">The Strategy includes the Government's Illegal Waste Activity Action Plan, which sets out what action is being taken and proposed in this area. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Reviewing the controls in place to deal with the management and carriage of waste. The review aims to reduce levels of fly-tipping by making it easier for businesses to understand and comply with the regulations and make them easier for local authorities to use.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) Developing legislation that will give local authorities and the Environment Agency the powers to stop, search and instantly seize vehicles being used to commit fly-tipping offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) Introducing mandatory Site Waste Management Plans for construction and demolition projects above a certain value.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) Funding the Environment Agency's targeted campaigns to disseminate good practice to businesses and raise awareness of good waste management practices.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/7" class="indent">(v) Delivering Flycapture Enforcement, a training programme aimed at local authority officers and their legal teams to increase knowledge of the relevant legislation and develop skills in effective enforcement and prosecution of fly-tippers.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/8" class="indent">(vi) Work with stakeholders to consider how the Flycapture database can be enhanced or improved to help local authorities implement fly-tipping interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/9">DEFRA has also funded Environmental Campaigns (Encams) to deliver a programme of work on local environmental quality and fly-tipping issues in partnership with Government Offices. This work will support the poorest performing local authorities in each region through a combination of data analysis, best practice sharing and targeted seminars. It will also promote the introduction of fly-tipping targets within local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.66W.2/10">In addition, DEFRA funded the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science to produce research on fly-tipping&mdash;&quot;Fly-tipping: Causes, Incentives and Solutions&quot;. This included good practice guidance on crime prevention techniques, including surveillance, and has been distributed to all local authorities in England.</p>

	<p pid="c.66W.5/1">It is very unlikely that climate change agreements (CCAs) would be relevant to the water-borne freight sector. CCAs provide for a reduction in the climate change levy (CCL) when operators meet challenging energy efficiency targets. However, CCL is not charged on every kind of fuel: it only applies to commodities specified in schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2000 as taxable commodities (including electricity, gas of a kind supplied by a gas utility, liquid petroleum gas and solid fuels). Furthermore, where a taxable commodity is used in a ship operating in international waters it may be eligible for exemption from CCL. Also, in order to qualify, the operator would have to engage in an eligible process, which is defined as either a process regulated under part A of the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 or meet specific energy intensity criteria. Water-borne freight is unlikely to meet either of these criteria.</p>

Economic growth will also be boosted by the job creation arising from the games, strategies to drive up the skills base, not just in East London but across the UK, and a reduction in worklessness. The games also provide an opportunity to increase inward investment into the UK. Our aim is to ensure these benefits will be spread around the whole of the UK, not concentrated in London.</p>

	<p pid="c.78W.5/1">Question 166624 refers to the higher education maintenance grant, which will be worth up to &pound;2,835 in academic year 2008-09. Information on the numbers of students in each parliamentary constituency who will be eligible for a full or partial grant in 2008-09 is not available. However, information on grants in 2006-07 show which areas have higher proportions of students receiving full and partial grants. The available data on grants at local authority level are given in the following table; this information is not available at constituency level. The family income threshold for full maintenance grant of &pound;2,700 in 2006-07 was &pound;17,500, with a partial grant available to students with a family income of up to &pound;37,425. In 2008-09 the thresholds will be raised to &pound;25,000 for a full grant and &pound;60,005 for a partial grant. This very large increase in the thresholds mean that 2006-07 figures can not be used as an indication of 2008-09 full and partial grant proportions.</p>
	<p pid="c.78W.5/2">The main measure for tracking progress on increasing participation is currently the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR). This is the sum of the HE initial participation rates for individual ages between 17 and 30 inclusive. The latest available figure is 42.8 per cent. for 2005-06. The 2005-06 figure for the young 17-20 age group is 34.0 per cent. The HEIPR is not disaggregated below national level.</p>

It was intended that a seasonal biometrics collection facility in Gomel Oblast specifically for children wishing to come to the UK for respite care would be offered. This would have been in addition to the service offered in our embassy in Minsk. However, the Government of Belarus would not allow the delivery of this visa service, including the collection of biometrics, through our commercial partnerships in the country and the embassy was compelled to adjust its plans. Correspondence with the Belarus embassy in London is ongoing. Given the lack of agreement with the Belarus authorities in respect to our commercial partnerships in Belarus, it has now been agreed that a seasonal mobile biometrics data collection service will operate on a pilot basis outside Minsk in the summer of 2008 for children in need of recuperative holidays. The pilot will involve the use of mobile biometric collection equipment in one or more regional locations between April and July.

	<p pid="c.94W.0/2">If Iran implements the Work Plan in full, it will be a step towards restoring trust in Iran's nuclear intentions. But addressing the outstanding issues is only one of the steps the international community requires Iran to take in order to restore confidence in its intentions. Iran needs to suspend enrichment, enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as requested by the IAEA Board of Governors and required by UN Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, and 1747. Iran also needs to implement fully the additional protocol and additional measures that the IAEA has requested. Until Iran meets these obligations we will continue to follow the dual track strategy agreed with our partners in the &quot;E3+3&quot; (China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States), and to discuss further measures aimed at persuading Iran to fulfil all its international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="c.94W.3/1">We are concerned about the proliferation risk that would be posed if Iran completes construction of a heavy water reactor. This type of reactor is particularly well suited for producing plutonium, which could be reprocessed and used in a nuclear weapon. This is reflected by the demands in UN Security Council resolutions 1737 and 1747, which require that Iran suspends work on heavy water-related projects, including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly reported that construction of the reactor has nevertheless been continuing. The February 2006 IAEA Director-General's report noted the Iranians saying that the commissioning date for the reactor was likely to be postponed until 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.99W.5/1">Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1992 as a consequence of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh. The closure of the border has inevitably inhibited the economic development of Armenia by limiting trade prospects. An open border between Turkey and Armenia is desirable and would bring benefits for both countries. We hope that the political situation in the region develops in such a way as to allow this. We encourage the Governments of Armenia and Turkey to look to the future and build a better relationship between their countries. In the meantime, we will continue to work for peace, security and mutual understanding in the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.102W.2/2">&quot;Lives saved' is an assessment of the cumulative effect of year on year reductions to the numbers of deaths in a specific age group and from a specific cause of death. In this case, it relates to deaths from cancer at ages under 75. It is calculated by subtracting from the number of deaths that occurred in the first year of the period, the number of deaths registered in each subsequent year, and then totalling the differences.</p>
	<p pid="c.102W.2/3">The cancer mortality target rate is calculated using three-year moving averages. In order to make concise statements, the three-year periods are sometimes referred to by the middle year of the period, this convention has been used in the first bullet point in paragraph 1.4 of the Cancer Reform Strategy. From the baseline in 1995-96-97 to the most recent period, 2004-05-06, the cancer mortality rate in people aged under 75 in England has fallen by over 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.102W.2/4">Lives saved are calculated using single year data. The middle year of the baseline period, 1996, is used as the baseline. Using single year data, to the most recent period, 2006, there were approximately 60,000 lives saved, compared to 1996.</p>
	<p pid="c.102W.2/5">The equivalent period before 1996 is 1985 to 1995. From 1984-85-86 to 1993-94-95 cancer mortality in people under age 75 in England fell by almost 10 per cent. With 1985 as the baseline, this equates to approximately 35,000 lives saved between 1985 and 1995.</p>

	<p pid="c.109W.6/1">The child health interim application (CHIA) was introduced in response to a decision in early 2005 to withdraw support for the ageing Regional Interactive Child Health System (RICHS) from 10 primary care trusts (PCTs) in London taken by its commercial supplier. CHIA was delivered to these PCTs at short notice by BT, the London local service provider under the national programme for information technology, as an interim measure at the request of the local national health service. At the same time NHS Connecting for Health, PCTs and BT were working together on a longer-term solution. The PCTs chose CSE Servelec's RiO system to be their strategic system, and all CHIA trusts will eventually migrate to RiO, which began roll-out in London in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/2">CHIA was always intended as a rapidly-produced like-for-like replacement for the RICHS system. There was no intention to provide an enhanced product.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/3">PCTs have been heavily involved in the development of the strategic system including the specification of criteria deemed essential by the PCTs using CHIA. They identified the automatic making of appointments and scheduling, and an electronic link with Great Ormond Street's newborn blood spot screening programme, as vital components of the new system. These functions will be present when the first trusts migrate from CHIA to RiO early next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.109W.6/4">Unlike CHIA and RICHS, RiO is an evolving product with capacity for continuing development over time.</p>

	<p pid="c.112W.6/4">The additional need element of the formula is intended to reflect the relative need for health care over and above that accounted for by age. The need weighting takes the form of indices fro two broad service areas:</p>

	<p pid="c.112W.6/6" class="indent">mental health.</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.6/7">The indices are based on models of utilisation of health care and comprise a number of socio-economic and health related variables. There are two different groups of variables included in these models:</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.6/8" class="indent">standard variables derived from small area statistical modelling of utilisation; and</p>
	<p pid="c.112W.6/9" class="indent">additional morbidity variables designed to capture some of the effect of unmet need where ethnic minority groups and low income groups do not receive healthcare services to the same level to that of others with similar health characteristics.</p>

	<p pid="c.120W.2/1">Mental health was identified as a key clinical priority in &quot;Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&quot;, in 1998, which set out a target to reduce suicides by one fifth by 2010. This target is included in the Department's public service agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/2">We published the first ever National Service Framework (NSF) in England for adult mental health services in 1999. It laid down models of treatment and care which people would be entitled to expect in every part of the country and was a deliberate move to raise the profile of mental health. Since then, mental health services have been working to implement a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, raise standards and provide quicker and more convenient services.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/3">The &quot;NHS Plan&quot; 2000, aimed to strengthen community care and in doing so, take pressure off acute beds. It provided an extra annual investment of over &pound;300 million by 2003-04 to fast forward the NSF.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/4">From 2001-02 to 2006-07, real terms investment in adult mental health services increased by 31 per cent. (or &pound;1.2 billion)&mdash;that is &pound;1.9 billion in cash terms. The national health service spent over &pound;5.1 billion on adult mental health services in 2006-07 compared to &pound;3.9 billion in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/5">Key targets were set for service delivery on early intervention, crisis resolution and assertive outreach services and, due to the NSF and increased funding, we now have over 700 new mental health teams working in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/6">During 2006-07, crisis and home treatment teams provided 95,000 episodes of home treatment against 84,000 in 2005-06 for people who would otherwise have been admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/7">The Government have allocated an extra &pound;130 million in 2006-07 to provide more appropriate 'places of safety' for people detained under the Mental Health Act by the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/8">We now have 55 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, almost 70 per cent. more clinical psychologists and at least 20 per cent. more mental health nurses than we had in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/9">Because of the NSF and increased funding, we now have over 700 new mental health teams working in the community (that includes assertive outreach, early intervention, crisis resolution teams).</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/10">A five-year action plan is in place to address inequalities in the experience Black and minority ethnic people have in accessing services.</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/11">We are also committed to expanding access to psychological therapies as a positive alternative to medication. By 2010-11, the NHS will spend &pound;170 million per year on psychological therapies, with &pound;33 million in 2008-09, &pound;103 million in 2009-10 and &pound;173 million in 2010-11. This investment will mean:</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/12" class="indent">900,000 more people will be treated for depression and anxiety, many of whom will be completely cured;</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/13" class="indent">450,000 achieving measurable recovery;</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/14" class="indent">all GP practices will have access to psychological therapies as the programme rolls out; and</p>
	<p pid="c.120W.2/15" class="indent">the average waiting time for psychological treatments will reduce from the current 18 months to a few weeks.</p>

	<p pid="c.122W.6/2">The utilisation of ISTC contracts (the levels of update of services provided) is monitored by the Central Contracts Monitoring Unit of the Department's Commercial Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.6/3">The Department works with sponsors and providers to ensure optimum utilisation of the contracts through the total contract period. This includes changing the case-mix to respond to local needs, and working with providers and primary care trusts to recover previous under-utilised activity where possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.122W.6/4">The Department does not routinely collect information on the number of complaints made in respect of ISTCs. However, the Department, the NHS and providers meet quarterly for a Joint Service Review to discuss a range of operational issues and to ensure that the services offered deliver a high-quality effective service to the NHS patients that they serve.</p>

Controls on the removal of SRM are set out in Community regulations which are applicable in all member states. The European Commission published its TSE Road Map on the future of TSE controls in July 2005.

	<p pid="c.147W.5/3">The National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence has an objective to improve the criminal justice response to domestic violence. This objective includes actions to increase reporting, arrests and conviction rates for domestic violence. Specific actions undertaken to increase the conviction rates for domestic violence include:</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.5/4" class="indent">The continued expansion of the Specialist Domestic Violence Court (SDVC) Programme. From April this year, 64 SDVCs are operational, with more planned which will bring the total to over 100.</p>

	<p pid="c.147W.5/6" class="indent">Domestic Violence Co-ordinators have been identified in all police force and Crown Prosecution Service areas to co-ordinate individual agencies' responses to domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.5/7" class="indent">Funding has been made available for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, whose involvement with victims of domestic violence has been shown to reduce the number of victims unwilling to support a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="c.147W.5/8">These steps are having a positive effect: successful prosecutions for domestic violence cases rose from 46 per cent. in a December 2003 'snapshot' to 65 per cent. during the whole of 2006-07, exceeding the target of 64 per cent. By September 2007, successful prosecutions had reached 68 per cent.</p>

The Government are keen that there should be a robust convention along the lines of the Freedom of Information Act. The draft convention lays down principles relating to access, whereas the Freedom of Information Act 2000 sets out the detailed provisions of the access regime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In relation to coverage of public authorities the scope of the convention is broadly the same as the Freedom of Information Act, where it will be open to parties to the convention to broaden the definition of &quot;public authorities&quot; beyond an obligatory minimum standard. The Government are currently seeking views on whether to use the powers under section 5 of the Freedom of Information Act and extend the coverage of the Act and if so, which organisations it should consider.</p>

	<p pid="c.152W.11/1">Land Registry constantly keeps such matters under review and is continuously reviewing the security control and access restrictions in place for its internal and external online systems. Land Registry withdrew access to documents available electronically via Land Registry Online on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-05">5 November 2007</phrase> and believes this to be a positive step that will help to alleviate the risk of misuse. It would be inappropriate to give details of the specific measures Land Registry has in place to combat abuse and illegal access or those it is considering introducing. Land Registry does have in place a robust anti-fraud strategy and all measures in place are regularly reviewed and revised, with a view to strengthening the protection they provide. Land Registry is working with the police and other organisations to refine its strategy and to develop its expertise in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.154W.0/1">Representation at inquests is outside of the usual scope of the legal aid scheme as set out in the Access to Justice Act 1999 and other documents laid before Parliament. However, it can be made available in exceptional circumstances. There are published criteria that help determine whether a case is exceptional. Applications for exceptional funding must first be made to the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The Ministry understands that applications, in relation to the inquests into the deaths of personnel on the Hercules XV179 shot down in Iraq in January 2005, are currently being considered by the LSC. Only where the LSC considers that the exceptional criteria are met will the applications be passed to the Ministry of Justice for final determination. The Government have not advised the press about any representation of other parties at those inquests.</p>

	<p pid="c.164W.2/1">In December 2006, the Government set out in the document 'Reducing Re-offending through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' their plans for improving the skills and employment outcomes for all offenders in custody and in the community. A key element of this plan involves engaging employers to work with offenders and ex-offenders. Many employers offer training programmes which not only teach vocational skills but also involve mentoring in order to develop softer skills and improve employability. These softer skills include job searching, CV preparation, interview techniques and customer service.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.2/2">Mentoring is also a vital service offered by voluntary and community sector organisations. There are several projects running across the country where these organisations work in partnership with Probation Boards, the Prison Service and the regional Government offices to remove barriers to employment for offenders, including via mentoring on release from custody.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.2/3">The Government's aim is to facilitate the sharing of good practice and lessons learnt from all the above examples of mentoring to encourage further and wider use of the methods which are proven to work best in improving skills and employability of offenders.</p>

The average cost is therefore estimated to be &pound;120 per prisoner per night.</p>

	<p pid="c.169W.2/1">Expenditure is not reported according to the categories requested. Probation boards meet the cost of managing and enforcing Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTO) and Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRR) through their grant as they see fit to meet their statutory duties. The following table shows the total budget allocation to probation areas in England and Wales over the period in question:</p>

In England, the treatment and testing components of the Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO) and Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR) are currently funded by a central contribution to the Department of Health Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB). The total contribution in 2003-04 was &pound;29.7 million, rising to &pound;42 million in each of the subsequent years, including 2006-07 as described in the following table below:</p>

	<p pid="c.184W.0/1">Red, amber, green status reporting is a valuable internal management tool for focusing efforts on key operational or strategic issues to ensure effective delivery of switchover. In this case red status reflected a concern about tight timescales for the delivery of the Digital Switchover Help Scheme in Whitehaven.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/2">Digital UK informed me that the switchover programme was likely to move to red status at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August 2007</phrase> and at the same time set out the steps that the programme was taking to resolve the issue. Given that this was essentially an operational issue and that plans to address it were being put in place, it was not at that stage an issue for widespread concern which necessitated informing Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/3">At the next meeting of the Switchover Programme Group sufficient action had been taken and the group agreed to revert to amber status. The relevant extract from the minutes of this meeting is given as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/4">The Digital UK Programme Office issues a status alert if a move to 'red' needs to be brought to the attention of the Switchover Programme Group before their next scheduled monthly meeting. Quarterly progress reports on the switchover programme, including its red/amber/green status, are published on:</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk">www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/6">All such changes in status and the implications of them, including whether to inform Parliament, will be considered on an individual basis depending upon the severity of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/7">The current status of the switchover programme is amber. The criteria used by the Digital Switchover Programme for awarding red, amber and green status are:</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/8" class="indent">Green: Good progress towards all milestones and objectives: no cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/9" class="indent">Amber: Some cause for concern: one or two milestones missed and indications are that this will recur. Issues may exist, but corrective action identified and being taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/10" class="indent">Red: Major cause for concern: several milestones missed or about to be missed endangering programme objectives. Further milestones will be missed unless proactive steps taken and sustained action supported by the programme or programme-critical issues exist with no clear course of corrective action identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/11" class="italic"> Switchover Programme Group: Extract from minutes of meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.184W.0/12" class="indent">Alex Pumfrey returned to the reasons why the Copeland Help Scheme was originally placed on red status on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-13">13 August</phrase>: (i) the need for reassurance that there was sufficient delivery and installer capacity to meet demand, which Peter White had confirmed there was; (ii) the need for a forward plan of activity, which has been shared; and (iii) assurance from DSHS that people have been given sufficient time to respond. Peter White noted that among the groups eligible for free help, 43 per cent. had responded, which indicated that people had had sufficient time to respond if they wished, and that low response was more likely to be attributable to the deterrent effect of the &pound;40 charge or take-up of satellite. On this basis the group agreed to move the Copeland Help Scheme from red to amber status.</p>

	<p pid="c.199W.3/2">The National Foundation for Educational Research (&quot;Admissions: who goes where? Messages from the statistics&quot;, published July 2006) found that academies tended to be situated in areas where the community populations included higher proportions of children eligible for free school meals (FSM); with special educational needs (SEN); of black or ethnic minority origin; and of lower key stage 2 (KS2) ability; and that academies admit higher proportions of pupils eligible for FSM and with SEN than the proportion living in the local postcode districts. Furthermore, they admit a lower proportion of pupils of higher KS2 ability compared to the proportion living within the local postcode districts.</p>
	<p pid="c.199W.3/3">There is a large body of evidence from independent reports and examination results that the academies programme is succeeding in raising aspirations and attainment in the communities they serve. The National Audit Office concluded that pupils' achievements in 2005 and 2006 indicated a strong trend in raising attainment, and that if this trend continues, the academies programme will meet its objective of raising attainment in deprived areas (&quot;The Academies Programme&quot;, National Audit Office, February 2007, page 8). The Government agree with this assessment, which is why the Secretary of State in his statement to the House of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-10.1319"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 1319-23</phrase>, announced a series of measures to accelerate the academies programme, and the Department plans to open 50 new academies in each of the next three years on its way to opening at least 400 academies.</p>

	<p pid="c.200W.8/1">The Department announced its policy on sprinkler systems for schools in March 2007. The policy is that a risk assessment should be undertaken for new and refurbishment projects in all categories of state-funded schools including all BSF schools. To help local authorities and school designers to decide when sprinklers are needed, DCSF has produced a risk assessment tool and a cost benefit analysis tool. See <a href="http://www.teachernetgov.uk/fire">www.teachernetgov.uk/fire</a> and follow links to Sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.8/2">Our presumption is that new schools and some refurbished schools will have fire sprinklers installed, however this is not a compulsory measure. There may be cases where local authorities or other promoters of schools consider that sprinklers are not needed. If so, they will need to be able to demonstrate that such schools are very low risk and that sprinklers would not represent good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.8/3">To date, seven schools have been built under the Building Schools for the Future programme, in Bristol, Solihull, Haringey, Sheffield, South Tyneside, Stoke and Sunderland; these include six 'early win' projects. We believe that the Bristol Brunei Academy is the only one fitted with a sprinkler system. This was a large new build project and the most suitable for a sprinkler installation. Five of the other six schools were refurbishment projects where it may not have been technically feasible to install sprinkler systems. It is also more expensive to install sprinklers in a refurbishment which means they do not always provide good value for money. These projects were all in the late design or construction stage when the new sprinkler policy was announced which would have made it more expensive and technically difficult to install sprinkler systems unless they were part of the original design.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.8/4">We expect approximately 80 schools to be under construction in the current financial year in the following local authorities: Bradford, Bristol, Lewisham, Sheffield, Knowsley, Lancashire, Leeds, Leicester, Manchester, Newcastle, Solihull, Stoke, Sunderland, Waltham Forest, Lambeth, Durham and Kent.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.8/5">Under Building Schools for the Future, we plan to rebuild, remodel or refurbish all secondary schools in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.8/6">For projects that were either in a late stage of design or in construction when the new sprinkler policy was announced it is difficult to introduce a sprinkler system. However, for new projects and those still in an early stage of design we expect sprinklers to be included.</p>

	<p pid="c.203W.2/19" class="indent">The consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase> and a full response was published. There are two strands to the programmes of work to take forward the Organising for Quality programme. The first of these is the introduction of new National Standards for Cafcass. These were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">01 April 2007</phrase> and are supported by revised practice guidelines and a comprehensive training programme. The second strand is that of organisational structures aimed at further efficiencies and improved practice. The changes at the first line management level are being achieved through a refocusing of priorities and a narrowing of the roles and responsibilities of first line managers to focus on practice, performance and staff development.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.2/20" class="indent">The majority of the structural changes will be completed by April 2008 and a period of consolidation will then follow.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.2/21" class="indent">There were thirty-two key proposals in the Cafcass consultation paper Organising for Quality. Twenty-two are being taken forward either as part of the current Cafcass restructuring programme, or within the delivery of the 2007-10 Business Plan. Six proposals are being taken forward in a modified form. Only one proposal for a Practice Advice Line, is being piloted. Four proposals are not being proceeded with at all, following a review of all proposals we received in the light of the consultation responses.</p>

	<p pid="c.203W.2/23" class="indent">Cafcass are in the process of negotiating significant changes to the Service Manager role to ensure both manageable and effective workloads. We intend to give Service Managers a reduced span of control and more business support to enable them to focus on practice, performance and staff development. These changes will be in place across most of the country by the start of the new financial year in April 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.203W.2/25" class="indent">No specific additional representations were received from service managers, apart from those received on a number of previous occasions, both directly and via trade unions and professional associations. Cafcass accepted the core points being made some time ago, and resolution of them has needed to wait for the resources to become available. Over the last two years, we did increase our national establishment by 15 Service Managers, which has made a difference, but my intention is that we take further steps in April 2008 to reduce workloads.</p>

	<p pid="c.205W.2/1">There is no information collected on waiting times or eligibility for direct payments, nor any estimate made of these. However, data are collected on the number of disabled children aged 16-17, and the number of carers of disabled children, receiving direct payments at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase> each year. The most recent data available are for <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, and show that 649 children and 4,170 carers were receiving these payments in England. These data are also available by local authority, and have been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.205W.2/2">In terms of local government funding, the children's social care relative needs formula (RNF) is designed specifically to allocate funding for the provision of children's social care services in local authorities in England. The formula takes account of the resident children population aged 0 to 17, deprivation top-up, foster and area cost adjustments. However, there is no specific element of the formula which takes into account the use of direct payments. This is because direct payments are designed to be cost-neutral, providing equivalent cash payments made in lieu of social service provisions to individuals or families.</p>

	<p pid="c.205W.5/21">Although these results are the best ever, we know that we can and must do more. We have a strong platform for securing further improvements. The Children's Plan, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">11 December</phrase> sets out that vision and our goals for achieving world class standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.205W.5/22">Every primary school is now using the renewed Primary Framework which puts phonics at the heart of the teaching of reading. We are also introducing nationally the Every Child a Reader (ECAR) programme. By 2011 this programme will provide 30,000 six-year-olds who have difficulty reading with intensive one-to-one tuition each year. Results from the first year of the pilot, involving some of the most disadvantaged children, showed they made well over four times the normal rate of progress in reading as a result of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.225W.8/2">As the hon. Gentleman will be aware from my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-08">8 November</phrase>, in 2002 the Government published the National Languages Strategy, with the overarching objective of improving the teaching and learning of languages across all phases of education. The Languages review, chaired by Lord Bearing and Lid King, the National Director of Languages, progressed this process further.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/3">We have taken a number of steps to improve standards of foreign language education. This week we have confirmed in the Children's Plan that the review of the primary curriculum will examine how best to introduce languages as a compulsory subject in primary schools, which will include how standards can be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/4">Standards in languages at key stage 3 are rising faster than in any other subject. The proportion of pupils achieving level 5 and above rose from 54 per cent. to 58 per cent. between 2006 and 2007, while the figure for those who achieved level 6 or above rose from 22 per cent. to 25 per cent. This improvement has been supported by the development of Strategic Learning Networks, enabling language teachers to work together and share good practice. The revised key stage 3 curriculum will be more relevant and engaging for young people and should continue this improvement in standards. Specialist language colleges receive additional money for outreach work with local schools, which can be used to improve standards at key stage 4.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/5">The proportion of those pupils achieving an A*-C grade in a GCSE language subject has increased from 48 per cent. in 1997 to 66 per cent. in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/6">The Languages Ladder/Asset Languages Scheme, introduced in 2005, complements existing qualifications and allows learners to progress at their own pace in one or more of the four language skills&mdash;speaking, listening, reading and writing. This allows pupils who may not previously have achieved a languages qualification to have their achievement recognised.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.8/7">Finally, we have announced the development of a new diploma in languages to be introduced from 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.226W.2/1">We have no plans to do so. Choice of which subjects to offer at A level is a matter for schools to determine. We were pleased to see a small increase in the number of pupils studying languages at A level in 2007. This shows that young people choosing to learn languages at GCSE are enthusiastic language learners who are more likely to continue learning post-16.</p>

	<p pid="c.228W.2/2">The Department does not collect data on the number of pupils withdrawn from Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). However, Ofsted's survey on SRE published in 2002 found that only 0.04 per cent. of pupils were withdrawn from the non-statutory aspects of SRE normally delivered through PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.2/3">Similarly, the Department does not collect data or the number of schools who include SRE within PSHE, but departmental guidance on SRE (DfES, 2000) makes clear that schools should embed SRE within their programmes for PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.2/4">In 2006 there were 1,129 school nurses with a school nurse qualification (an increase of 31.9 per cent. since 2004). Their involvement in the delivery of SRE is a decision for primary care trusts and individual schools. The Department recognises the unique contribution that school nurses make to SRE and encourages all those involved in classroom delivery to undertake the National PSHE: Continuing Professional Development Programme. This accredited programme supports standards in the delivery of PSHE teaching including sex and relationships education.</p>

	<p pid="c.236W.5/1">Local authorities and schools are funded to provide services for children with special educational needs (SEN). It is for local authorities and schools to determine how best to use resources to overcome barriers to achievement&mdash;including the provision of educational material in alternative formats where that is appropriate. The Education Act 1996 requires local authorities, schools and early years settings to have regard to the SEN Code of Practice which provides advice on carrying out statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.241W.5/2">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has a joint responsibility with the Department for Work and Pensions to maximise the employment and skills benefits for the UK arising from Games-related business. In the main, this will be achieved using existing initiatives such as Train to Gain, as we help employers in meeting their skill needs to design, build and deliver the Games, and encourage individuals to develop their skills so that they can compete for opportunities and progress within the labour market beyond 2012. To do this, we have initiated a programme of activities which are nation or UK-wide, rather than related to specific cities or regions. On the employer side, two cluster groups of sector skills councils are leading two areas: one to look specifically at the issues relating to the built environment and environmental improvements for the Games; and the other is looking at the staging and legacy aspects of the Games. Other specific employer-led initiatives include a programme of media training placements being developed by Skillset; the national skills strategy for hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism in England developed by People 1st; and the National Skills Academy for Construction centre on the Olympic site which the Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase>. For individuals, initiatives include new advanced apprenticeships in sporting excellence; customer service and hospitality apprenticeships; and the LDA-led Personal Best Programme which is currently being piloted in London but will be offered nationally and is targeted at individuals furthest away from the labour market to improve skills and promote employability.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.5/3">Within the Sunderland area itself initiatives include promoting business opportunities to Sunderland companies; engaging in discussions regarding the Cultural Olympiad; Sunderland venues registering as possible venues for pre-Games training camps; and Sunderland university has been involved in discussions concerning the North-east's regional cultural volunteering programme. The north-east's plans for the Games also include the development of a sport-related work force and making the most of the opportunities available for the key nine sectors in the regional economic strategy.</p>

Local authorities may therefore choose to keep information about empty homes in their area in the form of a register if this helps to facilitate their strategic approach.</p>

	<p pid="c.251W.2/1">The Local Authority Business Growth Incentives Scheme was announced in the 2002 pre-Budget report and introduced in 2005-06, to reward local authorities for increasing their business rateable value base. The scheme was simplified in its second year by removing the ceiling on payments to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.251W.2/2">A further change was made during 2007, in response to a challenge to the scheme under Judicial Review. As a result, additional year 1 and 2 payments were made to eligible local authorities in September 2007. These payments reflected increases in rateable value attributable to business expansion.</p>
	<p pid="c.251W.2/3">Following further consideration of the new legal challenges that have been made against the current Local Authority Business Growth Incentives Scheme and the inherent uncertainty that this causes to the remaining LABGI pot, the Government are today drawing local authorities' attention to their intention to re-consider all aspects of the approach used to distribute the remaining resources available for year 3 of the LABGI Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.251W.2/4">It should also be noted that the sum total of remaining LABGI resources available for distribution will be dependent on the amounts that may be required to meet any potential consequences arising from the court's decisions on the legal challenges for years 1 and 2 of the LABGI Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.251W.2/5">A further announcement will be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.257W.0/1">Comprehensive statistics of scientific procedures on living animals in Great Britain carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 are published annually. Copies of the publication for 2006 (Cm 7153) can be found in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/2">The data are not collected, stored or presented in a way enabling them to be easily broken down between England, Wales and Scotland as the 1986 Act is administered by the Home Office for the whole of Great Britain (it is administered separately in Northern Ireland). However a special exercise has been undertaken to extract the information requested in relation to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/3">During 2006, in Scotland, universities and medical schools carried out 74 per cent. of the regulated procedures under the 1986 Act, Government Departments 1 per cent., other public bodies 16 per cent. and commercial organisations 9 per cent. Public health laboratories, NHS hospitals and non-profit making organisations did not carry out any regulated procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/4">During 2005, in Scotland, 83 per cent. of the regulated procedures under the 1986 Act were carried out for fundamental and applied studies other than toxicology and 17 per cent for toxicity tests or other safety efficacy evaluation. During 2006, in Scotland, 81 per cent. of the regulated procedures under the 1986 Act were carried out for fundamental and applied studies other than toxicology and 19 per cent. for toxicity tests or other safety efficacy evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/5">During 2006, in Scotland, there were 239,593 mice, 48,519 rats, 1,915 guinea pigs, 711 hamsters, 2,625 rabbits, 211 horses and other equids, 10,573 sheep, 1,012 pigs, 10,680 birds, 336 amphibians, 73,548 fish, 31 cats, 886 dogs, 134 new world primates and 725 old world primates used in regulated procedures under the 1986 Act. No reptiles were used.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/6">In Scotland, at the end of 2006, 37 per cent. of the project licences granted under the 1986 Act that were in force were in the mild severity banding, 59 per cent. in moderate, 2 per cent. in substantial banding and 2 per cent. were in the unclassified severity banding.</p>
	<p pid="c.257W.0/7">During 2006, in Scotland, there were 31 regulated procedures under the 1986 Act using cats, 1,252 using dogs, 6,151 using rabbits, 2,490 using horses and other equids, 163 using new world primates and 1,103 using old world primates.</p>

	<p pid="c.266W.3/1">The Home Office published a study in 2007 to determine the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on violent crime, disorder and criminal damage. The study (which will contribute to a larger Home Office evaluation to be published early 2008) analysed time stamped data and focused on the types of offences that can occur as a result of alcohol misuse and night-time disorder and to see whether the timing of offences had changed. A copy of the report can be found on the Home Office website:</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/rdsolr1607.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/rdsolr1607.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/3">In addition, the Home Office also collects data via the British Crime Survey (BCS) on violent incidents. Relevant statistical information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/4" class="indent">The 2005-06 BCS reported a reduction in the number of violent crimes committed in or around pubs and clubs in 2005-06 compared with 2004-05 at 17 per cent. from 22 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/5" class="indent">In 2006-07 victims believed the offender or offenders to be under the influence of alcohol in 46 per cent. of all violent incidents (at any time of day).</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.3/6">It is also worth noting that the feasibility of police forces flagging violent crime and disorder offences in the night-time economy is being examined as part of the regular annual data requirement review process by the Home Office and ACPO.</p>

	<p pid="c.267W.2/1">According to the British Crime Survey, the most reliable indicator of long-term trends in violent crime, violence nationally fell by 35 per cent. between 1997 and 2006-07.

It is a Metropolitan Police Service team dedicated to tackling gun crime within the black community. Community involvement has been seen as key to Trident's success from the outset, with the Trident Independent Advisory Group set up to harness public support and keep officers informed of community views. Trident is widely seen as a successful model and has been emulated in other cities. Adult Trident offences are falling.</p>

The Board is exploring what more local authorities, schools and the criminal justice system might do to improve youth crime prevention across London. It will seek to instigate a number of changes before completing its work at the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.272W.11/2">Since December 2005, the Forensic Science Service (FSS) has been established as a Government-owned company. It is no longer an Executive agency of the Home Office and thus no longer subject to the agency target setting regime. Its establishment as a Government-owned company was designed to provide the FSS with the freedom, flexibility, structures and resources to better respond to customer needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.272W.11/3">Therefore, the Home Office as its shareholder does not set the FSS detailed performance targets as such. Instead it agrees an overall strategic business plan with the FSS. The business plan covers such matters as trading and operational performance, but as the FSS now operates in a competitive market, the details are commercially confidential. The FSS published a report and accounts covering its financial performance for the period since changing status, in August 2007. This was filed at Companies House, and copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.273W.2/4">The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amended PACE to allow samples to be taken if the person was charged with, or reported for summons, or convicted for a recordable offence, and allowed the samples and DNA profiles derived from these to be retained and speculatively searched against other samples and profiles held by or on behalf of the police, thus allowing the creation of the DNA database for use in criminal investigations. However, if the person was not prosecuted or was acquitted the samples and profiles had to be destroyed. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 amended PACE to remove the requirement for destruction of samples following a discontinuance or acquittal, but specified that any samples and profiles that were retained could be used only for the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 amended PACE to allow the police to take DNA and fingerprints without consent from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and detained in a police station.</p>
	<p pid="c.273W.2/5">People who volunteer to give a DNA sample include victims, witnesses, people with legitimate access to crime scenes, family members, and those responding to DNA intelligence-led screens. There are two options: consent to giving a sample of DNA to be used in a single investigation only which is then destroyed; and consent to giving a sample of DNA which will be added to the database and kept permanently.</p>

	<p pid="c.281W.5/14">During November 2007 Humberside police completed their part of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Enhanced Disclosure process in an average of 29.1 days.</p>
	<p pid="c.281W.5/15">However average figures do not give an accurate indication of performance, since any force's performance can be affected by a number of factors; the volume of cases sent to a force to process in any given month, the number of staff available to process the checks and the IT resources on hand to forces. With these variables, performance can fluctuate within individual forces from one month to the next.</p>
	<p pid="c.281W.5/16">The CRB has been supporting those forces that have encountered problems in meeting their targets by a range of measures including the provision of additional resources, monitoring performance, providing demand forecasting data and assistance in introducing new IT initiatives. Within Humberside police the following steps have been taken in conjunction with the CRB to improve performance:</p>
	<p pid="c.281W.5/17" class="indent">Increased resources have been made available to the force to support them in recruiting extra staff and obtaining new accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="c.281W.5/19" class="indent">An improvement plan has been implemented which shows a reduction in the workload between January and March 2007 to improve turnaround times following the escalation of cases within the force to the assistant chief constable.</p>

	<p pid="c.283W.9/2">The new identity cards for foreign nationals will make it easier for public service providers to confirm a person's eligibility to entitlements and for foreign nationals to access those services. This is because the new identity cards will replace the existing residence permits and other UK immigration status documents which can be subject to fraud. The new cards will be presented as a highly secure polycarbonate standalone card which will contain a tamperproof embedded chip. The face of the card will contain important biometric and biographical information&mdash;including the person's immigration status and entitlement to public funds in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.288W.5/2"><i> </i>We have taken a range of legislative and preventative action to reduce the availability of guns, knives and other dangerous weapons since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/3">In 1997, following the Dunblane tragedy, we introduced a ban on handguns.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/4">In 2003, a national firearms amnesty resulted in nearly 45,000 firearms and over 1 million rounds of ammunition being handed in. In 2006, a national knives amnesty resulted in nearly 90,000 knives being handed in. Although we have never claimed that amnesties alone will solve the problem, they are one facet in a range of tactics which include tough enforcement, prevention and education work. We are currently exploring the possibility of a hand-in system for weapons which would fall short of an amnesty but still provide a conduit for people to remove weapons from circulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/5">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a mandatory minimum sentence for possession of a prohibited firearm of three years' detention for 16 to 17-year-olds and five years' imprisonment for people aged 18 and over.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/6">The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003:</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/7" class="indent">introduced a ban on self-contained gas cartridge guns;</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/8" class="indent">raised the age limit for having an air weapon; and</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/9" class="indent">made it an offence to have an air weapon or an imitation firearm in a public place without a reasonable excuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/10">Subsequently, the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006:</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/11" class="indent">raised the minimum age at which a person can buy a knife from 16 to 18;</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/12" class="indent">doubled the maximum sentence for possession of a knife in a public place without good reason from two to four years;</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/13" class="indent">introduced a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon&mdash;where someone hands their weapon to another person to look after, they will no longer be able to escape prosecution for possession (and where a child is used, this will constitute an aggravating factor in determining sentencing);</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/14" class="indent">banned the sale, manufacture and importation of realistic imitation firearms;</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/15" class="indent">introduced tougher sentences for carrying imitation firearms (increased from a maximum of six months' imprisonment to 12 months);</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/16" class="indent">further raised the age limit for having an air weapon (to 18);</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/17" class="indent">required that air weapons only be sold by registered firearms dealers; and</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/18" class="indent">introduced powers for school staff to search pupils for weapons (although schools can still call the police if preferred).</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/19">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December 2007</phrase>, we announced that, following a public consultation, we intend to ban the sale, import and hire of samurai swords.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/20">In September 2007, the Tackling Gangs Action Programme (TGAP) was established, to focus targeted action in neighbourhoods of London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool where gun crime and gangs are a particular problem. The Association of Chief Police Officers, Serious Organised Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs are fully engaged in this work. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-28">28 November</phrase>, an action day focusing on firearms was held in the four TGAP cities, which resulted in 124 arrests.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/21">Ongoing work also includes support for prevention and education work through a variety of educational packages and other projects such as the Urban Concepts 'Don't Trigger' anti-gun crime campaign.</p>

	<p pid="c.290W.2/1">There are a small number of states still issuing passports that are not machine readable. The e-Borders programme has ensured that its solution is capable of processing such documents at both check-in and the immigration control.</p>
	<p pid="c.290W.2/2">In addition, from 2008, all visa applicants will be required to provide a 10-finger fingerprint scan and a digital photograph, as part of the application process when applying for a UK visa. Fingerprints and facial images are now in use in 125 countries and the global roll-out will be completed by, or before, March 2008. Nationals from approximately three-quarters of the countries identified as listed require a visa to travel to the UK. We are currently applying a Visa Waiver Test to all non-EEA countries by the end of 2007, with changes to the UK's visa regimes taking place over 2008-09. The Visa Waiver Test uses a range of criteria including the assessment of the level of security and integrity of each individual countries passport.</p>
	<p pid="c.290W.2/3">Furthermore, from 2008 onwards the UK will also start to introduce immigration documents for foreign nationals resident in the UK which will include fingerprints. Together, these measures will ensure that we can fix the identity of foreign nationals thus check their entitlement to be in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.292W.2/1">The future prediction of passport demand is updated periodically by the Identity and Passport Service to reflect actual numbers of applicants. The November 2007 Cost Report included the most recent prediction of future passport volumes. This prediction had recently been updated to reflect lower than anticipated passport renewals. There could be a number of reasons for passport renewals being increasingly delayed by customers:</p>
	<p pid="c.292W.2/2" class="indent">Other identity documents have been improved. In particular the introduction of the photo driving licence has been introduced in the last 10 years. This would be an alternative option for those who hold a passport for proof of identity reasons;</p>
	<p pid="c.292W.2/3" class="indent">Last minute behaviour. To a certain extent, the travel industry encourages 'last minute' behaviour and it is reasonable to believe that customers also apply this behaviour to how they apply for passports. This behaviour has also been enabled by IPS Fast Track services which have improved to meet this demand since these were first introduced in 1996;</p>
	<p pid="c.292W.2/4" class="indent">Changes in travel trends. Official statistics confirm that passenger journeys continue to increase, but whether this is the same number of people travelling more frequently is unclear. Hence the overall total demand for passports is difficult to predict with accuracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.292W.2/5">The latest Cost Report may be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.298W.2/1">An average retirement age cannot be separately identified from the available data. The available data are the age on leaving the service within the following time bands only: 25 and under, 26 to 40, 41 to 55 and over 55. Information about the average pension being paid to officers retiring in a particular year is not held centrally. The size of an officer's annual pension depends largely on his or her pensionable pay, and length of pensionable service. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987, a lump sum is not paid out automatically but only where the officer chooses to convert (commute) part of his or her pension into a lump sum. The size of a lump sum therefore depends on the officer's annual pension, the proportion of pension that the officer chooses to commute, and the commutation factor to be applied to the surrendered portion of pension in order to convert it into a lump sum. A typical officer, retiring after 30 years' service on a final pensionable pay of &pound;34,080 (the 2006-07 pensionable maximum for an officer of constable rank outside London), would be entitled to a pension of &pound;17,040 per annum and a lump sum of &pound;85,200, based on the officer commuting the maximum possible proportion of his or her pension, and using the most substantial factor. Based on the available data, the indications are that the average pre-commutation pension would be in the region of &pound;21,500.</p>

	<p pid="c.298W.5/1">A police officer who is a member of the Police Pension Scheme 1987 is entitled to retire with an ordinary pension after 25 years' service, payable from the age of 50. An officer who is a member of the 1987 scheme can also retire with a full and immediate pension at any age once he or she has accrued 30 years' service. The earliest age from which this would normally be possible is 48&amp;frac12;, given the minimum entry age of 18&amp;frac12; for the police service. Unless an officer becomes permanently disabled for police duty, and is required to retire on ill health grounds, there is no specific early retirement scheme. In order to qualify for an ordinary pension, officers must in all cases, however, provide the police authority with one month's notice of their intention to retire, or three months in the case of chief officer ranks, although it is at the discretion of the police authority to accept a shorter notice period. As it is a matter for local discretion, there are no centrally held data on its frequency of use.</p>

Instead, the law sets out various requirements, including registration, for those who are convicted or cautioned for a wide range of sexual offences. Some offences are defined by the age of the victim but for other offences the age of the victim is immaterial. The data in the annual reports includes all registered sexual offenders.</p>

Type approval is granted only to devices that comply with the specification laid down by the HO Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) and successfully complete both field and scientific testing. The type approval process provides a public reassurance that a device is accurate, consistent and reliable. Three variants of the LTI 20.20 system were type approved in the 1990s. We are satisfied that the device merits its type approval and have seen no reason to conduct further assessments.</p>

	<p pid="c.302W.2/2">The grounds for proscription as a terrorist organisation are set out in section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000. They are that the Secretary of State believes the organisation to be concerned in terrorism. An organisation is considered to be concerned in terrorism if it:</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/3" class="indent">(a) commits or participates in acts of terrorism,</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/4" class="indent">(b) prepares for terrorism,</p>

	<p pid="c.302W.2/6" class="indent">(d) is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/7">If an organisation meets the criteria for proscription, the Secretary of State then has a discretion as to whether or not to proscribe. In exercising that discretion successive Secretaries of State have had regard to five factors in particular. They are:</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/8" class="indent">1. The nature and scale of an organisation's activities</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/9" class="indent">2. The specific threat that it poses to the United Kingdom</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/10" class="indent">3. The specific threat that it poses to British nationals overseas</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/11" class="indent">4. The extent of the organisation's presence in the United Kingdom</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/12" class="indent">5. The need to support other members of the international community in the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="c.302W.2/13">The Baluchistan Liberation Army was proscribed in 2006 because it met the criteria for proscription. In this regard I would refer the hon. Member to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Terrorism Act 2000 (Proscribed Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.0/4" class="indent">As in previous censuses, statistics from the 2011 round of European censuses, including the UK Census, will be provided to Eurostat as part of a Programme to be agreed by the EU Statistics Programme Committee, on which, as National Statistician, I am represented. The statistics to be provided by each member state will be subject to appropriate National Statistics disclosure control measures that will protect the data from disclosure of any information that would identify an individual person or household.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/5" class="indent">A full Evaluation of the Census Test, which was carried out in May, will be published in spring 2008. An initial report on the results of an address checking exercise carried out as part of the Test&mdash;'The Coverage of address Registers for 2007 Census Test&mdash;Phase 1' is available on the National Statistics website at</p>

	<p pid="c.308W.0/7" class="indent">ONS is carrying out further research in order to determine the best approach for ensuring that the 2011 Census is supported by the most complete and up-to-date address information. There is currently no single definitive national address register for England and Wales that fulfils Census requirements. For the 2011 Census there is a need to assess the two competing address products, Ordnance Survey's MasterMap Address Layer 2 (AL2) and the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG). A final decision on the 2011 approach to create the initial address list will be made in 2009, on the basis of research of the address products, and ongoing discussions with suppliers about licensing costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/8" class="indent">A number of questions are being developed for the 2011 Census in England and Wales that will seek to collect information on multi-occupancy. These cover the type of accommodation and the extent of self-containment. ONS is developing a household frame for the 2011 Census, and will conduct a pre-Census address check, that will identify such addresses; so that the appropriate number of household forms are delivered to each address. Information from local authorities about areas with high levels of multiple occupancy will also be used to inform the enumeration methodology.</p>

	<p pid="c.310W.2/2">The draft Climate Change Bill, which has just been introduced into Parliament, proposes to set out a requirement for the Government to produce the first UK risk assessment on climate change within three years. Following this, it is proposed that the Government will update the risk report and programme on a five-yearly basis, with one informing the other.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/3">In addition, the cross-Government Adaptation Policy Framework will set out the Government's overall intentions in relation to adapting to the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.2/4">As a result of the impacts of climate change, the annual costs of flooding to homes, businesses and infrastructure could increase. The Government announced in the 2007 comprehensive spending review that funding for flood and coastal erosion risk management across Government will increase to &pound;800 million in 2010-11. The Government will also introduce an adaptation toolkit of &pound;10 million per year to assist communities in adapting to change where constructing defences is not the most appropriate means of managing flood and coastal erosion risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.317W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the average UK household disposable income was in each of the last five years, broken down by region; and what proportion of disposable income on average was spent on energy bills in each year (175533).</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of average weekly household disposable income as well as expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels appear in the ONS report &quot;Family Spending&quot;. The latest report for 2005/06 was published on the National Statistics website on 18th January 2007 at http://www:statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361. Family Spending is the annual report on the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), an annual survey of approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/5" class="indent">Table 1 shows average weekly household disposable income for each region of the United Kingdom, while table 2 shows expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels as a percentage of household disposable income for each of these regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/6" class="indent">Both tables show data which has been averaged over three years, which is consistent with the presentation of regional data in Family Spending. Estimates which are based on smaller regional sub-samples are subject to larger sampling error, and so an average over three years provides more reliable estimates of regional income and expenditure. Three year averages covering three different time periods have been provided. Data is not available for earlier periods on a consistent basis due to changes in survey methodology which coincided with the introduction of the Expenditure and Food Survey which replaced the old Family Expenditure Survey in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="c.317W.2/7" class="indent">Household disposable income includes all income from wages and salaries, income from self-employment, income from investment, occupational pensions and social security benefits. All these incomes are recorded after the deduction of any income tax or national insurance contributions.</p>

At a national level, the Government now spend &pound;5 billion a year less on unemployment benefits than in 1996-97.

The data to support this response was provided in PQ478 (Hansard ref 464 Column 1535) sent to Mr David Laws on 17th October 2007.

	<p pid="c.330W.14/6" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the Labour Force Survey. The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.14/7" class="indent">It is important to bear in mind that the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas.</p>

	<p pid="c.331W.2/1">The price of heating oil, petrol and diesel are influenced by a range of factors, including international crude oil prices, exchange rates, seasonal factors, level of stocks, refinery capacity, distribution costs and the degree of retail competition.</p>
	<p pid="c.331W.2/2">International oil prices have been high and volatile in recent years, more than doubling between 2004 and 2007, and this has been reflected in the retail prices of all fuels. The rise in prices has been due to a range of factors, notably strong and resilient global oil demand growth, tight refining and production capacity and geopolitical uncertainty in several key oil-producing countries. In 2007 Q4, additional factors including oil supply shortages have also contributed to increased crude oil prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.331W.2/3">Oil price is only one of these factors and there is typically a lag to changes in retail pump prices as retailers absorb temporary changes in oil prices in their profit margins.</p>

The data in the table below are consistent with the dataset for the &quot;Public Sector Finances&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.344W.11/6" class="indent">In answering this question total tax revenue has been defined consistently with the Total taxes and social contributions series in table 11.1. Similarly, Indirect taxes have been defined as Taxes on products and imports, and business taxes as Production taxes other than on products plus non-household Taxes on Income. The financial year has been used because the UK adopts this as its fiscal base.</p>
