These discussions have included the situation in Afghanistan. As a NATO-led operation, it is for the Alliance to find collectively the forces the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) needs. As the NATO Secretary-General has said, nations should deliver what they have all agreed ISAF ought to have. Work is of course ongoing to ensure that the necessary capabilities are in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.2525W.6/2">No. The UK's priority for the 3<sup>(rd)</sup> Review Conference to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in November is to finalise a Protocol on Mines Other Than Anti-Personnel Mines (Anti-vehicle mines). We believe that the work on Explosive Remnants of War should continue on the basis of the current mandate. If achieved, progress on these two areas should ensure the continued success of the CCW. On cluster munitions, a recent study commissioned by CCW member states concluded that International Humanitarian Law is adequate.</p>

	<p pid="b.2526W.0/2">The UK is committed to its obligations under the Ottawa convention (Mine Ban treaty). In 1999 the United Kingdom and Argentine Governments agreed as a confidence-building measure to</p>
	<p pid="b.2526W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;work together to evaluate the feasibility and cost of clearing the land mines still present in the Falkland Islands&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.2526W.0/4">This co-operation has been welcomed by other states parties to the treaty. The feasibility study is largely to be funded by Argentina, on the principle that almost all the mines are theirs. Against the background of the sovereignty dispute and the Argentine financial crisis in 2001, the negotiations have been long and complex. After much hard work they resulted in July 2006 in agreement on the modalities for completing a survey of the Falkland Islands and the final report of the feasibility study during the next austral summer. Only when the feasibility study has been completed will we be in a position to decide on the best option available to enable us to meet our Ottawa obligations.</p>

	<p pid="b.2526W.6/2">Progress is being made on the political, economic and social fronts in the four southern provinces but is inevitably linked to and dependent on progress in security.</p>
	<p pid="b.2526W.6/3">The handover of security responsibility to Iraqi security forces has started in the South, demonstrating Iraq's progress in building up its political institutions, its security capacity and its commitment to economic development and delivery of basic services. Transition to Provincial Iraqi control took place in Al Muthanna on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July 2006</phrase>, and the Governor and elected local authorities in Dhi Qar will take over responsibility for security before the end of this month. The political situation in Maysan has improved, with the Governor and Provincial Council working with the multi-national force to ensure the province is ready to transition as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.2526W.6/4">In Basra, despite some difficulties in relations with the Governor, co-operation with the Provincial Council and the Governor himself has continued, particularly in building the capacity of the security forces and the civil authorities. We are working with the Iraqi security forces to implement Prime Minister Maliki's Basra Security Plan, led by General Ali Hammadi. The training and mentoring of the Iraqi Police Service remains a priority in Basra with a focus on developing better leadership capacity, Command and Control structures, and specialist skills. The Basra Provincial Reconstruction Team is working with the Basra authorities to develop and implement economic, governance and reconstruction projects. Improved security would help deliver a range of investment, employment and economic opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2526W.6/5">Data on social conditions in Iraq are patchy and often only available at a national level. Major surveys due shortly from the UN and from the World Bank will add to our understanding. However the UK is working closely with the Government of Iraq and international organisations to improve the infrastructure, including electricity and water supply.

	<p pid="b.2532W.0/1">Funding under the arm's length management organisation (ALMO) programme is allocated in the form of borrowing approvals to enable local authorities to bring their housing stock up to the decent homes standard. This funding is additional to the local authority's existing resources and is allocated in two year tranches. An ALMO must attain a 2* inspection rating from the Housing Inspectorate in order to qualify for funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.2532W.0/2">Since 2001 there have been five bidding rounds for ALMO funding. Funding is confirmed in two year tranches. Most ALMOs accepted onto the first bidding round have received and spent all their allocations. ALMOs on subsequent bidding rounds have yet to receive all their allocations. ALMOs on the most recent bidding round are not yet in receipt of funding as they have hitherto not been inspected by the Housing Inspectorate.</p>

The penalty charge is set at &pound;200 in the Home Information Pack Regulations 2006 and could be repeated for an on-going breach. Where the breach is committed by an estate agent, the case could be referred to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT may then consider using existing powers to issue a banning order requiring the agent to cease trading and we regard this as the main deterrent.</p>

The cost of the HCR will be determined by the market and this will depend, as now, on the size, condition and location of the property. However, we expect competition will push prices down.

	<p pid="b.2536W.0/1">The Government have taken a number of steps to raise design standards, including for new housing developments. Planning policy and guidance has been strengthened to require good design. This has been backed by additional work to encourage innovation, to provide capacity building and support and to promote the take-up of good practice. We are now looking to see better delivery at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/2">Our policy in &quot;Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development&quot; (PPS1) sets out general principles and policies for planning, and makes it clear that good design is indivisible from good planning. PPS1 needs to be taken into account by all planning authorities in the preparation of development plans and it may also be material to decisions on individual planning applications. The policy is supported by good practice guidance such as &quot;By Design&mdash;better places to live and Safer Places&mdash;the Planning System and Crime Prevention&quot;. We have also tested out new tools to help deliver quality developments, including piloting the use of Design Coding.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April 2006</phrase> I also announced additional measures to encourage good design. Most types of planning application will now have to be accompanied by a design and access statement. This will explain how high quality design and issues such as disabled access have been addressed in the proposal and more importantly help local planning authorities ensure new developments are of a high quality. This will give local communities a greater understanding of what is proposed, what might eventually be built and therefore a greater opportunity to contribute to the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/4">The Government are also promoting innovation through a series of schemes, such as the Millennium Communities programme and the Design for Manufacture competition which has resulted in practical lessons for the house-building industry, including how to reduce construction costs while retaining high standards of quality as well as how to build houses at a high density. The competition also suggests further opportunities to cut costs and improve design for social housing, making it possible to build more homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/5">Work continues to provide support and reward success, particularly through spreading of best practice and improving design skills. The Government support the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE). Their work to promote the adoption of design champions within local authorities and at a senior level within the mass house builders, the design training programmes which they deliver, and their advice on specific development proposals are all making an important contribution to raising standards. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) Housing Design Awards recognises those partnerships that have delivered exemplary housing developments, large and small.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/6">To overcome skills barriers, the Government have recently established a new Academy for Sustainable Communities. This is working with others to deliver the cutting edge skills and knowledge to make better places for people now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.2536W.0/7">CABE is the Government's advisor and champion for improving urban design, and therefore DCLG Ministers and officials meet with CABE for a variety of reasons. I hosted a seminar in February 2006 to discuss improving housing design quality, where CABE presented the findings of their recent Housing Audits. CABE are also closely involved in the development of the Thames Gateway Strategic Framework and presented progress on their work at a meeting I chaired on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.2537W.5/1">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly, at local authority level. The constituency of Lewisham, Deptford is wholly contained within the London borough of Lewisham.</p>
	<p pid="b.2537W.5/2">Only partial information was reported by Lewisham during 1997-98. The number of households reported as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need between 1998-99, and 2005-06, along with the reported number of households in temporary accommodation arranged by the council under homelessness legislation as the end of those years, is tabled as follows.</p>

	<p pid="b.2537W.5/4">The duty owed to a person accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. As an alternative to the provision of temporary accommodation some authorities arrange for households to remain in their current accommodation (homeless at home), until a settled solution becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="b.2546W.0/1">Most foodstuffs are VAT zero-rated, saving consumers approximately &pound;10.6 billion in the last financial year. This zero rate does not however extend to certain beverages, including fruit drinks, which have been subject to VAT since the decision to apply the standards of VAT in 1993. Under our agreements with our European partners, we are not able to extend existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. It is therefore not possible to remove VAT from fruit drinks and other beverages.</p>
	<p pid="b.2546W.0/2">These same agreements do allow the UK to introduce a reduced rate of VAT of not less than 5 per cent. for foodstuffs that are not already VAT zero-rated. While all taxes are kept under review, to date we have been sparing in our use of VAT reduced rates and have only applied them where the tax system offers the most effective and best-targeted support for our social objectives, when compared with other policy instruments. The 2004 Wanless report on public health highlighted difficulties in principle and practice in using the tax system to promote public health. To date, the Government have therefore focused resources to encourage healthy eating choices outside the tax system. This includes action and resources to provide classroom teaching of the benefits of good nutrition and a &pound;235 million package to transform the quality of school meals, reflecting new nutritional standards for primary and secondary schools. Under the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme all 4-6 year olds in LEA schools are entitled to a free piece of fruit or vegetable each school day. In 2007 a new telephone, online and digital television service is being introduced to support people of all ages in making healthier lifestyle choices.</p>

	<p pid="b.2546W.7/1">The World Trade Organisation (WTO) operates on a &quot;one member, one vote&quot; basis, and takes decisions by consensus. In effect, any country can veto any decision. Developing countries also make up the majority of the WTO membership. While this gives developing countries more influence over the WTO's decision making process, the negotiating process is more complex in an organisation of just under 150 members.</p>
	<p pid="b.2546W.7/2">We support the need to strengthen developing country voice and participation at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We welcome the current debate on the governance of the IMF in the context of the Managing Director's Report on the Fund's Medium Term Strategy. This recognises the importance of governance reform for the continued effectiveness and credibility of the IMF. We support the central objectives of this reform to adjust the shares of member countries to reflect global economic changes and to strengthen the participation and voice of low income countries. We believe the influence of developing countries within the IMF can be bolstered by measures including strengthening their voting rights, increasing support for their representatives at the IMF Executive Board and by increasing discussion and debate at the international and country level. We look forward to continuing discussion on these issues at the Annual Meetings in Singapore.</p>

	<p pid="b.2549W.5/2">No specific grants are provided by central Government to fund post 16 transport. Local authorities' responsibilities for transport provision and concessionary fares is funded through formula grant from central government (comprised in the main of Revenue Support Grant and National Non-Domestic Rates) and through income generated by councils, including council tax. Formula grant is not hypothecated to a particular service and councils are free to use the funding in line with the wishes of their electorate and taking into account their statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2549W.5/3">Amendments were made to the Education Act 2002 that placed a duty on local authorities to ensure that transport was not a barrier to students of sixth form age wanting to participate in FE. DfES does not provide direct funding for post 16 transport but has made available a small amount of funding to each local authority to enable them to meet their statutory duties by forming transport partnership groups and developing their local transport policies and transport arrangements. The overall DfES funding for each year is 2003/04 &pound;14 million, 2004/05 &pound;13 million, 2005/06 &pound;12 million, 2006/07 &pound;12 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2549W.5/4">Individual post-16 students are also able to access hardship funds from their school or college to help with costs of further education, including transport, and individual learners who receive education maintenance allowance may use an element of the allowance to contribute towards transport costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.2550W.6/2">In line with the 'Government strategic framework for the sustainable control of bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain', we have made a commitment, to work in partnership with dairy and beef farmers, and with others, to reduce the geographic spread of bovine TB and achieve a sustained reduction in decrease in high incidence areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.2550W.6/3">In March we introduced compulsory pre-movement testing of cattle in England to reduce the risk of spreading TB through cattle movements. The current legislation applies to cattle over 15 months of age moving from one and two year tested herds. Farmers are generally complying with the policy and TB reactors are being identified, so there is emerging evidence that the policy is helping to prevent disease spread. The policy is being kept under review to enable modifications, if necessary, prior to the planned implementation of phase 2 in March 2007 which will extend pre-movement testing to movements of cattle over 42 days old. DEFRA will continue to work closely with interested organisations during the introduction of phase 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.2550W.6/4">To enhance our existing, and comprehensive, cattle testing programme we recently announced that from October 2006 the gamma interferon test will be used more extensively in England and Wales, alongside the skin test, in certain prescribed circumstances. Using both tests in this way can help to speed up the resolution of confirmed TB breakdowns by identifying as many infected cattle as possible at the earliest opportunity. Compensation is payable for animals which are caused to be slaughtered under section 32 of the Animal Health Act 1981.</p>
	<p pid="b.2550W.6/5">We continue to make progress with our research on vaccine development. We have started testing candidate vaccines in naturally infected cattle and badgers, as well as work on developing novel vaccine delivery systems, and we have committed to future funding of approximately &pound;5.5 million per annum for this.</p>
	<p pid="b.2550W.6/6">No decisions have yet been made about badger culling to control bovine TB. Any decision needs to have a sound scientific and practical foundation and we do not yet have this. The evidence base is complex and a number of practical delivery issues need to be resolved. The strength of feeling on badger culling, as demonstrated by the 47,000 responses to the recent badger culling consultation, combined with the range of evidence, mean it is crucial that our decision is not rushed. My officials and I have been discussing the issue with interested groups to try to establish a shared understanding of the facts before we can make progress. We are not ruling anything in or out at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.2550W.6/7">Finally, farmers also have a crucial role to play in preventing bovine TB&mdash;not only by complying with statutory policies designed to limit the spread of the disease but by ensuring they apply good biosecurity measures and suitable husbandry practices on their holdings.</p>

	<p pid="b.2551W.2/2">Following a steady increase in the total number of new bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incidents over recent years, there has been a provisional 15 per cent. reduction in the number of new incidents in Great Britain from January to July 2006 compared with the same period in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.2551W.2/3">The chief veterinary officer (CVO) has undertaken a review of the apparent reduction, drawing on detailed analyses carried out by epidemiologists from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and DEFRA officials, comments from a group of independent experts convened by the chief scientific adviser, and views from farmers, practising vets and the state veterinary service. She concluded that whilst there has been a real reduction in the number of new TB incidents, it is too early to draw firm conclusions as to whether this is a temporary change or the start of a sustained trend. She also recognised that the reduction is likely to be caused by a complex combination of factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.2551W.2/4">A summary of the analysis is included in a recent report by the CVO, which is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

This is done primarily using table valuations based on average sales prices achieved for pre-determined cattle categories, drawn up in consultation with the industry. To support the system, sales data is continuously collected by an independent service provider from a large number and wide range of sources across Great Britain . These sources include 'regular' markets, dispersal sales, and breed sales.</p>
	<p pid="b.2552W.2/3">Table valuations are based on real sales prices achieved at market; the compensation payable in respect of an individual animal is the average market price for its category. There are 47 categories in total and these are split into non-pedigree and pedigree. At the end of each month, the average sales figure is determined. For non-pedigree categories the average is calculated from one month's data, and for pedigree categories six month's data are used.</p>

	<p pid="b.2553W.2/3">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) estimates that over 34 per cent. of households already participate in home composting schemes, with 23 percent of British households composting both kitchen and garden waste. WRAP is working with local authorities and other partners to increase this further through websites, a dedicated helpline and the distribution of one million home composting bins to households across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.2553W.2/4">Local authorities are strictly limited in the amount of biodegradable waste they can landfill by their allocations under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme. A further incentive is provided by the annually increasing landfill tax, which currently stands at &pound;21 per tonne.</p>

	<p pid="b.2556W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/2">The UK cannot intervene directly in sovereign matters of other countries, and bushmeat has been a legitimate and acceptable food source for domestic consumption in many countries for generations. While some bushmeat may be entering the UK, it is understood not to be in significant quantities. Moreover, of the limited amount which may be entering the country, we consider the endangered-species element, including that of non-human primates, is likely to be at a very low level.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/3">The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is strictly regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, for which the Home Office has the lead responsibility. Non-human primates are afforded special protection under the Act and there are stringent requirements regarding their use in scientific experiments. The use of wild-caught non-human primates is subject to supplementary additional considerations.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/4">The Home Office announced in 1997 that there are no foreseen circumstances under which licences under the 1986 Act for programmes of work involving the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) would be issued. In addition, exceptional justification would be required for the licensed use of other types of non-human primates taken from the wild.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/5">The 1986 Act provides that non-human primates, whether captive bred or wild-caught, can only be used when no other species are suitable for the purposes of the programme to be specified in the licence, or that it is not practicable to obtain animals of any other species that are suitable for those purposes. For the use of wild-caught primates to be exceptionally authorised, there must be no appropriate alternative, no suitable captive-bred animals available and the likely benefits of the programme of work would have to fully justify their use.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/6">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and the Animal Procedures Committee provide advice on a case-by-case basis on whether, and on what terms, such use should be licensed. Application of these stringent criteria has meant that first time use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific procedures has not been licensed in the UK for some years.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/7">The import, export and re-export of primates is strictly regulated under Council Regulation 338/97, which implements the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora within the EU. The Government's view is that primates are not suitable for the general pet trade. We currently limit imports of these species to specialist keepers who must be able to demonstrate that they are sufficiently well equipped and experienced to house and care for them. In July last year, Defra launched a public consultation regarding the use of powers under Article 8.2 of Council Regulation 338/97, which sought views on proposals designed to further restrict the keeping of certain CITES listed species, including primates.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/8">We propose to introduce a regulation under the Animal Welfare Bill to ban the use, in travelling circuses, of certain non-domesticated species whose welfare needs cannot be satisfactorily met in that environment. A Circus Working Group has been set up to advise on this proposal. We also intend to introduce Codes of Practice to cover all performing animals, not just those in circuses. This will address issues such as training activities, trainer competences and accommodation needs for animals when travelling.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/9">I would like to thank Animal Defenders International for their dossier &quot;Primate Nations.&quot; The use of animals, including non-human primates, in research and testing is an issue for which the Home Office has responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.2556W.2/10">A copy of the dossier will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.2564W.8/2">The responsibility for the medical care of ex-service personnel, whether regular or reserve, lies with the NHS. This has been the established practice since 1948 under successive Governments. Where an individual is also a war pensioner, he or she is entitled to priority treatment for his or her accepted condition within the NHS. Priority is decided by the clinician in charge and applies to physical and mental health problems. For conditions that are due to service where treatment is not available under the NHS, the Government also funds care at the specialist mental health charity Combat Stress facilities, which last year cost &pound;2.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2564W.8/3">The health needs of the majority of veterans will be met by current NHS provisions. However, MOD has work in hand to ensure that there is a coherent response to veterans' mental health issues, co-ordinating inputs from the NHS, Health Departments throughout the UK, the services and ex-service organisations, including Combat Stress. The MOD is also working on a number of further measures for the prevention and management of operational stress, and has work in hand to ensure that service leavers can recognise the signs of stress and know where to go for help, using suitable magazine-style material.</p>
	<p pid="b.2564W.8/4">The MOD is currently developing detailed arrangements for the enhanced post-operational mental healthcare programme for recently demobilised reservists. The programme will offer a mental health assessment, conducted by appropriately qualified members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). This will be available to any member of the reserve forces who has been demobilised since January 2003 following deployment on any operation overseas and who has a concern about their mental health as a result. If individuals are then assessed as having a mental health problem that is categorised primarily as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or a related traumatic adjustment disorder, and that is directly related to their operational deployment and of a nature that can be treated within the resources of the DMS, then they will be offered out-patient treatment by the DMS.</p>
	<p pid="b.2564W.8/5">If the assessment identifies cases that fall outside the parameters set out above, such as complex multi-disorder diagnoses or acute cases requiring in-patient care, the DMS will refer them&mdash;with our assessment results&mdash;back to their civilian GP in order to assist their access to NHS treatment, as well as encouraging contact with the relevant welfare organisations to ensure follow-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.2564W.8/6">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" name="Tom Watson">my predecessor, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson)</phrase> said in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>, a further announcement will be made later this year to confirm the details of the programme, including the location(s) at which the assessments will be provided, and the date on which the service will commence.</p>

	<p pid="b.2576W.5/1">The study was split into three consecutive phases, each one dependent on the successful completion of the preceding phase. Phase One, to identify precipitating factors for deliberate self-harm among soldiers, with an overall objective to provide a structured interview protocol to investigate self-harm in the military community. Phase Two, to retrospectively match each identified case with an appropriately matched control group, and Phase Three, to evaluate the extent to which risk factors and risk profiles identified in Phases One and Two could be used as a marker for deliberate self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.5/2">All three phases were to include military community psychiatric workers, under the direction of the Army Suicide Prevention Working Group (ASPWG), supported by suitable external subject matter expertise. The Directorate of Army Personnel Strategy commissioned the provision of external experts from research funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.5/3">The statement of requirement for Phase One of the Study and an invitation to tender for the work was sent to three independent academic experts. Only two bids were received, one from Imperial College and the other from King's College. The bids were assessed in accordance with current MOD competitive tendering guidelines, and the contract was awarded to Imperial College.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.5/4">Phase One of the study began in April 2004, with an expected completion date of June 2005. However, as there were far fewer cases of deliberate self harm over the period than statistically predicted, this resulted in insufficient numbers of volunteers coming forward to be interviewed, the completion date of Phase One was extended until December 2005. Despite this extension, the numbers of those interviewed was considered to be insufficient for the purpose of the study.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.5/5">The results were presented to the ASPWG in December 2005 where it was decided that the study could not progress on the basis that there were too few cases of self-harm over the period to provide a credible result for Phase One. Therefore there was insufficient data to inform the subsequent Phases.</p>
	<p pid="b.2576W.5/6">A summary of the findings of Phase One was submitted to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and presented to the Royal Society of Medicine Symposium in January. The BMJ have since declined to publish these findings, due to the size of the sample used.</p>

	<p pid="b.2584W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) overall aim is to always establish the correct identity of a person prior to providing a benefit or service.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.2/2">Before entitlement to benefit can be considered, an individual and their partner need to satisfy Section 1(1b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. This requires the customer to provide enough information and evidence to confirm that a national insurance number (NINO) quoted on the claim is their own. Where a customer does not know their NINO, they are required to provide enough information and evidence in order that the correct NINO can be traced. If the customer does not have a NINO, they are required to verify their identity and provide enough information in order that a NINO can be issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.2/3">We have established secure procedures for the allocation of national insurance numbers to adults, conducting rigorous checks to ensure that adult national insurance numbers are only issued to those who have undergone an evidence of identity interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.2/4">DWP staff are trained in preventing identity fraud and refer any suspected cases for investigation. DWP prosecutes for identity fraud offences, including attempts to obtain national insurance numbers using false documentation. This forms a useful deterrence against those fraudsters who attempt to infiltrate DWP systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.2/5">DWP expects to maximise the use of the proposed Identity Card across its businesses when ascertaining an individual's right to benefit and we are working with the Home Office to develop such future applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.2584W.2/6">DWP is represented on the Home Office Identity Fraud Steering Committee which has a remit to implement measures to counter identity fraud. Other representatives of this group include the private sector and other Government Departments such as HMRC with whom we work closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.2585W.2/1">The Department follows a robust process to verify the individual's identity prior to the allocation of a national insurance number (NINO). This process includes a check to ensure that the applicant does not already hold a NINO, and if appropriate will be followed by a face-to-face interview designed to build up a picture of the individual's circumstances. This will involve document examination checks to ensure the authenticity of any documentary evidence provided in support of the application; and corroborative checks with third parties (including other Government Departments) to verify information supplied during the interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.2585W.2/2">Only when Jobcentre Plus is satisfied as to the individual's identity will a NINO be allocated.</p>
	<p pid="b.2585W.2/3">Before entitlement to benefit can be considered an individual and their partner need to satisfy section 1(1B) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 regarding NINO provision. This requires the customer to provide enough information and evidence to confirm that the NINO quoted on the claim is their own. Rigorous checking procedures are built into benefit processes to ensure that the gateway to the benefits system is secure. Anyone who has acquired a NINO does not have automatic access to the benefits system and the use of a NINO in isolation is not sufficient to obtain benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.2585W.2/4">Where a customer does not know their NINO, they are required to provide enough information and evidence in order that the correct NINO can be traced. If the customer does not have a NINO, they are required to verify their identity and provide enough information in order that a NINO can be issued.</p>

	<p pid="b.2590W.2/15" class="indent">The total staff costs include the salaries of permanent and casual staff, temporary duties allowance, overtime, superannuation costs and payment for early release schemes. There was an increase in staff costs from 2004-05 to 2005-06 of &pound;120 million despite a headcount reduction of over 3,500 whole time equivalents. The main reasons for this were the increase in employer's pension contributions of &pound;65 million and &pound;60 million to fund early retirements to reduce headcount.</p>

	<p pid="b.2598W.8/1">The most commonly used definition of people who are not in work who are willing and able to work is the International Labour Office (ILO) definition of unemployment. The ILO unemployed are people who are without a job; want a job; have actively sought work in the last four weeks; and are available to start work in the next two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.2598W.8/2">The latest figures for ILO unemployment (seasonally adjusted) are from the Labour Force Survey and cover the period March to May 2006. This shows that there were 1,623,000 people below state pension age who are not in work who are willing and able to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.2598W.8/3">The Government's ambition is to provide employment opportunities for all not only by helping the ILO unemployed get a job but also by helping the economically inactive&mdash;generally those who are not looking for work&mdash;to consider work and help them into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.2598W.8/4">The combination of macroeconomic stability and welfare to work policies has been successful in achieving high employment rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in their re-assessment of their Jobs Strategy, identified the UK as a successful performer. Their latest (2006) Employment Outlook also shows that the UK has the best combination of low ILO unemployment and inactivity rates of all the major G8 countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.2602W.2/1">We are aware of allegations such as those raised by the BBC in late 2005 that failed asylum seekers are subject to mistreatment on return. However, we have found that there is no objective evidence to support allegations outside of sources known to be sympathetic to the plight of asylum seekers or who specifically provide assistance to individual Congolese claimants. While it is impossible to rule out the potential for individual officials to act on their own account, we have seen no corroborated evidence that they do so, nor that the Democratic Republic of Congo authorities have a policy of deliberately targeting failed asylum seekers for special attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.2602W.2/2">In early 2006, the UNHCR's Kinshasa Office consulted a number of domestic and international human rights organisations and other relevant NGOs based in the capital about the authorities' treatment of returning failed asylum seekers. The UNHCR inquiries found that apart from encountering questioning and possibly temporary detention, there is no evidence to suggest that returning Congolese nationals face systematic mistreatment or that returning failed asylum seekers are at greater risk of scrutiny by the authorities than any other profile of Congolese national returning home.</p>

	<p pid="b.2605W.9/1">The Home Office and DWP jointly undertook to pilot a scheme to apply a benefits sanction to offenders found to be in breach of their community sentence. The scheme was piloted in four probation areas&mdash;Derbyshire, Hertfordshire, West Midlands, and Teesside from October 2001. An evaluation report published in February 2004 concluded the policy had a small impact on compliance (1.8 per cent.) suggesting that for every 50 community sentences given, one less resulted in breach initiation as a result of the policy. The results of a further monitoring period proved inconclusive with regards to improvement of offender compliance. This is because the period coincided with other initiatives to improve compliance some of which gave significantly higher improvement than the benefits sanctions pilot.</p>

The final figure for the average response time to letters received in 2005 will not be available until all those letters have been answered.</p>
	<p pid="b.2606W.8/2">Volumes of Members' letters on IND matters have grown considerably in recent years. In 2003 there were 24,700 letters and in 2004 35,800. The figure for 2005 will be reported shortly by the Cabinet Office in its annual report on performance on correspondence handling by all Government Departments. This will show a further substantial increase in letters for the IND.</p>
	<p pid="b.2606W.8/3">The enforcement and removals directorate (ERD) is the business area within the IND which receives the most letters. In early December the ERD introduced new ways of working which should result in significant improvements in its performance on handling Members' correspondence. This approach, which was already in place across the rest of the IND, draws a distinction between Members' letters which engage substantively with a case and those which are simply inquiring about case progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.2607W.5/1">The target for responding to hon. Members' letters is to send a reply within 20 working days. I responded to my hon. Friend's letters concerning Ruth Kelly of <i> (a)</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-12">12 September 2005</phrase> and <i> (b)</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2607W.5/2">Volumes of Members' letters on Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) matters have grown considerably in recent years. In 2003 there were 24,700 letters and in 2004 there were 35,800&mdash;a year on year increase of 45 per cent. In 2005 IND received 41,200 letters, an increase of a further 15 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.2607W.5/3">The Enforcement and Removals Directorate (ERD) is the business area within the IND which receives the most letters. In December 2005 the ERD introduced new ways of working which should result in significant improvements in its performance on handling Members' correspondence. This approach, which was already in place across the rest of the IND, draws a distinction between Members' letters which engage substantively with a case and those which are simply inquiring about progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.2608W.0/1">It is an operational matter for the police to decide in each case whether to apply to a court for a production order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 or earlier legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2608W.0/2">The Home Office published a code of practice in 2003 which includes guidance to the police and other agencies on obtaining production orders. Under the legislation and the code, the police need to ensure that an application for an order is fully and clearly justified. There also must be reasonable grounds for believing that the material or information requested is likely to be of substantial value to a confiscation investigation or money laundering investigation. The level of financial loss to a victim is likely to be one of a number of factors that the police take into account when considering whether to apply for an order.</p>
	<p pid="b.2608W.0/3">The courts have powers to make compensation orders against convicted persons in respect of financial loss to victims.</p>

There are presently no plans to extend the availability of ear acupuncture in prisons.</p>

	<p pid="b.2624W.6/1">The Government have introduced credible, intensive community sentences, which courts can tailor to individual offenders who might have otherwise receive ineffective short prison sentences. We have also alerted courts to the availability of electronic monitoring to support a curfew imposed as a condition of bail. Courts are being encouraged to use this option instead of a remand in custody in appropriate cases. We are increasing useable operational capacity in prisons by building additional places as part of an ongoing funded building programme, as well as carefully managing accommodation at existing prisons.</p>

(Please note that these figures do not include those in the 'Day 1' chart.) The number of apparent self-inflicted deaths that occurred during a prisoner's first week in prison (Days 1-7), and where the deaths occurred, is shown in the table E.</p>

Prisoners in early custody are therefore subject to a number of policies and practices designed to enhance their safety. These include health screening upon arrival, the use of peer supporters ('Insiders') to offer information and support to new prisoners, and First Night and Induction procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.2658W.5/1">The Government looked closely at the merits of introducing a transitional period for those affected by the increase in the minimum qualifying period for settlement. In deciding not to introduce a transitional period, consideration was given to the following factors: this change does not prevent anyone from doing anything that they are currently doing; it does not limit anyone's time with any employer or reduce their stay in the United Kingdom&mdash;if they meet the conditions necessary to be in the UK under the Work Permit or Highly Skilled Migrants Programmes they will be granted an extra year's leave before settlement. If they do not meet these conditions they would in any case not have qualified for settlement at four years. To introduce a transitional period for those who arrived when the qualifying period was four years would mean that a desirable policy would not take effect until 2011.</p>
