	<p pid="d.650W.6/1">Fish stocks in EU waters are assessed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Scientists from the UK's fisheries laboratories contribute to the undertaking of these assessments. The ability to perform scientific assessments is directly linked to the quality of fisheries data. In some fisheries, for example, the quality of catch and effort data are deemed to be insufficient or the available catch data appear to conflict with data from research surveys. In such cases, as a consequence, quantitative scientific assessments are not available.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.6/2">In the absence of a quantitative scientific assessment, it is not possible to define a stock's status with respect to safe biological limits.</p>

	<p pid="d.650W.12/1">The Federation of Environmental Trade Associations (FETA) has confirmed that 200,000 heat pumps were sold in the commercial sector in 2006, of which around 90 per cent. were air source.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.12/2">Estimates for the costs and savings in the housing market have been made for the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT). Ground source heat pumps are not currently a cost-effective substitute for gas condensing boilers. In a typical three bed-roomed semi-detached house, carbon dioxide (CO2) savings are around 0.46 tonnes CO2 each year.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.12/3">However, if they replace conventional electric heating, they are cost-effective, with annual CO2 savings of around 4.3 tonnes CO2 each year. If they replace solid fuel stoves, they are not cost effective but save around 5.7 tonnes CO2 each year. By comparison, cavity wall insulation would save 0.575 tonnes CO2 each year in a gas condensing boiler-heated house.</p>
	<p pid="d.650W.12/4">If 10 million homes with gas condensing boilers had them replaced with ground source heat pumps, national savings would be around 4.6 MtCO2 (million tonnes of CO2) each year. This compares with the impact of all the policies in the Climate Change Programme by 2010, of 17.6 MtCO2 each year.</p>

	<p pid="d.651W.8/1">Decisions on the best way to collect waste and recyclables are rightly a matter for local authorities, not central government. Decisions to collect recyclables for sorting at kerbside or in a single-stream (co-mingled) for sorting at a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) will depend on a range of factors, including the local housing stock, the range of materials being collected and the sorting and re-processing facilities available.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/2">No research has been commissioned by my Department on the take-up of recycling facilities where co-mingled recyclable collection is employed. Assessments on the uptake of local recycling facilities would normally be undertaken by individual local councils.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/3">WRAP will be undertaking a study into the cost and performance of different kerbside collection schemes later in the year and they are planning for that study to investigate several of these issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/4">Household waste recycling/composting has doubled in the last four years to reach 27 per cent. in 2005-06, which exceeds the Waste Strategy 2000 target of 25 per cent. This excellent progress is thanks to the commitment and hard work of the vast majority of local authorities, ever more enthusiastic householders and carefully targeted Government support.</p>

	<p pid="d.668W.5/1">Total UK biofuel sales for the financial year 2005-06 amounted to some 139 million litres, and provisional figures suggest that total UK biofuel sales for the financial year 2006-07 amounted to some 327 million litres. Further details are available via:</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.uktradeinfo.com">http://www.uktradeinfo.com</a></p>
	<p pid="d.668W.5/3">Some of these biofuels were produced in the UK from a variety of feedstocks, and some were imported. The Department does not hold precise information on the breakdown between domestically produced and imported biofuels, nor does the Department have a precise forecast for UK biofuel production in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.5/4">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, due to be introduced in April 2008, will significantly increase the demand for biofuels in the UK. A number of major new UK biofuel production facilities are due to come on stream over the next few years to help meet this additional demand. UK biofuel producers will, however, continue to need to compete with overseas producers to supply the UK market.</p>

The media open day was organised to coincide with an on-site exhibition for employees, contractors and their families. This was in response to the House of Commons Defence Committee's (HCDC) view that there was a case for greater openness regarding the work undertaken at AWE.

	<p pid="d.685W.2/1">The armed forces employ a wide range of measures to ascertain the effectiveness of their recruitment advertising campaigns. They are then set against advertising expenditure to assess the cost effectiveness of the various media channels and tools used and compared with each other, across-government and with industry averages.</p>
	<p pid="d.685W.2/2">For civilian advertising, delegation of responsibility across the Department has resulted in a variable level of effectiveness and identified that improvements could be made. As part of the Civil Service's People Programme we are moving towards a centralised recruitment service. In addition, an advertising contract via the Central Office of Information has been negotiated which enables a continued presence in the national and diversity media and recruitment and diversity websites but also has the flexibility to allow managers to target post specific advertising more effectively. New adverts began in February 2007 to support a pilot of MOD's new external recruitment process. 'TMP Worldwide' has provided generic adverts that appear in monthly selected publications such as diversity press and national newspapers and three large recruitment and diversity websites. In June, Phase 1 of the recruitment service for Broader Banded grades launched and has been supported by the new adverts and any post specific adverts; the service is planned to be fully delivered by June 2008. It is too early to give results but we anticipate a cost saving plus an increase in effectiveness.</p>

It is a sophisticated system which will provide training for aircrew and groundcrew operating one of the most complex weapon systems in the RAF. The recent, extensive, post-commissioning testing has, as intended, identified anomalies in the software which integrates the numerous and complex systems that make up the simulators. These have been addressed and the corrective actions will be consolidated during the planned upgrade of the simulators to the production delivery standard.</p>

Accordingly, the Home Office contributed &pound;35,000, &pound;125,000 and &pound;250,000 to the funding of the centre in financial years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, respectively.</p>

	<p pid="d.692W.8/3">We have given the police new powers to carry out evidential roadside breath testing, subject to type approval of appropriate equipment. We have also included in the Road Safety Act 2006 a number of further measures designed to deter drink driving and reduce reoffending. These include enabling powers to require serious, including repeat, offenders to retake the driving test at the end of their driving disqualification, improvements to the operation of the drink drive rehabilitation scheme and provision for a statutory alcohol ignition interlock programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.692W.8/4">We have just launched a new &pound;3 million multi-media publicity campaign aimed primarily, though not exclusively, at young, male drivers who are more likely to be involved in drink-related crashes than other driver categories. This is designed to emphasise the very serious consequences of being convicted for drink driving and provides a powerful deterrent message for potential drink drivers.</p>
	<p pid="d.692W.8/5">We have also announced, in the second three-year review of the Road Safety Strategy published in February 2007, that we intend to carry out a consultation on other ways of tackling drink driving, including ways of making police enforcement against drink driving easier. A consultation paper will be published by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.696W.8/1">Taser has been available to all Authorised Firearms Officers in England and Wales since September 2004 as a less lethal alternative for use in situations where a firearms authority has been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the Association of Chief Police Officers Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms.</p>
	<p pid="d.696W.8/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July 2007</phrase> Chief Officers throughout England and Wales have been able to deploy Taser for use by Authorised Firearms Officers in operations or incidents where the criteria for the authorisation to issue firearms does not apply, but where officers are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject(s) of their action.</p>
	<p pid="d.696W.8/3">In addition, a 12 month trial of the deployment of Taser by specially trained units who are not firearms officers in similarly violent circumstances requiring conflict management will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase> in the following 10 forces in England and Wales: Avon and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, Gwent, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Metropolitan Police Service, Northamptonshire, Northumbria, North Wales and West Yorkshire.</p>

	<p pid="d.710W.5/1">There has been significant progress towards the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has successfully helped to bring peace and stability to south Lebanon. Their efforts, in conjunction with the Lebanese army, have ensured that the cessation of hostilities has been maintained with few significant breaches. There has also been steady progress on the clearance of unexploded munitions from the conflict last year. With significant UK support, UN and Lebanese teams have cleared approximately 17.5 square kilometres of contaminated land. This amounts to half of the total contaminated land.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.5/2">However, the ongoing political crisis in Lebanon is hindering progress towards full implementation of UNSCR 1701. In particular, we continue to be concerned by reports of arms smuggling across the Syria/Lebanon border. We are working with international partners and the Government of Lebanon to address this issue. As part of this we are supporting a German-led project aimed at strengthening the border.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.5/3">We are also deeply concerned by the firing of three rockets from south Lebanon into Israel on <phrase class="date" code="">17 June</phrase> and an attack on a UNIFIL vehicle on <phrase class="date" code="">24 June</phrase> that killed six soldiers. Such attacks are unacceptable and serve only to destabilise Lebanon. The UK will continue to work for the full implementation of UNSCR 1701.</p>
	<p pid="d.710W.5/4">The UN Secretary-General's most recent report on the implementation of UNSCR 1701 was published on <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase>. I will arrange for copies of this report to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.723W.5/1">In the case of curfews, it is intended that this form of enforcement is used where other lesser and direct attempts to recover the unpaid maintenance have been tried but some or all of the amount remains outstanding.</p>
	<p pid="d.723W.5/2">While research indicates that curfews do not tend to feature internationally, all major comparator countries that have a similar child maintenance system to the UK operate a range of enforcement options. Curfews will serve as an effective alternative to committal as such orders will create a strong incentive for the non-resident parent to pay, while not impeding his or her ability to do so by causing him or her to lose his job.</p>
	<p pid="d.723W.5/3">In the case of 'naming and shaming' (the publication of the names of non-resident parents who have been successfully prosecuted for information offences on the CSA website) the Department is aware that a similar approach is used in some other child maintenance systems internationally.</p>
	<p pid="d.723W.5/4">Both these policies need to be seen as part of the broader programme to build a stronger culture of compliance amongst non-resident parents. The intention is to promote the message that not paying for your children is unacceptable and brings consequences with it.</p>

	<p pid="d.724W.5/1">The chapter on child poverty in last year's Opportunity for All strategy report outlined the breadth of work underway across Government to ensure that our targets to halve and ultimately eradicate child poverty are met. These commitments reflect our wider ambition to ensure that every child has the best start in life and has an equal opportunity to fulfil their potential. We are making good progress; there were 600,000 fewer children in poverty in the UK (as measured by relative low income) in 2005-06 than there were in 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="d.724W.5/2">The Government's long-term measure for child poverty already includes three indicators developed following extensive consultation initiated by the DWP: absolute low income, relative low income, and material deprivation combined with relative low income. This long-term measure is also underpinned by the poverty and social exclusion indicators within Opportunity for All.</p>
	<p pid="d.724W.5/3">There are a number of ways that depth of poverty can be measured. Our Opportunity for All indicators includes a range of income thresholds. In addition, we have a lower income threshold implied by the absolute low income tier within our long-term measure. These indicators enable us to analyse different depths of poverty and respond accordingly.</p>

Due to the scale of our operations we do not collect information on the commuting choices of our staff, and have no plans to do so. It is not possible to estimate the number of staff using public transport to commute, as this would be different in every building. But a variety of information is provided to staff to help them make personal choices about their commuting journeys, via our intranet site and Sustainable Development staff magazine&mdash;such as links to 'Transport Direct' and suggestions on car-sharing schemes. Businesses are encouraged to operate a green travel plan at those sites where one would be beneficial.</p>

Article 10 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure Order) 1995 requires a local planning authority to consult the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency before determining planning applications for new major accident hazard sites, or for modifications to existing sites.

Community and large scale combined heat and power could play an important role in meeting this objective and we are looking to each project to act as an exemplar for particular aspects of low and zero carbon technology. Alongside this and other sustainability objectives, we intend that eco-towns should play a key role in easing the affordability crisis by ensuring that between 30 and 50 per cent. of their new housing is affordable as well as meeting our other essential criteria on high quality design, good provision for jobs, sustainable travel, services and community development. The launch of the prospectus today will be accompanied by an invitation for local authorities and other stakeholders to respond with their views on potential sites.</p>

	<p pid="d.745W.8/2">The Secretary of State monitors housing projects where registered social landlords are or will be involved, through local housing authorities returns. This will include most projects which include affordable housing, but not necessarily all, because private sector developers may also plan to build units of affordable housing. She does not monitor planning decisions for affordable housing as such. Local authorities monitor the actual delivery of affordable housing in their annual monitoring reports which are published and submitted to the Secretary of State. In Penwith district 31 affordable houses were built in 2005-06, 10 per cent. of the total new houses built. In Kerrier district, 22 affordable houses were built in 2005-06, 9 per cent. of the new houses built.</p>

	<p pid="d.750W.2/1">The Government published a draft planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change for consultation at the end of 2006. This makes clear that planning should be a positive force for change and help secure progress against the UK's emissions targets, both by direct influence on energy use and emissions, and in bringing together and encouraging action by others. The PPS will apply to all development; it expects all planning authorities, in enabling the provision of new homes, jobs, services and infrastructure and shaping the places where people live and work, to secure the highest viable standards of resource and energy efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions. The final PPS will be published later this year.</p>

These cases are not included in the totals above.

	<p pid="d.770W.3/11">The Government are committed to improving the rates of successful prosecution in rape cases. PSNI's CARE units deal with the investigation of serious adult sexual offences and sexual and physical abuse of children and are staffed by highly skilled and trained personnel. The PSNI CARE teams are dedicated to enhancing the service to victims of rape and sexual assault and are seeking to enhance the investigative process so that more offenders are brought before the courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.770W.3/12">We have made significant progress towards establishing a sexual assault referral centre in Northern Ireland and are working in partnership with colleagues in DHSSPS, PSNI, the medical profession and the voluntary sector to develop an appropriate range of services. In addition, PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service have recently begun to analyse a number of rape investigations, in order that they continue to develop models of best investigative practice. In particular, attention will focus upon case building and the significant number of cases that currently do not make the threshold for prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="d.772W.3/2">Much of the content within the national standards leaflet will now be reflected in the underpinning regulations arising from provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill, which finished its parliamentary passage on <phrase class="date" code="">17 July</phrase>. This will include training requirements for bailiffs for an enhanced and extended certification regime. Agents will be required to have a working knowledge of all the relevant areas of enforcement law and of the national standards in particular how to deal with vulnerable and potentially vulnerable debtors and others present at the premises. This will provide considerable protection for genuinely impoverished and vulnerable debtors.</p>
	<p pid="d.772W.3/3">As part of the development of the underpinning rules and regulations and implementation of the provisions in the Bill HMCS will now be re-engaging with all interested parties. We will use this opportunity to remind the industry including local authorities, magistrates courts and bailiffs themselves of the contents and purpose of the national standards. The outcome of this consultation process will inform the implementation timetable.</p>

	<p pid="d.780W.5/1">The electronic monitoring contractors are only required to report to the police breaches of curfew for those subject to court bail conditions under the Bail Act 1976. According to data provided by the contactors the number of breaches reported to the police in such cases, in the previous two financial years, is as follows:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="d.782W.2/2">There are no specific contract sanctions available at present. The discussions that the solicitor has with the client on the potential use of mediation are evidenced by the completion of a 'Suitability of Mediation' form. If this form is not completed and submitted when the solicitor applies for funding to issue proceedings, the application will be rejected and not processed until the solicitor has completed the form and resubmitted the application for funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/3">The LSC will be monitoring the number of referrals made by individual firms to mediation. An improved monitoring system, to be implemented in October 2007, will extract information from LSC databases on the reasons used by individual firms for exemption from mediation. Where it is shown that solicitors' firms do not make appropriate and timely referrals, the LSC Relationship Manager will have discussions with the firm about this. Funding to continue with proceedings will be refused until the solicitor has demonstrated that mediation has been assessed as not appropriate, or has been attempted and broken down.</p>

	<p pid="d.783W.0/1">The contracts with the operating companies specify minimum staffing levels. These assume that the centre is operating at full capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.783W.0/2">Hassockfield, Medway and Rainsbrook met minimum staffing levels throughout the period <phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase>. During this period, there were three days on which staffing levels at Oakhill fell below the minimum staffing level. However, on each of these days there was a sufficient number of staff to care for and work with the number of young people who were placed at the centre at that time.</p>
	<p pid="d.783W.0/3">The issue of staffing shortfalls is being addressed by the Oakhill contractor, Group 4 Securicor. The contractor has drawn up a recovery plan which the Youth Justice Board is monitoring. The Board is working with the contractor on the implementation of the action plan.</p>

We recognise that there are small pockets of corruption in Her Majesty's Prison Service.

	<p pid="d.805W.3/1">In 1997, the Department together with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) commissioned a joint research programme on the effects on health of exposure to air pollutants and damp in the home. This programme focused on indoor air pollution and its effects on health. In particular, the health effects on sensitive individuals within the population and the interactions between indoor air pollutants and health effects of damp in the domestic environment. There were 13 projects in total, seven of which were funded directly by the Department. Further details of these projects can be found at table three of &quot;Air Pollution Research Funded&quot; which is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.809W.11/1">The Department and the national health service promote the benefits of physical activity in many ways to professionals, the public and other stakeholders. This complements investment across government to encourage and enable healthy active lifestyles, for example through the physical educations, schools sport and club links programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/2">In particular, primary care trusts are required to have systematic and managed health promotion programmes, including action on exercise, that are responsive to local needs. Spending on the promotion of sport and physical recreation by the NHS is not recorded centrally.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/3">Alongside spending by the NHS to support local delivery of physical activity programmes for adults and children, the Department has funded pilot work to inform interventions. This has included:</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/4" class="indent">the local exercise action pilot scheme (LEAP), which has been jointly funded by the Department, Sport England and the Countryside Agency with an overall cost of &pound;2.5 million between 2003 and 2006. The LEAP pilots included interventions targeted towards children, adults and older people.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/5" class="indent">a joint Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills, and Youth Sport Trust pilot programme Schools on the Move, which includes resource materials for schools, teachers and young people to help integrate pedometers into the life of the school. The Department has invested &pound;100,000 in the pilot during 2005 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/6">National programmes to promote physical activity arising out of this pilot work include a &pound;494,000 school pedometer programme, distributing 40,000 pedometers to 250 schools in deprived areas to encourage children to become more active, and enabling all schools to access resources to support increased physical activity.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/7">The Public Health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot; included a commitment to develop continuing professional programmes for schools to support physical activity and we have invested &pound;160,000 in a schools physical activity guide as part of the healthy schools toolkit.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/8">The Secretary of State for Health, through the Section 64 General Scheme of Grants (S64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968), has power to make grants to voluntary organisations in England whose activities support the Department of Health's policy priorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/9">The Department has provided funding to physical activity based programmes under the Section 64 Scheme to the following organisations:</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/10" class="indent">Sustrans;</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/11" class="indent">Amateur Swimming Association;</p>

	<p pid="d.809W.11/14" class="indent">British Trust for Conservation Volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/15">Delivery of programmes to encourage children and young people to lead healthy active lifestyles extends beyond the remit of any single government department.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/16">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport share a public service agreement (PSA) target to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds spending at least two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/17">The Government are investing &pound;1.5 billion, including lottery funding, in the five years to 2008 in support of this target and on <phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase> the Prime Minister announced a &pound;100 million campaign to give every child the chance of five hours of sport every week in the run up to 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.809W.11/18">The Government are also investing in walking and cycling to school. DCSF and the Department for Transport are providing &pound;7.5 million to fund a network of school travel advisers to develop and implement school travel plans. By March 2005 more than 10,000 schools had developed approved travel plans, and &pound;55 million in capital grants has been given to schools to spend on items such as secure bike shelters and new entrances.</p>

	<p pid="d.816W.5/1">Prior to the introduction of the new home oxygen service on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, there were no explicit requirements on those providing an oxygen cylinder service or an oxygen concentrator service to deliver a service urgently or within another specified period. Therefore, no data are available to assess average delivery time prior to that date.</p>
	<p pid="d.816W.5/2">The new service contract requires the service provider to meet specific response times for each oxygen service provided under the contract. These are:</p>
	<p pid="d.816W.5/3" class="indent">emergency or urgent supply of oxygen to be delivered within four hours of receipt of an order from a healthcare professional;</p>
	<p pid="d.816W.5/4" class="indent">an order supporting the discharge of a patient from hospital to be delivered on the day following receipt of the order or on a date specified by the healthcare professional in the order; and</p>
	<p pid="d.816W.5/5" class="indent">an order for short burst oxygen therapy, long-term oxygen therapy, or an ambulatory oxygen service to be provided within three working days of receipt of an order either from a health care professional or from the patient directly (for re-supply).</p>
	<p pid="d.816W.5/6">Each supplier must meet these service requirements under the terms of the contract and delivery times are a key indicator used in monitoring supplier performance. There is no average delivery time. A supplier will either pass or fail in meeting these requirements. Current data show that suppliers are achieving around 99 per cent. compliance with this service requirement.</p>

Finished Consultant Episode (FCE):<br/> An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 2. Ungrossed Data:<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> 3. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):<br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 4. Assessing growth through time:<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 5. PCT and SHA data quality:<br/> PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioners practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.820W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/4" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your questions asking why MRSA is not a recognised cause of death and whether it will be policy to adopt the recommendations of the (a) World Health Organisation and (b) Office of National Statistics and allow MRSA to be cited on a death certificate as a contributory factor. I am replying in her absence. (150539, 150538)</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/5" class="indent">Diseases caused by infection with Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria (eg MRSA septicaemia, MRSA pneumonia, MRSA wound infection etc) are recognised as causes of death and can be cited on death certificates. The Office for National Statistics publishes annual statistics on deaths certified as due to or contributed to by MRSA.</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/6" class="indent">The World Health Organisation (WHO) makes recommendations, in the International Classification of Diseases, currently in its tenth revision (ICD-10), on certification of cause of death by doctors, coding and classification of diseases, and selection of a single cause for each death for statistical purposes. The General Register Office and ONS follow ICD-10 recommendations and go further, as explained below.</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/7" class="indent">Doctors have a statutory duty, under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, to certify the cause of death to the best of their knowledge and belief. GRO produces books of Medical Certificates of Cause of Death (MCCDs), in the format recommended by WHO, and supplies these to doctors through local registrars of births and deaths. The books include notes to doctors, based on ICD-10, on how to complete the MCCD. These ask the doctor to describe the sequence of illnesses or events that led directly to death in part I of the MCCD, ending on the last used line with the underlying cause of death. The underlying cause is defined by WHO as the disease or (external cause of) injury that initiated the morbid train of events leading directly to death. Certifiers are also asked to write in part II of the certificate any other conditions which contributed to the death but were not part of the direct sequence. WHO makes clear that the certifying doctor must use his/her clinical judgement to decide which of the conditions present at or before death contributed to the death and so should be included on the certificate.</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/8" class="indent">In addition to the notes in the front of every book of MCCDs, the ONS Death Certification Advisory Group (DCAG) published updated guidance to certifiers in ACP News and on the GRO website (<a href="http://www.gro.gov.uk/medcert/">www.gro.gov.uk/medcert/</a>) in June 2005. This guidance, which is also supplied to doctors with every new book of MCCDs, includes specific advice about certifying deaths involving health care associated infections (HCAI). The Department of health's Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, in his 'CMO Update' no 42 of July 2005, which is sent to all registered doctors, drew attention to the DCAG guidance in a short article entitled 'Certifying deaths involving MRSA' <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/PublicationsAndStatistics/LettersAndCirculars/CMOUpdate/DH__4115663">http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/PublicationsAndStatistics/LettersAndCirculars/CMOUpdate/DH__4115663</a>). These publications, from ONS/GRO and the Department of Health, make absolutely clear that doctors should include MRSA and other HCAI on the death certificate in the appropriate place if they believe that the infection was part of the direct causal sequence or contributed to the death.</p>
	<p pid="d.820W.2/9" class="indent">WHO recommends that the underlying cause of death is tabulated for routine mortality statistics because preventing it would prevent not just the death, but the whole period of illness leading up to death and so result in the greatest health gain. MRSA infection is often associated with health care, and so it will not usually be the underlying cause of death, which may be the disease or injury necessitating the care during which the MRSA infection was acquired. Because of the public, policy, professional and media interest in the subject of MRSA infection, ONS provides more than just routine underlying cause statistics. Using ICD-10 codes and the full text from MCCDs, ONS publishes annual figures on the number of deaths in which MRSA was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, in addition to those where it was selected as the underlying cause of death. Figures for 2001 to 2005 were published in Health Statistics Quarterly no 33, which is available in the House of Commons library, in February 2007. Statistics based on death certificates which cited MRSA have also been quoted in answer to a number of previous Parliamentary questions and published in Hansard. In 2005 there were 1,629 death certificates that cited MRSA in England and Wales and in 29% of these (467 deaths) MRSA was the underlying cause of death.</p>

	<p pid="d.822W.8/1">NHSmail first went live October 2004. There are over 260,000 NHSmail users registered for the national health service e-mail and directory service which is increasing every week with an average of one million messages sent or received across the NHSmail platform daily.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.8/2">Since 2004 the technological and market environment has changed significantly. A number of opportunities for technology refresh were built into the original NHSmail contract. The move to Microsoft Exchange is the first of those. The cost of the transition will not exceed the existing programme budget. Costs have been controlled partly by the licences gained through the renewal of the enterprise agreement with Microsoft and partly through the reuse of existing infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.8/3">The move to Exchange will deliver new functionality and improved usability to NHSmail users. These include full mobile access via an extensive range of wireless devices, facilitating access to the many peripatetic workers in the NHS, full support for shared calendar use between doctors and managers, easier navigation between screens and functions, and the ability to share contacts between users. Exchange will also enable much faster recovery should any event impact one of the two data centres.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.8/4">NHSmail carries out annual user surveys, and the Exchange-based service meets all of the most common requests for change reflected in survey results.</p>
	<p pid="d.822W.8/5">Other additional features are currently under consideration, such as instant messaging, which we believe will further increase the service appeal to NHS staff. As a result of this and the features described above, early contact with NHS trusts and NHS staff indicates that the transition to Exchange is likely to increase NHSmail user take-up above the current rate of 5,000 new users per month.</p>

	<p pid="d.823W.2/1">Revenue allocations to primary care trusts are informed by a fair funding formula. The formula is overseen by an independent body, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA). ACRA's role is to ensure equity in resource allocation. In order to achieve this objective, ACRA ensures that the most up-to-date, accurate and robust data available at the time of making allocations are used in the formula.</p>

	<p pid="d.823W.5/15">To date, 1.4 million patient records have been entered in the systems in use in the South.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.5/16">Five further systems are planned to go live in the South during 2007, 24 in 2008, and 19 in 2009. In London, three Millennium deployments are planned in 2007, the first, at Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals Trust, due to go live before the end of July, and a further four in 2008. Go live dates in each strategic health authority (SHA) area are determined by agreement with the NHS bodies concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.5/17">The Millennium system is a robust product built on modern architecture, with greater patient data security and stability than older systems. It is used in many other countries and currently has a worldwide patient base of some 100 million patients. The version of Millennium being deployed through the national programme is based on that purchased in 2005 by two London NHS hospital trusts, the Homerton, and Newham University Hospitals Trusts. This version, release 0, contains the patient administration service functionality, is compliant with Choose and Book, and has the ability to order pathology tests and radiological diagnoses, and receive the reports. Subsequent releases will include ever greater functionality, particularly clinical functionality, bringing increasing benefits to patients and those who treat them.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.5/18">Current users of the Homerton and Newham systems, who have had two years to become familiar with the system and to make local improvements, have expressed their satisfaction with the system. Further positive feedback has been received from a number of users, especially nurses.</p>
	<p pid="d.823W.5/19">Though the current Millennium release version has less functionality than that of certain advanced alternative systems in some trusts, this limitation is a necessary step in building up a fully integrated secondary care system through subsequent releases. Meanwhile, NHS Connecting for Health and SHAs are working closely with the LSPs and Cerner to further develop and improve the product, its functionality, and its ease of use.</p>

	<p pid="d.832W.14/1">An initial evaluation of the school fruit and vegetable scheme was carried out in November 2004. At that stage the children who participated in the evaluation had only been receiving free fruit and vegetables since June 2004. The results provided a useful insight into the initial impact of the scheme but it was recognised that further work would need to be undertaken to measure the impact of the scheme over a longer period. In 2006 we commissioned a further evaluation of the school fruit and vegetable scheme. The report of the further evaluation will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.843W.2/1">The CAMHS Standard of the Children's National Service Framework for England (published September 2004) set out a 10 year programme of improvements for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). The aim is that all children and young people, from birth to their eighteenth birthday, who have mental health problems and disorders, will have access to timely, integrated, high quality multidisciplinary mental health services to ensure effective assessment, treatment and support, for them, their parents or carers, and other family members.</p>
	<p pid="d.843W.2/2">This commitment to improve CAMHS has been backed by significant additional funding, over &pound;400 million in the last four years, to local authorities and the NHS. We will continue to build on these improvements and ensure that the promotion of children's mental health and emotional well being remains a priority for schools and children's services.</p>

	<p pid="d.845W.2/1">In January 2007, there were approximately 162,900 (full-time equivalent) teaching assistants in schools in England. This is an increase of 102,300 since 1997, more than doubling the number of teaching assistants.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/2">The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in conjunction with the Welsh Assembly Government, have commissioned a five-year research study (2004-09) to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of support staff on teaching and learning, in addition to comprehensive and reliable information on the types, characteristics and deployment of support staff (including teaching assistants) in schools in England and Wales. Early findings published in 2006 (Blatchford et al, DfES Research Report 776) suggested that many teachers felt support staff were having a positive effect on pupil learning and behaviour. Teachers also felt that support staff benefited their teaching in a number of ways, for example, by allowing them to differentiate the work for more pupils. Subsequent publications will report in more detail on the role of support staff in teaching and learning and provide a systematic analysis of the effect of support staff on pupil outcomes, including attainment.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/3">In 2002, Ofsted reported that</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;In virtually every year group and at every level of free school meal eligibility, the quality of teaching in lessons with teaching assistants is better than in those without&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/5">(Applies to primary only. Source: Teaching Assistants in Primary Schools: An Evaluation of the Quality and Impact of their Work April 2002).</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/6">In 2006, the National Foundation for Educational Research concluded that</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/7" class="indent">&quot;In departments that had dedicated support staff, both teachers and departmental heads were significantly more satisfied with the amount and quality of in-class support and administrative support they received. There was evidence that being based in one department was also of benefit to the support staff themselves, both in terms of their overall satisfaction and access to professional development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/8">(Source: The deployment of teachers and support staff to deliver the maths and science curriculum in secondary schools&mdash;NFER 2006).</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.2/9">In January 2003, the National Agreement, &quot;Raising Standards, Tackling Workload&quot; was signed by the Government, employers, and the majority of the school work force unions. The agreement set out the shared vision for the school work force of the future and featured a series of phased reforms to help schools raise standards of achievement of all their pupils and tackle work load issues. It is vital that schools make the most effective use of teachers' time, ensuring that they spend their time only on activities that really need the professional skills and judgment of a teacher. The increased use of teaching assistants (and other support staff) in schools, providing high quality support in the classroom and by taking on a number of administrative tasks previously carried out by teachers, has therefore been integral to the Government's drive to raise standards for pupils and tackle teacher work load.</p>

	<p pid="d.858W.2/1">Under both the current national curriculum in England for science and the new science curriculum to be taught in schools from September 2008, pupils aged 11-14 are taught about renewable energy and the possible impact of human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels, on the environment. The current geography curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds requires pupils to be taught about resource planning and management issues, for example developing alternative energy sources. From September 2008, 'environmental interaction and sustainable development' will be one of the key concepts in the new geography curriculum for 11 to 14-year-olds with a requirement to study climate change.</p>
	<p pid="d.858W.2/2">In May 2007, DCSF and DEFRA sent a climate change pack to every secondary school in England. The online teacher guidance accompanying the pack provides material to support the teaching of climate change in geography, science and citizenship. The pack is part of the wider DCSF Sustainable Schools programme which aims to embed sustainability in the curriculum, how schools operate (eg reducing energy usage) and in their work with the local community <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/sustainableschools">www.teachernet. gov.uk/sustainableschools</a>. In addition to work being supported by DCSF, DEFRA have sponsored a number of projects aimed at raising awareness of climate change through the Climate Challenge Fund. Seventeen out of the 83 projects have schools as their main audience or have specifically targeted aspects of their project, <a href="http://www.climatechallenge.gov.uk">www.climatechallenge.gov.uk</a>. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has developed programmes for renewable energy education for primary and secondary schools <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/sources/renewables/renewables-schools">www.berr.gov.uk/energy/sources/renewables/renewables-schools</a>. BERR has provided grant funds to hundreds of schools for installations of microgeneration on their properties, and currently provides these through phase 2 of the Low Carbon Buildings Programme <a href="http://www.lowcarbonbuildingsphase2.org.uk">www.lowcarbonbuildingsphase2.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="d.861W.2/1">It is for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) as the independent regulator to ensure that exams are fit for purpose and to make judgments on how to govern the use of multiple choice questions.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.2/2">While elements of multiple choice testing may be included, this would be within the context of an exam that maintains the high standards of GCSE and requires a suitably challenging breadth and depth of knowledge.

	<p pid="d.861W.5/1">The Department is responsible for the following PSA targets, each of which were agreed between the former Department for Education and Skills and HM Treasury as part of the 2004 Spending Review:</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/2" class="indent">1. Improve children's communication and social and emotional development so that by 2008 53 per cent. of children reach a good level of development at the end of the Foundation Stage; and reduce inequalities between the level of development achieved by children in the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged Super Output Areas and the rest of England by four percentage points from 16 per cent. to 12 per cent. (Joint with the Department for Work and Pensions)</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/3" class="indent">2. As a contribution to reducing the proportion of children living in households where no-one is working, by 2008: increase the stock of Ofsted-registered childcare by 10 per cent.; increase the number of children in lower-income working families using formal childcare by 120,000; and introduce by April 2005 a successful light-touch child care approval scheme. (Joint with the Department for Work and Pensions)</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/4" class="indent">3. Reduce the under-18 conception rate by 50 per cent. by 2010 as part of a broader strategy to improve sexual health. (Joint with the Department of Health)</p>

	<p pid="d.861W.5/6" class="indent">5. Narrow the gap in educational achievement between looked after children and that of their peers; and improve their educational support and the stability of their lives so that by 2008 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 or more years will have been living in the same placement for at least two years, or are placed for adoption.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/7" class="indent">6. Raise standards in English and mathematics so that: by 2006, 85 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieve level 4 or above, with this level of performance sustained to 2008; and by 2008 the proportion of schools in which fewer than 65 per cent. of pupils achieve level 4 or above is reduced by 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/8" class="indent">7. Raise standards in English, mathematics, ICT and science in secondary education so that: by 2007 85 per cent. of 14-year-olds achieve level 5 or above in English, mathematics and ICT (80 per cent. in science) nationally, with this level of performance sustained to 2008; and by 2008 in all schools at least 50 per cent. of pupils achieve level 5 or above in English, mathematics and science.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/9" class="indent">8. Improve levels of school attendance so that by 2008, school absence is reduced by 8 per cent. compared to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/10" class="indent">9. Enhance the take-up of sporting opportunities by 5 to 16-year-olds so that the percentage of school children in England who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and sport within and beyond the curriculum increases from 25 per cent. in 2002 to 75 per cent. by 2006 and to 85 per cent. by 2008, and to at least 75 per cent. in each School Sport Partnership by 2008. (Joint with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport)</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/11" class="indent">10. By 2008, 60 per cent. of those aged 16 to achieve the equivalent of 5 GCSEs at grades A*-C; and in all schools at least 20 per cent. of pupils to achieve this standard by 2004, rising to 25 per cent. by 2006 and 30 per cent. by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.861W.5/12" class="indent">11. Increase the proportion of 19-year-olds who achieve at least level 2 by three percentage points between 2004 and 2006; and a further two percentage points between 2006 and 2008, and increase the proportion of young people who achieve level 3.</p>

	<p pid="d.868W.0/1">The Department has not undertaken or commissioned any recent assessment of sex and relationship education (SRE) in schools. Ofsted is responsible for assessing the quality of schools' provision in the area of personal, social and health education (PSHE), including SRE, through its inspection framework and subject reports, and last reported on SRE in &quot;Sex and Relationships Education in Schools&quot; in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/2">The Department's &quot;Sex and Relationship Education Guidance&quot; for schools outlines their responsibilities in this area and provides information on the issues to be covered at each of the four key stages, taking account of the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the young people. The guidance is clear that schools need to make sure that SRE meets, and is sensitive to, the needs of all pupils whatever their developing sexuality. Pupils should be helped to understand difference and respect themselves and others in order to prevent and remove prejudice.</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/3">Certain aspects of SRE must be delivered as part of the statutory curriculum for science, and legislation requires that head teachers and school governing bodies must have regard to the Department's guidance when delivering a broader range of SRE within the framework for PSHE. All schools are expected to meet the statutory requirements and have an up-to-date policy on SRE. Beyond this, there are no plans to regulate SRE further, as this would be contrary to curriculum reforms designed to give schools greater flexibilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/4">It is for schools to determine whom they employ to deliver any area of the curriculum. We are however committed to helping schools improve their planning and delivery of this important area, and there is a Government-funded continuing professional development programme for PSHE, which all teachers of SRE are encouraged to undertake. The programme, which is also open to community nurses, supports standards in the delivery of PSHE teaching, including SRE. To date, over 6,000 teachers and nurses have benefited from the programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/5">Other measures to support high quality SRE provision include:</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/6" class="indent">(1) The Department's funding for a new PSHE subject association. The association provides support and advice to teachers in all areas of PSHE, including SRE;</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/7" class="indent">(2) Increased funding (&pound;13.2 million) in 2007-08 for the national Healthy Schools Programme. This key programme requires schools, for the purposes of accreditation, to demonstrate that they have a SRE programme in line with DCSF guidance. We expect all schools to have reached or be working towards Healthy School status by 2009;</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/8" class="indent">(3) Detailed guidance to teachers from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, covering how schools can evaluate what young people are learning through PSHE, including SRE; and</p>
	<p pid="d.868W.0/9" class="indent">(4) Developing a SRE pupil assessment tool for use by schools and teachers to establish whether SRE provision is meeting the needs of the young people receiving it.</p>

	<p pid="d.872W.2/1">There is no clear evidence that further reductions in the infant class size limit from 30 would have further impact on overall pupil attainment, and therefore we have not done any work in costing this. Teachers, supported by teaching assistants, are free to organise their classes into small groups if they consider it will benefit individual pupils' learning.</p>

	<p pid="d.886W.11/1">Statutory guidance issued to local authorities, in their capacity as decision makers, makes it clear that when considering proposals to establish a new school, they should take into account not only the existence of spare capacity in neighbouring schools, but also the schools' standards and popularity, together with any evidence of parents' aspirations for a new school. Where proposals for a new school will add to surplus capacity, but there is a strong case for approval on parental preference and standards grounds, the guidance includes a presumption to approve the proposals but makes it clear that the local authority should consider parallel action to remove any resulting surplus.</p>

	<p pid="d.888W.2/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families provides two streams of funding for school improvement partners (SIPs). First, it contributes to the cost to local authorities of providing a SIP for every secondary school and, from April 2008, for every primary school and every special school. The funding is to help local authorities meet the cost of the SIP programme additional to that of previous local authority link adviser arrangements. The funding will be &pound;15.8 million in financial year 2007-08. Allocations of funding for SIPs for 2008-11 will be announced in the autumn as part of wider announcements for the next CSR period.</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.2/2">The second stream of funding is part of the Department's central support provided by the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. The SIP element of that support covers SIPs' accreditation, support to local authorities for introducing and managing SIPs, quality assurance of the programme and regional and national co-ordination of the work of SIPs. The cost of this in 2007-08 is &pound;8.7 million. The cost of this work will vary annually depending on the level of support required and is also subject to the announcement of allocations for 2008-11 in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.888W.2/3">Both streams of funding have a direct and beneficial impact on the resource available to schools to help with school improvement and raising standards.</p>

	<p pid="d.889W.8/1">It is not this Government's policy to make all secondary schools independent specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.889W.8/2">Any maintained secondary school in England may apply to be designated as specialist in one, or a combination of two, specialisms. Currently over 85 per cent. of all secondary schools in England are part of the Specialist Schools programme and have a subject specialism. The current target for the programme is that 95 per cent. of all schools will be specialist by 2008 and we are well on the way to achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="d.894W.5/1">At present, no schools have implemented proposals to become foundation schools with foundations (Trust Schools) under the Education and Inspections Act 2006. However, the first of the Pathfinder schools plan to become Trust Schools from September 2007. There are currently 33 Pathfinder projects involving around 70 schools. All of these schools are expected to become Trust Schools by September 2008. With the addition of around 140 Early Adopters this means that there are currently more than 200 schools working towards Trust status. This is a school driven policy therefore there are no set targets. However the Department for Children, Schools and Families will work towards having 300 schools, which by the end of the year will have become Trust Schools or are working towards this.</p>
	<p pid="d.894W.5/2">Forming a Trust does not involve new buildings. There is no additional capital and they will be funded through the local authority like any other maintained school.</p>

	<p pid="d.897W.3/1">The Government have been taking action on a number of fronts to ensure fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are used cleanly. The two key areas for reducing CO2, SO2 and NOx are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="d.897W.3/2">The development of the Carbon Abatement Technology Strategy for Fossil Fuel Use, published in June 2005 (reference URN 05/844) sets out a path towards the cleaner use of fossil fuels enabling them to have a role in a sustainable world with significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of this the Government announced in the Budget this year a competition to demonstrate carbon capture and storage power plant which has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from power plant by up to 90 per cent. The Strategy document is available in the House of Commons Library and also can be found at</p>

	<p pid="d.898W.2/1">As stated in the recently-published Energy White Paper, the Government are committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from heat. Many current policies contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from heat&mdash;for example the EU ETS, the climate change levy, tax incentives for CHP and the Energy Efficiency Commitment. In addition, policies such as the Warm Front programme to tackle fuel poverty help to reduce emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.898W.2/2">The Government published a Biomass Strategy alongside the Energy White Paper. The strategy provides a framework for the development of biomass, including its application to combined heat and power. The Government are currently also consulting on proposals to band the Renewables Obligation. The proposals contain mechanisms which are designed to encourage biomass CHP.</p>
	<p pid="d.898W.2/3">The Government recognise the value of considering the heat sector in a holistic and focused way. Further work is therefore being carried out into the policy options available to reduce the carbon impact of heat and its use. The work examines the full range of policy options, including the range of existing policy mechanisms such as the EU ETS.</p>
	<p pid="d.898W.2/4">The Government recognise that Combined Heat and Power has an important role to play alongside other low carbon technologies. However, the market is best placed to decide which technologies are most effective in supplying the UK's energy while also meeting our carbon reduction goals. It will be for the proposers of Eco Towns to bring forward their ideas on how heating and electricity generation can be supplied from renewable sources, including combined heat and power and associated heat grids as appropriate. These will be assessed against Government policies for promoting renewable and decentralised energy supply. My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing, will shortly be publishing a prospectus for Eco Towns setting out the growth expectations for sourcing heat and power use from renewable energy.</p>

The Energy White Paper published in May 2007 set out in detail the Government's strategy for energy security. Specific measures include reform of the planning and consents process, to help facilitate delivery of energy infrastructure projects, continuing to press for fully competitive and transparent international markets, and provision of more detailed, forward looking information to the market through the Energy Markets Outlook. We will also maximise the economic production of our domestic energy sources, which, together with energy saving measures, will help reduce our dependence on energy imports.</p>

	<p pid="d.903W.3/1">I have had no such discussions since my recent appointment. These issues are an important aspect of the discussions within Europe and globally about policy issues arising from the internet.</p>
	<p pid="d.903W.3/2">The rapidly increasing use of the internet gives rise to a range of issues relating to privacy. These include the problem of spam, issues around identity and on-line authentication, how to make the internet a safe place for children, and the problem of identity theft when such mechanisms fail. Privacy concerns also emerge in relation to the adoption of new technologies such as radio frequency identification and law enforcement initiatives such as the retention of and access to communications data. We also expect the European Commission to come forward with proposals to enhance privacy of data in their review of the telecommunications framework.</p>

	<p pid="d.914W.0/2"><i> </i>My Department are continuing to work with the renewables industry to overcome the barriers for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="d.914W.0/3">The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the Government's main support mechanism for supporting renewables generation. The RO places an obligation on suppliers to source a specific and annually increasing proportion of their sales from renewable sources. The RO is currently technology blind so that as long as the generation is from an eligible renewable source the generator will receive one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) for every 1 MW of renewable generation.</p>
	<p pid="d.914W.0/4">We are currently changing the RO to allow banding whereby differing values of ROC's dependent on what the generating source is and we announced in the Energy White Paper the proposed bands for renewables under the RO.</p>
