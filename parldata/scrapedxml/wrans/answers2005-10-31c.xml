	<p pid="c.666W.5/1">The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road casualties in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 280,840 in 2004, and the numbers of children aged less than 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 3,905 in 2004. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&ndash;67 to 42.4 billion in 2004&ndash;05, a rise of 32 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK's two main pollutants, nitrous oxides and particles, fell by 38 per cent. and 21 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.666W.5/2">Capital funding for local transport in the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency is allocated to the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority and the local district councils. The funding allocated to the councils Tyne and Wear since 1997 is shown in the table below <sup>1</sup> . It has been for the local authorities to determine how that allocation has been spent, in line with their local transport plan and their priorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.669W.0/1">The Road Traffic Act 1991 provides for the decriminalisation of most non-endorseable on-street parking offences in London and allows similar arrangements to be introduced elsewhere. Research for the Department by the Transport Research Laboratory (Special Parking Areas in London&quot;; The Special Parking Area in the District of Winchester&quot;; and The Special Parking Area in Oxford&quot;) showed that decriminalised parking enforcement provides local authorities with greater control over their enforcement activity and an enhanced ability to deliver their parking strategies. The Department partly funded the British Parking Association's recent review of decriminalised parking enforcement, which concluded that the existing system works well but that it would benefit from some modifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.669W.0/2">In 1995, the Secretary of State issued detailed guidance for local authorities in England outside of London on applying for, introducing and operating decriminalised parking enforcement. The guidance&mdash;local authority circular 1/95&mdash;makes clear that local authorities should liaise with the police to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibilities and that they should, therefore, continue to liaise with the police so that the two systems can operate effectively side-by-side. When applying for the power to enforce parking regulations, authorities have to submit detailed applications to the Department for Transport which need to confirm, among other things, that the authority will review its existing Traffic Regulation Orders, signs and road markings and use suitable documentation&mdash;including an appropriate penalty charge notice (PCN)&mdash;when enforcing contraventions. The appropriate police authority is asked whether it supports the application.</p>
	<p pid="c.669W.0/3">Circular 1/95 also makes it clear that the Government expect authorities to have regard to the minimum or common standards set out in that guidance. The information that must appear on a penalty charge notice is set out in the Road Traffic Act 1991. The Secretary of State's 1/95 guidance provides further suggestions about information that should be provided on penalty charge notices.</p>
	<p pid="c.669W.0/4">The Department is considering options for strengthening the existing system for the civil enforcement of parking contraventions while drafting regulations and guidance under Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2005. We have established an expert working group to help us take this work forward and aim to carry out public consultation in spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.673W.3/1">A comprehensive import regime exists in European Community law to ensure that animals and animal products imported from non EU countries do not pose a risk to animal or human health. They must come from approved countries and must be accompanied by official veterinary certification in a form specified in Community law. Animal products for human consumption must also come from approved establishments to ensure that they have been produced under hygienic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/2">Imported animals and animal products must enter the EU at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. A number of animals from each consignment are physically checked and a proportion of consignments of animal products undergo physical checks. EU law lays down minimum levels for physical checks, which vary depending on the product. These checks are to ensure that import conditions are met.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/3">Emergency safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of animals and meat from all, or parts, of the affected country, can be taken if there is an outbreak of disease in an exporting country likely to present a risk to human or animal health.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/4">The import of products of animal origin by individual travellers in their personal luggage is judged to be a potential route by which animal disease could be introduced. Following pressure by the Government, new tighter EU rules governing these imports were introduced in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/5">Action against illegal imports forms part of the overall Defra Animal Health and Welfare Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/6">&pound;25 million of new money has been made available over three years 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 to tackle illegal imports of products of animal origin (POAO) and plants and plant based goods (PBG) from third countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/7">HM Revenue and Customs are the delivery agent with enforcement responsibility at the frontier for illegal imports of products of animal origin (POAO) and plant based goods (PBG) from countries outside the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/8">Customs enforcement is based on risk. This includes information provided by Defra on the animal health disease situation around the world, including the risks from new disease outbreaks. Defra provide Customs with the 'map of the world' (informed by OIE) detailing animal health risks to assist Customs in deploying their resources according to risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/9">Enforcement powers in relation to illegally imported live animals are the responsibility of the Trading Standards department of the relevant local authority. Defra is working in partnership with HMRC on this issue and they have been kept informed of developments. As a result Customs are being more vigilant. If they come across live animals in the course of their duties they will hand these over to the State Veterinary Service or local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/10">The importation from non-EU countries of animal pathogens and carriers is prohibited except under licence. Licences issued to authorise such imports impose conditions for their safe handling and disposal. Animal pathogens causing the most serious exotic diseases of livestock and poultry are strictly controlled under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO). Specified animal pathogens may only be imported by those licensed to hold or work with them under SAPO. To be considered for licensing an establishment must meet the relevant Defra containment and operating requirements for the specified animal pathogen concerned and inspections are carried out to confirm this.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/11">Imports from third countries of plants and most types of plant produce require a phytosanitary certificate issued by the plant health services in the country of origin stating that the consignment meets our plant health import rules. For movements within the EC, consignments of high risk plants must carry a plant passport&quot;. Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate carried out 10,128 check inspections of imports from non-EU countries last year, 29,884 inspections of plants and produce moving within the EU, and 32,617 inspections of plants susceptible to Phytophthora ramorum (the pathogen which causes Sudden Oak Death in California). Where potentially damaging pests or diseases or other evidence of non-compliance were found, proportionate actions were taken to deal with the immediate risk and to reduce the possibility of recurrence.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/12">In order to improve the effectiveness of import controls and implement recent changes to the Plant Health Directive a further nine Plant Health Inspectors have been recruited this year to be based at major air and sea ports. The UK supported the recent adoption by the EC's Standing Committee on Plant Health of a risk targeting mechanism to determine appropriate rates of inspection for import trades depending on their compliance record. The UK also plays an active role in setting international standards for plant health controls and monitoring their implementation as well as ensuring that regulatory action on plant pests and diseases is based on good scientific evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.673W.3/13">Defra recently published a plant health strategy to set out: objectives and priorities for protecting plant health in England; the relative roles of government and other stakeholders in delivery of these objectives; and how activities relevant to plant health (including research) of Defra, its executive agencies and other bodies should best be co-ordinated.

	<p pid="c.678W.3/1">The Flycapture database was established in April 2004 to record all fly-tips reported to and dealt with by waste collection authorities and the Environment Agency. The following data were recorded to the Flycapture database by waste collection authorities between April 2005 and August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.3/2">It is important to note that the data are likely to increase as more authorities submit returns and get better at collecting and reporting the data.</p>

	<p pid="c.688W.2/1">The Government recognize the benefits of reducing the number of plastic bags used, but does not consider that the case for a tax on plastic bags has been demonstrated conclusively. A recent Extended Impact Assessment carried out by the Scottish Executive on a proposal to introduce a levy on plastic carrier bags in Scotland concluded that there would be a broad environmental disbenefit if a levy was introduced on the lines proposed. We are continuing to keep developments in Scotland and Ireland under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.688W.2/2">The number of single-use plastic bags in circulation could be significantly reduced through reuse and recycling, so we have asked the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to investigate the feasibility of a national Bag for Life scheme. This would encourage consumers to use strong, re-usable plastic bags in place of single-use bags. Life cycle analysis surveys suggest that re-using such bags between four and seven times would have significant environmental benefits when compared to alternatives such as plastic carrier bags, paper bags and biodegradable bags.</p>
	<p pid="c.688W.2/3">WRAP are currently trialling a national Bag for Life scheme in Bristol and Edinburgh, in association with supermarket retailers, the Scottish Executive, the British Retail Consortium and Scottish Waste Awareness. Approximately 35 to 40 supermarket outlets in each town will take part in these trials.</p>

	<p pid="c.690W.5/1">It is well known that <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis</i>) is endemic in the badger population and this has been the subject of many detailed studies. <i>M. bovis</i> has also been isolated from a number of mammalian species including red deer, sika deer, roe deer, fallow deer, fox, mink, brown rat, and mole.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.5/2">More recently, a study conducted by Oxford University (SE3009) carried out a systematic survey of over four thousand small mammals and found <i>M. bovis</i> in a single bank vole and three badgers. Another survey conducted by Central Science Laboratory (SE3010) found <i>M. bovis</i> in fox, stoat, common shrew, yellow necked mouse, wood mouse, field vole, grey squirrel, roe deer, red deer, fallow deer, and muntjac deer. Many of these had been shown in the past to harbour <i>M. bovis</i> occasionally, but this project has been the first to show <i>M. bovis</i> in muntjac deer. The prevalence in most of these species was very low and ecological factors suggested that they posed little risk. However, the findings highlighted red and fallow deer as being of potential risk to cattle. Therefore, Defra has commissioned two quantitative risk assessment studies to try to quantify the risk wild deer may pose in spreading TB to cattle.</p>
	<p pid="c.690W.5/3">The final report from SE3010 can be found on the Defra website at: &lt;<a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/proiect_data/More.asp?I=SE3010&amp;M=KWS&amp;V=">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/proiect_data/More.asp?I=SE3010&amp;M=KWS&amp;V=</a> se3010&amp;SCOPE=0&gt;.</p>

	<p pid="c.690W.8/2">A number of measures have been introduced aimed at tightening surveillance and reducing the risk of TB spreading to new areas. The recalculation of routine testing intervals will ensure TB testing complies with Commission legislation while offering robust protection. Livestock movement restrictions are now imposed immediately a herd's routine test becomes overdue and a more rigorous and systematic approach to identifying and dealing with potential new TB hotspots is in place. In addition to this, rigorous testing schedules for new and reformed herds have been introduced.</p>

	<p pid="c.695W.5/1">The Government regards responsible business behaviour as very important and that corporate social responsibility can help companies to become more efficient, more profitable and more sustainable. The Company Law Reform Bill will address one aspect of corporate social responsibility through its introduction of a statutory statement of directors general duties. This will provide greater clarity to directors on how they are expected to behave. The basic goal of directors is the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, but in fulfilling this duty directors will be required, to have regard to factors such as the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment. This approach will give directors the clarity they need, while recognising that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin. It complements the requirement on quoted companies to report on matters such as social and community issues and the environment in the operating and financial review where these are necessary for an understanding of the nature of the business.</p>
	<p pid="c.695W.5/2">The Government recognises that the corporate social responsibility agenda is varied and wide. It does not believe that company law reform can address all of the issues within this agenda, and it will continue to consider more broadly how the regulatory and fiscal framework can encourage responsible business behaviour.</p>

Where arrears are not paid, an enforcement notice will be issued setting out the arrears that are considered to be due. An employer will then have 28 days to lodge an appeal and subsequently have his case heard before an employment tribunal. If the appeal is not upheld or the enforcement notice has not been appealed against, the arrears become due.

	<p pid="c.710W.2/2">The Office for National Statistics estimates that the number of jobs paid below the minimum wage was 272,344 in April 2004. However, this estimate is based on the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings which is not designed to monitor compliance with the minimum wage. The survey cannot separately identify workers such as apprentices, those undergoing training and those workers eligible for the accommodation offset, all of whom may legally be paid less than the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.2/3">Arrangements are in place to ensure that those employers most at risk of paying their employees below the minimum wage are considered for NMW enforcement measures. Workers and others may register a complaint that the minimum wage has not been paid with the HMRC NMW Helpline. This will trigger an inquiry into the employer by one of the 16 locally based HMRC NMW enforcement teams. Other employers that are at risk of not complying with the minimum wage legislation are also visited by one of the enforcement teams to check they are compliant. These employers are selected using risk assessment when information from various sources, including from within HMRC and from other Departments, is considered.</p>

Rabies and Hepatitis B vaccines are offered to personnel who are at occupational risk. Vaccinations are only administered after the individual has given informed consent, therefore, all vaccinations can only be deemed recommended for deployment. The costs of the immunisations have been calculated per person, per dose and include VAT:</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.2/1">The Government have put in place a broad programme of both macroeconomic and microeconomic reform since our election in 1997 designed to improve the economic performance of all parts of the UK. Since these policies were implemented, the economic performance of the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency has improved considerably. For example, since May 1997, claimant unemployment in Gateshead, East and Washington, West has fallen by 54 per cent. while both long-term youth and adult unemployment have fallen by over 90 per cent.</p>

With share options, the incentive clearly takes time to work because share prices need time to grow to generate gains for employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.3/2">We are continually analysing EMI information received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) from companies and their representatives. We also commission research from external contractors to gather further EMI evidence as part of the HMRC research programme. National statistics on EMI are annually updated on the HMRC website. Findings of qualitative research that gathered early evidence on the attitudes and experiences of companies using EMI are also available on the HMRC website. Based on these results, a more comprehensive quantitative study of the policy is planned for 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="c.729W.8/1">Since 1997, the Government have taken steps to improve the environment for all UK businesses&mdash;including manufacturer&mdash;by maintaining macroeconomic stability and implementing microeconomic reforms to remove barriers to efficient and flexible markets. The UK now has the lowest rate of corporation tax since its introduction. A number of other measures have also delivered improvements for the manufacturing sector through the tax system. In addition to 40 per cent. first year allowances for investments in plant and machinery by small and medium sized enterprises, the Government has introduced 100 per cent. first year allowances for investments in designated energy-saving plant and machinery. The introduction of R and D tax credits has also already led to claims of over &pound;1.3 billion, delivering important Government support for research and development in innovative UK manufacturers and other firms.</p>

Furthermore, international studies show that the UK is a good place to do business. A range of factors affect the competitiveness of the business environment, and the Government have introduced a range of measures to enhance the five drivers of productivity and growth, such as the R and D tax credits to encourage innovation. The UK also has an impressive record of macroeconomic stability and resilience over the last decade, and some of the most flexible labour and product markets in the developed world.</p>

In common with other policy or process changes, a learning needs analysis will be conducted once the nature of any changes to incapacity benefits has been finalised.

The guidance also refers to guidance issued by the Health and Safety Executive and other bodies covering risk assessment, the safe management of crowds, event safety, and related issues. My officials also have regular discussions with LACORS (Local Authorities Coordinators or Regulatory Services) about specific licensing issues, including some that are relevant to open arenas such as requirements for plans.

	<p pid="c.743W.11/1">The advertising of applications for licences under the Licensing Act 2003 is not a matter of guidance but a matter of primary and secondary legislation. Under the Licensing Act 2003 (Premises licences and club premises certificates) Regulations 2005 (2005 No. 42) applicants are required to display prominently at their premises for 28 days a notice about the application where it can be conveniently read from the exterior of the premises. They must also publish a notice in a local newspaper, or if there is none, in a local newsletter, circular or similar document circulating in the vicinity of the premises on at least one occasion during the period of ten working days following the giving of the application to the relevant licensing authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.11/2">The 2003 Act also requires that licensing authorities must place details of applications on its licensing register which must be available and accessible to the public. There is nothing in the 2003 Act which prevents licensing authorities themselves from taking supplementary action to bring applications to the attention of individuals living in the vicinity of the premises concerned if they consider it necessary, but this is a matter for them to decide in the light of local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.11/3">We are committed to monitoring closely how the new regime operates in practice and this will include looking at evidence about the effectiveness of requirements such as those on the advertising of applications. Where the evidence suggests that elements of the system could be more effective, we will consider revisions to the guidance or, if necessary, asking Parliament to amend the legislation.</p>

	<p pid="c.744W.2/2">A number of measures are being drawn upon to assess the impact of the Licensing Act on levels of crime and disorder in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.2/3">These include the use of national surveys including (but not limited to) data on alcohol related crime from the British Crime Survey. These national measures will be supplemented by local area case studies in five police force areas in England. These local case studies will look at patterns of recorded crime and disorder in relation to licensed premises and extended hours. This work will also include surveys of local residents and a range of businesses, including licensees, that may potentially be affected. The work will establish a baseline against which any change can subsequently be measured.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.2/4">It is intended to supplement this exercise in the five areas with information from ambulance call-out statistics and accident and emergency departments, and the Home Office are currently engaged in discussion with the Department of Health on the feasibility of this issue. The Home Office are leading on this work, in consultation with other Government Departments including the Departments of Health, and Culture Media and Sport.</p>

	<p pid="c.750W.5/5">The British Government and the BBC have formally requested the Government of Nepal to allow the BBC to broadcast unhindered. The British Ambassador in Kathmandu has also raised our concerns about media censorship directly with the King, in the context of our wider concerns about the erosion of democratic processes, institutions and civil liberties.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.3/1">There already is a budget line for non-proliferation activities within the group of budget lines for common foreign and security policy (CFSP) activities. Our view is that this budget line should remain, within the CFSP envelope, in the next financial perspective. We do not think, however, that it would be appropriate to have one budget line or instrument covering both Commission and CFSP activity in this area as each requires a separate legal base. Activity such as nuclear safety is carried out under the euratom treaty. CFSP activities, such as non-proliferation and small arms and light weapons projects with third countries, are carried out on the basis of title V, treaty on European Union i.e. on the decision of all member states in the CFSP framework.</p>

These include increasing the effectiveness of the global security agenda and the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget. The proposed nuclear safety instrument would provide a specific basis for funding activities that fall under the Commission's competence on the basis of the euratom treaty. The CFSP budget will remain as the basis for member states' activity through CFSP. We are arguing for an increase in the latter, within an overall budget of no more than 1 per cent. of EU gross national income.</p>

Many external works are authorised under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. For the local planning authority the test is whether installation of equipment would amount to 'development' and, if so, whether it would breach any of the limits set by the Permitted Development Order to help protect the amenity of the neighbourhood. Even where a planning application is necessary, the fee is waived if the works are designed to improve access for a disabled person to his or her home.</p>

	<p pid="c.763W.9/1">The policy for ensuring provision of affordable homes is being considered as part of the Tamworth Local Plan review process. The Inspector's report on these revisions is due to be published soon and it would not be proper to pre-empt these considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.9/2">Earlier this year the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister introduced changes to the planning system aimed at removing barriers to delivering affordable homes and to free up unused employment land where it is needed for housing. Following publication of the Inspector's report, Tamworth borough council will begin work on a Housing Development Plan Document which will form part of the overall Local Development Framework for the borough. Work on the document which will set out future housing needs, including for affordable and social housing, is due to get under way early in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.9/3">My hon. Friend will be aware that the Government have a long-term strategy to increase the supply of affordable housing. Over the next five years our new homebuy schemes will extend the opportunity for home ownership for potentially 100,000 households by 2010. These schemes will introduce simpler, fairer and more affordable products to help people to get a foot on the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.9/4">We are also investing heavily in new affordable homes for rent with investment for 2007&ndash;08 earmarked at around &pound;2 billion which is double what it was in 1997. At the same time we are increasing investment in social homes which, in the three years to 2008, will provide 75,000 new homes which is a 50 per cent. increase per year over original targets. The West Midlands Regional Housing Strategy is providing the first step towards addressing affordable housing issues in the region. The Strategy has informed the regional housing board's allocation of funding for the period 2004 to 2008 including &pound;368 million for investment in social housing which should deliver nearly 10,000 new homes across the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.765W.0/1">DFID prioritises the provision of basic health services in Africa and is helping to build comprehensive and sustainable health services in many countries. This helps poor countries tackle diseases such as ascariasis, elephantiasis and river blindness, in addition to many others.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/2">These diseases are often linked to dirty water or poor sanitation. DFID is committed to helping African countries provide clean water and sanitation for their people and will double aid expenditure on water and sanitation in Africa over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/3">In addition, DFID targets funds at parasitic diseases through a number of Global Health Partnerships, multilateral agencies and researchers. For example, DFID supports the African Programme for Onchocerciasis (river blindness) Control. We have supported onchocerciasis control continuously since 1974, contributing around &pound;4.65 million to date.

	<p pid="c.765W.3/1">At the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Japan in January this year member states including the United Kingdom renewed their commitment to reducing disaster risk. At Gleneagles in July, the G8 also agreed to increase investment in disaster risk reduction. The challenge is to transform these commitments into action in developing countries where it is needed most.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/2">In 2004 the Secretary of State for International Development committed the Department to increase expenditure on disaster risk reduction. The UK is already the largest contributor of unearmarked funds to the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). Earlier this year, we committed &pound;3.5 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for their disaster risk reduction programmes in Africa and Asia. We have also allocated 10 per cent. of our tsunami response funds to support disaster risk reduction measures in the countries affected. In October 2005 we committed &pound;12.5 million over five years to support the community level disaster risk reduction work of five international non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/3">We are developing a new policy paper on disaster risk reduction to enable DFID to tackle disaster risk more effectively, and to advise our country offices on ways of incorporating disaster risk reduction into development. We have also called on the United Nations and the World Bank to do more on disaster risk reduction. This challenge is being taken up through the reform of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and increasing recognition of disaster risk reduction in Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="c.766W.2/1">The Government of Malawi and donors were able to respond quickly to the food shortages in Malawi because Malawi had a good early warning system, and an effective system of assessing needs and allocating food aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.766W.2/2">To date, 1.8 million people have received food aid. This will rise to 2.8 million people by the end of December as needs increase. By the end of the hungry season, the plan is to feed 4.2 million people. The distribution of the food aid through the Government and the World Food Programme (WFP) is carefully targeted and monitored to ensure that it properly meets those in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="c.766W.2/3">The UK Government have contributed &pound;15.2 million to address Malawi's food shortages this year. These funds paid for 70,000 tons of food, the financing of a logistics unit that is distributing food on behalf of the Government, options for the Government of Malawi on a further 60,000 tons of maize, the purchase of seeds for next year's harvest and support for UNICEF's nutritional rehabilitation units, which treat severely malnourished children.</p>

	<p pid="c.766W.5/1">The UK Government have contributed &pound;15.2 million to address Malawi's food shortages this year. Of this amount, &pound;6.7 million has been used to purchase 45,000 tons of maize, which will be distributed with the help of Non Governmental Organisations on the ground in targeting poor people whose harvests have failed and who do not have money to buy food. &pound;4.87 million of additional budget support has been used by the Government of Malawi to buy options on 60,000 tons of maize in case the food situation worsens plus the purchase of seeds for next year's harvest. A further &pound;3 million will be used after the next harvest to replenish 22,400 tons of maize drawn from the Strategic Grain Reserve to provide food aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.766W.5/2">DFID is also providing &pound;500,000 to build the Government's capacity, including financing a logistics unit to distribute food on behalf of government. A further &pound;130,000 has been given to UNICEF to support their treatment programme for severely malnourished children. We are monitoring the situation closely and stand ready to do more if required.</p>

	<p pid="c.767W.2/1">DFID provides most of its health-related assistance to Africa in support of building comprehensive health services, often through non-earmarked Poverty Reduction Budgetary Support (PRBS) or ear-marked health sector support. Whilst a proportion of this will be used to tackle obstetric fistula, it is not possible to provide an exact figure for spend in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.2/2">The cornerstone of preventing obstetric fistulae is prompt access to good quality health care when needed. DFID is committed to helping countries expand access to health care, including family planning, antenatal and obstetric services.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.2/3">DFID also targets some funding through NGOs to tackle obstetric fistula. For example, DFID has provided a grant of &pound;588,000 to the Engendered Health and Women's Dignity Project to combat obstetric fistula in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.2/4">To complement our country level support, DFID also channels funds though the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). For the period of 2005&ndash;06, DFID has provided &pound;20 million core funding and &pound;10 million specifically for reproductive health (for preventable and treatable conditions such as obstetric fistula).</p>

	<p pid="c.768W.2/1">I am pleased that, on development, the outcome of the UN Millennium Review Summit consolidated all that was achieved at the G8 Summit at Gleneagles.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.2/2">In particular, the summit endorsed the need for faster progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), acknowledging the special needs of Africa. It also endorsed the G8 approach on HIV/AIDS and climate change, including, importantly, on stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.2/3">The commitments of the G8 and EU, to increase aid, provide deeper debt relief and explorie innovative financing mechanisms were all welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.2/4">Important commitments were also made in other areas too. For DFID, our immediate priorities are to support the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission by the end of the year and to develop satisfactory arrangements for the Peacebuilding Fund; to be closely involved in the process by which the Secretary General develops his ideas for longer-term reform of the UN development architecture; and to continue to work with the UN on reform of the humanitarian assistance system.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.2/5">The Millennium Review Summit ensured that the momentum generated at Gleneagles was maintained, and the commitments made there given global endorsement by the 191 UN member states. There is still much to be done, but the agreements reached this year represent a significant step towards reducing poverty in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.771W.8/1">Administrative staffing levels at Feltham are stable with relatively slow turnover. Within officer grades turnover is greater, particularly within the first 12 months that staff are in post. Historically, Feltham has experienced recruitment difficulties but this situation has improved, with more staff being recruited from the local area and a proactive approach ensuring that high numbers of vacancies do not occur. Sickness levels have also drastically improved over the last three years</p>

	<p pid="c.773W.6/2">The key performance target for overcrowding in public sector prisons for 2005&ndash;06 is for no more than 24 per cent. of the population, and for the private sector 34.5 per cent. of the population held in accommodation units intended for fewer prisoners. The difference in the targets between the public and private sector prisons reflects their different circumstances. Private sector prisons are generally of a comparatively newer design and construction than their public sector equivalents and better able to safely accommodate higher levels of overcrowding than the public sector estate. At present, there are 23.5 per cent. of prisoners sharing accommodation in crowded conditions in the public sector and 24.9 per cent. in the private sector. This is kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.773W.6/3">Population pressures can result in greater numbers of prisoners required to share cells in crowded conditions. Higher numbers of prisoners may also affect the provision of regimes in some prisons. Everything possible will continue to be done to minimise any disruption.</p>

The Probation Service would normally provide a PSR in all cases where custody is a possibility. A PSR would not usually be provided where an offender has been found guilty of murder and a life sentence is the only possible disposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.784W.5/1">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety funds the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR), which undertakes a wide range of statistical research into success rates for the treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer. It has recently published a major report on breast cancer which is a further significant step in the evaluation of cancer care here&mdash;Gavin A, Kinnear H, Fitzpatrick D, Ranaghan L, 2005. Cancer Services Audit 1996 &amp; 2001, Breast. N. Ireland Cancer Registry&quot;. In addition, the Research and Development Office (RDO), which is also funded by my Department, established a Cancer Recognised Research Group in 2000&ndash;01. This comprises 15 research programmes in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancers. A number of individual research projects currently funded by the RDO are specifically related to breast cancer treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.784W.5/2">The success rate for the treatment of breast cancer is dependent on a range of factors including the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Latest published figures from NICR, based on persons diagnosed in the period 1996&ndash;99, show that the one-year relative survival rate for breast cancer is 95.2 per cent. while the five-year relative survival rate is 81.5 per cent. These rates are very good in comparison with other cancers but the fact that survival is already high makes it more difficult to measure improvements over time.</p>

	<p pid="c.787W.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Gregory Campbell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding, what steps are being taken to ensure that those using disabled parking bays in car parks open to the general public in Northern Ireland are drivers with a valid disabled Blue Badge applicable to the vehicle in question.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/5" class="indent">Firstly, I should explain that a Blue Badge is issued to a disabled person for their personal use. It does not limit the disabled person to a particular vehicle and can legitimately be used in any vehicle in which the disabled person in question is travelling. When a Blue Badge is displayed on a vehicle, only the serial number and date of expiry are visible to someone making a routine inspection. Other information, such as a photograph of the disabled person and their signature, are not immediately visible.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/6" class="indent">The purpose of the Disabled Persons Badge Scheme (the Blue Badge Scheme) is to give disabled people the ability to park on-street, close to the facilities and services they need so as to improve their lifestyle, independence and freedom of choice. The scheme only applies to on-street car parking. A Blue Badge does not entitle the holder to free parking within a Roads Service off-street fee paying public car park. Therefore, there is no monetary benefit to be gained from the improper use of a Blue Badge within a fee paying public car park. For other off-street private car parks, such as shopping centres and multi-storey car parks, badge holders must check the concessions offered, as these can vary widely.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/7" class="indent">Responsibility for the enforcement of off-street disabled parking spaces in public car parks currently rests with Roads Service. Article 6 of the Off-Street Parking (NI) Order 2000 prohibits the driver of a vehicle, other than a disabled person's vehicle, to park in a disabled parking space. Contravention of this Article is an offence, and in such circumstances, Roads Service has the power to remove the vehicle or instigate proceedings to prosecute the individual involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/8" class="indent">However, our experience is that there is not a major difficulty with the misuse of off-street disabled parking spaces. This may be explained by the considerable concessions for Blue Badge holders at on- street parking facilities, including free unlimited parking at on-street 'pay and display' equipment. Other on-street parking concessions also permit a Blue Badge holder to leave their vehicle without time limit in a street where waiting is normally allowed only for limited periods. Blue Badge holders may also, in some areas, leave their vehicle for up to 3 hours on many yellow lines.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/9" class="indent">It is therefore our policy to discourage potential offenders and where disabled persons' interests can be protected by persuasion, rather that prosecution, so much the better. To this end when car park attendants discover a vehicle parked in a disabled parking space without having a Blue Badge on display, they place a notice on the vehicle advising the driver that he/she is parked in a space reserved for disabled people. The notice also advises that such parking is an offence that may result in a fine or the vehicle being removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/10" class="indent">I should also advise that following the PSNI's decision to withdraw from the enforcement of on-street parking restrictions, to enable policing resources to be focused on areas of greater policing priority, DRD has introduced new primary legislation, the Traffic Management (NI) Order 2005. This legislation provides the necessary legislative power to introduce civil enforcement of certain road traffic offences, initially enforcement of parking and waiting prohibitions and restrictions. Decriminalised Parking Enforcement (DPE) is likely to become effective in late September/early October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/11" class="indent">Under DPE, traffic attendants will be able to inspect Blue Badges to check for abuse of the system and may issue a Penalty Charge Notice if misuse is suspected. If this happens, Roads Service will write to the holder of the badge and inform them that it has been used inappropriately. Should this happen on a number of occasions Roads Service may withdraw the disabled persons' badge. Vehicles not displaying a Blue Badge, but parked in an on-street disabled parking space, will be issued with a Penalty Charge Notice.</p>
	<p pid="c.787W.2/12" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

The costs include redundancy pay, compensatory lump sum and actuarial costs. The long term savings for each board as a result of these redundancies will be significantly in excess of the redundancy costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.795W.0/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding his estimate of the change in commuting time for motorists between Sandyknowes roundabout and Belfast City Centre during the morning rush hour period, 7.45am to 9.15am, over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/5" class="indent">Roads Service monitors journey time surveys on the strategic routes in Northern Ireland including the routes from Larne to Belfast to Newry (A8, M2, Ml and Al). These surveys commenced in 1996 and the most recent information available is for 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/6" class="indent">Unfortunately, we have no journey time information that relates to the specific journey between Sandyknowes and Belfast City Centre. However, a comparison of journey times between Sandyknowes and the Divis Street junction on Westlink would suggest that the average journey time in the morning peak over this section has increased by 2 to 3 minutes between 1996 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/7" class="indent">This excludes the significant delays experienced by southbound traffic approaching Sandyknowes on the M2. Roads Service acknowledges that these delays are a direct result of capacity restrictions downstream of Sandyknowes where only 2 traffic lanes are available to cater for both mainline M2 traffic and the considerable flow joining the motorway from Sandyknowes roundabout. Consequently we plan to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions. This will make it easier for traffic to join the M2 from the Sandyknowes junction, particularly during the morning peak traffic, and also provide greater capacity on the Belfast-bound section of the M2 towards Greencastle. Construction of these improvements on the M2 is expected to start during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/8" class="indent">The &pound;30 million M2 Widening Scheme is one of three schemes forming part of the &pound;100 million Roads Service Design, Build, Finance and Operate Package 1, along with the Ml/Westlink Project and the Antrim Hospital slip roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/9" class="indent">I can also advise that the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan proposes modifications to the Sandyknowes roundabout to minimise conflicts between different traffic movements and afford greater priority to the strategic M2 and A8 movements. Roads Service is currently investigating various design options.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.0/10" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

The projected fall in pupil numbers will not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in surplus places&mdash;changes to the schools' estate in the intervening period, through the major capital works programme and as a result of proposals from school authorities for closures or amalgamations should remove a considerable number of surplus places.</p>

Provisional GCSE examination results data show a strong performance, with the average academy improving at 5 per cent. per year of opening, five academies improving by over 20 per cent. since opening and an overall improvement rate of at least 6.6 per cent. this year.

	<p pid="c.803W.0/1">Building Schools for the Future (BSF) aims to renew all secondary schools of any category in England in the next 15 years.

	<p pid="c.803W.0/2">BSF does not support investment in primary schools or sixth form colleges, for which other funding is available. In the March budget, the Chancellor announced additional funding of &pound;150 million for primary schools from 2008&ndash;09, rising to &pound;500 million by 2009&ndash;10, with the aim that at least half of all primary schools will be renewed in the next 15 years.

	<p pid="c.803W.0/3">Sixth form colleges are funded through the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). From 2006&ndash;07, there is a new joint schools and LSC budget for investment in post-16 provision, which will be administered by the LSC. This reaches &pound;180 million by 2007&ndash;08, including &pound;100 million from schools capital. The Chancellor's Budget statement also strengthened the government's commitment to the further education sector by announcing new capital funding of &pound;100 million for the sector in 2008&ndash;08, rising to &pound;250 million in 2009&ndash;10.</p>

	<p pid="c.809W.5/1">My Department does not directly monitor the progress of universities and colleges in making reasonable adaptations. Universities are autonomous bodies and it is for them to ensure that they are complying with the Act. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) assists HEIs to meet legislative requirements, spreads good practice and helps institutions to improve access and provision for disabled people. It has distributed project capital funding specifically to help institutions meet their duties under the Act, amounting to &pound;173 million, and all institutions have submitted plans to HEFCE concerning their use of this funding. HEFCE has also provided funding to widen access and improve provision for disabled students in HEIs and directly funded FECs. In 2004&ndash;05 over &pound;12 million was distributed.</p>
	<p pid="c.809W.5/2">Performance indicators on the participation of students in receipt of the Disabled Students Allowance have been published since 2002. The latest indicators are published on the website of the Higher Education Statistics Agency (<a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/</a>). The Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE) also publishes data on participation of disabled students in higher education (<a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/lgm/divers/eostudent.xls">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/lgm/divers/eostudent.xls</a>).</p>
	<p pid="c.809W.5/3">The Learning and Skills Council monitors the quality of all aspects of provision in further education colleges, including the extent to which college premises are accessible to disabled learners. Since July 2001 the LSC has approved funding to enable colleges to undertake adaptations that will help them comply with the Act. So far over &pound;160 million has been made available. All colleges have made or are making adaptations, or have plans in hand.</p>

	<p pid="c.813W.2/2">The current budget for education maintenance allowance (EMA) payments in the financial year 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;403 million. However EMA is a demand-led programme which is funded through Annually Managed Expenditure by HM Treasury so final provision may be different.</p>
	<p pid="c.813W.2/3">For the academic year 2005/06, we estimate around 55 per cent. of students will be eligible for EMA on income grounds. We estimate this to be some 465,000 young people. This includes unwaged trainees on work-based learning programmes funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). From April 2006, unwaged trainees, and their parents/carers, will receive the same package of financial support as is currently available to those who stay on in full-time education, i.e. EMA, child benefit, child tax credit and other related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.813W.2/4">So far, the national EMA scheme has been rolled out to 16 and 17-year-olds. However, in pilot areas EMA is also available to those aged 18. The national scheme will be rolled out to 18-year-olds in September 2006. Unwaged trainees aged 16&ndash;19 will be eligible from April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.815W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/3">In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success'&mdash;a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/4">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14&ndash;19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult work force. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/5">The Chancellor announced in the 2004 Spending Review settlement for education and skills in April 2004, that there will be over &pound;1 billion of additional investment in the learning and skills sector by 2007&ndash;08. We will not know what this will mean for regional and local budgets until allocations are made by the National LSC Office, following receipt of the grant letter from my Department.</p>

	<p pid="c.817W.5/1">Further Education allocations to colleges are an important part of the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) business cycle. This process starts with my Department's annual grant letter to the LSC in November which enables the LSC to plan regional priorities and budgets. Local LSCs begin their planning dialogue with colleges and providers in December and in January colleges are provided with indicative (provisional) allocations for the following funding year beginning <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>. Local, regional and national plans have to be reconciled and the LSC expect to sign off individual college plans in April. Final allocations for colleges are then confirmed in May. This timetable was followed for the 2005/06 funding year.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.5/2">My Department has already agreed with the LSC our funding priorities for 2006/07 and colleges have been advised of these through a letter from me and through the LSC's 'Priorities for Success' document which was published on <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>. This also confirms the allocations timetable for next year. I expect this earlier notification of funding priorities and the dialogue between colleges and the LSC which can now begin will lead to less uncertainty in the period up to confirmation of college allocations for 2006/07 in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.817W.5/3">I am satisfied that the LSC's management of this complex process is a proper balance between their obligation to meet the Government's priorities and ensuring colleges can effectively deploy public resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.820W.2/2">Independent research by Royal Holloway, University of London, reported that by March 2004, 87 (65 per cent.) authorities had met the requirement. 29 (22 per cent.) of authorities were assessed as being 'well ahead' because they had protocols that were signed by health, education, social care and other agencies. 43 (32 per cent.) authorities were assessed as being a 'bit behind' when protocols had yet to be agreed at a high level.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.2/3">Acknowledging the challenge in meeting the requirements to the original deadline, we allowed local authorities to carry over unspent funds into the financial year 2004&ndash;05. We commissioned Royal Holloway to do a further check on authorities in July 2004, which indicated that significant progress had been made. At this point, less than 10 per cent. were identified as 'a bit behind'.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.2/4">We have not made any subsequent detailed checks on authorities about whether they have met the requirements and have no plans to do so. We continue to encourage local authorities to develop effective information sharing arrangements and, partly in response to calls from local authorities, we plan to provide them with non-statutory guidance on information sharing across all children's services early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.820W.5/1">Intelligent design does not form part of any programme of study in the national curriculum. In science pupils should be taught at Key Stage 4 how scientific controversies can arise from different ways of interpreting empirical evidence [for example, Darwin's theory of evolution]&quot;. Although it is possible that intelligent design could be raised in this context, controversies need to be scientific in order to meet national curriculum requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.5/2">Intelligent design may be taught in religious education lessons as a religious interpretation of how the world was created. All religious education syllabuses are devised by local authorities, so statistics are not held centrally.</p>

Schools may have investment needs such as larger building projects that cannot be fully supported with a single year's allocation and therefore, so that schools can build up funding for them, our guidance includes that this money can be rolled-over for up to three years. Also, where there is local agreement with their authorities, schools may be able to draw down future years' allocations so that they get early benefit of the investment.</p>

	<p pid="c.823W.2/1">Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of school playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the proceeds as it wished.</p>
	<p pid="c.823W.2/2">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Section 77 defines playing field as land in the open air which is provided for the purposes of physical education or recreation.</p>
	<p pid="c.823W.2/3">All applications received since <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-16">16 July 2001</phrase> have been scrutinised by the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel, which comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association. The panel provides advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.823W.2/4">Since 1997, 166 applications to sell an area of school playing field capable of being used for at least a small sports pitch have been approved. Of these approvals, 70 have been at closed school sites. Of the 96 disposals at operating schools, the proceeds of sale have been used to improve on-site sports facilities at 69 of these schools. In the other 27 cases the sale proceeds have been used to improve educational facilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.823W.5/1">A targeted review of the role of special schools was carried out in 2003 which resulted in the Report of the Special Schools Working Group: the majority of the report's recommendations were subsequently embodied in the Department's SEN Strategy&mdash;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;. We believe special schools have an important role to play within the overall spectrum of provision for children with SEN&mdash;both through direct provision and through sharing their expertise with mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.823W.5/2">Under the Education Act 1996, local authorities are under a duty to secure sufficient schools for pupils in their area and in doing so must have particular regard to the need to secure special educational provision. Ofsted inspects the quality of educational provision for children with SEN, including specialist provision. Within this framework how provision is organised is a matter for local decision, and for that reason, Government plays no role in relation to local authority school reorganisations or in respect of decisions to close schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.824W.2/2">From September 2006 we will be introducing revised rules for determining what support should be available to students who have previously undertaken higher education courses. These new provisions will not alter the treatment of graduate students undertaking a second undergraduate degree leading to a professional qualification. As is the case under current rules, such students will not be eligible for fee support, or for the new grants that we have introduced. However, they will continue to qualify for the maintenance loan.</p>

	<p pid="c.825W.5/1">From 2006/07 all EU nationals, and this includes British nationals living abroad, will be entitled to tuition fee loans provided they have resided in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three years immediately preceding the start of the academic year in which their course commences. However, these students are not entitled to loans for living costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/2">Apart from closely defined exceptions, to be eligible for student loans for living costs in addition to student loans for fees (from 2006/07), a British national must have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands (the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) throughout the three years immediately preceding the first day of the first academic year of the course and ordinarily resident in England on this date. A British national whose residence in the UK and Islands during the three year period was wholly or mainly for the purpose of receiving full time education is not considered to have satisfied the ordinary residence requirement&mdash;unless they have exercised a right of free movement within the European Economic Area and were ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area (including the UK) immediately prior to the three year period.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/3">An exception is made where the three year residence requirement cannot be satisfied because the applicant or their parents have been temporarily employed or absent abroad. This provides flexibility where British nationals are not able to meet the residence requirements but have not made a long term decision to live outside the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/4">British nationals may indeed meet the temporary absence provisions, dependent upon their individual circumstances and they and their families would then be eligible for the full range of student support, including, student loans for fees and maintenance. The term temporary is not defined in regulations. A statutory definition of the term could not reflect the range of circumstances under which students and their families may find themselves temporarily abroad. We believe the fairest approach is to allow local authorities to judge each case on its individual merits.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/5">A very specific exemption from the three year residence requirement applies to armed forces personnel and their families serving abroad as a result of their special situation because they are bound by military law to accept overseas postings.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/6" class="italic">Background</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/7">The criterion of residence, rather than nationality, has been the principle of successive governments since it was introduced in the 1960's. We believe this remains a fair requirement which clearly demonstrates a substantial residential connection with the UK and recognises an economic contribution to the country. If a person lives abroad on a long term basis, it is not reasonable they should expect support for higher education, through subsidised loans, from public funds in the same way as students who reside in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/8">There are also a number of other carefully defined exceptions where a student may receive support without satisfying the normal residence requirement. In order to comply with European Union legislation, designed to ensure the free movement of workers throughout the European Economic Area, UK nationals, their spouses, civil partner, children and stepchildren, who have been working elsewhere in the European Economic Area or Switzerland and have returned to take up employment in the UK are generally eligible for support as is they had not left the UK. In order to benefit from this provision they must have been ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three years immediately preceding the start of their course.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/9">The vast majority of British nationals who choose to live and work abroad do so at their own volition. Where this is short-term the temporary absence provisions will meet their needs and they will be eligible for student support.</p>
	<p pid="c.825W.5/10">It would be not be right to open up the student loan scheme to expatriates and other British passport holders who have lived and been educated in other parts of the world and have few connections with the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.826W.2/1">The Student Finance Direct website was launched by the Student Loans Company in January 2003. The cost of the website alone cannot be given since it is an integral part of a much larger IT project. No specific targets were set for the use of the website, but it receives an estimated 1.5 million visits annually. Students and their sponsors can use the website to make on-line applications for student loans. No special activities were undertaken to promote the website or the on-line system, but references were included in our usual student finance promotional material. It is not possible to separate out the costs associated with adding these references but these would have been small.</p>

	<p pid="c.830W.8/2">The national service framework (NSF) for older people considered the range of services and support needed for older people with dementia. However, despite the significant achievements of the NSF for mental health and older people, there was agreement that there were particular challenges in delivering better mental health services for older adults.</p>
	<p pid="c.830W.8/3">As a result, in June 2005 the Department published Securing Better Mental Health for Older Adults&quot; to mark the start of a new programme bringing together mental health and older people's policy to improve services for older people with mental health needs. In early November this year, the Department will also launch a web-based service development guide for older people's mental health, the next step in improving mental health and care services for older people. The service development guide builds on the service models outlined in the NSF for older people and the principles promoted in Securing Better Mental Health for Older Adults&quot;.</p>

We also introduced the direct payments development fund, which is &pound;9 million over three years, to encourage investment in direct payments support services. In addition, we have strengthened the performance indicator to monitor the take-up of direct payments in each local council.</p>
	<p pid="c.834W.11/3">We have produced a range of user-friendly information which councils should supplement with locally appropriate information.</p>
	<p pid="c.834W.11/4">We have also consulted in our recent Green Paper, Independence, Well-being and Choice&quot;, on ways to extend the benefits of direct payments to those currently excluded, by using an agent for those without the capacity to consent, or unable to manage even with assistance.</p>
	<p pid="c.834W.11/5">We have acknowledged that our ability to increase the number of people using direct payments is limited by the barriers some people experience taking them up. Some people find that the responsibilities that come with having a direct payment are too much for them. We are piloting the introduction of individual budgets for those with assessed social care needs which will include looking at how those who receive services can be supported.</p>

	<p pid="c.839W.6/1">The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions, while specifically aimed at those with neurological conditions, is relevant for all people with long-term conditions, including lupus. The NSF addresses a range of key issues including the need for equitable access to a range of services; good quality information and support for patients and carers; the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.6/2">Addressing the training needs of health professionals is the responsibility of the appropriate regulatory bodies. They set standards for the pre-registration training of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals, approve the education institutions that provide the training and determine the curricula.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.6/3">The post-registration training needs of national health service staff are decided against local priorities, informed by local delivery plans and the needs of the service.</p>

	<p pid="c.840W.0/1">The national health service and social services provide a range of health and social care services tailored to the varying individual needs of patients with Meniere's disease, allowing them to manage their condition, maintain independence and achieve the best quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="c.840W.0/2">The NHS improvement plan has set out the Government's commitment to improve care for people with long-term conditions by moving from reactive care towards a patient-centred approach. Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts have all received the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. While the NSF is principally concerned with improving health and social care services for people with a long-term neurological condition, it will address some of the generic issues that are important to people living with other long-term conditions. The principles in the NSF apply equally to improving quality of life and promoting independent living for anyone living with a long-term condition.</p>

	<p pid="c.840W.3/1">It is not routine practice for every child with a mental illness to be seen by a psychiatrist. Many children are treated by professionals such as a psychologist, mental health nurse or primary mental health worker, often as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Individual trusts are responsible for determining their workforce needs in the light of the mix of skills of all members of the agencies and services in their area, not just child psychiatrists.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.9/2">The responsibility for handling complaints rests with the appropriate national health service primary care trust or acute trust that referred the patients to the independent treatment centre. Such complaints are handled through the NHS complaints process. The Department is not involved in the resolution of such complaints.</p>
	<p pid="c.842W.9/3">Under contract terms, the Department is required to be notified by an independent treatment centre of any complaints in relation to treatment they provide to NHS patients. To date, the Department has been notified of nine such cases since the service commenced in February 2004 and since then over 18,000 patients have been treated.</p>

Changes we are making in the national health service, such as payment by results and commissioning a patient-led NHS, will help to draw health and social care together. The national service framework for long-term conditions, issued in March this year, emphasises that rehabilitation is most effective when health and social care bodies work collaboratively with each other. The detail of which model of service best suits the needs of local people is a local matter to be determined by the NHS and social services working in partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.6/2">One of the aims of the Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, is to improve access to contraceptive and sexual health advice services for young people who are sexually active.</p>
	<p pid="c.851W.6/3">The national media campaign stresses the importance of using condoms to protect against unplanned pregnancies and STIs and highlights the availability of confidential advice for young people on sexual health issues. The campaign also includes messages on the benefits of delaying sexual activity and resisting peer pressure to have sex before they are ready.</p>
	<p pid="c.851W.6/4">Guidance on Sex and Relationships Education issued by DfES in 2000 recommends that schools should provide young people with details on how they can access services and the Government are also promoting the development of on-site health advice services in a range of non-traditional settings, such as in schools, FE colleges and Connexions Centres.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.9/2">Patients with sleep apnoea are able to access a range of national health service and social care services, tailored to meet their individual needs, to help them manage their condition. It is for health professionals in primary care organisations, in consultation with other stakeholders, to determine which services their populations require and ensure the appropriate level of provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.851W.9/3">The national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions, while specifically aimed at people with neurological conditions, is relevant for people with all long-term conditions, including sleep apnoea. The NSF addresses a range of key issues including the need for equitable access to a range of services; good quality information and support for patients and carers; the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible.</p>
