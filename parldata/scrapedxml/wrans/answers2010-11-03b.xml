This support may be used by DCLG, at its discretion, either for core project activities or to support individual FRSs. EADS wrote to DCLG in June 2010 with a detailed list of activities assigned to the contractually agreed consultancy support resource. Within this, EADS had assigned 20 consultant days worth of effort, at an average daily rate of &#163;600 in relation to preparation for and appearance at the Select Committee Inquiry hearing in February 2010. DCLG has not authorised any effort associated with this activity to be assigned consultancy support and does not agree that it falls within the scope of core project activities.

We have seen no evidence that the project is being delivered more efficiently as a result. Indeed, the move, which also involved removing access to the areas where the EADS teams work, has reduced my officials' visibility of the solution and our ability to provide the fire and rescue service with the assurance they need. Inevitably this has had a negative impact on the relationship between the Department for Communities and Local Government and EADS. It is much to be regretted.</p>

	<p pid="b.820W.3/1">All of this information is not available. The information we do have is detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/2">Initial estimates suggest that the housing benefit policies announced in the June 2010 Budget will not have a statistically significant impact on child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/3">The package of measures announced in the June Budget and being introduced for the local housing allowance in 2011-12, including the removal of the &#163;15 excess planned by the previous Administration, will achieve savings of around &#163;1 billion by 2015-16. The other changes to housing benefit announced in the June Budget are estimated to save a further &#163;1.1 billion in 2015-16. Overall, this represents a reduction of 9% in the total 2015-16 expenditure on housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/4">The reduction in housing benefit expenditure will reduce the amount customers receive from the Government towards their rent. However, the purpose of reform is to influence rent levels and housing choices, as well as to begin to address the disincentives to work in the current system created by high rates of benefit. These factors are likely, at least in part, to mitigate the impact of these measures on poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/5">Also, the impact of the housing benefit measures should not be considered in isolation of the wider package of measures that have been announced, in particular the extra money distributed to families with children through the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-23">23 July</phrase>, the Department published a document on 'Impacts of Housing Benefit proposals: Changes to the Local Housing Allowance to be introduced in 2011-12', which includes detailed analysis of the impacts of the June Budget measures at the local authority level. A copy of the document has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.3/7">Initial estimates suggest that the proposed benefit cap will not have a statistically significant effect on child poverty; the policy will affect relatively few households who already have a substantial income from benefit compared to the poverty line.</p>

	<p pid="b.833W.6/1">There have been no prosecutions under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 reported to the Ministry of Justice for England and Wales, from its introduction in March 2004, up to the end of 2009 (latest available).</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.6/2">The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 is intended to help to prevent this unacceptable practice from happening in the first place. Research suggests a number of barriers to prosecution, including pressure from the family or wider community, lead to cases going unreported. Despite the lack of prosecutions to date, the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 provides a clear message that female genital mutilation is an unacceptable practice and illegal in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.6/3">A range of guidance has been issued to heighten awareness among all relevant professionals. The Home Office issued guidance to all chief officers of police in England and Wales on the investigation of cases of female genital mutilation when the Act came into force in 2004. The Association of Chief Police Officers incorporated female genital mutilation in guidance for police forces which was revised and reissued in 2008. The Crown Prosecution Service included female genital mutilation in its Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Domestic Violence, which was disseminated to all prosecutors by the end of 2008. This was accompanied by a modular training package which has been rolled out to all CPS areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.6/4">The Government appointed a cross government female genital mutilation coordinator in September 2009 and a number of initiatives have been implemented to improve the Government response to tackling female genital mutilation. Most recently, the Home Office, in partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department of Health and Department for Education, have developed draft Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines to assist practitioners handling cases of female genital mutilation. These guidelines are open for consultation at:</p>

	<p pid="b.833W.6/6">Following consideration of responses, we hope to publish these guidelines in spring 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.833W.6/7">Court proceedings data for 2010 are planned for publication in 2011.</p>

As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br/> It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br/> 2.

The Department for Education's allocation in 2010-11 is &#163;3,357,000. This funding is delivered to local authorities through the Area Based Grant mechanism, which was subject to a reduction of 23.96% following a departmental wide &#163;670 million savings exercise earlier in this financial year.

	<p pid="b.841W.5/1">I have met with both the CWU and Unite to discuss Royal Mail matters. Government have been clear that their policy for ownership of Royal Mail is to enable a sale of shares in the company in order to secure the future of both Royal Mail and the universal postal service, and as part of this to make available 10% of the equity for employees as part of the privatisation process. This was set out in the policy statement that we published alongside introduction of the Postal Services Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-13">13 October</phrase> &quot;Delivering for the future-a universal mail service and community post offices in the digital age&quot;.

	<p pid="b.841W.5/3">Neither the CWU nor Unite have raised with Government the possibility of either a mutualisation or employee buy out for Royal Mail. However, a mutualisation or employee-led buy out of Royal Mail is unlikely to give it the access to the commercial confidence and disciplines of private investors that it needs to allow the company to modernise faster and keep pace with the changes in the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.850W.0/2">We deeply regret all civilian casualties. Protecting the Afghan civilian population is a cornerstone of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)'s mission, and all British troops undergo comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement. Where incidents do occur, procedures are in place to ensure they are promptly reported to the chain of command and follow-up actions take place in accordance with ISAF and UK national procedures. This contrasts directly with the attitude of the insurgents, whose indiscriminate use of suicide bombs, roadside explosive devices and human shields cause the majority of civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan. We will continue our efforts to prevent insurgents harming civilians and to develop the capacity of Afghan security forces to protect the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.0/3">The records relating to the follow-up actions taken following these incidents are not held centrally by the Department and will take time to identify. I will write to the hon. Member once work has been completed.</p>

The precise number of tanks which will be taken out of service will be determined by further, more detailed work into the overall fleet requirement, taking into account factors such as the withdrawal from Germany, revised fleet management options and updated training requirements.</p>

Initial Gate seeks approval to undertake the detailed development and an assessment of available options to meet a capability gap. Following Initial Gate projects seek Main Gate approval to proceed with the demonstration and manufacture of their recommended option. Main Gate is the major investment decision, whereas Initial Gate ensures that only projects which meet a requirement and are likely to be deliverable are allowed to continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.853W.1/1">We remain absolutely committed to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme, which will provide a world-beating aircraft, able to operate from both the sea and land, ideally suited for our future capability needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.1/2">In the first instance, we intend to buy enough JSF aircraft to build up our carrier strike capability, and to operate a balanced fleet of JSF and Typhoon aircraft in the medium to long term. We will confirm the exact number of aircraft in our initial buy at the time of our main investment decision, in line with usual practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.1/3">The decision to purchase the Carrier Variant offers advantages in terms of interoperability with allies, range, and pay load and through life costs over the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant, and we are seeking to minimise any delay resulting from the change of variant. We will bring JSF into service, initially in the land environment, and then to deliver a carrier strike capability from around 2020. The aircraft will be equipped with a range of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, the exact mix of which will be optimised to reflect the operational requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.853W.1/4">We have previously committed to purchasing three JSF which will be used for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. No further orders have been placed. Our changed plans will not therefore incur cancellation costs to the Department. We currently assess that the decision to procure the Carrier Variant will reduce the forecast cost of the JSF programme since the Carrier Variant is likely to be cheaper both to procure and to support through life than the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant, which we had previously been planning to buy. The cost of each aircraft depends on when in the overall production programme it is bought and will vary according to a number of factors, such as other partner nations' procurement plans. We do not routinely reveal the forecast cost of future programmes in order to protect the Department's position in commercial negotiations.</p>

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) received over 6,000 responses from MPs, members of the armed forces, public servants within and beyond defence, industry, academics, and the public. The MOD also engaged a wide variety of external organisations during the SDSR including NATO, principal UK and international think tanks and academic institutes, NGOs, industry organisations, and service veterans' and families' organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.856W.2/3">The Department did not ask those individuals or organisations whether they would be content for their names to be published, and therefore does not intend to release them.</p>

NHS Cancer Screening Programmes has commissioned research to examine if more can be done to raise awareness of this right.</p>

Following publication of the outcome of the SCR review a letter was sent by officials to each primary care trust (PCT) highlighting that any information added to a patient's SCR over and above the core information should only be done with the explicit consent of the patient. Where additional information has already been added to patients' SCRs, patient consent must be confirmed for the additional information to be retained. Where the explicit consent of the patient is not confirmed, PCTs will advise general practitioner practices to amend the SCR to hold only core information.</p>

	<p pid="b.874W.2/1">The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises Ministers and the national health service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy. The UK NSC reviewed the policy for screening for group b streptococcus (GBS) carriage in pregnancy in 2009 and concluded that the evidence did not support its introduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.874W.2/2">The UK NSC commissioned a clinical and cost effectiveness study comparing different approaches to GBS. The health technology assessment took this work forward on behalf of the UK NSC and published the results in 2007. The main conclusion was that there was considerable uncertainty on the most effective approach to GBS. The study results were considered during the policy review.</p>
