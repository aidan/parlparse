	<p pid=".17W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-19">19 June</phrase>, coalition aircraft conducted routine patrols over the Northern No-Fly Zone over Iraq. During these patrols, aircrews came under multiple attack by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. On this occasion, no coalition ordnance was released in self-defence. In fact, all coalition aircraft involved in the patrols returned to base safely and all of their ordnance has been accounted for.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.3/2">Saddam Hussein's propaganda machine yet again has made completely false claims. The Iraqis have asserted that, during these patrols, coalition aircraft attacked civilian targets when in fact, the evidence suggests that his own air defence system was responsible. The US Defence Department has stated that it has good reason to believe that one of the missiles fired at coalition aircrew may have returned to earth in the area where the casualties are alleged to have occurred.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.0/1">It is my normal policy to do so. However, we have always made it clear that in relation to party political peers, the Appointments Commission was taking over the role formerly fulfilled by the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee. It was never the custom that appointments to the Lords to enable someone to take up ministerial office should be subject to scrutiny by that Committee. I have also decided, after consultation with the House of Lords Appointments Commission, that a limited number of holders of very high office may be recommended direct to the Queen by me.</p>

	<p pid=".28W.3/1">I can announce that a new review will commence this month and is expected to report its findings at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/2">Its Terms of Reference are:</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/3">To assess the value of a cleaner coal demonstration plant from four key perspectives:</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/4" class="indent">1. It will specifically take account of the relative benefits and costs, in comparison to other sustainable energy technologies, arising from the use of cleaner coal plant for power generation in the UK to:</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/5" class="indent">Support the Government's climate changes policy objectives through the reduction of CO <sub>2</sub> emissions in the longer term and assessing the potential for CO <sub>2</sub> capture and sequestration.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/6" class="indent">The contribution it would make to the overall energy policy objectives of the Government &quot;to ensure secure, diverse and sustainable supplies of energy at competitive prices&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/7" class="indent">2. It will complement other ongoing work looking at energy choices in the context of the need to make substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the longer term. Within the context of using coal for power generation, such choices should not only cover cleaner coal plant but also alternative means for extracting the energy from coal, e.g. underground coal gasification.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/8" class="indent">3. It will consider the four main technical options currently available, each of these will be assessed in the review to determine which is the most appropriate both in terms of value for money and environmental impact. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/9" class="indent">Retrofitting cleaner coal technology components to existing combustion plants.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/10" class="indent">Retrofitting coal gasification plant to older combined cycle stations.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/11" class="indent">New build of supercritical or coal gasification on a brown field site.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/12" class="indent">Cleaner coal plant with CO <sub>2</sub> capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/13" class="indent">4. It will determine the feasibility of a demonstration project/programme in terms of:</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/14" class="indent">Value for money in terms of promoting the wider use of cleaner coal generation plant including benefits to the UK economy and the potential for export sales.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/15" class="indent">The various types of plant amenable to clean coal technology.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/16" class="indent">The cost per tonne of carbon saved, compared to other sustainable technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/17" class="indent">The emerging evidence on the viability, security, environmental impact and acceptability of capture and storage technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/18" class="indent">The impact which overseas support schemes have actually had for cleaner coal plant, particularly in the United States, EC and Japan.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.3/19" class="indent">State aid issues.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.5/1">The DTI will continue to ensure that administrative burdens associated with necessary regulation to protect the interests of consumers and citizens and to provide decent minimum standards for workers are minimised. The regulatory impact appraisal (RIA) process was changed in 2000 to require that administrative and policy costs should be separately identified, enabling us to concentrate on minimising the cost of the administration associated with regulation. Where it is shown to us that administration is excessive, we will reduce it, as we did with the Working Time Regulations in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.5/2">The new Regulatory Reform Act will play a vital role in the Government's drive to reform outdated, overlapping and over-burdensome regulation. The Labour Party's Business Manifesto commits the Government to use the new Order-making power in the Act to bring forward a programme of regulatory reform initiatives involving all the key Government Departments. A list of 51 examples of reforms that could be achieved by this means is available from the Libraries of the House, and on the Cabinet Office website.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.3/1">The Government have an extensive programme of action to reduce the pay gap between men and women. This gap has reduced from 37 per cent. when the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970, to 18 per cent. now. We are taking steps to make the legislation work better, by making equal pay claims quicker and easier. We are working with the Equal Opportunities Commission, employers and trade unions to develop voluntary equal pay reviews. The EOC has received an extra &pound;100,000 to take this forward. The Government are committed to equal pay for its own staff. All Departments and Government agencies must undertake reviews and prepare equal pay action plans within two years. We are introducing Castle Awards to recognise employers' excellence in promoting equal opportunities and pay, and have appointed fair pay champions from a range of backgrounds to promote the issues. We also have a number of initiatives in place to address the underlying causes of the pay gap. These include tackling gender stereotyping in education, removing barriers to women's employment in traditionally male industries such as ICT and encouraging employers to take measures which allow parents to combine work and raising a family. In April of this year, the Government appointed Denise Kingsmill to lead an independent review into Women's Employment and Pay. This review will report in the autumn, and the Government will then consider what additional action is required to make further progress.</p>

Nine sight-impaired people were recruited as Justices of the Peace to the Commission areas of Leicestershire, Devon, North East London, Wiltshire, Humberside and Manchester. Each was appointed after having met the normal selection criteria and completed the training. The responses from those who have worked with the sight-impaired magistrates have shown that each one of them has made a positive and valuable contribution to the work of their Benches. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is therefore removing, forthwith, the bar to appointment of sight-impaired applicants as Justices of the Peace.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.7/20">The recorded crime statistics for the 12 months to March 2000 show that Surrey had the second lowest number of crimes per 100,000 population in England and Wales. However, a boundary change involving Surrey and Metropolitan police forces took place on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>, when Surrey took on some areas from the Metropolitan police. Figures for Surrey before and after that date are therefore not directly comparable. By excluding the boundary effect (i.e. by assuming these areas were policed by the Metropolitan police throughout the period), the increase in overall crime in Surrey in the 12 months to September 2000 compared with the 12 months to September 1999 is an estimated 3 per cent. The Government are committed to reducing all crime, including violent crime, and to tackling the causes of crime, ensuring proper punishment of those who break the law and providing the resources necessary to tackle crime. Although there continues to be an increase in the number of violent crimes recorded by the police, the rate of increase is slowing down and crime overall has fallen under this Government. The British Crime Survey, which is widely accepted as the most authoritative source of information on the real rates of crime, indicates that violent crime has been falling since 1995, and reduced by 4 per cent. between 1997 and 1999, the latest date for which figures are available.</p>

	<p pid=".42W.2/1">Proposals to proceed with the relocation of the Home Office, including the Prison Service, to a new development on the site of the former Department of the Environment offices at Marsham street, where outline planning consent exists for a mixed office, residential and commercial development, were announced in July last year. Contract negotiations for developing the Marsham street site as a public-private partnership project are currently in progress with Anne's Gate Property plc, the preferred bidder.</p>
	<p pid=".42W.2/2">The City of Westminster resolved in February to grant detailed planning consent subject to completion of a planning agreement. That has been successfully negotiated and the formal agreement was signed earlier this month. Provided detailed contract terms can be agreed between the Home Office and the preferred bidder, a start on demolishing the old Department of the Environment offices is planned for later this year. The new development is intended to house the majority of Home Office and Her Majesty's Prison Service staff currently based in central London.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the implications of sentencing are explained in open court. The then Lord Chief Justice issued a practice direction in January 1998 requiring a court imposing a custodial sentence to explain the practical effect of that sentence for the benefit of the defendant, any victim and members of the public. Although the practice direction was issued before home detention curfew became available, it makes clear that any future changes to early release arrangements should be reflected in the court's explanation. We will consider whether any legislative requirement is necessary in the context of proposals emerging from the review of the Sentencing Framework.</p>
