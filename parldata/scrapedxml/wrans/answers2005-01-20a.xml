	<p pid="a.1047W.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-04">4 January 2005</phrase> the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) issued a letter to more than 300 organisations and individuals announcing a formal consultation exercise and inviting comments on the draft Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005 and associated guidance notes which set out revised controls on veterinary medicines. The new Regulations are intended to implement amendments to EU legislation, carry forward some recommendations of the recent Marsh and Competition Commission Reports on the supply of veterinary prescription only medicines, and to simplify and consolidate existing UK legislative provisions which are currently contained in the Medicines Act 1968 and some 50 statutory instruments. It is proposed to replace these with a single set of Regulations containing all the provisions, which will come into force at the end of October 2005 to comply with the timetable for implementing the amended EU requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.6/2">The formal consultation exercise follows a series of informal consultation meetings held during the summer and autumn of 2004 with a wide range of organisations at which various aspects of the proposals were discussed. The full consultation package, comprising draft Regulations, 18 draft guidance notes and a draft partial Regulatory Impact Assessment is available on the VMD's website (<a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk">www.vmd.gov.uk</a>) under &quot;consultations&quot; &quot;current&quot;. It is also available from the VMD on CD-ROM or as a paper copy on request. In view of the volume of the package and the wide scope of the Regulations, four months, rather than the standard 12 weeks, is being allowed for comments, which are required by <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.6/3">The key changes contained in the proposals include provisions to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.6/4" class="indent">improve the clarity of the requirements;</p>
	<p pid="a.1047W.6/5" class="indent">disapply the Medicines Act 1968 from the regulation of veterinary medicines;</p>

	<p pid="a.1048W.2/1">A key source of mercury waste arises from the chlor-alkali industry. Annual figures for the three UK mercury cell chlor-alkali plants for the years in question are set out in table 1. Large amounts of mercury will no longer be required when mercury cell plants are decommissioned, although this mercury is pure enough to be re-used without further treatment. Mercury can be present in waste arising from a range of other industries, including from power generation, and mining activities, although there are no aggregated national figures available for these. Mercury is also present in used dental amalgam, some forms of lighting equipment, certain thermometers, thermostats, manometers, some batteries, switches and relays, although the use in all these applications is declining. Implementation of the WEEE Directive and the hazardous waste regulations should encourage the greater recovery and recycling of mercury from these sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.1051W.10/1">Under the Gambling Bill grandfather rights will be granted to all current proprietors of amusement arcade establishments that offer gaming machines under part III of the 1968 Gaming Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051W.10/2">Where existing arcade premises offer what will become known as category D gaming machines, they will become entitled to receive a family entertainment centre gaming machine permit. Where existing premises offer a mixture of category C and category D gaming machines, they will need to apply for, and be granted an operating licence from the Gambling Commission, and they will be entitled to receive a family entertainment centre premises licence from their local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051W.10/3">In all cases, the existing operator will need to apply for the necessary permit or licences, and to pay a fee. In the case of the family entertainment centre gaming machine permit and the family entertainment centre premises licence the grandfather rights mean that the local authority must grant these applications. They will have no power to reject the applications, or to impose conditions which alter the existing rights of the operator. However, all gaming machines must comply with the Bill's requirements on which category of machine may be used (from A to D), and the stakes and prizes for each.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051W.10/4">Once grandfathered, the permits or licences will operate in the same manner as any new permit or licence. Therefore, there is no enduring duration of the grandfather rights. For example, should an operator breach the terms of a licence, the Gambling Commission will be able to review it, and may impose a penalty, including the revocation of the licence. The permits have a ten year duration, and that applies to grandfathered permits also.</p>

	<p pid="a.1058W.2/1">The Article I-16 obligations referred to in the question are in substance the same as those first set out in Article J.1 (4) of the Maastricht treaty (currently Article 11(2) TEU). As under the Maastricht treaty and the treaty on European Union, member states are under the constitutional treaty required to comply in good faith with their treaty obligations, including those relating to the common foreign and security policy mentioned in Article I-16. Any consequences which might follow if a member state failed to fulfil its obligations would depend on the circumstances. But the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is excluded from common foreign and security policy issues by Article III-376.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070W.9/2">For the Thames Gateway, as elsewhere, planning policies for affordable housing (which includes social housing) are currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 : &quot;Housing&quot; and in Circular 6/98, &quot;Planning for Affordable Housing&quot;. They advise that where local planning authorities are able to demonstrate a lack of affordable housing to meet local needs, based on up-to-date surveys and other data of local need, they should indicate in their local plan how many affordable homes need to be provided throughout the plan area, and set indicative targets for specific suitable sites (expressed either as numbers of homes or a percentage of the homes on the site).</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/3">In London the Mayor is responsible for preparing the spatial development strategy (SDS), also known as the London Plan. In the remaining eight English regions, regional planning bodies (RPBs) are responsible for developing regional spatial strategies (RSSs). RSSs and the SDS should be developed in line with national planning policy. The principal role of the RSS/SDS is to serve as a strategic planning framework for the region, with which local development frameworks produced by local planning authorities must be in conformity. This may include indicative targets for the delivery of affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/4">The Thames Gateway is covered by the Mayor of London, and the two RPBs, the east of England regional assembly and south east England regional assembly. In August 2004, these three bodies published an interregional planning statement, to act as a co-ordinated planning strategy for the Thames Gateway sub-region. While it is a non- statutory document, it provides the regional partners with an agreed strategy and should inform the development of regional plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070W.9/5">The London Plan, published in February 2004, set an affordability target of 50 per cent. for new developments. Regional spatial strategies for the south east of England and the east of England regions are currently under review. At present neither existing RSS sets a target for affordable housing. An anticipated target of 30 per cent. was put forward in the interregional planning statement. The draft RSS revision for the east of England contains a policy providing an affordability target of 30 per cent.</p>

Total overseas development assistance to water supply and sanitation from the EC in 2001 was allocated as follows: Africa 79 per cent., Latin America and Caribbean 15 per cent., Oceania 6 per cent. (this is based on a five-year moving average).</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.5/2">The European Union (including 25 member state plus the European Commission) is the largest donor overall and the largest donor in the water sector in Africa, committing some &euro;1.4 billion each year. The priority of water has been increased in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, with the establishment of the EU-ACP Water Facility (&euro;250 million available this year).</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.5/3">Obtaining comparable figures is difficult because different donors use different criteria to calculate support to the water sector or track support within multi sector projects. Figures may also include or exclude related issues such as water resources management or concessional loans. The UK is working with the EU Water Initiative Finance Working Group to improve the tracking of aid flows in the water sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1075W.2/1">EU funds for aid are allocated by the Commission on the basis of priorities set out by developing countries in Country Strategy Papers. The Department for International Development (DFID) is represented on all committees at which these papers are discussed and agreed and works with others to ensure aid is spent as effectively as possible to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including those on access to water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.2/2">Within African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, DFID is represented on the board of the European Development Fund (EOF) and has been involved in establishing the ACP-EU Water Facility. The Water Facility makes provision for &euro;250 million this year, from the unspent funds of the EDF, for catalytic projects in the sector that are able to leverage greater finance flows and accelerate progress toward the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075W.2/3">DFID are also supporting the EU Water Initiative. The EU Water Initiative, through an Africa Component are working with the African Ministerial Council on Water and other stakeholders in Africa on increasing the priority being given to water and sanitation in poverty reduction or national development strategies, on improving strategic planning in the sector and on improving donor coordination. This will ensure that existing money is better spent and that a clearer demand for work in the sector is articulated to which donors (including the EU) may respond with increased aid commitments under the 2002 Monterrey Consensus principles of demand led assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078W.2/1">The Met Office does not itself issue flood warnings, but provides information and services to the Environment Agency in support of their responsibility to issue flood warnings in England and Wales. It provides similar support to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. A more restricted severe weather service has been commissioned by and is therefore provided to the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.2/2">As the National Met Service for the United Kingdom, the Met Office has a responsibility for warning the citizens of the UK of severe weather events. Severe weather warnings are issued when it is judged there is a possible danger to life and property, or when disruption to transport is possible. Two types of warnings are issued. Flash warnings are typically issued three to six hours ahead of a predicted event and early warnings are issued up to five days ahead of a forecast event. These warnings are made available to the public via a range of media (including national television and radio) and to other Government bodies and agencies who have a responsibility for the protection of life, property and infrastructure. During 2004 a total of 406 severe weather warnings were issued. The Met Office records for 2004 indicate that some 87 per cent. of severe weather events occurring in the UK were preceded by a severe weather warning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.2/3">The funding for the National Severe Weather Service is provided by the Cabinet Office and devolved administrations. In the current financial year, the funding available to the Met Office for this service is &pound;2.02 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.6/2">CICA expects to receive about 70,000 new applications in 2004&ndash;05, and to resolve approaching the same number, though many of the cases so resolved would have been lodged in previous years.</p>

As we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December</phrase>, the Home Office is considering a package of measures working with the Department for Education and Skills and the Association of Chief Police Officers. We are focusing on analysis of information, tackling the knife culture, especially among young people, community involvement and strengthening legislation. The measures under consideration include: raising the minimum age for purchasing a knife to 18; adding new categories of knife now being used in crime to the list of banned offensive weapons; providing a power to require specified licensed premises to search for an offensive weapon on entry; giving head teachers a new power to search pupils for knives; pulling together best practice from initiatives and schemes focusing on knife crime and developing local crime reduction and enforcement strategies on dealing with the carrying of knives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1088W.6/1">The UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families is not compatible with the Government's immigration policies. For example, most overseas nationals coming to the UK to take employment require a work permit. The UK employer applies for a work permit to enable them to fill a specific vacancy in the UK, following which the worker applies for leave to enter or remain in the UK. If the migrant worker leaves this employment they are expected to leave the UK or to apply for a work permit for their new employment. The Convention, however, would allow them to remain in the UK for the duration of their leave, whether or not they were still employed. We consider that unemployed migrants being able to remain in the UK and claim benefits in these circumstances would act as an unnecessary &quot;pull factor&quot; and undermine current immigration controls.</p>

	<p pid="a.1091W.3/1">Last June, the Council concluded that any Community instrument in the fields of nuclear installation safety or the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel should be developed only following a process of consultation involving stakeholders and should take account of future developments in the international arena running through at least into 2006. Last December, the Working Party on Atomic Questions adopted an Action Plan for implementing these Council Conclusions. It envisages a programme of activities for the member states, acting individually or collectively, linked to the standards-making work of the IAEA, the peer review processes of the relevant international Conventions and the efforts to harmonise regulatory approaches currently being undertaken by Europe's national nuclear safety authorities. At their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January</phrase>, experts considered ways in which this work should be carried forward with a view to identifying what, if any, further action at EU level might be helpful in order to improve nuclear safety. At this stage, it is not clear what source documents will be considered although the Health and Safety Executive's expert intends to draw the Working Party's attention to the United Kingdom's third national report for the Convention on Nuclear Safety. This is available on the DTI's website. We expect that the Presidency will ensure that the Working Party's report is published on the EU's Europa website. Early indications suggest that the Presidency hopes to have an interim report ready in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1097W.2/7">The Agency is actively engaged in resolving these problems, and has established a debt management transformation programme.

	<p pid="a.1097W.2/8">Likewise, NIAO considered that there was considerable uncertainty over the encashment control creditor balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097W.2/9">The Agency believes that much more reliance can be placed on the creditor balance. This is because benefit payments &quot;issued&quot; are recorded by the programme accounting computer system and the actual encashments of these payments are either reconciled by the Agency or agreed with the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097W.2/10">The difference between payments issued less those encashed is represented by the creditor balance and so the Agency concludes that, although a customer breakdown of the total is unavailable, the balance itself is actually robust.</p>

In line with its undertaking to maintain employment in the area, the Royal Brompton and Harefield National Health Service Trust's plans for the Harefield site include the facilitation of a science park on that location following the move of the hospital's work to the campus. The estimated value of the Royal Brompton hospital site within the outline business case is &pound;94.5 million. It is currently planned that, with the appropriate approvals, land sales from the Royal Brompton and Harefield and St. Mary's NHS Trusts will fund the cost of the proposed land acquisition and other capital commitments of the Paddington Health Campus. The construction cost of the Campus is assessed as &pound;789 million at current prices, exclusive of value added tax and inflation. The estimated value of the Royal Brompton hospital represents 12 per cent., of the estimated construction cost of the campus.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126W.0/24">4. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126W.0/25">5. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
