	<p pid="a.928W.0/1">An annual survey of vehicle operators carried out by the Department for Transport indicates that there are almost 80,000 public service vehicles operating in Great Britain. These comprise a range of vehicles, including minibuses, full size buses and coaches. Vehicle size, age, carrying capacity and type of operation will dictate which of these must meet the requirements of the public service vehicle accessibility regulations. This makes it impossible accurately to determine what percentage of public service vehicles are currently required to comply with the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.928W.0/2">Nevertheless, the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) carried out prior to the introduction of the PSV accessibility regulations predicted future changes in bus fleet composition, including reduced numbers of double deck buses and increased numbers of minibuses. It was estimated that by the time of full compliance, i.e. 2017 for buses and 2020 for coaches, almost 53,000 buses will fall within the scope of regulations, representing towards 95 per cent. of the bus fleet capacity at that time. Numbers of coaches were more difficult to predict but the RIA estimated that 1,250 vehicles would fall within the scope of regulations. This is likely to represent 5 per cent. of the total coach fleet in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.928W.0/3">However, the Department is currently discussing with industry whether it might be possible to extend the scope of regulations to include coaches used on tour services. If vehicles operated in this way were brought within scope of the regulations, this would result in a far greater proportion of accessible coaches in the fleet.</p>

	<p pid="a.929W.0/1">The most recent projected cost of the fitting-out of the St. Pancras Midland Road station is approximately &pound;60 million (at 2003&ndash;04 prices) which includes the fitting out, rail systems alterations and client costs required to make the station operational. This figure may change depending, for example, on future decisions on the scope and programme for the works.</p>

	<p pid="a.930W.3/1">Academies are registered independent schools. Like all independent schools, they are not bound by the legislation which requires teachers in maintained schools to register with the General Teaching Council for England (GTC), which is the professional regulating body for teachers in the maintained sector. However, as the vast majority of teachers within academies will have moved across from the maintained sector, most will already be registered with the council and are likely to remain so. We will be writing shortly to academies to clarify this issue and will certainly encourage them to continue to register existing staff with the council. Ultimately, however, this is a matter for individual teachers to decide.</p>

The 10-year science and innovation investment framework, published jointly by Treasury, the Department for Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Skills last July, sets out a range of new measures to address the problem. These cover all phases of education from schools through to higher education. In addition, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills wrote to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) at the beginning of December asking their advice on what types of action should be considered to strengthen and secure subjects of strategic national importance, including mathematics and science.</p>

	<p pid="a.939W.2/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer attends the ECOFIN formation of the Council of Ministers. One policy that benefits the Clwyd, South constituency is Structural Funds and Cohesion Policy, agreed as part of the EU budget. At ECOFIN, the UK has consistently argued both that the overall EU budget should be constrained, and focused on value for money, and also that spending should provide a good budgetary deal for the UK. In the current Financial Perspective, part of my hon. Friend's constituency is included in the west Wales and the valleys area, for which the Government secured objective 1 status at the Berlin European Council in 1999. The outcome also included funding through objective 3, which applies in the parts of Clwyd, South not covered by objective 1, and objective 2 which also applies in some parts of Clwyd, South. Based on this, in subsequent spending reviews, the Treasury has made available extra allocations, outside the Barnett formula, for the Welsh Objective 1 programmes, including in the 2004 Spending Review &pound;106 million for 2005&ndash;06, &pound;128 million for 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;147 million for 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.939W.2/2">This has allowed the Objective 1 programme so far, for example, to commit &pound;1 billion to 1,300 projects reporting the creation and safeguarding of some 84,000gross jobs. This funding, together with other Government policies, has helped to support the Clwyd, South economy, to reduce unemployment from 1,422 in 1997 to 1,058 in 2000 and to 752 now&mdash;overall, since May 1997, claimant unemployment has fallen by 48 per cent., while long-term unemployment and long-term youth unemployment have fallen by 88 and 81 per cent. respectively.</p>

In the course of achieving their objectives, however, neither Department separately identifies inspection or enforcement activity, with the exception of the law enforcement work of HM Customs and Excise. This focuses on the management of risks to society that arise from the illegal importation of prohibited or restricted goods such as class A drugs, firearms or paedophile material. It is not therefore possible to provide the information requested on costs of inspection and enforcement activities for 1996&ndash;97 and 2003&ndash;04, although more information on the activities of HM Customs and Excise and of the Inland Revenue and the administrative costs of running the Departments, including the costs to HM Customs and Excise of working to reduce crime and drug dependency and on investment in compliance activity in the Inland Revenue, can be found in their annual reports and accounts.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.0/2">Where a 2003&ndash;04 or 2004&ndash;05 tax credit award includes an element of help towards the cost of child care, the Inland Revenue has contacted child care providers to verify the details that have been provided by the claimant.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.0/3">In 2003&ndash;04, the Department contacted around 215,000 child care providers to check information and so far in 2004&ndash;05 they have contacted around 251,000 providers. Wherever possible, the Department sends a single, composite inquiry covering all the claims in which the child care provider features.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.0/4">Unlike the previous tax credits, the amount of help towards child care is not fixed for the duration of the award. The new tax credit system is designed to respond to changes in circumstances and where people alter their child care arrangements the amount of tax credits they receive may be adjusted to ensure they continue to receive the right amount of money. Claimants are required to tell the Inland Revenue within three months where the amount they pay for child care falls by &pound;10 per week or more. Other changes can be reported when finalising the claim after the end of the tax year, although the Inland Revenue encourages claimants to report changes as and when they happen to avoid over and under payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.944W.2/2">This information is not available from our statistics. DFID tends to support integrated HIV/AIDS programmes and it is therefore difficult to break down support for HIV/AIDS prevention as distinct from treatment and care activities. Also, our support to voluntary organisations takes three forms (direct support to UK-based organisations through our Civil Society Challenge Fund, direct support to local organisations through our country programmes and Partnership Programme Agreements) only the first of which can be readily disaggregated in the way requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.944W.2/3">We support 18 major UK voluntary organisations through Partnership Programme Agreements. These are strategic level agreements based on shared aims and specific outcomes rather than individual project activities. It is therefore not possible for us to apportion support to HIV/AIDS activities. However the majority of these organisations do have an agreed outcome specifically targeted at HIV/AIDS. The level of our support for Partnership Programme Agreements has increased from &pound;47 million to &pound;62.5 million over the past five years.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-28a.218819.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-28a.948W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="948W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/text/50228w11.htm#50228w11.html_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.948W.6/1">Spot wholesale gas prices have risen due to a number of factors: tighter gas markets as production from the North Sea declines and the UK becomes a net importer of gas, and high-fossil fuel prices driving higher gas prices on the Continent, which feed into UK prices via the gas interconnector. On the forward market, there is also a fair amount of 'market sentiment' about tightness of supply over the next two winters as we move towards more import dependency. The Ofgem Price Probe, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-05">5 October 2004</phrase>, also attributed these reasons for the price movements over the previous year, and the concurrent Financial Services Authority investigation into gas prices in autumn 2003 found no evidence of market abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.6/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met representatives of the energy intensive sectors of industry before Christmas and has asked officials to work with them to develop ideas for improving the operation of the forward gas market. My Department has also commissioned an independent consultant to analyse the current operation of the UK gas forward market and to identify the underlying causes of high forward prices for the next two winters.</p>
	<p pid="a.948W.6/3">The Government are working to ensure that the right framework is in place to allow the market to deliver sufficient quantities of gas at competitive prices. This is already happening, as major new import projects come forward, due to come on-stream over the next 3 years. The Government are also encouraging the European Commission to ensure prompt and full implementation of the second EU liberalisation package, which will contribute to the development of more competitive markets across Europe.</p>

This information is not available at constituency level. The Small Business Service (SBS) was set up as an agency of the Department of Trade and Industry in April 2000. Contracts were exchanged with a national network of 45 Business Link Operators (seven in the North West) to provide Business Support to small and medium sized enterprises from April 2001. Before this date Government support to businesses was provided through Training and Enterprise Councils and the Small Business Service does not have access to this data.</p>
	<p pid="a.952W.0/2">The type of assistance provided by the Business Link Operator includes pre-starts, start up advice, intensive assistance, IT support and Investors in People.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.4/2">The only dedicated element of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps is its Headquarters, which is currently training as a High Readiness Force (Land) HQ. This involves exercising as a Corps and Land Component Headquarters for generic multinational deployments on warfighting and peace support operations. From April 2005 HQ ARRC will begin preparation for an expected deployment to Afghanistan in 2006 to lead the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). On present plans, HQ ARRC's ISAF training will involve two self contained Command Post exercises, periods of individual and collective military training and the NATO pre-operational directed training package. In addition, HQ ARRC will continue to support the training of UK formations, including the UK elements of the NATO Response Force throughout this period.</p>

	<p pid="a.955W.7/3">The remit of the APA is to bring prosecutions under military law against British Army personnel in UK or abroad. Once a case has been referred to the APA, he has the power to determine, prefer or amend an appropriate charge, conduct court martial proceedings or discontinue proceedings on any charge. He also has the power to delegate any of his functions to a suitable qualified officer appointed by him. When exercising his prosecution function, the APA is subject to the general superintendence of the Attorney-General and is independent of the Chain of Command. There is no difference in these matters between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.961W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence currently employs 519 military personnel, 61 UK based civil servants and 1,038 locally employed civilians in Gibraltar. It was announced last week that, in line with Government policy to obtain best value for defence from the tax payer's money, we are implementing in Gibraltar the current UK and overseas best practice model for delivering facilities management. This involves outsourcing all the activities of the Gibraltar Defence Estates and the Joint Logistic Unit (except laundry and Motor Transport Engineering which are subject to separate efficiency proposals). Some two military, five UK based civilian and 296 locally employed civilian posts fall within the scope of the contract and are likely to transfer to the successful contractor. In addition to this initiative, a review of the supply of support services (eg janitorial, catering and motor transport) is also underway. The review team has yet to report, but a reduction of about 70&ndash;90 posts is likely if an in-house option is secured. If not, up to 300 posts could be contractorised.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/2">In addition, the Defence Communications and Services Agency (DCSA) in Gibraltar is also undertaking a review of its structure to improve effectiveness. It is planned that the DCSA will reduce the total number of staff and change the balance of employee types in favour of locally employed civilians. This is separate from the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) initiative, which is due to impact on Gibraltar in 2007&ndash;08 and could lead to further outsourcing proposals. The DII initiative will replace our current administrative IT system. It is too early to assess what the impact will be, but up to 10 posts may beaffected. As with all organisations, the MOD in Gibraltar will change and adapt to reflect an evolving defence need and the most effective way of delivering it.</p>

	<p pid="a.970W.2/1">In May 2003 Human Rights Watch estimated that there were at least 290,000 people missing in Iraq and stated</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.2/2" class="indent">the answer to their whereabouts likely lies in these graves&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.2/3">USAID is quoted as estimating in January this year that there are between 260 and 270 mass graves in Iraq and they estimate that between 300,000 and 400,000 people are buried in them. More recent estimates of the number of mass graves have revised the figure downward to 187. The final figure will not be known until all the graves have been completely exhumed. The figures we have used are the best estimates available to us at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.2/4">We are working with the authorities in Iraq and in co-ordination with the United Nations to establish a national centre for missing persons and exhumations policy in Baghdad. It will provide the forensic and social expertise to manage the sensitive task of helping reunite families with the remains of their lost relatives and provide forensic evidence to support prosecutions of those who perpetrated mass murder. We have provided training for forensic and other experts who will carry out the exhumations and we are also providing judicial, prosecutor and investigator training for the Iraq Special Tribunal tasked with bringing to justice those responsible for mass killings in Iraq. So far one gravesite in Hatra has been partially exhumed to obtain forensic evidence for prosecutions and a second exhumation is planned soon. No official humanitarian exhumations have begun partly due to poor security but also because the infrastructure has not yet been established to manage this properly. We will continue to work with the Iraqi authorities and the United Nations to establish this infrastructure so that humanitarian exhumations can start as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.976W.6/28">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/29">1.Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. Figures are given in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/30">2.Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities and primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/31">3.Figures for 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/32">4.In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/33">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/34">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/35">Cumbria and Lancashire acting as paying authority for student bursaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.6/36">5.For these reasons expenditure cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>

	<p pid="a.992W.3/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Havant constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Hampshire police force increased by 328 from 3,452 to 3,780. Following the Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002, Hampshire has been allocated funds to recruit 25 CSOs in the first quarter of 2005 to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour on Hampshire streets. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Hampshire police force has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 19 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/3">Hampshire Police will receive &pound;197.7 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&pound;7.2 million) over 2004&ndash;05. Hampshire benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &pound;4.9 million less. General grants funding to Hampshire has increased by 31.5 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Hampshire will also receive around &pound;16 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Four CCTV projects in the Havant CDRP area received a total of &pound;235,000 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;569,288 has been allocated to Havant CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.57 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the South East for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Havant set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Havant a total of 26 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Havant has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Hampshire Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;5.48 million, rising to &pound;6.47 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Havant constituency can be obtained from the Hampshire Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.992W.3/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which isbeing delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved.

Humberside also gains around &pound;0.2 million from the amending report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 3.95 per cent.

	<p pid="a.995W.0/7">The Government recognise the important part played by communities in addressing the wider issue of the underlying gun culture. The Government's Connected Fund, launched in May 2004, is a non-bureaucratic funding stream designed to assist small local community projects across England, working to tackle gun crime and related issues, &pound;515,000 has been given nationally so far.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-28a.215979.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-02-28a.999W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1084" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="999W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050228/text/50228w24.htm#50228w24.html_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.999W.2/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Woodspring constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Avon and Somerset police force increased by 428 from 2,989 to 3,417. The Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 99 CSOs on Avon and Somerset streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Avon and Somerset has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 33 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/3">Avon and Somerset police force will receive &pound;170 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 4.8 per cent. (&pound;7.8 million) over 2004&ndash;05. General grants funding to Avon and Somerset has increased by 26.1 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Avon and Somerset will also receive around &pound;17.7 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. One CCTV project in the North Somerset CDRP area (which includes Woodspring constituency) received a total of &pound;64,000 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;890,000 has been allocated to North Somerset CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;1.98 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the South West for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in North Somerset set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In North Somerset a total of 20 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of February 2005. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. North Somerset has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for North Somerset Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;793,149 rising to &pound;976,550 in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Woodspring constituency can be obtained from the North Somerset Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.2/18">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012W.8/1">In respect of organised criminality by paramilitary organisations, the Government's response is led through the Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF). It produces an annual Threat Assessment which informs the strategic priority setting of the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA). Expert Groups, involving both the LEAs and the Private Sector, work to develop measures and techniques to reduce the opportunities for organised criminality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012W.8/2">In 2004, the first Cross Border Organised Crime Assessment was launched by both An Garda Siochana and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This and the level of joint operational activity are tangible evidence of the effective co-operation occurring across the border.</p>
