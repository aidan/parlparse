This will complement the principles of long-term athlete development by identifying talented young people with the potential to reach elite or even Olympic levels of performance.

However, at <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase> there were 19,913 registered clubs in England and Wales. This number also includes political, ex-services, working men's and other clubs as well as Miners' Welfare Institutes.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.8/2">It should be noted that sports clubs do not just pay the fee of &pound;16 now for a registration certificate allowing them to supply alcohol. Those that obtain permanent extensions for their bars, must pay an additional &pound;25 for their special hours certificate. To obtain such a certificate, the club must first obtain a &quot;certificate of suitability&quot; from its local authority. This is essentially the same as a public entertainment licence and costs vary between local authority areas from &pound;50 to &pound;500 annually. Those clubs without permanent extensions of hours but which open their bars later for special occasions like Christmas and other holiday dances and functions, weddings, anniversaries or during periods like World Cups abroad, must pay for each permission to extend their hours. These are &quot;occasional permissions&quot; and &quot;special orders of exemption&quot;. Each costs the club &pound;10 and many clubs will have as many as 12 per year. All of this and the bureaucracy involved is swept away by the 2003 Act. Under the new licensing regime, the fee of between &pound;100-&pound;635 will cover all the activities and hours involved, and the majority of sports clubs will pay no more than &pound;100, and &pound;70 annually thereafter.</p>

However, the general position is that a television licence is required to install or use a television receiver, which is defined in regulations as any apparatus installed or used for the purpose of receiving any television programme service. Mobile or portable devices are not exempt from the licensing requirements, but a television licence for a person's home address covers the use, anywhere else in the United Kingdom, by the licensee or any person normally living with them at the licensed address, of a portable television receiver powered solely by its own internal batteries.</p>

This code of practice recommends, among other things, that auditory bird scarers sound only four times in any one hour, and that they are placed as far away as is practicable from nearby hospitals, homes or schools in order to avoid causing a nuisance.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.16/3">Should a local authority receive a complaint of noise from an auditory bird scarer, they have a duty to take reasonable steps, where practicable, to investigate the complaint under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. If satisfied that the noise amounts to a statutory nuisance, or that a statutory nuisance is likely to occur or recur, the local authority must serve a notice requiring the noise to be abated or restricted. Failure to comply with an abatement notice can result in a fine of up to &pound;20,000 upon summary conviction.</p>

	<p pid=".646W.5/1">The Government have a continuing supporting role in helping the wine industry and in particular, their endeavours to produce and market quality wines. This is encouraged through the Quality and Regional Wine Schemes which have been introduced by the Department to promote the quality and reputation of English and Welsh wine. Officials meet regularly with the industry to discuss producer concerns, and to monitor how these schemes are operating. I am very pleased that more and more producers are being persuaded to take part in these schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.5/2">When suitable opportunities arise, we in the Department always endeavour to serve and promote national products including English wine. These occasions are an important means of introducing our wines to a new and influential audience. For example, British produce (including English wine) will be promoted generally during the UK presidency of the EU, and we plan to provide British produce and drink for all EU Council meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg over this period.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.5/3">In addition, English wine producers have benefited from Defra grants in excess of &pound;350,000 to help with production and marketing.</p>
	<p pid=".646W.5/4">Defra has also been in recent contact with the United Kingdom Vineyards Association (UKVA), which represents a majority of English and Welsh wine producers, to encourage further uptake of marketing and processing assistance schemes available to the industry.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.5/3">Long term data on hedgehog populations, over the period covering the badger population increase, would be required in order to answer the above question. Such a dataset does not exist, therefore it is not possible to conclude that badger population increase is the cause of a hedgehog population decline.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/4">Research is being carried out to obtain a greater understanding of these interactions. The Central Science Laboratory is conducting a replicated experimental assessment of the ecological consequences of badger removal within the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. The research includes estimating the abundance of hedgehog populations in selected regions of south-west England. Unpublished data from this research suggests that hedgehogs were less likely to be present in areas where badger sett density was high. Additionally, hedgehog numbers tended to increase when badgers were removed, suggesting that a relationship exists between badger density and hedgehog populations. It is hoped further analyses will reveal more on the nature of what is likely to be a complex relationship.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit, which will allow us to prepare estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.5/1">The Forestry Commission has embarked on a programme to restore 15,000 hectares of ancient semi-natural woodland on the public forest estate by 2020 and this will include planting and regenerating native tree species. In addition most new planting by the Commission, which is in the priority areas for improving the environment of disadvantaged urban communities, will be native broadleaves.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.5/2">In the recently published Action Plan for our new Statement of Policy for England's Ancient and Native Woodland there is a clear action to promote woodland creation which extends, buffers and links ancient woodland through both the English woodland grant scheme and environmental stewardship grants. In order to respect the biodiversity values of ancient woodland much of this type of woodland creation will involve the use of native species.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.5/3">Information on the number of trees planted by Government agencies is not recorded centrally. However, most new woodland planting is carried out by private landowners and is grant aided by the Forestry Commission. This has averaged over 4,600 hectares per year for the last 10 years and the majority of this planting has been with broadleaves and most of these have been-native species.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.5/4">Our policy for the expansion of forests and woodland is set out in the England Forestry. Strategy published in 1998. This seeks a continued steady expansion of our woodland area to provide more benefits for society and our environment. Within this policy we have established some short-term targets, for example the creation of 30,000 hectares of new woodland under the current (2000&ndash;06) England Rural Development Programme.</p>

The Civil Aviation Authority's Environmental Research and Consultancy Department produces annual noise contours at Heathrow on behalf of the Department. These are published on the Department's website. The latest report (ERCD 0401, July 2004) shows that Twickenham lies outside the 57dBA contour area normally considered to represent the onset of significant community annoyance.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

Financial incentives which make an eventual return to full-time work more viable are also available through the permitted work rules, benefit run-ons and tax credits.</p>
	<p pid=".680W.2/2">Our Pathways to Work pilots offer a sophisticated range of back to work and rehabilitation support. We are expanding the coverage of our compulsory work-focused interview (WFI) regime to existing claimants to make sure they are fully aware and are actively encouraged to take up the help and support on offer. Our proposals for reforming incapacity benefit will build on Pathways to Work to enable as many recipients as possible to realise their own aspirations of a return to work.

	<p pid=".683W.12/1">In Uganda, over the last 10 years we have provided &pound;75 million of direct assistance to the education sector through projects and targeted budget support. The Ugandan Government prefer donors to provide support for the implementation of its Poverty Eradication Action Plan as general budget support and this is now the principal means through which the UK supports the continued expansion of the education sector. In addition, mindful of the continuing insecurity in the north, DFID is supporting UNICEF in funding projects through NGOs that are improving access to basic services, including education.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.12/2">The UK is the co-ordinating donor for the education sector in Rwanda. We have supported education, through general budget support, &pound;21 million was released between 2000 and 2003 via an 'education window', and our current Poverty Reduction Budget Support monitors education performance as an indicator of progress. Since 2001 we have targeted &pound;13 million to a programme of capacity building. DFID has also worked with the Ministry of Education, with a particular focus on improving girls' education. We have also supported a number of measures to help reduce public financing on higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.12/3">The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces immense challenges. Education&mdash;like every other sector&mdash;deteriorated hugely under the impact of conflict over the past decade. The DRC is moving towards its first democratic elections since the 1960s and we hope this will signal a new start in DRC where an elected Government, with the support of the international community, can work to deliver services to the Congolese people. DFID is already providing some assistance to education; we have been supporting the Bank in the development of their Education Investment programme, and we are supporting the NGO Catholic Relief Services in its project in basic education in North Sankuru. More broadly, we are now looking hard at what DFID's most effective long-term role should be, as part of the wider donor community, in supporting the strengthening and expansion of service delivery in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.12/4">In Sudan, DFID is supporting UNICEF's work in basic education and the international NGO, GOAL'S country wide literacy and livelihoods programme. In the south we are in the process of developing a framework for service delivery which covers health, water and sanitation as well as education, and we are about to launch the second phase of our education and training scholarships scheme, which will be managed by the British Council (&pound;1.4 million 2005&ndash;07). Our support for education in the Horn relates mainly to Ethiopia, with a small programme of support in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.12/5">DFID supports the Government of Ethiopia's Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP), which emphasises primary education, through Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) to the Government of Ethiopia (&pound;30 million 2004&ndash;05). The Department works closely with the Ministry of Education and development partners to improve sector dialogue, policies and strategies in education. Gross enrolment rates in primary education have doubled over the last 10 years. In addition, we provide specific technical support in a number of areas (including education management capacity building and HIV/AIDS and education). In particular, we are supporting the Ministry of Education's Teacher Development Programme through a pooled fund with five other bilateral partners. DFID also has a small Innovatory Fund for Education which supports the development and dissemination of innovative practice in education, particularly by NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.12/6">We are playing an active role in the coordination and development of the Somalia education sector with other development partners in Nairobi, including UNESCO, UNICEF, USAID, EU and the private sector. We are supporting UNESCO, Save the Children UK and Africa Educational Trust on projects in Somalia that aim to increase opportunities for girls as well as boys in accessing quality basic education, develop textbooks and establish an examination system.</p>

	<p pid=".685W.2/1">The Government welcome the recent study, conducted by the World Health Organisation and the Medical Research Council, showing that the routine immunisation of young children against Hib disease, a major cause of meningitis and pneumonia in developing countries, has virtually eliminated the disease in The Gambia. We hope that these results will encourage other countries in sub-Saharan Africa to persevere with their own immunisation efforts.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.2/2">Routine Hib vaccination was introduced in The Gambia in 1997 as part of the country's expanded programme of immunisation. No cases of invasive Hib have been detected since 2002. The programme is being supported by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), to which DFID has contributed since its inception in 2000. The GAVI is providing $3,229,000 for the Hib and Hepatitis vaccination programme for the period 2002&ndash;06 and is currently considering a second phase of support from 2007, taking into account priorities, performance and results, in consultation with the countries concerned. DFID has presently pledged support to the GAVI up to 2007&ndash;08.</p>

Relevant figures are only readily available for deaths where the underlying cause was either related to drug poisoning or directly related to alcohol (alcohol abuse, dependence and poisoning, and diseases directly related to alcohol use). It is not possible to identify from death certificates which substance was the primary cause when more than one was involved.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.6/5" class="indent">Figures for alcohol-related deaths to usual residents of Southend and Essex registered in the years 1995 to 2004 are given in the attached table. ONS compiles a special database to analyse mortality from drug-related poisoning adding more detail than is available on routine annual extracts. This database is compiled using the annual occurrences extract of mortality data. Figures showing deaths related to drug poisoning involving controlled drugs occurring in the years 1994 to 2003, to usual residents of Southend and Essex, are given in the table below. Information on deaths involving illegal drugs is not available, as how the deceased obtained a particular drug is not recorded at death registration.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.6/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the figures on drug-related poisoning are not directly comparable to the figures on alcohol for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.6/7" class="indent">The figures on drugs do not include long-term effects of drug taking, whereas the figures on alcohol include cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.6/8" class="indent">Deaths from poisoning which involved both drugs and alcohol are coded as due to drug poisoning, in accordance with international rules for coding cause of death.</p>
	<p pid=".686W.6/9" class="indent">The figures on alcohol include only those where the underlying cause was alcohol-related. The figures on specific drugs include any mention of a substance on a death related to drug poisoning.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.0/1">The Government believes that Article 45 of the new procurement directive is very helpful in the fight against fraud and corruption by requiring, for the first time under the EU procurement rules, contracting authorities to exclude suppliers convicted of such offences. At present, such exclusions are voluntary. The article only enables member states to derogate from this requirement for &quot;overriding requirements in the general interest&quot;, which is designed to cover exceptional circumstances of national emergency, for example related to the protection of life and security. Our proposed guidance on this article will cover these matters and will provide additional advice to authorities on when the derogation should be invoked.

(10941)</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/4" class="indent">I have arranged for the data requested to be placed in the House of Commons library.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/5" class="indent">Electorate Counts</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/6" class="indent">The ward electorate counts are for February 2001 parliamentary electors, including attainers (persons attaining the age of 18 after <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-16">16 February 2001</phrase> but before <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-16">16 February 2002</phrase>). The counts relate to England and Wales only. There are a number of wards which are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. The ward electorate and population counts are repeated for each parliamentary constituency which they fall within, and are indicated by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. Split ward electorate and population counts by parliamentary constituency are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/7" class="indent">Electoral Wards</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/8" class="indent">The electorate counts are not necessarily consistent with the statutory electoral register return RPF 29, due to the need for population estimation purposes to use and convert historic electorate counts on different ward geographies to a consistent ward geography i.e. the Census Area Statistics (CAS) ward geography (CAS wards were used for 2001 Census outputs).</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/9" class="indent">The electorate counts therefore do not necessarily relate to wards which were in existence in February 2001, and some wards which were in existence in February 2001 may have had subsequent boundary changes.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/10" class="indent">Population Estimates</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/11" class="indent">The ward population estimates for persons aged 18 and over relate to mid-2001 i.e. <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> and are for CAS wards. Due to their small population size, population estimates for wards in City of London and Isles of Scilly are shown for the local authority areas only. For comparative purposes, the electorate counts for wards within these local authorities have been similarly aggregated.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/12" class="indent">Limitations with the data</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/13" class="indent">The parliamentary electorate excludes European Union citizens and includes overseas electors. The former will be included in the population estimates and the latter excluded. Comparable ward counts of local government electors are not readily available.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/14" class="indent">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. In addition, people can register in more than one place.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.3/15" class="indent">There is a relatively small number of wards (44) where the electorate counts are more than 10 per cent. greater than the population estimate, the majority of such cases are likely to be attributable to a limitation in the methodology used to convert electorate counts from a non-CAS ward geography onto a CAS ward geography. There may however also be valid reasons why the electorate count may exceed the estimated population, as described above.</p>

Also, significantly more families benefit from them, including a large proportion that are only receiving the family element.

	<p pid=".700W.9/1">The Department and DfES are working closely together to ensure that the skills which business and industry require are those which are delivered in schools and through the sector skills councils. For example the 14&ndash;19 White Paper (DfES) recognised the need to do more to increase the appreciation among tomorrow's citizens of the contribution that science and technology make towards our way of life; and also to increase the numbers who leave school equipped to pursue careers using skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.</p>
	<p pid=".700W.9/2">The DTIs key focus is on the informal side of science education. We are supporting SETNET, the Science, Engineering, Technology and Maths Network, for the next three years with funding in excess of &pound;10 million. SETNET co-ordinates a UK-wide network of some 50 SETPOINTS and also the Science and Engineering Ambassadors programme (SEAs) which provides a framework within which people, working in science and technology environments can be trained to go into schools and act as role models to help teachers convey the excitement of careers using STEM skills.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.2/2">Following the judgments against British Coal in both the vibration white finger and respiratory disease litigations, the High Court ordered the DTI to set up schemes, in agreement with miners' solicitors, to assess compensation for both types of claim. Claims had by then been registered through the Claimants Solicitors Group (the CSG), some of which were sponsored by the main mining unions, the NUM and NACODS. The UDM had also registered a large number of claims directly on behalf of their members, through their dedicated claims handling company, Vendside Ltd. The CSG and the UDM were unable to work together or enter into single arrangements for historical reasons. Ministers agreed the DTI would negotiate the strategy with the UDM and Vendside in which the terms for compensation are the same as for the agreement with the CSG.</p>

When there are grounds to suspect that a company is operating a scheme in breach of the regulations the company may be investigated under Part XIV of the Companies Act 1985 and, if the investigation findings point to the need to do so, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may present a petition in the public interest for the winding up of the company under section 124A of the Insolvency Act 1986.

	<p pid=".710W.5/1">We have a well established work force strategy based on recruiting and retaining a high quality national health service work force. As part of this strategy, we recognise the need to use a flexible pool of staff through NHS banks or private agencies. We expect these staff to be of good quality and for the NHS to get value for money. To ensure that this is the case, we have developed agency framework agreements through our Purchasing and Supplies Agency and have established NHS professionals as a special health authority. These are playing a significant part in securing the appropriate and effective use of agency staff.</p>

The MHRA's adverse incident database holds detailed information on each of those incidents. MHRA staff using the database may select from 139 different categories and sub-categories when specifying incident causes. It would not be practical to provide this level of detail in the summary document, so these categories are grouped together under high level headings.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.9/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/18">1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust (PCT) summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/19">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/20">3. Figures for 1997&ndash;98 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/21">4. In many HAs, there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/22">the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/23">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/24">5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. Therefore, the total expenditure in the answer by HA does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.9/25">6. For these reasons expenditure cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.</p>

	<p pid=".736W.2/1">National health service organisations are expected to plan for and achieve financial balance each and every year. Any deficits of NHS trusts need to be matched by underspends by other NHS bodies each year. In the next year NHS trusts which overspend should make a surplus in order to ensure that other organisations can utilise the underspends from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid=".736W.2/2">It is the responsibility of strategic health authorities (SHAs) to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. However, there is a degree of flexibility in how this is managed at a local level. In circumstances where a surplus cannot be generated in the following year, SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Clearly, any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.5/1">Currently the makeup of the London Ambulance Service (LAS) patient forums does not adequately represent the perspective of the capital overall. With 12 members, there are large parts of the city that do not have patient experience representation.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/2">It is the Government's intention to focus patient forum activity at the primary care trust (PCT) level but with arrangements in place to ensure the whole patients' journey is covered by forum activity. In the context of the LAS it is envisaged that all London PCT forums would work together to ensure that ambulance services are monitored and reviewed effectively from the patient perspective. It will be for the forums themselves to decide how best to achieve a comprehensive and robust arrangement, but one approach might be for each PCT forum to nominate one of its number to form a pan-London specialist ambulance review panel. Such an arrangement would mean that there was strong input from across the city with a membership of 29, with each London locality having a real chance to input into LAS at both strategic and operational levels.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.5/3">It is envisaged that the reduction of forums to be based on PCT areas only will be during 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.8/2">The Department has received representations about photodynamic therapy (PDT) from several correspondents; a list of these correspondents is not collated centrally. David Longman, director of &quot;Killing Cancer&quot;, has made recent representations about PDT.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.8/3">As part of its programme of work on interventional procedures, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is looking at the use of PDT in the treatment of several cancers. NICE has already issued guidance on the use of PDT in the treatment of Barrett's oesophagus and advanced bronchial carcinoma and is preparing guidance on the use of PDT in the treatment of bile duct cancer, skin tumours and advanced bronchial carcinoma.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.8/4">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.2/1">Spend on enhanced services is monitored locally by strategic health authorities (SHAs) and nationally by the technical steering committee; a United Kingdom-wide committee incorporating representatives from all UK health Departments, NHS Employers and the British Medical Association (BMA). This indicates that overall investment in enhanced services by primary care trusts (PCTs) in 2004&ndash;05 is expected to be greater than the planned investment of &pound;601 million, although a minority of PCTs planned to under-spend against their enhanced services floor. Slippage and slow uptake on enhanced services schemes appear to be the main reasons behind the forecast underspends.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/2">As a consequence of this reported underspend, it has been agreed with the general practitioners' committee of the BMA that any underspends by PCTs in 2004&ndash;05 will be re-invested in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/3">SHAs have the power to intervene if they believe PCTs are not delivering the necessary level of investment to provide good quality service for patients.</p>

	<p pid=".746W.0/2">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. There are two targets for prostate cancer to be achieved from December 2005; of a maximum 31 day wait from diagnosis of prostate cancer to start of treatment and 62 days from urgent referral for suspected prostate cancer to first treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".746W.0/3">A national cancer waits project was set up in December 2004 and has held two national conferences on achievement of the 2005 waiting times targets. An expert reference group, chaired by the national cancer director, consisting of representatives from special health authorities, primary care trusts, senior clinicians and national health service managers meets regularly to advise the project and discuss NHS implementation of the targets. The prostate advisory group, which includes membership from prostate charities, also discussed prostate cancer waits at its last meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".746W.0/4">If a patient tells a clinician that they need time to reflect before deciding on treatment, then clinicians are allowed to suspend the time patients need to consider their treatment options. This means that when monitoring the time taken to achieve the targets, this time does not count as part of the 31 and 62 day waiting times. This ensures that patients have enough time to make the right decision about their favoured treatment option. Decisions on the best treatment for each individual cancer patient must remain a clinical decision made by a multi disciplinary team. The targets ensure that agreed treatment is delivered quickly.</p>

	<p pid=".755W.11/1">There are two separate detained fast track processes, which were operating in 2004. The Oakington process, which incorporates Non-Suspensive Appeals (NSA) and the Detained Fast Track at Harmondsworth.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.11/2">During 2004, 6,520 applicants entered the Oakington process. The average length of stay for a detainee is not recorded centrally. However, the fast track process at Oakington is intended for claims which, upon initial screening, appear capable of being decided quickly in about 7 to14 days. Claimants from countries listed on the designated NSA list at Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 are subject to the NSA procedure from the outset. Claimants who receive a clearly unfounded decision at Oakington can be immediately removed. Some claimants may stay at Oakington after their NSA decision pending re-documentation or because they are seeking to pursue a judicial review. Where appropriate to do so, they are detained at Oakington pending removal, others may be moved to other centres. The majority of claimants who do not receive a certified decision are released on temporary admission on completion of the Oakington process whilst their appeal is processed.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.11/3">During 2004, 1,105 asylum applicants entered the Detained Fast Track at Harmondsworth. Since its inception in April 2003, the average time of detention for applicants in the fast track stands at 44 days from arrival at Harmondsworth to release and/or removal, this information is based on internal management information as such is not published within the official statistics.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.2/7">The Home Office is working closely with the Department for Transport to provide a method for electronically transferring data from the DVLA to the police so that information exchange is more timely and accurate. This is in addition to other improvements being made in this area by the DVLA such as the bar coding of Vehicle Excise Licences at the point of issue.</p>

In addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has had discussions with relevant authorities in France about the action taken by French consular staff to assist victims of FGM and are planning to approach those in the Netherlands. Further guidance for consular staff is being developed by the FCO, in conjunction with the police and social services.</p>

	<p pid=".777W.5/1">While the Home Secretary decides whether an applicant qualifies for compensation in respect of a miscarriage of justice, the assessment of the amount of compensation is undertaken by an Assessor appointed by him under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (currently Lord Brennan QC). The amount of an award is wholly a matter for the Assessor, and the Home Secretary has no power to influence or vary his determination.</p>
	<p pid=".777W.5/2">Saved living expenses for the period an applicant spent in prison are frequently referred to, incorrectly, as deductions for &quot;bed and board&quot; or &quot;board and lodging&quot;. The compensation process involves two separate and distinct concepts of loss: pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. The pecuniary element, the quantifiable financial loss, is intended to put the applicant back into the financial position they would have been in but for their wrongful conviction, but not to a position better than that. Any deduction for saved living expenses is made by the Assessor in respect of the costs an applicant would have been required to pay out of their net income, for example rent or mortgage payments. The deduction is restricted to the pecuniary loss element only, and is not intended to cover optional or enhanced expenditure, such as luxuries and leisure activities. A minimal monthly expenditure is therefore deducted.</p>
	<p pid=".777W.5/3">The non-pecuniary loss award, however, is in recognition of, for example, loss of reputation, loss of liberty, hardship, mental suffering, injury to feelings, and inconvenience. It is an award in recognition of the miscarriage of justice itself.</p>

	<p pid=".787W.11/1">The national probation service has a statutory duty to work with victims of sexual or violent offences where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. This duty was conferred under the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 and is soon to be extended, under the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, to the victims of mentally disordered offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.11/2">Victims are provided with a single point of contact with the probation service, through Victim Liaison Officers (VLOs), from whom they can receive information about key stages in an offender's sentence, such as temporary leave and release on licence.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.11/3">Many victims of serious crime will have concerns about an offender approaching them or their home once released from prison. The victim contact scheme provides an opportunity for victims to request that conditions be attached to an offender's licence on conditional release. These conditions may specify, for example, that the offender is not allowed to have any contact with the victim and may establish exclusion zones into which the offender is not allowed, such as the areas around the victim's house or place of work. Victims who have concerns about the risk posed to them by an offender on either temporary or conditional release can discuss their concerns with the VLO who can use this information in reports to the prison governor or Parole Board.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.11/4">When an offender is released on licence, he/she will be subject to supervision by the probation service. During the period of the licence, the VLO will maintain contact with a victim and the victim's family. If victims have concerns about the offender breaching conditions not to contact them or entering an exclusion zone, they should inform the VLO who will in turn notify the offender's supervising officer. If the concerns are substantiated, the offender will either be warned about his/her behaviour, or recalled to custody if it is thought he/she presents an unacceptable risk of harm to the public and there is evidence he/she has breached the licence conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.9/2">The applicants requested the Secretary of State's screening direction on the matter of whether or not the application made to Stroud district council is an 'EIA application' within the meaning of the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.9/3">The Secretary of State issued a screening direction on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-11">11 May 2005</phrase>. In the opinion of the Secretary of State, taking into account the selection criteria in schedule 3 to the 1999 regulations, the proposal is likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature and location. The development proposed, namely, change of use of buildings to a mix of classes B1, B2, B8, and sui generis uses falls within the description at paragraph (10)<i>(a)</i> of schedule 2 to the 1999 regulations. The reason for this conclusion is the proposal is for an industrial estate development on a site in excess of 0.5 hectares. Since the proposal exceeds the threshold in column 2 of the table in schedule 2 to the 1999 regulations and is located in a sensitive area, the Secretary of State considers the application to be a 'Schedule 2 application' within the meaning of the 1999 regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.9/4">However, the Secretary of State's opinion on the likelihood of the development having significant environmental effects is reached only for the purposes of the screening direction. Since a further planning application is expected in respect of this site, it is possible that the site will come before the First Secretary of State in the future either as the subject of a call-in or on appeal, therefore any comments regarding the merits of any proposal for the site could prejudice the First Secretary of State's position.</p>

English Partnerships will be working closely with stakeholders such as the Regional Housing Boards, local planning authorities and others to assess local demands and accommodate them where possible taking account of regional strategies and development plans.

	<p pid=".806W.5/2">It is the responsibility of local planning authorities to identify and release land for housing as part of the planning process.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.5/3">The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply in support of the Sustainable Communities Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.5/4">A register of surplus public sector land held by central Government bodies has been established. English Partnerships is currently reviewing the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at March 2005, there were 713 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interests are received after a site has been marketed. A list of the sites on the register, as at March 2005, can be found on the English Partnerships website at: <a href="http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf">http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk/images/16EE954C904340DDAB44702EF5D2ADE6.pdf</a>. English Partnerships will publish a quarterly update of sites on the register.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.5/5">English Partnerships has also recently taken ownership of the first 67 sites from a portfolio of 96 surplus hospital sites. The sites are currently being assessed for their development potential and will then be taken forward in consultation with the relevant local planning authorities. English Partnerships and the Defence Estates have also signed a joint working agreement on surplus land. This sets out how the agencies will work together with the objective of maximising the potential of surplus defence sites to help deliver the Sustainable Communities Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.5/6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and English Partnerships also maintain the National Land Use Database of Previously-Developed Land (NLUD-PDL). This covers vacant and derelict land and also land in use with potential for development. It covers land in both public and private ownership. Information on the sites is available from the NLUD website at <a href="http://www.nlud.org.uk">www.nlud.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".806W.5/7">In addition, English Partnerships is developing the National Brownfield Strategy which will provide a coherent vision for the future development of brownfield land to underpin national, regional and local development aspirations. The strategy will help our targets for building new homes on brownfield land thereby reducing the pressure on the green belt.</p>

	<p pid=".813W.2/1">During 2003 and 2004, there were 12,184 and 13,572 cattle herds placed under movement restrictions as a result of bovine TB. The distribution of movement restrictions is not available by county. The increase in herd restrictions in 2004 reflects the measures introduced to deal with herds whose test had not taken place by the due date. There is clear evidence that the incidence of TB in Northern Ireland is decreasing.</p>

	<p pid=".816W.6/2">Boards must consider carefully any reduction in their support for EAL Services as the additional funding provided to schools for this purpose through the common funding Formula is intended to supplement and not to replace board funding. Boards must be satisfied that the services they provide are sufficient to meet the needs of EAL pupils in their area. The change in EAL policy by the board may adversely affect children whose first language is not English and who are of a different race and could therefore place the board in contravention of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Boards are public authorities in their own right under the terms of the Act. Boards must advise the Department on the action they are taking to ensure the provision of adequate EAL services in their area.</p>

This includes the provision of a new wastewater treatment works at Tandragee and the closure of a number of smaller wastewater treatment works including Laurelvale. The wastewater from these smaller works will be pumped to the new Tandragee Works for treatment. The new treatment works has been designed to cater for future needs in the area up to the year 2028.

However, due to other priorities, arising mainly from the need to achieve compliance with EC Directives, it is unlikely that any improvement work on the sewerage network could commence before 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".821W.2/1">The Department of the Environment has recently published guidance on waste management options for municipal and non-municipal waste in Northern Ireland. The report on Best Practicable Environmental Option for Waste Management follows extensive stakeholder engagement involving District Councils and other stakeholders as part of the Waste Management Strategy review.</p>
	<p pid=".821W.2/2">A broad range of options were considered comprising different combinations of technologies to divert waste from landfill including recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment, thermal treatment and advanced thermal treatment (pyrolysis and gasification). These options were assessed against key decision criteria of feasibility, environmental impact, cost and social impact.</p>
	<p pid=".821W.2/3">The findings provide a framework for assessing the preferred combination of different technologies to meet targets on landfill diversion at 2020, in order to support progress on planning, procurement and funding for a new waste management infrastructure for Northern Ireland. The framework is intended to guide District Councils in the development of their Waste Management Plans and infrastructure procurement, while not constraining local choices to meet challenging Landfill Directive targets.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.2/1">16&ndash;19 academies will be established under the procedures for setting up new further education colleges as specified in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. These academies will be subject to the same governance arrangements as for existing further education colleges, but tailored to reflect the ethos of an academy and the presence of a sponsor. Tailoring governance arrangements in this way is already established practice for a number of colleges in the FE sector, for example sixth form colleges. The governance arrangements for the academies will also need to take account of existing statutory requirements and will need to satisfy my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State before approval is given to the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.2/2">If approved by the Secretary of State, the new Brunei HSBC Education Trust Academy will be legally established as a further education college but will reflect the ethos of an academy. It would open in September 2008. The academy would provide education for 800 16&ndash;19 year-olds drawing from the Learning and Skills Council London West area and beyond. It would be particularly aimed at those who might otherwise not have stayed on for post 16 education, including students from disadvantaged areas or who have achieved less than they might. (10490)</p>
	<p pid=".828W.2/3">The London West Learning and Skills Council Strategic Review did not coincide with the proposal to establish the Brunei HSBC Education Trust 16&ndash;19 Academy. However, initial consultation by the sponsors involved Hillingdon LEA, West London LSC and the national LSC before the feasibility phase for the project began in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.2/4">The West London LSC are active members of the Brunei academy project board and chair the academy forum which is seeking the views of local secondary schools and FE Colleges on the proposal, on an on-going basis as the proposal is developed. The academy sponsors are very keen to work closely with local schools and to provide a wider service to the community. Post 16 participation in Hillingdon is one of the lowest in West London and the academy will help to address this weakness. Further research into the need for places in the London West area, and the potential impact such an academy may have on local providers, has been commissioned by the local LSC and this should be available in the autumn for presentation to both the LSC and Ministers before a decision on the academy is made.</p>

	<p pid=".829W.5/1">There are no blanket restrictions on people who are overweight from applying to adopt a child. The adoption agency has a duty to children needing adoptive families to satisfy itself that the prospective adopter has a reasonable expectation of continuing to enjoy good health, and that they have sufficient health and vigour to meet the many varied demands of a child throughout his childhood and into adulthood.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.5/2">A person's weight could be a contributory factor to the state of his health, either now or in the future, and if so this will be brought out in his medical report produced by his GP. If there is any medical condition which might affect the prospective adopter's capacity to care for a child, this is taken very seriously and explored thoroughly to obtain as much information as possible to enable a decision to be made on his suitability to adopt a child. If an adoption agency decides that it does not propose to approve the prospective adopter, the reasons must be sound and defensible. The prospective adopter has the right to challenge that qualifying determination by either making representations to the adoption agency or applying to the independent review panel to review his case.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.8/1">The content of each apprenticeship framework is designed by the business led Sector Skills Councils in the context of a blueprint agreed between the Department and key stakeholders. Achievement of the full framework is intended to be the minimum requirement for qualified status at either Level 2 or Level 3 within a particular industry. The basic elements of the framework,&mdash;NVQ, technical certificate, key skills and any other qualifications designated by the sector&mdash;form that minimum requirement and are intended to provide as much flexibility as possible while maintaining quality and standards across industries. However, for some young people initial assessment will indicate they may not be able to complete all elements of the framework. A number of other programmes may be suitable for young people in this position. In particular for 16 to 18-year-olds we are piloting a programme to encourage young people in jobs without training to take up learning opportunities. The programme will start in April 2006. For those over 19 and without either basic skills or a first Level 2 qualification we are putting in place the National Employer Training programme to deliver high quality flexible qualifications in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid=".832W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council measures the number and proportion of young people who complete all the elements of their apprenticeship framework. The completion rate in academic year 2002/03 was 27 per cent., so far in 2004/05 the rate is 35.7 per cent. To further improve completion we have adopted a Performance Indicator for 2007/08 to increase the number of completions by 75 per cent. from 43,000 to 75,000. To achieve this, the Department and the LSC will continue to research and address the reasons for non-completion, which will vary from sector to sector and from employer to employer. Overall, the main reasons that have been identified are: poor quality learning provision; inappropriate or inflexible frameworks, or elements of frameworks; and inadequate initial assessment of apprentices' capabilities. We also have anecdotal evidence of young people not completing due to promotion at work. While this might be seen as a 'good' reason, we are keen that young people and their employers understand the value of completing the full framework, both to productivity and future employability. The LSC will continue with its programme to root out poor provision by withdrawing contracts where necessary. According to the Adult Learning Inspectorate in 2001&ndash;02 the level of inadequate provision was 60 per cent. In 2003&ndash;04 that had fallen to 34 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.2/2">The content of apprenticeship frameworks are set by Sector Skills Councils within a blueprint set by the Department and other key stakeholders. This offers as much flexibility to sectors as possible while maintaining overall standards across industries. Effective initial assessment remains crucial to ensuring that young people have a realistic chance of completing their programme. Providers are judged on the systems they have in place to do this. We will also be focusing our future marketing activity on ensuring that apprenticeships and their value are better understood.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.3/2">The project to establish a 16&ndash;19 Academy based on Brunel University's Uxbridge Campus is currently in its feasibility stage. Initial consultation with post-16 education providers in the area is already under way through a West London Learning and Skills Council (LSC) chaired Academy Forum. Formal and wider consultation on the proposal to establish the Academy will begin during July 2005 for three months involving organisations who would normally be consulted during the establishment of a Further Education College and an Academy. This will include local schools and FE colleges, the West London LSC, the national LSC, Hillingdon LEA and other LEAs in the areas surrounding Uxbridge. In addition details of the proposal will be published in a local newspaper. The Academy sponsors are very keen that it should develop a good relationship with local schools and colleges.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.3/3">Academy projects in feasibility receive funding from the Department for Education and Skills depending on the expected length and complexity of the feasibility phase. The Learning and Skills Council is not involved in providing Academy feasibility funding. A final feasibility budget for the Brunel HSBC Education Trust Academy is likely to be decided shortly but is currently estimated to be &pound;332,000. This will cover project management, consultation, legal and other costs until completion of the feasibility phase. This started in December 2004 and should finish in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.3/4">Academies for 16 to 19-year-olds will legally be Further Education Colleges but with an Academy ethos. The consultation will follow the statutory requirements for establishing a Further Education college under section 51 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Consultation requirements also include compliance with the Education (Publication of Draft Proposals and Orders) (Further Education Corporations) (England) Regulations 2001&mdash;S.1.2001/782. The responses to consultation will be included in the detailed information to both the national LSC and Ministers before a decision is made on the establishment of the Academy.</p>

	<p pid=".850W.2/1">The quantity and quality of skilled labour available in an economy is an important determinant of economic performance and productivity growth. Research has shown that, in terms of GDP per hour, 12 per cent. of the productivity gap with France and one-fifth of the productivity gap with Germany is due to the UK's relative skills level.</p>
	<p pid=".850W.2/2">In addition to skills investment, innovation, enterprise and competition are all key drivers of productivity growth. These drivers are complementary and interdependent.</p>

	<p pid=".850W.5/1">DfES funding for university teaching and research in England is in the form of a block grant, and universities have flexibility to allocate it as they wish between Departments and programmes. We do not monitor which programmes receive funding. The research councils are the other major Government funders of academic research: they do not have any formal co-funding programmes with Israeli funding agencies, but have awarded some funding for projects, including funding to enable collaborations between UK and Israeli researchers.</p>
