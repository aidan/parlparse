	<p pid=".1W.3/1">The Cabinet Office has been partially responsible for the implementation of one EU Directive in the past five years. The Women and Equality Unit, formerly part of Cabinet Office, implemented the Burden of Proof Directive (EC Directive 097/80/EC). However, the relevant statutory instrument, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-12">12 October 2001</phrase>, was laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Minister for Women, who has overall responsibility for women and equality issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/2">Directive 97/80/EC has effect in relation to the UK by virtue of Council Directive 98/52/EC, and is implemented in the UK through the Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination and Burden of Proof) Regulations 2001. Its aim is to ensure that any measures implementing the principle of equal treatment are made more effective, thereby providing victims of sex discrimination with effective access to justice. The Directive also defines the concept of indirect discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/3">EC Regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states, without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some Regulations require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/4">The total number of EC, ECSC and Euratom Regulations made over each of the last five years is estimated to be:</p>

			<tr pid=".1W.3/14"> <td>2002 (up to and including November)</td> <td>2,125</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1W.3/17">It should be noted that many of these are small or technical Regulations to amend, implement or indeed repeal existing measures.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.3/18">It would incur disproportionate cost to identify which Government Department was responsible for each of these Regulations. The Cabinet Office rarely has lead responsibility for EC Regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.2/1">The trafficking of people is part of a wider set of issues related to the migration of poor people to better their lives, and to their vulnerability to national and international smugglers and traffickers. Trafficking is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's role is to work to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that can lead to such abuse. Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and end poverty, DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances that give rise to this appalling trade, and which make women and children especially vulnerable. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection and justice in line with the international treaty framework covering these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/2">For example, in south-east Asia, we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's work to reduce the trafficking of women, many of whom would enter the sex industry, in Laos, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. It involves a number of activities to raise awareness and prevent the trade. In the Balkans we recently supported the International Organisation for Migration in training the various agencies dealing with the victims of trafficking, including police, social workers and the legal profession, in order to create and disseminate models of good practice.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.5/1">Reliable statistics are not available by district in Iraq. Maintaining both clean water and electricity supplies has been a high priority for the coalition since the end of the recent conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.5/2">In 2000, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF estimated that 48 per cent. of people in rural areas and 96 per cent. of people in urban areas had access to clean drinking water. The International Committee of the Red Cross has worked well with other humanitarian organisations, the UK military and local authorities to repair water facilities and provide water by alternative means while supplies have been disrupted, primarily by looting, after the recent conflict. The situation in many parts of the country, including Basra, Kirkuk and Mosul is now improving. Baghdad is now receiving 70 to 90 per cent. of its pre-war water supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.5/3">Electricity installations did not sustain significant damage during the recent war, but power supplies are very variable as a result of previous lack of maintenance and subsequent looting and sabotage. Generation capacity is estimated at 50 to 60 per cent. of the country's needs.</p>

Cumulation of origin means goods can be processed using inputs from any source within the Euro-Mediterranean area, and take advantage of the system of preferential tariffs, which currently exists between Europe and the Mediterranean partners. As such, it should help to foster economic integration between Mediterranean partners and with Europe, enable goods to be produced more efficiently through sourcing the cheapest inputs, and encourage economies of scale. A subsequent assessment of the effectiveness of this agreement will eventually be possible.</p>

We recognise, however, that the ability and resources of some developing country members to participate meaningfully in WTO negotiations can be limited. As a result, the Government have offered &pound;40,000 to a WTO Trust Fund to enable Ministers and officials from the least developed countries to attend the meeting in Cancun.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/2">More generally, the Government have committed to spending &pound;45 million by 2004 on trade related capacity building. Activities funded include improving developing countries' ability to negotiate favourable deals in the WTO talks trade negotiations, helping them interpret trade agreements, and supporting them in taking advantage of new international trading opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".9W.2/1">Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are intended to be country-driven and owned, based on broad participation in their design, implementation and monitoring. PRSPs provide a focus for joint donor efforts, and so it is not possible allocate particular elements of countries' PRSPs to the actions of any one donor. DFID participates in formal and informal donor networks around PRSPs, has co-funded World bank-led workshops and has been active on PRSP preparation committees and working groups.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/2">DFID's strong commitment to achieving debt relief and poverty reduction in the world's poorest countries means that we are working actively with their Governments to support production of PRSPs. We are also supporting the consultative process that the PRSP requires, to ensure the strategy is built on broad-based consensus in which the poor have a voice. The majority of DFID country offices support the national PRSP process by promoting official or Government participation. We also give direct support to civil society to strengthen the impact of public action on poverty, and to encourage progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. DFID has worked with the World bank on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Sourcebook. This is a guide to assist countries in the development of poverty reduction strategies and includes advice on issues such as health, education, infrastructure, water and sanitation, macroeconomic policy, gender and the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/3">DFID also supports major multi-lateral initiatives, such as the Water and Sanitation Program, that work to support national Governments and civil society in national PRSP processes. Research undertaken by the Water and Sanitation Program of Full and Interim PRSPs in Sub-Saharan Africa has found that treatment of water and sanitation is not comprehensive and often inconsistent. In particular, sanitation and solid waste management received inadequate attention. Also, despite the significant continuing work on sector reforms (e.g. decentralisation, rural and urban water and sanitation), their incorporation in the country PRSP initiatives requires considerable strengthening. The Uganda PRS was a notable exception having good coverage of water and sanitation issues, and serves as an illustration of good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".9W.2/4">DFID has also commissioned a research and advocacy project in sub-Saharan Africa that is being undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and WaterAid. The project is investigating how resources allocated to water supply and sanitation in PRSPs in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Madagascar and Uganda) are converting into actual expenditure on water and sanitation, and will make recommendations to improve the poverty reducing impact of this work. This will be completed in 2004 and is an important opportunity to support the building of sustainable improvements in local capacity in a way that is consistent with nationally owned poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.0/1">The UK has supported the French Africa initiative to the G8, which recognises the damaging effects of agricultural subsidies on African economies. Discussions around the French initiative during the recent G8 summit at Evian were also important to reiterate the importance of finding solutions to the commodities' problem and to improve the way in which preferential access into developed countries' markets operates for the benefit of developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.0/2">In the WTO, the UK is committed to reaching agreements on long-term agricultural trade rules, which are fair and non-discriminatory. These multilateral rules should aim to create the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to make long-term investment in developing countries' agriculture. In this context, the draft agricultural trade framework agreement (put forward by Stuart Harbinson) proposes that developed countries phase out all export subsidies within 10 years.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.3/1">The Government believe that the current round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will provide the best opportunity for improving developing country access to protected agricultural and non-agricultural markets in the developed world. Along with commitments to improve market access, the negotiations also aim to tackle developed countries' high levels of trade-distorting domestic support and use of export subsidies, which harm developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.3/2">At the fifth Ministerial meeting of the WTO in Cancun this September, Ministers will assess progress towards achieving the 'development' agenda set out in Doha in November 2001. This includes an assessment of the merits of already tabled proposals on market access. Specifically, the EU is pushing for an overall average tariff reduction of 36 per cent. in the agriculture negotiations, and a reduction of tariffs on non-agricultural goods to a maximum of 15 per cent. The EU is also pushing for all developed countries to fulfil their commitment to grant duty and quota free access for all products excluding arms originating in least developed countries.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.3/3">To ensure that trade rules benefit all individual developing countries, any new rules will have to consider the particular needs of countries in terms of development, food security and poverty reduction. For example, the current draft of WTO agricultural trade rules includes a number of special and differential provisions for developing countries, such as lower (subsidy and tariff) reduction commitments and longer implementation periods. Some provisions also aim to protect developing countries' food security by naming &quot;special products&quot; which would be subject to less market opening.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.3/4">The UK is a strong advocate of trade reform and a supporter of special and differential rules for developing countries. The recently agreed package of CAP reform is important in delinking subsidies from production which will help reduce the unfair competition against third parties, particularly developing countries.</p>

Durham providing onbound access to both community, L. A. and business users. The Cumbria and Lancashire Education Online have also helped the small rural communities of Hawkhead and Coniston. The Buckfastleigh project is using a mixture of fixed-line and wireless connections. Jeff Joseph Sale Moor Technology College, Cheshire, has established an open-to-all wireless broadband access point located in a council house in the centre of a local estate. The wireless network is intended to give broadband access from anywhere in the college and up to 5km in to the local community.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.5/2">The choice of which generating plant to use to meet their contracts with electricity suppliers is a commercial matter for the electricity generating companies.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/3">Electricity generators face limits imposed by the environment Agency on a variety of emissions with environmental impacts. Examples of emissions limited by the Agency in this way include sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, emissions of which are generally higher from coal plant than from other types of generation.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/4">Coal fired generation also produces higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions than most other forms of generation. The Agency does not set limits for emissions of carbon dioxide from power stations. However, a trading scheme for carbon dioxide emissions is due to be launched by the European Union in January 2005. This scheme will cover all fossil fuelled power stations and will give generators direct financial incentives to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/5">Our February 2003 Energy White Paper sets out our strategy for using competitive markets to reconcile environmental considerations with the electricity needs of homes and businesses. The White Paper stated that,</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/6" class="indent">&quot;we will make the new trading scheme a central plank of our future emissions reduction policies, through which the traded carbon market can set a signal for the value of carbon reductions in the economy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/7">Although there are at present no direct incentives on electricity generators to reduce carbon emissions, we have put in place a number of other policies to encourage environmentally friendly forms of generation. The most significant of these policies are <i>(a)</i> the Renewables Obligation, launched in April 2002, which encourages electricity suppliers to contract for increasing quantities of power from renewable sources and <i>(b)</i> exemption from the climate change levy of electricity from renewable source and from good quality combined heat and power plant.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/8">The electricity sector has made significant progress in reducing environmentally harmful emissions over the past decade. Between 1990 and 2002, its emissions of carbon dioxide fell by about 20 per cent. and between 1990 and 2001 its emissions of sulphur dioxide fell by about 73 per cent. (figures for 2002 are not yet available).

	<p pid=".27W.14/1">Following the Hatfield derailment, Network Rail (then Railtrack), the infrastructure controller, made two significant changes to the way railway maintenance safety standards are managed on the railways. The first specified more detailed and prescriptive requirements for the inspection and rectification of rails exhibiting rolling contact fatigue. The second involved the implementation of more stringent requirements for general track inspections to enable better monitoring of rail condition.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.14/2">Network Rail is fundamentally changing the way it manages rail maintenance. Its New Maintenance Programme ensures that Network Rail decides what work is completed and when. Network Rail is also taking direct control of three maintenance contract areas. This will give Network Rail clearer control of the works being completed and will help provide a safer, more reliable and efficient railway infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid=".31W.5/1">My Department is only responsible for road projects in England outside London. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State's, statement to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-09">9 July</phrase> made clear our commitment to improving the nation's roads and other forms of transport, in both the immediate and the longer terms.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.5/2">The Government's Target Programme of Improvements currently contains 72 major trunk road improvement proposals tackling congestion, providing safety benefits and relieving communities of traffic. Since June last year, 12 other major trunk road schemes have been opened. A number of other major trunk road improvements have been proposed, mainly through the multi-modal study process. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's announcement covered 11 of these studies. The Highways Agency have been asked to do further development work on over 30 road proposals, includingactive traffic management and other technology related improvements on various parts of the motorway and trunk road network. Similar work is also being carried out on other projects following our responses to eight other multi-modal studies within the last two years.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.5/3">Since December 2000, over 60 major road schemes, often bringing safety and quality of life benefits, have been proposed by local authorities and received provisional or full approval by the Government to proceed. We are expecting around 20 further such proposals to be submitted as part of this year's Local Transport Settlement process.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.8/1">Sustainable tourism is relevant to all tourism areas, including coastal resorts, historic and modern cities, rural areas and man-made visitor attractions. We set out the policy framework necessary to achieve progress in the Tomorrow's Tourism strategy. To implement sustainable tourism requires action by a wide range of partners, including Government Departments and their agencies, Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), local authorities, the tourism industry and organisations with environmental, conservation or social exclusion remits. Actions initiated by DCMS include giving VisitBritain a remit to market England to encourage domestic tourism and the 'Fitness for Purpose' initiative to provide customers with a firmer assurance that hotels, and the restaurants within them, are fit for trading. RDAs are promoting sustainable tourism as part of their enhanced role in the strategic leadership of tourism, which links with their statutory remit for sustainable development. Local authorities can help promote sustainable tourism through spatial planning and approaches to visitor management and Business Links provide practical guidance to tourism businesses on matters such as energy efficiency and reducing waste. Everyone has something to contribute towards achieving sustainable tourism in every part of the country and it is in everyone's interest to do so.</p>

Through DWP's efforts the scheme has been promoted by VisitBritain, both on its web site and in an e-mail newsletter sent to 200,000 tourism businesses, and by the Tourism Skills Network, who advertised the award on its web site.

	<p pid=".39W.3/1">In October 2004 the final phase of Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 comes into force. Organisations that provide a service to the public, which includes most small businesses in the tourism sector, are required to tackle physical features that make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled customer to use their service.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/2">However, the DDA only requires service providers to make &quot;reasonable&quot; adjustments. The Act allows flexibility for service providers in considering how to make their services accessible to disabled people. All circumstances would be considered when interpreting what is &quot;reasonable&quot;, including the cost of an adjustment, its practicality, and the extent of a service provider's resources. What might be considered reasonable for a national hotel chain may not be so for a small guesthouse. Financial incentives should not therefore be needed, apart from the clear business case for providing good service for disabled people and their family and friends, whose overall annual spending power is estimated at &pound;45 billion.</p>

The performance of each project is monitored during its lifetime to ensure agreed output targets are achieved.

Court hearings are held to determine these questions. A CAFCASS practitioner represents the interests of a child during proceedings. The court considers all the evidence before it, including CAFCASS reports, and makes the decision about the child's future. At the end of April 2003, CAFCASS were dealing with 12,245 public law cases (care, adoption, freeing orders and guardianship) that were at various stages between application and final hearing. Information on how many children are awaiting hearings on future guardianship is not held centrally and could not be collected without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

Friend on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-16">16 June 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-06-16.46"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 46&ndash;7W</phrase>, were not accurate. The correct figures are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/2">In the calendar year 2000, the British embassy in Damascus received 815 student applications. Of these, 535 visas were successful. In the financial year 2001&ndash;2002, 845 student applications were received and 502 visas were issued. In the financial year 2002&ndash;2003, 657 student applications were received and 432 visas were issued.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/3">The number of visit visa applications received in Damascus in the calendar year 2000 was 5,720. Of these 4,263 were successful. In the financial year 2001&ndash;2002, 3,758 applications were received and 3,525 visas were issued. In the financial year 2002&ndash;2003, 5,068 applications were received and of these 4,208 were successful.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/4">In the calendar year 2000, our embassy in Damascus received 140 settlement applications. Of these, 71 were successful. In the financial year 2001&ndash;2002 165 applications were received and 178 visas were issued. This apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that applications can be carried forward from one month to the next before being resolved. In the financial year 2002&ndash;2003, 368 applications for settlement in the United Kingdom were received. Of these, 280 were successful.</p>

However, the Forum's section in Western Sahara had been inoperative and effectively without a membership for over a year.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.2/2">Some former members of the Forum continue to monitor the situation in Western Sahara and to undertake case work.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.2/3">As the British Government would never have had access to the Forum's membership record and effectively the Western Sahara section of the Forum no longer exists we are therefore unable to comment on the number of former members of the Forum, their current locations or activities. We are aware of specific cases involving individuals previously associated with the dissolved section, for example, Ali Salem Tamek whose case officials have raised with the Moroccan authorities.</p>

The service will provide coverage of both Chambers, sittings in Westminster Hall, and some Select and Standing Committees. Audio and video coverage will be available for any committees that are televised. Audio-only coverage will be provided for most other committees. Therefore, if a committee chooses to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny, or if a special committee is appointed for that purpose, it is likely that its proceedings will be webcast either in audio-only or both in audio and video.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.6/2">Any material webcast will be available on demand from an archive that will hold about 14 days' worth of material. There are plans to make the webcasting service available to all users of the parliamentary network, but this is dependent on an upgrade to the network that is planned for this summer, which will provide greater transmission capacity.</p>

	<p pid=".61W.5/1">There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the United Kingdom or the European Union. A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000) indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.5/2">The Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 created a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling someone through prostitution, the relevant sections of which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-10">10 February 2003</phrase>. Given that the powers came into effect very recently there is not any information yet held centrally about numbers of victims of this crime. Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic given the reluctance of the victims of trafficking to report to the police.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.5/3">The current pilot project for victims of trafficking will provide us with a clearer idea on scale of trafficking problem and enable better assessment to be made of the needs of victims.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.0/1">The White Paper &quot;Secure Borders Safe Haven&quot;, published last year, set out a comprehensive approach for supporting the victims of trafficking. It included a commitment to make arrangements for victim protection and support.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.0/2">In March this year we established a pilot scheme, working with Eaves Housing, a voluntary sector organisation, to provide support and assistance to victims of trafficking to enable them to make an informed decision about co-operating with the authorities. The pilot scheme will initially run on a trial basis for a period of six months so that we can evaluate its impact.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.0/3">Under the terms of the scheme victims are referred to Eaves housing by the police, via a voluntary organisation or self-referred. There is an assessment made of their needs and they get information about the consequences of co-operating with a prosecution. Their immigration status is considered, and it is recognised that if they co-operate with the authorities then it may be appropriate to allow them to remain in the United Kingdom. This assessment is made on a case by case basis. If they decide to return home, arrangements are made through the International Organisation for Migration, which has a well established voluntary assisted return programme, to assist the woman to reintegrate back into her home society.</p>

A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000) indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.</p>
	<p pid=".62W.3/2">The Government have announced their intention to tackle the heinous crime of trafficking through a four-pronged approach set out in the White Paper 'Secure Borders Safe Haven' published last year. This approach encompasses legislation, enforcement, victim support and international co-operation. In the context of this last point, the UK has been working hard to push trafficking up the international agenda. We were at the forefront of work to draft the United Nations trafficking protocol and subsequent EU framework decision on trafficking. We have been closely involved in Europol's work to counter trafficking including establishing a joint intelligence sharing team with Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands on Bulgarian trafficking gangs. The UK also hosted the first EU prosecutors conference on trafficking last year and are closely involved in follow up work. We are also actively shaping EU consideration of next steps on trafficking through the formation of a new experts group on trafficking that the UK is helping to steer towards tangible action to tackle this form of organised crime.</p>

More detailed local studies are now under way in most areas, which will help in more detailed assessment of infrastructure requirements. Further discussions with the water industry have taken place since publication of the Sustainable Communities Plan and these will continue involving the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Water UK, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the individual water companies concerned, the Environment Agency and OFWAT.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.3/2">However, the Labour Force Survey shows that 69 per cent. of disabled people receiving Incapacity Benefit and 78 per cent. of lone parents receiving Income Support have qualifications below level 2.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.3/3">This is why Jobcentre Plus training is strongly focused on basic skills and more appropriately targeted training, ensuring that this is linked to the labour market rather than just a qualification. Our evidence suggests that a Level 2 qualification is not, in general, the most significant milestone in terms of employability. There is a much bigger difference in terms of employment rates between those with no qualifications and a qualification of any kind, and particularly between those with or without basic skills, than between Level 2 and lower qualifications.</p>

Enforcement by health and safety inspectors is an essential element of the basic framework, which has stood the test of time. The possibility of contracting out health and safety inspection was however, considered and rejected in the course of the 1996 quinquennial review.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.5/1">None. We believe that the current rules are fair. The changes we have made ensure that for most people the benefits they receive for every day living are not touched while they are in hospital. This recognises that hospital in-patients are likely to have on-going costs of maintaining their homes. Disability living allowance and attendance allowance, however, help with the disability-related needs of severely disabled people. These needs are met by the national health service when the recipients are in hospital, and so payment of these benefits stops after 4 weeks. Entitlement to carer's allowance can continue throughout breaks in care for holidays or for hospitalisation of the carer or disabled person. Provided the DUVAA remains in payment, these breaks can total 12 weeks in a period of 26 weeks.</p>

Individual contract reviews are conducted by Jobcentre Plus contract managers and District Programme Quality Management Teams. Reviews assess the administration, delivery, quality and propriety of the provision being delivered against the requirements set out in providers' contracts. In addition, the Adult Learning Inspectorate in England, and Estyn in Wales, play a pivotal role in the quality assurance of New Deal provision, under the provisions of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. All inspection under the requirements of the Act is carried out in accordance with the Common Inspection Framework. The framework focuses on the learner, and on evaluating the effectiveness of education and training in meeting all learners' needs.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.2/3">New Deal providers who fail to meet their contractual requirements, or who fall below accepted quality levels, are subject to thorough improvement strategies and action plans agreed between them and Jobcentre Plus. Where no improvements have taken place within agreed timescales, action is taken to terminate the contract in accordance with contractual terms and conditions. When re-tendering or extending contracts, such quality issues are considered and, where relevant evidence exists, this is considered as part of the decision to award or extend. Where a serious irregularity or fraud is identified, Jobcentre Plus retains the right to terminate contracts with immediate effect.</p>

The order in which households are contacted has been designed to produce a controlled and measured build up of applications, evenly distributed throughout the UK. The households to be contacted before October represent a cross section of the pensioner population, including pensioners of all age groups and likely levels of eligibility for pension credit. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. As part of a separate exercise, The Pension Service also began in April to write to pensioners to invite them to convert to direct payment into an account.

	<p pid=".82W.3/1">The actuarial basis for the minimum funding requirement (MFR) is kept under review by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries. They have recommended two substantive changes to the basis since May 1997, and both were implemented. From <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-15">15 June 1998</phrase> the factor for the equity market value adjustment, which generally applies to the calculation of liabilities for scheme members below pension age, was reduced from 4.25 per cent. to 3.25 per cent. and the gross yield on the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index was replaced with the net yield on the same index. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-07">7 March 2002</phrase> the factor for the equity market value adjustment was further reduced, from 3.25 per cent. to 3.00 per cent. The changes were intended to address movements in the strength of the MFR test resulting from changing economic and demographic trends. In addition to these changes there have been a number of minor technical amendments to the actuarial guidance which governs the calculation of a scheme's MFR liabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.3/2">It is not possible to define a typical pension scheme, but estimates <sup>1</sup> about the effect of these changes on the aggregated MFR funding levels of all schemes subject to the MFR have been prepared by the Government Actuary's Department. These indicate that the change which took effect from <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-15">15 June 1998</phrase> may have increased aggregate funding levels against the MFR by around 5 per cent. and that the change which took effect in March 2002 may have further increased aggregate funding levels against the MFR by around 3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.2/1">The Health and Safety Executive has recently taken over responsibility from DEFRA for the registration and assessment of rodenticides under the Control of Pesticides Regulations. Five Government Departments are signatories to these regulations, DWP, DEFRA, DH, Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The policy lead for vertebrates and wildlife issues remains with DEFRA. Rodenticides will be among the first chemicals to be reviewed under the EU Biocidal Products Directive next year and controls under this Directive will replace those that currently exist under the Control of Pesticides Regulations. HSE is the Competent Authority for the Biocidal Products Directive in the UK. The evaluation of products includes an assessment of the possible effects to non-target species.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/2">The HSE has produced guidance on the safe use of rodenticides on farms and holdings, and is currently compiling specific guidance for the safe use of rodenticides in urban areas. A copy has been placed in the Library. Information and advice for the user of a rodenticide on how a product should be applied is given on the product label, and is specific for each product.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.2/3">The enforcement of the Control of Pesticides Regulations is split between the relevant enforcing bodies, which include HSE, Local Authorities and DEFRA. Which authority carries out the enforcement action is dependant on whether the product was used by a member of the public or someone employed to carry out a treatment, where the product was used and whether people, animals or the environment could have been affected by the treatment. The HSE free leaflet 'Reporting Incidents of Exposure to Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines' (INDG14) provides advice to members of the public on which body to contact and is available from HSE Books. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

My Department also funds the School Governors' One Stop Shop which was established in November 1999 to recruit governors with business and management skills for inner city schools in Excellence in Cities (EiC) areas. In September 2002 this remit was extended to a number of other areas known to have serious vacancy problems.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/3">Under my Department's National Strategy for Training and Supporting School Governors the first priority was to develop a National Training Programme for New Governors to ensure that all governors have the information they need to fulfil their statutory functions. The programme, which is delivered by LEA governor trainers, has been operating since September 2001. A Clerks' National Training Programme, developed for the Department by Consortium 52, a partnership involving LEAs in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humberside regions, together with the local diocesan bodies, is being rolled out to LEAs this summer. The programme supports a national job description for clerks, agreed after extensive consultation last year, and should increase awareness of this important role as well as ensure that clerks have the necessary skills and knowledge to support governing bodies effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/4">The third strand of the strategy is a National Development Programme for Heads and Chairs, which is currently being developed by the Eastern Leadership Centre (an Affiliated Centre for the National College of School Leadership) in partnership with governor services in nine eastern region LEAs in association with local Anglican and Catholic dioceses. The programme will provide skills training for chairs as well as joint development for heads and chairs linked to supporting a school improvement activity in the participants' schools, to develop joint leadership and effective team working. The Programme is due to be delivered to the Department at the end of March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.2/5">All of these programmes build on existing good practice, provide mixed media resources, and offer self study as well as taught course materials to cater for a wide variety of preferred learning styles and access arrangements.</p>

It includes television and media advertising, a variety of customised information and materials, a national order line and a website with order facility. Local authorities promote careers in child care using a range of materials and events, working with local partners such as Jobcentre Plus, Careers Services, providers and sector organisations to provide practical help to potential recruits.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.5/1">Prior to April 2003, cross border disputes arose typically because of differences between local education authorities' (LEAs') eligibility criteria and grant distribution. Guidance issued by the Sure Start Unit encourages LEAs to make reciprocal arrangements or otherwise to consider funding on a case by case basis. Nursery education funding is now allocated to LEAs through their Education Formula Spending Share. This is calculated on the basis of the latest data on pupil numbers and reflects provision for all children taking up a free place, regardless of where they live. From April 2004, there should be no need for reciprocal arrangements since all LEAs will have a statutory duty to provide a free nursery education place for every three year old whose parents want one.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.5/2">The Government are allocating resources to develop children centres, and to create 43,000 new child care places&mdash;&pound;435 million in this spending review period, including &pound;317 million capital. Local authorities are responsible for deciding how and where children's centre services will be delivered. The majority of centres will be developed from sure start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and early excellence centres. However, the sure start unit is also encouraging development from other existing provision in the maintained, voluntary and private sectors. Local authority strategic plans are due by mid October 2003; we cannot estimate what proportion of centres will be fully funded by DfES until these are received.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.5/1">The National Literacy Strategy (together with the National Numeracy Strategy) has transformed standards in our primary schools and the 2002 test results at age seven and 11 were the best ever. Nationally, 75 per cent. of pupils achieved level four or above in the 2002 Key Stage 2 English tests, 10 percentage points more than in 1998. Compared to 1998, about 60,000 more 11-year olds achieved the expected level for their age in English.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.5/3">The improvement of literacy standards of pupils in Wandsworth LEA is broadly in line with the national improvement. In 1998 64 per cent. of pupils achieved level four or above in English at Key Stage 2. In 2002 the figure was 73 per cent. The Key Stage 2 results are provided at national, LEA, and school level.

	<p pid=".106W.5/2">The number of regular teachers in the maintained sector in England increased by 24,800 between January 1997 and January 2003 (provisional). The number of teachers with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) rose by 12,500. The number of teachers with professional qualifications obtained in countries outside the European Economic Area and instructors with special qualifications or experience of particular skills or subjects rose by 8,500. The remaining 3,800 of the increase is comprised of mature career-changers working towards QTS while working as teachers on employment-based training routes like the graduate teacher programme. These routes, which were first established in 1998, already provide over 10 per cent. of all newly-qualified teachers. Since autumn 2000, the earliest date for which these data are available, over 5,000 teachers on employment-based training programmes have been awarded QTS. Almost 900 of those have gained QTS since January 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".106W.5/3">Data about teachers by phase of employment for January 2003 are not yet available in the form requested. Of the 24,800 increase 5,800 were in the maintained nursery and primary phase, 17,600 were in the maintained secondary phase and 1,400 were in maintained special schools, pupil referral units or education elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.5/1">The Department of Health is responsible for the provision of eye checks undertaken by local primary health care teams in accordance with professional advice. The principal threats to eye health and impaired vision development should be detected, at or before school age, through health development checks or through a visual screening on school entry. Older children may develop myopia (short sight) which is usually recognised when they complain of difficulty seeing clearly at distance. Since the onset of myopia commonly occurs between the ages of nine and 16 it is not possible to identify optimum ages for screening. Children may &quot;pass&quot; a routine screening examination only to find problems within the next few months. Whenever parents or carers suspect that there is a problem with their child's sight they should take them to an optician. All children up to the age of 15 are entitled to free sight tests, as are children aged 16&ndash;18 if they are in full time education.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.5/2">The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice provides practical advice to local education authorities, maintained schools and others on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's special educational needs, including for children with visual impairment. The Code aims to promote consistency of approach, but, within its guidelines, it is for schools and LEAs to determine appropriate intervention based on an assessment of each child's individual needs and circumstances.</p>

Since October 2000 the freephone advice line has advised over 8 million young people, around 50 per cent. of who were boys.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.3/1">The most recent data for 2001 shows a 10 per cent. reduction in the under 18 conception rate and an 11 per cent. fall in the under 16 conception rate since 1998, the baseline year for the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. Participation of teenage parents in education, training or employment has doubled from 16 per cent. to 33 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/2">These are early encouraging signs of progress towards meeting the Government's target to halve the under 18 conception rate by 2010 and increase to 60 per cent. the participation of teenage parents to reduce their long term risk of social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/3">However, evidence suggests that it takes many years to bring out the societal and behavioural changes required. That is why the Government have set out a 10-year Strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.0/1">The primary purpose of all major incident exercises is to identify lessons that can be used internally as a means of improving plans and training in all participating organisations. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) ensures that rigorous debriefing takes place following such events and that specific lessons are identified and shared with national health service and other participating organisations. An executive summary of the report of exercises&mdash;specifically identifying any general lessons learnt&mdash;will be placed on the HPA website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk">www.hpa.org.uk</a> to ensure that the information is more widely disseminated.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.0/1">Further to the discovery of the use of hydrolysed proteins from non-chicken origin in chicken products on sale in the UK in late 2001, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) undertook a co-ordinated enforcement exercise with 20 local authorities. The exercise targeted those companies and products where use of hydrolysed proteins of non-chicken origin had previously been found. The results indicated that of the 25 formal samples taken, 12 tested positive for non-chicken DNA (either pork or in one case pork and beef).</p>
	<p pid=".116W.0/2">The FSA is taking action to reduce the use of hydrolysed proteins of non-chicken origin in chicken products. As a result of the enforcement exercise, local authorities are taking follow-up action with the importers and suppliers of mislabelled chicken products, and will be making regular checks. The companies using these hydrolysed proteins can be identified from the licensed health marks used on these products, therefore the FSA is also working closely with the Dutch authorities to increase sampling and inspection of these manufacturers. Formal action has recently been taken against five Dutch processors. Following FSA pressure, the European Commission has agreed to improve rules on labelling of meat products with added water, but the FSA is calling in addition for a limit on added water of 15 per cent. and a ban the use of non-poultry proteins in this type of poultry product.</p>

The Data Protection Act 1998 provides individuals with a right of access to their health records. However there are certain circumstances in which the record holder may withhold information.</p>
	<p pid=".121W.5/3">Access may be denied, or limited, where the information might cause serious harm to the physical or mental health or condition of the patient, or any other person, or where giving access would disclose information relating to or provided by a third person who had not consented to the disclosure. The decision over whether to grant or withhold access must be made by individual record holders. However individuals do have recourse to the NHS complaints procedure if they feel that their application for access has not been dealt with appropriately.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.6/1">The Government are committed to improving the care, treatment and management of people with personality disorder. One component of the work is the provision of appropriate assessment and treatment services for the small number of people with severe personality disorder (probably less than 2,500 nationally) who pose a continued risk to others. New facilities, in both prisons and secure psychiatric hospitals, will evaluate what the most effective methods of treatment are and consider how people can be helped back into society. This is known as the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.6/2">In addition, &quot;Personality disorder: no longer a diagnosis of exclusion&quot;&mdash;policy implementation guidance for the development of services for people with personality disorder&mdash;was published by National Institute for Mental Health in England in January 2003. This guidance builds on standards four and five in the national service framework for mental health and sets out how services for people with personality disorder should be developed. It brings this often neglected and isolated area of mental health into focus for the first time.</p>

The term 'independent health care' refers to private or voluntary establishments or agencies that provide care by medical practitioners, and such providers are registered as independent hospitals, independent clinics or independent medical agencies.

These include increased scope of regulation, a single regulator to promote consistency of application, national minimum standards and powers to inspect clinical performance. This will continue under CHAI.</p>

	<p pid=".127W.5/1">In January 2000, the Government consulted on what the legal position should be on the physical punishment of children, in Protecting Children, Supporting Parents. There were over 830 responses to the consultation in England, over 500 of these from individuals. The consultation did not specifically ask about smacking behaviour. However, the results showed that about 70 per cent. of individual respondents were in favour of keeping the status quo with regard to the smacking of children by parents.</p>
	<p pid=".127W.5/2">A 1998 Office for National Statistics (ONS) Omnibus Survey of attitudes towards physical punishment found that 88 per cent. of respondents agreed that it is sometimes necessary to smack a naughty child.</p>

	<p pid=".129W.9/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking if it is policy to use the One Number Census process to determine population in the future. (124747)</p>
	<p pid=".129W.9/4" class="indent">In the UK, the mid-year population estimates are based on an internationally accepted and widely employed demographic method. Using this method, estimates are produced by updating from a census base allowing for births, deaths and net migration. This basic method will continue to be employed in the future. However, we are continuing with research into improving our methods of estimating the components of population change between the censuses. The 2001 census showed we need to be much better at this. In particular the Office for National Statistics published on the 9th July a study looking at the future of population statistics; this is available on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Methodologybytheme/DemStatSer21STCen.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/Methodology by theme/Dem Stat Ser 21ST Cen.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".129W.9/5" class="indent">Further, a National Statistics Quality Review on International Migration Statistics is nearing completion and this will make recommendations on improving the accuracy of these statistics, which are the most difficult component of population change to measure accurately.</p>
	<p pid=".129W.9/6" class="indent">A research programme, the Census Strategic Development Programme, has been established to co-ordinate the future development of the census. This programme will explore the modifications to a traditional census, taking account of the lessons from the 2001 census and harnessing modern technologies. Other potential options are being explored including: a rolling census, covering successive sections of the population; a sample census, only ever covering a percentage of the population; producing statistics from existing person-based data held by government for administrative purposes; or some combination of these. The first phase of this research will result in recommendations in late 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".129W.9/7" class="indent">The One Number Census process added considerably to our knowledge of the quality of the census at a local authority level. However, in the future it will be possible to place even more emphasis on producing measures of quality. This will be a critical shift in determining future actions.</p>
