	<p pid="c.1017W.2/2">&quot;World-class Apprenticeships&quot; confirmed our commitment to making apprenticeships a top-quality option for both young people and adults and set out steps to increase the numbers of people undertaking adult apprenticeships. In the summer we published a Draft Apprenticeships Bill to underpin and help sustain the improvements in the quality of the programme. Through this proposed legislation we aim to ensure that apprenticeships are a badge of quality skills for young people, for adults and for employers. The legislation will also drive forward the provision of sufficient apprenticeship places to meet the entitlement for our young people to have an offer of an apprenticeship place by 2013. Last year we abolished the upper age limit for apprenticeships and we are increasing Apprenticeships funding to over &pound;1 billion between 2007-08 and 2010-11. Expanding apprenticeships will play a key role in improving the nation's skills base and we plan to deliver over 250,000 apprenticeship starts and 190,000 successful completions by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="c.1017W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-07">7 August</phrase> this year my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills announced Government proposals to cut red tape concerning Apprenticeships in response to employers' concerns. We will remove unnecessary bureaucracy such as demands to store paperwork for up to six years; multiple inspection visits; and minimise reporting requirements at the earliest possible opportunity. In line with the successful actions of some of Britain's leading employers, we will introduce improvements including more efficient use of electronic audit and storage, simpler and faster registration and certification processes, and more streamlined payment and reporting systems. These practical measures will enable more employers to meet their present and future skills needs, unimpeded by time-consuming and costly administration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1017W.5/2">We are also working with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, who recently surveyed SMEs to establish how the new National Apprenticeship Service can better meet the needs of employers. The survey focused on, although was not limited to, reducing the administrative burden on business. Together we will consider how best to incorporate the recommendations coming out of the survey.</p>

	<p pid="c.1018W.2/1">The level of additional learning support (ALS) based on the new funding methodology was finalised through the negotiation and allocation process between the Learning and Skills Council and Chelmsford college as part of wider discussions on overall funding allocations for the college. This resulted in the final funding allocation being agreed for 2008/09. ALS is part of the overall funding allocation for Chelmsford college. The overall funding allocation for the college (including ALS) is &pound;9.7 million in 2008/09 (an increase of 3.7 per cent. compared to 2007/08).</p>
	<p pid="c.1018W.2/2">Changes to the way ALS was calculated for 2008/09 were made following consultation across the full range of FE colleges and providers. These changes were introduced to ensure that the funding was better focused on need rather than purely on an historical basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1018W.2/3">We recognise that with any change to funding approach there is a period of transition and to allow for this and to minimise the impact on colleges' budgets only 60 per cent. of ALS has been distributed using the formula approach in 2008/09. The remaining 40 per cent. has been allocated on the basis of the historical proportion of the budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.1019W.0/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) use a national funding system in which national rates determine the amount of public funding payable for courses funded through the 16-18, adult learner and employer responsive funding models. The actual funding a college or provider receives for a particular course is based on the number of hours required to complete the course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1019W.0/2">Learners aged 16-18 at the start of their programme will be entitled to full fee remission and therefore will not be charged fees. Adult learners (aged 19 or over) in receipt of income-related benefits will be eligible for full fee remission. Those who are not eligible for fee remission will be expected to contribute towards the cost of the course in line with the national fee assumption. For the 2008/09 academic year the national fee assumption is 42.5 per cent. of the national funding rate, increasing to 47.5 per cent. in 2009/10.</p>
	<p pid="c.1019W.0/3">While a college or provider receives the national fee assumption affecting the level of public funding, it is for colleges and providers to determine the actual fee charged. It is therefore not possible to provide a breakdown of the fees charged to adult learners doing A-levels either at national level or by college.</p>

	<p pid="c.1020W.0/1">Trade unions have a key role to play in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this more effectively we introduced the union learning fund in 1998. This source of funding is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and training providers to encourage greater take-up of learning at work and boost their own capacity as learning organisations. The level of funding in each of the last three financial years has been as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.1020W.0/4"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1020W.0/5"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>15.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1020W.0/6"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>16.9</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.1020W.0/7"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>18.4</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1020W.0/10">With the help of the union learning fund, trade unions and their union learning representatives have been able to develop successful partnerships with employers to raise skill levels in the workplace. There are now over 20,500 trained union learning reps who have helped over 600,000 workers back into learning since the fund was introduced. Over 200,000 were helped last year, many from those hard to reach groups, who employers and training providers find it so difficult to engage with, including over 34,000 workers with poor basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.0/11">Union learning representatives and other trade union representatives and officers can also access LSC funded training, delivered through a network of approved colleges, to help them carry out their duties more effectively. There is no separate budget allocated for this type of training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice have no plans to review the law in this area. If a person of sound mind freely and voluntarily administers a drug to himself, it would not be appropriate for the law to hold the supplier of the drug responsible for that decision. In the case of R <i> v.</i> Kennedy (No 2) [&quot;2007] UKHL 38 the defendant was found guilty of supplying a controlled drug. That is a serious offence reflecting the harm that controlled drugs can do. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment, or a fine, or both. The defendant was sentenced to three years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.2/2">In this particular case, the person supplied subsequently died as a result of taking the drug. But the conviction for manslaughter was not upheld on appeal, because administering the drug was the decision of the deceased and the appellant could not be said to have committed a criminal act which had been a significant cause of the deceased's death.</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.2/1">All prisoners are assessed at the point of reception into prison and those at risk of having a mental health problem, or vulnerable to suicide, are referred for a mental health assessment to the mental health in-reach team. Nearly &pound;20 million a year is being invested recurrently in mental health in-reach. There are 102 mental health in-reach teams with all prisons having access to them: a total of 360 extra staff altogether.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.2/2">There are new systems to monitor and support those at risk of harming themselves, and prison officers are being trained in mental health awareness. &pound;600,000 has been invested over three years to 2009 to train frontline prison staff. Investment (&pound;308 million in 2006-07 and &pound;336 million in 2007-08) is also being made in four close supervision centres (CSC) at Whitemoor, Wakefield, Woodhill and Long Lartin prisons to deliver mental health care to those prisoners whose offending behaviour and history mean that containment in secure isolated accommodation is the only option.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.2/3">Furthermore, in relation to the small number of people with a severe personality disorder who are dangerous, the Department of Health and Ministry of Justice are investing in special secure services. The programme has a capacity of over 300 places in two high security prisons (Frankland and Whitemoor), a female prison (Low Newton in Durham) and two high security hospitals (Broadmoor and Rampton). They provide essential clinical services for dangerous offenders whose offending is linked to severe personality disorder.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.10/1">The Highways Agency continues to monitor the performance of the A38 between Marsh Mills, Plymouth and South Brent to improve its operation and safety. This includes discussion with key stakeholders including Plymouth city council. The closures and improvements detailed in this answer have evolved from this process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.10/2">Between (and including) Marsh Mills junction and South Brent junction, a distance of approximately 20 kilometres, there are seven eastbound and eight westbound locations where access to or egress from the A38 trunk road is possible. The current position at these locations is:</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.10/3"><i> (a)</i> The Highways Agency has recently consulted on the permanent closure of the A38 Voss Farm eastbound access slip road and is in the process of making an order to authorise its permanent closure. This access slip road has been temporarily closed since June 2007. Although the accident data do not support the closure of the Voss Farm westbound slip roads, their possible closure will be considered as part of improvements required to accommodate additional development growth for Deep Lane.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.10/4">The current accident data for the other locations do not support further slip road closure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.10/5"><i> (b)</i> A recent accident study for Marsh Mills recommends improvement to the signing, lining and skid resistance of the road surface at this junction and this work is currently being designed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.10/6">At Deep Lane, the junction improvement work has been undertaken. This consists of the installation of traffic signals and realignment works to accommodate the construction of the Langage Power Station. The westbound access slip safety study will be completed this autumn.

	<p pid="c.1034W.2/1">The Highways Agency has estimated the annual cost of cleaning the M25 motorway in the financial year 2007-08 as &pound;1.272 million. Data are not collated or held in a format which provides a breakdown of costs for the cleaning of individual roads within the Highways Agency's Area 5 network. The figure for cleaning the M25 is therefore only an approximation based on the proportion of network to costs. The M25 forms just under half (49.92 per cent.) of the Area 5 network.</p>

Decisions on the nature, priority and timing of improvements to the M6 and the need for any further investigation works, such as looking at relocating junctions, will be made following the conclusions of this work.</p>

	<p pid="c.1036W.11/1">In our White Paper &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot; published in July 2007 we confirmed the policy of capping most regulated fares to RPI plus 1 per cent. until 2014.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.11/2">But we are never complacent about issues that affect rail passengers. The previous Secretary of State for Transport asked Passenger Focus to address how well the current system of fares and ticketing meets passenger expectations so that we can consider options for further improvements.

	<p pid="c.1038W.11/1">The estimated range of construction costs for one mile of three-lane motorway with a continuous hard shoulder is from &pound;21.4 million to &pound;35.0 million. This compares with a range of &pound;19.3 million to &pound;31.5 million for a three-lane motorway without hard shoulder. The estimated rates cover the construction costs of a new dual three-lane rural motorway including detail design costs and statutory undertakers' diversions, but excluding land costs, VAT and the Highways Agency's agent and administration costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.11/2">The Highways Agency does not hold estimates for the costs of construction of a new motorway with emergency refuges at any distance, as they have never undertaken or considered a project of this type. The M42 Active Traffic Management Pilot cost &pound;9.0 million per mile but this scheme added hard shoulder running and emergency refuge areas at around 500 metres to an existing three-lane motorway with hard shoulder. However, costs will vary on a scheme by scheme basis and so the M42 pilot might not represent the typical cost of adding hard shoulder running with emergency refuge areas at around 500 m.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.11/3">Following the Advanced Motorway Signalling and Traffic Management Feasibility Study, further work is under way to examine in detail the scope for a wider roll-out of dynamic hard shoulder running. This will include analysis of the cost of adding hard shoulder running to existing motorways with emergency refuges at around 800 m.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.0/1">Our current forecasts of UK aviation carbon dioxide emissions were reported in &quot;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 Forecasts&quot;, published in November 2007 and available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/ukairdemandandco2forecasts/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/ukairdemandandco2forecasts/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/3">According to these forecasts, using Stansted's existing runway to the new maximum permitted capacity would result in additional carbon dioxide emissions of around one million tonnes per annum by 2015. This would be equivalent to an increase of less than 1 per cent. in total UK transport emissions, or an increase of around 0.2 per cent. in total UK emissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/4">These forecasts also show that the opening of a second runway at Stansted, which will be the subject of a separate planning inquiry in 2009, would cause the UK's annual carbon dioxide emissions to increase by an additional 2.3 million tonnes per annum, when averaged over the period 2015 to 2075.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/5">The Government's strategy for tackling the climate change impacts of aviation are set out in the 2003 Air Transport White Paper. Our view is that the most effective way of tackling the climate change impacts of aviation is through including the aviation sector in a well designed, international emissions trading regime. This would ensure that any increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector would be matched by a corresponding reduction in another sector, which the aviation industry would pay for.</p>

	<p pid="c.1041W.6/1">We are currently preparing regulations to implement the EU batteries directive. The directive requires greatly increased collection, treatment and recycling of batteries by 2012 with a further target by 2016. In accordance with the directive the UK regulations will require all shops who sell a significant quantity of batteries to collect batteries returned by members of the public. In addition batteries producers will need to set up other collections to meet their targets under the directive.</p>

Trials include establishing 'drop off points at supermarkets, as well as other methods of collection such as at the kerbside.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.6/3">WRAP'S full report on the results from the trials is due shortly and will be available on the WRAP and DEFRA websites. It will be used to help Government and batteries producers to identify the best methods of collecting batteries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1045W.8/1">The legal framework governing public procurement does not allow public bodies to give greater weight to locally produced food and drink when awarding contracts. This is because public bodies are required to ensure public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. It would also reduce competition contrary to UK public procurement policy that is designed to achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1045W.8/2">The legal and policy framework does provide public bodies with plenty of flexibility to be innovative in their procurement and, for example, we are encouraging them through the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI) to increase tendering opportunities for small and local producers. How they can do this is explained in the advice on the PSFPI website, including the guides &quot;Putting it into practice&quot; and &quot;How to increase opportunities for small and local producers when aggregating food procurement&quot;.</p>

However, we understand a study was undertaken by the Environmental Services Association into this issue, but the Department has not seen and does not possess its results.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.5/2">More generally, the operators of incinerators are required by their environmental permits to report periodically on the elemental composition of the bottom ashes produced by the incinerators. These reports do not equate to test results on toxicity testing. The reports are placed on the Environment Agency's Public Register and can be inspected at the Environment Agency's Area offices.</p>

	<p pid="c.1047W.2/1">The links between the Marine Bill and Marine Navigation Bill have been considered and the issue was briefly discussed by the Joint Committee on the Draft Marine Bill during its pre-legislative scrutiny. Work on the Marine Navigation Bill is being led by the Department for Transport. The Marine Bill is concerned with creating and delivering a strategic management framework for the UK's marine resources. By contrast, the Marine Navigation Bill is concerned very specifically with improving safety at sea and in our ports, and with updating the powers of the bodies responsible for maritime safety.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.2/2">Although there is no direct linkage between the Marine Navigation Bill and the Marine Bill, there are possible synergies with the proposals for the setting up of the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) to deliver marine functions around the UK, such as licensing. In this they are complementary, sharing aims of better regulation, but the two Bills are otherwise too different to justify combining them into a single Bill.</p>

The removal of asbestos to enable the installation of insulation measures is judged on a case by case basis, where the cost to remove the asbestos and the improvement of energy efficiency are considered. The costs incurred in undertaking asbestos removal are met using Warm Front funding, but are not assigned to any individual householder's grant monies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.2/2">Eaga and DEFRA have procedures that both directly and indirectly assess the quality of work and associated customer satisfaction in the Warm Front Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.2/3">A works completion certificate must be signed by customers for each measure provided through the Warm Front Scheme. This certificate is a declaration that work is complete and fitted to the satisfaction of the customer. Without a valid signed certificate Eaga will not pay for work invoiced. In addition to this, 100 per cent. of heating works and 5 per cent. of insulation works undertaken through the scheme are independently inspected to ensure they meet the high levels of quality installation expected of the scheme. Installers are required to perform any remedial work identified at inspection within 28 days of notification. Remedial actions resulting in inspection failure have the same timeline imposed and will be re-inspected once action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.2/4">Where a customer may not wish to discuss their concerns directly or face to face, Eaga also provides quality assurance through several other media including e-mail, letter, the availability of customer service staff and related installer management back office support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.2/5">Twice a year Eaga also commissions independent measurement of Warm Front customer satisfaction at each of the six stages of service delivery, commencing with initial contact through to the provision of aftercare.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.2/6">Finally, Eaga carries out several focus groups each year both with Warm Front customers and service delivery staff. Information gleaned is acted on appropriately as part of its commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.2/7">DEFRA itself gauges customer satisfaction through customer opinion polls undertaken by National Energy Action, and also by means of twice yearly audits of the scheme by White Young Green and periodic audits by the National Audit Office.</p>

	<p pid="c.1050W.5/2">Although the Warm Front Scheme household grant limit is set centrally and is applicable across England, the scheme does provide a higher grant of &pound;4,000 for oil central heating for properties off the gas network in view of the additional cost of these installations, in comparison to &pound;2,700 for all other systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.5/3">The prices charged for Warm Front have been set regionally to reflect the local installer market. Installers in each region provided independent quotations for each installation type, and the most economically advantageous quotes (in most instances the lowest) were selected. The prices of these selected tenders were averaged and set as the installer rate for that region.</p>
	<p pid="c.1050W.5/4">These processes were overseen by independent quality assessors, employed by DEFRA, to ensure the prices charged by the scheme are fair and reflect the market rate. These quality assessors have since undertaken reviews of Warm Front pricing to ensure Warm Front charges continue to offer value for money. These reviews are available on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1055W.12/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-22">22 March</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary publicly encouraged increased dialogue between China and Taiwan to resolve differences, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question acceptable to the people on both sides of the Strait. We have taken every opportunity since then to convey these views to the Chinese government, and through unofficial channels, to the Taiwanese authorities. We have given strong support to EU statements to the same end.</p>
	<p pid="c.1055W.12/2">We have also encouraged both sides to find solutions to allow Taiwan's greater participation in selected multilateral forums where this is important to global interests. In particular, we look forward to a solution before next year's World Health Assembly which will allow Taiwan's more effective participation in the global health safety net.</p>

	<p pid="c.1068W.3/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) does not contain any information about criminal records, as this is not necessary for its function of matching DNA from crime scenes with DNA from individuals. Criminal record information is held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Also, before the introduction of the ACPO Criminal Record Retention Guidelines in April 2006, police forces deleted PNC records from some of those convicted of lesser offences after five to 10 years. It is not therefore possible to say either how many of those on the NDNAD did not have a conviction when sampled, or do not currently have a conviction. However, information does exist on the current PNC status of those on the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.3/2">Data obtained from the PNC on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> indicates that 3,832,986 (of the 4,116,713) people had a record retained on the PNC. Of these, 3,259,347 had a conviction, caution, formal warning or reprimand recorded on the PNC.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.3/3">Information is not collected in respect of the number of those with no conviction whose DNA was found at the scene of a crime. Some research information is, however, available on the number of DNA profiles taken from those arrested but not charged and from those arrested, charged but not convicted of an offence that have resulted in a DNA match, thus providing the police with an intelligence link on the possible identity of the offender and assisting in the detection of crimes. In April 2004, an amendment to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 came into effect, which enabled the police to take and retain DNA and fingerprints from persons who had been arrested for a recordable offence. In the period April 2004 to December 2005, the retention of DNA profiles of arrested persons who had not been charged or proceeded against had resulted in matches with crime scene profiles from over 3,000 offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.1068W.3/4">In May 2001, an amendment to PACE came into effect, which enabled the police to retain DNA samples taken from persons who had been charged but not convicted of an offence. In the period May 2001 to December 2005, an estimated 200,000 DNA samples taken from people charged with offences had been retained on the NDNAD, which would previously have had to be removed because of the absence of a conviction. From these, approximately 8,500 profiles of individuals have been linked with crime scene profiles, involving nearly 14,000 offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.6/3">Time spent on patrol refers only to time when an officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Activity (such as advice to a member of the public) carried out whilst on patrol is recorded separately. The percentage of time spent on patrol needs to considered alongside other activities. We use the front-line policing measure to provide a fuller picture of police activity. The measure assesses time spent by all police officers on core policing duties, such as patrol, responding to 999 calls, as well as activities of CIS and specialist officers. While these officers are not always visible to the public, they are nonetheless carrying out core policing duties.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.6/4">In 2006-07 13.6 per cent.<sup>(1)</sup> of officers' time was spent on patrol and 64.2 per cent.<sup>(2)</sup> was spent on front-line policing duties. There were 141,892 police officers in 2006-07.</p>

These officers are now able to deploy Taser in operations or incidents where the use of firearms is not authorised, but where they are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves or the subject.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.9/3">It was also announced that the deployment of Taser to specially trained police units not composed of firearms officers, for use when facing similar threats of violence, would be trialled in 10 police forces. The 12-month trial commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>. The 10 forces are: Avon and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, Gwent, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Metropolitan Police, Northamptonshire, Northumbria, North Wales and West Yorkshire. The trial is currently being evaluated. The 10 forces have been informed that the Government are content for them to continue to use Taser on the same basis as in the trial pending a conclusion on future use.</p>
	<p pid="c.1072W.9/4">The number of incidents of Taser use in England and Wales since its introduction in April 2004, including the number of firings, can be found on the Home Office website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1080W.2/1">These cases are investigated by the Metropolitan Police in London and the police apply for the issue of summonses in cases they decide to prosecute through the courts. These are offences that are specified under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and as such they are reviewed and presented at court by the police court presentation officers. In the event of a plea of not guilty, or if the defendant fails to attend and evidence is to be called, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) takes over the conduct of proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/2">The CPS is guided by the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which is issued under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The CPS applies the code so that it can make fair and consistent decisions about prosecutions. The reviewing crown prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. If the case does not pass that test it will not go ahead. If the case does pass the evidential test the crown prosecutor goes on to consider the second stage test to decide if a prosecution is needed the public interest. The dominant public interest factor that applies in these cases is that of road safety. The crown prosecutor will continue a prosecution when the case has passed both the evidential and the public interest tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/3">Public consultation shows how seriously society views the potential dangers of the use of mobile telephones and other hand-held devices, while driving. The CPS has issued a policy for prosecuting cases of bad driving. In cases where the driver was avoidably dangerously distracted by that use, a charge of dangerous driving is the starting point for charging decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/4">The CPS prosecuted a total of 502 offences of using a mobile telephone while driving in the year 2007-08. The data for 2008 show that in the year 2008-09 538 offences were prosecuted up until and including September 2008. The borough breakdown for 2007-08 is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.1080W.2/45">These figures only represent the cases that the CPS took over from the police because the defendant either pleaded not guilty or failed to attend court and evidence was to be called. A greater number will have pleaded guilty either in person or by post. Those cases will have been prosecuted by the police. The CPS figures show that prosecutions for this type of offending is increasing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1080W.2/46">CPS London has set up a unit specialising in traffic prosecutions. serves a number of courts across London and one court centre will take cases from a number of boroughs. The unit makes best use of its resources by serving a restricted number of court centres only. It has been a great success in many ways but not least because it manages to bring successful prosecutions in an overwhelming number of cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.1081W.2/1">While Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) records include details of proceedings for theft, they provide no discrete count of offences of shoplifting. The Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR) has provided the following table of figures derived from the court proceedings database. The figures show the number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates' courts, and found guilty at all courts, for offences of stealing from shops and stalls (shoplifting) in England and Wales during the years 2004 to 2006, the latest period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1081W.2/2">A range of responses, proportionate to the circumstances of the case, is available for dealing with offences of shoplifting. An offender may be prosecuted, cautioned, or dealt with by way of a fixed penalty notice. The decision to prosecute is taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors. Where a case passes the evidential test set out in the code, a number of public interest factors then weigh in favor of a prosecution. these include: evidence that the offence was premeditated; evidence that the offence was carried out by a group; the defendant's previous convictions or cautions; and any grounds for believing that the offence is likely to be repeated.</p>
	<p pid="c.1081W.2/3">Under the Penalty Notice for Disorder scheme a fixed penalty of &pound;80 can be issued for the shoplifting of goods, normally up to the value of &pound;100. The introduction of fixed penalty notices was welcomed by the police as it enabled them to do their job quickly and to return to patrolling the streets, which is what the public wants them to do.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.5/24" class="indent">3. What is the expected cost of the ongoing refurbishment of the headquarters of the Architects Registration Board?</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.5/25" class="indent">The Board recently agreed a budget allocation for 2009 of &pound;350,000, excluding professional fees, to refurbish its offices. The Board's landlords commenced negotiations with the Board in 2004 as they wished to extend their Weymouth Street premises. The Board used this opportunity to negotiate a more flexible and modern lease, as the previous lease was particularly onerous in terms of length.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.5/26" class="indent">A significant advantage of the additional space secured as part of the negotiations will be for the Board to hold its public Board meetings in-house rather than having to use external premises. The Board has also welcomed the opportunity to deliver compliance with regard to its responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Part of the refurbishment plan will be both to install a disabled lift access to the main reception area and compliant toilet facilities, along with additional assistance for people with hearing impairments. Although an overall budget allocation of &pound;350,000 has been made, the project is at an early stage with the final specification and tender document yet to be agreed. The Board is very conscious of its obligations to be prudent and economical and will ensure that the project not only delivers the Board's objectives, but also offers value for money.</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.2/1">As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government stated when the Planning Bill was in Commons Committee, our principal starting point is that almost all developments will have some imposition and impact on the need for infrastructure, and some call on local services or amenities. In addition, exemptions to, or reductions from, CIL may cause complexity and distortion and reduce fairness. Therefore, the Government envisage that most types of development will be liable to pay CIL.</p>
	<p pid="c.1088W.2/2">The Government will however consider the case for exemptions when consulting on the regulations to implement CIL, and will set out the exemptions available in the final regulations. Any exemptions we create must be legally robust and based on coherent criteria, such as those set out at page 60 of the CIL policy document published in August.</p>

	<p pid="c.1088W.5/1">The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) clauses in the Planning Bill, now in the other place, stipulate that CIL funding may be applied only to infrastructure that supports the development of an area. Infrastructure in itself has other impacts on infrastructure. For instance, a power station might place new burdens on the local road network. Therefore, the Government do not consider it right to provide an automatic exemption from paying CIL for developments that have been in receipt of CIL funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1088W.5/2">This is not to say that there will be no exemptions from CIL.

	<p pid="c.1094W.8/1">The Government's delivery bodies, the Housing Corporation (HC) and English Partnerships (EP) are already engaged in this issue. They have taken a lead in setting benchmarks for high quality urban design, construction and environmental sustainability. It is important that they understand the issues around residential living space, to help build on existing good practice and explore innovative ideas. The Homes and Communities Agency will consider how to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.8/2">'Parker Morris' standards were appropriate for the housing needs of the time. A partnership of industry bodies have been working together to examine the issue. Currently these partners, including the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), EP, HC and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIB A) are sharing information and undertaking research to understand if there is a legitimate issue concerning size of new build open market units. It is important that an evidence base is established before conclusions can be drawn on whether there is a problem and whether this is a matter for public policy intervention.</p>

	<p pid="c.1099W.3/1">Building Schools for the Future is aimed at secondary schools. It follows that no primary schools have received funding from this programme in the last five years. However we are taking a similarly transformational approach to capital investment for the primary sector through the Primary Capital Programme. Funding for the pathfinder phase commenced in April this year and will be rolled out to all local authorities from 2009-10. Subject to future Government spending decisions, the programme commits to renewing at least half of all primary school building by 2022-23, creating &quot;primary schools that are equipped for 21st century learning, at the heart of their communities, with children's services in reach of every family&quot;. The programme is supported by &pound;1.9 billion of new capital investment over the three-year period 2008-09 to 2010-11. To access that funding local authorities must develop and agree with the Department a Primary Strategy for Change.</p>

	<p pid="c.1100W.3/1">The national curriculum tests have been designed to ensure that the vast majority of pupils working at the level of the tests can access them. However there may be a small number of pupils who require additional arrangements to access the tests. Arrangements can be made to adjust test conditions to enable fair and equal access to the tests for these pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1100W.3/2">There are many reasons why a pupil may require access arrangements. Access arrangements would be appropriate for pupils whose learning difficulty or disability significantly affects their ability to access the tests; pupils who are unable to sit and work at a test for a sustained period because of a disability or because of behavioural, emotional or social difficulties; and pupils for whom English is an additional language and who have limited fluency in English.</p>

	<p pid="c.1107W.5/2">A local authority can only intervene in the care and upbringing of a child without the parents' agreement if the local authority obtains a court order. The Children Act 1989 set out the circumstances under which a child may become subject to a care or supervision order. The threshold criteria for such intervention are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.5/3" class="indent">that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.5/4" class="indent">that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to the care given to the child (or which would be given if a care or supervision order were not made) and is not what could be reasonably expected of a parent, or that the child is beyond the control of the parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.5/5">Before any application is made in proceedings, the local authority will undertake a core assessment to assess the parents' capacity to meet the child's developmental needs in the context of the wider family and environmental factors. Other specialist assessments may also be commissioned. This assessment will identify whether there is evidence to support concerns about significant harm but will also focus on family strengths. The information will be analysed and lead to the development of a plan for the child which may result in care proceedings if the local authority consider that the criteria set out above have been met.</p>
	<p pid="c.1107W.5/6">It is for the court to determine whether the threshold criteria are met and whether a care order is in the best interests of the child. All the other parties involved have the right to respond to any allegations made in the analysis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1116W.2/1">The Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) has risen from &pound;162 million in 2004-05 to &pound;187 million in 2008-09 and will rise to &pound;206 million by 2010-11. This ring-fenced grant provides specific funding to contribute to the work of local authorities and schools in narrowing achievement gaps for black and minority ethnic pupils, and covers some of the additional costs in meeting the needs of bilingual learners and underachieving pupils. In the five years 2002 to 2007 the proportion of children from most ethnic minority groups achieving national expectations at key stages 2 and 4 has increased faster than that of the whole cohort. The targeted use of EMAG has contributed towards this desirable outcome.</p>

The data were obtained from ongoing research commissioned by the Department, which estimated that 84 per cent. of primary schools were teaching languages in class time. The figures are based on a representative sample of maintained primary schools and the survey achieved a 69 per cent. response rate nationally. Percentages do not add up to 100 per cent. as some schools offer two or more languages.</p>

At the same time, they receive help with supporting their children's learning. A further outcome is that many, having gained confidence and skills, want to gain employment. LSC further funds the Family Learning Network which runs a variety of learning events such as the Family Learning Festival taking place over the course of October 2008.</p>

The aim is that all of those out of work&mdash;including parents&mdash;will get the help they need to address their skills needs, find employment and progress in work through continued skills development. To help more people find more learning, we are creating a new adult advancement and careers service, drawing together a full range of advice and support on issues such as jobs, skills, child care, housing, financial and personal issues to address the broader needs of customers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1132W.11/1">Schools have flexibility in how they deliver their weekly timetable and the hours they allocate to individual subjects. Diploma students studying a foundation or higher diploma at key stage 4 will study mathematics, English and science as part of the core curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1132W.11/2">For an advanced diploma, the level of English, mathematics or science that would be covered would depend upon the line of learning and associated additional and specialist learning (ASL) topics being studied.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.5/1">The &quot;Extra Mile&quot; is a small project, launched in July 2008, designed to help schools serving disadvantaged areas raise the attainment and aspirations of their pupils. All schools will trial one or two activities which have been shown to be effective elsewhere, and will be put in touch with a partner school which has experience of those activities. Four Extra Mile schools were below the threshold of 30 per cent. of pupils gaining five plus good GCSEs inc. English and Maths in 2007: Oakmead School, Bournemouth; Portchester School, Bournemouth; St. Hugh's Church of England College, Grantham, Lincolnshire; Witton Park High School, Blackburn with Darwen. Six of the partner schools were in the same situation: Banbury School, Oxfordshire; Newall Green High School, Manchester; Ridgeway School, Wirrall; Park High School, Wirrall; The Wordsley School, Dudley; Sir Henry Cooper School, Kingston upon Hull.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.5/2">There is no contradiction between a school being an Extra Mile school or partner school and being below the 30 per cent. threshold. The Government want all schools to achieve a good standard of education for their pupils, which is why we launched the National Challenge to give extra support to schools currently below this threshold. Many of these are improving schools serving very disadvantaged communities, so they are well-placed to share their experiences with schools facing similar challenges. It would be unrealistic to partner an Extra Mile school with a school serving a very different type of community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.5/3">&pound;400 million is available to support National Challenge schools over the next three years. This includes &pound;200 million announced in the 2008 budget for National Challenge plus an additional &pound;200 million identified from existing resources. The Government hope that many of these schools will rise above the 30 per cent. floor target when the 2008 results are known.</p>

	<p pid="c.1140W.2/1">The allocation formula for the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) does not separately allocate money to support small rural schools; it is based on local authorities' spending on schools for 2005-06, which is closely related to the formula for Schools Formula Spending Shares in use that year. That funding formula, which now underlies the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), included an indicator of sparsity which reflects the Government's recognition of the needs of rural authorities to maintain smaller primary schools on average than other authorities. We calculate that DSG in 2008-09 contains &pound;191 million funding for the extra costs of primary schools which arise due to sparsity of population. It is for local discretion how much of that authorities spend on the increased costs associated with small rural schools and we are aware that some authorities have specific protection for small schools within their local formulae.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.2/2">The following table sets out estimated amounts within 2008-09 allocations of DSG, derived from the amounts allocated through the schools FSS formula in 2005-06 on the basis of sparsity, updated appropriately, totalling &pound;191 million for the year.</p>

And we will consult widely with schools and others on a detailed proposition before the measure is implemented.</p>

All of the schools budget is spent on pupil provision, but some is retained centrally where this is the best way to manage it: the principal areas are funding for provision of the three and four year old free entitlement in private, voluntary and independent nursery providers; funding for statemented pupils with special education needs; funding for Pupil Referral Units and other education outside school; and a contingency distributed to schools during the year against unforeseen circumstances. Nationally 88.6 per cent. of the total schools budget is to be delegated to schools in 08-09. All centrally retained expenditure is discussed with the local schools forum, and the amount retained centrally may not increase year on year faster than the individual schools budget (that delegated directly to schools) without the schools forum's agreement.

	<p pid="c.1148W.5/30">Local authority areas with the highest proportion of secondary schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils attained 5 higher grade GCSEs, including English and mathematics in <i> (a)</i> 1996 <i> (b)</i> 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/31">The comparisons between 1996 and 2007 indicate the substantial success of this Government's policies on school improvement. In 1996, over half of all secondary schools failed to reach the Government's benchmark for the National Challenge, while in 2007 that proportion had fallen to one fifth. This is also reflected in the substantially reduced percentages of low-attaining schools in those authorities with the highest proportions of such schools in 2007 compared with 1996.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/32">The table also illustrates the effectiveness of targeted policies and programmes to improve school standards. In particular, the success of London Challenge is evident, since six of the ten authorities with the highest proportion of low attaining schools in 1996 were in London. In 2007 no London authority features in the list. One of the key principles of the National Challenge is to build more widely on the proven elements of London Challenge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/33">The 2007 list of authorities is dominated by those with relatively high levels of social deprivation where the potential barriers to learning outside schools are considerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/34">The Government's policies, set out in the Children's Plan, are designed to remove such barriers, especially in relation to children's well-being and securing personalised support for all pupils. The National Challenge is a crucial element of the Children's Plan, since it will provide bespoke support to individual schools with relatively low attainment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1154W.5/1">Advice on this issue can be found in paragraphs 4.24, 4.25, and 4.58 of Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education which came into effect in January 2007. CRB disclosures for new appointments to head teacher, teaching and non teaching posts should be obtained before staff begin work. If this is not possible they should be obtained as soon as possible after appointment. Such appointments will be conditional upon receipt of a satisfactory CRB disclosure. We do recognise that occasionally there can be problems obtaining disclosures prior to starting work. Head teachers, principals and local authorities therefore have the option to allow people to start work while waiting for a disclosure to be processed. In such cases they need to ensure that the individual is appropriately supervised and that all other checks including a List 99 check have been completed. Disclosures are not required if the person is moving from a similar post in a school, local authority or FE college and there has not been a break in employment of more than three months. Governors are not required to have an enhanced disclosure unless their duties include regular work in the presence of children, or who care for, train, supervise or are in sole charge of children. Governors who do not require a disclosure are asked to sign a declaration confirming their suitability to fulfil their role. Governors will be required to register with the new mandatory work force vetting scheme administered by the Independent Safeguarding Authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.1163W.3/1">The Department continues to engage strategic health authorities about their plans to deliver a reduction in mixed sex accommodation, thus keeping levels to an absolute minimum, and where possible eliminating it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.3/2">Our guidance to the NHS has always required single sex accommodation rather than single sex wards, (the latter being where a group of patients are treated by the same team, who have the necessary specialist skills). Even within a mixed ward, good single sex accommodation can be achieved by using single rooms or single sex bays and toilet facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.3/3">Local plans have been made in the context of the 2008-09 Operating Framework for the NHS in England, which requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to review the current situation in all trusts and agree, publish and implement stretching local plans for improvement in delivering single sex accommodation, with identified timescales and monitoring mechanisms. The framework specifically requires that patient survey results, where available, be used as the monitoring mechanism. Plans in Bolton reflect the national approach to reducing levels of mixed sex accommodation as set out above, and more detail of such action is available from North West Strategic Health Authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.1163W.6/1">The continued development of an effective financial performance framework remains a key priority for the Department. In recent years there have been several initiatives aimed at delivering improvements in financial management in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/2">As part of this new financial performance framework the Department introduced a new working capital loans system in 2006-07. Instead of relying on brokerage as a source of funding or planned support, national health service trusts' working capital requirements must now be financed by loans agreed with the Department and recorded in individual accounts. National health service trusts now have to address financial problems head-on and take steps to ensure that they live within their means. Deficits remain where they occur, and are transparent in the trust's annual accounts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/3">The Department has also committed to publishing the financial position of every national health service organisation on a quarterly basis, which has increased the local accountability of national health service organisations due to a greater level scrutiny over their financial performance. As a result this has ensured that all organisations put sufficient focus on their financial performance and that there is greater involvement in meeting the financial objectives from non-finance professionals including clinicians and operational staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/4">In order to assist national health service organisations, since 2007-08 the Department has issued Payment by Results tariffs and the Operating Framework earlier than was the case in previous years. This has given the national health service more time to prepare their financial plans, and as a result these financial plans have proven to be more robust with less variation between the plan, the in year forecasting and the final outturn.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/5">In addition, the Department collects both year-to-date, and forecast information, on balance sheet, income and expenditure, and cash flow. Key indicators of financial performance are collected on a monthly basis and with strategic health authorities required to work with national health service organisations to provide explanations of any significant variations. In addition the Department also recognises the value of the Audit Commission's independent Auditor's Local Evaluations scores and is heavily involved in the performance management of organisations that do not meet minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.6/6">This increased local ownership, scrutiny, and clinical engagement within the finance function in the NHS has resulted in fewer national health service organisations recording deficits in their annual accounts. In 2005-06, prior to the introduction of this more transparent financial regime, 33 per cent. national health service organisations recorded a deficit in their annual accounts compared to only 3 per cent. of organisations recording a deficit in their 2007-08 annual accounts.</p>

	<p pid="c.1164W.2/1">The Department introduced a new working capital loans system in 2006-07. Instead of relying on brokerage as a source of funding or planned support, trust working capital requirements must now be financed by loans agreed with the Department and recorded in individual accounts. Organisations now have to address financial problems head-on and take steps to ensure that they live within their means. Deficits remain where they occur, and are transparent in final accounts at the year-end.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.2/2">National health service trusts who traditionally relied on planned support are now able to focus on the areas that were causing them to overspend and look for ways to address them. Working with the strategic health authorities (SHAs), NHS trusts agree a financial plan at the beginning of the financial year that delivers a surplus, which is at least sufficient to meet any loan repayments the trust has, and thus reducing their overall debt.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.2/3">As a result of introducing the new loans system, there were 17 NHS trusts where the financial challenges are such that the Department either could not give a loan because the trust could not afford to meet the repayments, or where a loan was agreed, but the amount could only be repaid over a very extended time scale. Instead these trusts were advanced money as a short-term measure to cover their running costs while a rigorous review was conducted on their finances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.2/4">In the 2007-08 quarter 4 edition of &quot;The Quarter&quot;, the Department announced that 10 of the original 17 trusts were no longer classified as financially challenged. This was a result of the trusts working extremely hard in conjunction with their SHAs and primary care trusts to improve their underlying financial position. As a result, they are now trading in balance and are able to produce sufficient surpluses going forward to operate as a sustainable organisation, both financially and in the provision of health care. All 10 of these organisations will have repaid their debt within five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1164W.2/5">This increased local ownership, scrutiny, and clinical engagement within the finance function in the NHS has resulted in fewer national health service organisations recording deficits in their annual accounts. In 2005-06, prior to the introduction of this more transparent financial regime, 33 per cent. national health service organisations recorded a deficit in their annual accounts compared to only 3 per cent. of organisations recording a deficit in their 2007-08 annual accounts.</p>

	<p pid="c.1170W.8/1">There is currently a global shortage of medical isotopes, including molybdenum (Mo-99)/technetium (Tc-99m), which are used in many routine diagnostic nuclear imaging procedures such as heart imaging, bone scans and some cancer detection procedures. At a national level, the Department maintains a close oversight of the effect the shortage of supply of radio-isotopes is having on clinical procedures. For the duration of the shortage, we have put in place weekly situation reports from all national health service providers. For the most part, supplies are running at about 70 to 90 per cent. of normal and the NHS has made adaptations to optimise patient care. We are in close contact with all suppliers to the United Kingdom market and are monitoring their supply position. Through the European Commission we are working with member states to ensure production and supply issues are being coordinated and that reactors are brought back in to production as soon as practicably possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.1177W.2/1">The Government have taken steps to help people avoid having to sell their homes during their lifetime to pay for residential care. Since October 2001, local councils have been able to enter into a deferred payments agreement with people about to enter residential care. This allows people with property, but without income and other assets sufficient to meet their assessed financial contribution to the cost of residential care, to have a legal charge placed on their property to meet any shortfall. The local council then meets the cost of the person's residential care and reclaims the debt from the person's estate when their affairs are wound up. This gives people more options for meeting care home fees and avoids the need for their property to be sold during their lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/2">Local authorities (LAs) assess a person's ability to pay charges for residential care using the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 and statutory guidance, entitled the Charges for Residential Accommodation Guide (CRAG). The guidance helps LAs to understand the charging regulations and ensures a consistent approach to charging. Copies of the Regulations and CRAG are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1177W.2/3">In assessing a person's contribution towards the cost of their residential care, the value of their property is not always taken into account. It is disregarded where it continues to be occupied by the resident's spouse, partner or another relative who is over 60 or who is incapacitated, a lone parent with a dependent child who is the resident's estranged or divorced partner or a child under 16 whom the resident is liable to maintain.</p>

	<p pid="c.1179W.6/1">Lifting people out of poverty decreases vulnerability to climate change, so all of the UK's poverty reduction work has a role in addressing the effect of climate change. The UK is also working to prevent the most serious potential impacts by pushing for an ambitious new global agreement to tackle climate change and helping developing countries prepare for international negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.6/2">Around one third of the UK's &pound;800 million contribution to the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds will support the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience. This will support a number of countries to address the impacts of climate change through their development plans and budgets. The UK is also one of the largest donors, contributing &pound;20 million, to the UN Special Funds which are focused on helping developing countries adapt to climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.6/3">We are also addressing climate impacts through DFID's country programmes. For example, a new &pound;75 million programme will support Bangladesh's efforts to protect its people further from impacts such as rising sea-levels, water-logged land and increased salinity. DFID is already spending &pound;50 million to help improve the livelihoods of 32,000 families in Bangladesh by raising homes above 1 in 100 year flood level.</p>

The 2008 monitoring survey shows that, three years ahead of the 2010 deadline, we have met or exceeded seven of the 10 targets, and are very close to meeting another.

This was endorsed by 13 other donors, including the World Bank, UNDP, EC and Germany. It will enable partner Governments and their citizens&mdash;those who ultimately benefit from aid&mdash;to plan for and make the best use of aid.

Attacks are becoming more regular and pirates are venturing further off shore which is interfering with major shipping channels. Humanitarian aid to Somalia was directly affected earlier this year as the United Nations World Food Programme (UN WFP) were unable to find contractors willing to deliver humanitarian relief to Mogadishu. The International Community has since recognised the need to provide naval escorts for WFP ships and no WFP contracted ship has been targeted.

	<p pid="c.1184W.2/1">Voter education will be critical to the success of elections in Sudan. Over &pound;11 million has been put aside to support the elections and referendum, and we expect a significant portion of this to support voter education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/2">As the National Elections Commission that will oversee voter education in Sudan is yet to be established, the bulk of proposed UK Government support have not yet been programmed. However, since December 2007, the UK Government have supported an initial programme of broad civic education through the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, an international non-governmental organisation with extensive networks of local partners. We will also provide funding to the UN to launch a programme of preparatory support to the elections process. The UK Government intend to contribute an initial &pound;1.5 million to this programme, which will fund a range of activities related to voter education: supporting information campaigns, training of key actors such as civil society organisations and electoral assistance staff, development of materials and the provision of small grants for local initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.5/1">North Darfur has experienced an upturn in violence between Government and rebel forces since September which has hindered the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The UN World Food Programme report that 134,000 people throughout Darfur did not receive food aid in August due to insecurity. When data becomes available, this number is expected to rise to 450,000 for September, partly as a result of two NGOs temporarily suspending operations in rural areas of North Darfur. Tens of thousands of people are reported to have been displaced by recent military campaigns. Although the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has assessed some new displacements, access is still restricted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.5/2">The UN humanitarian co-ordinator, Ameerah Haq, urged both parties to cease hostilities immediately and requested humanitarian access to the affected areas in North Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.2/1">The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that during 2008, 17 humanitarian workers have been threatened, 24 injured, 14 physically or sexually assaulted, 170 abducted and 11 killed. OCHA does not disaggregate these incidents according to nationality.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.2/2">Several actions are under way to improve the security of humanitarian workers. In response to the deteriorating security and as a precautionary measure before the announcement of the International Criminal Court's indictment of President Bashir, the UN increased its security posture to phase IV in July. This triggered tighter security procedures and restricts activities to essential humanitarian work. Linked to this, an evacuation plan has been drawn up for all relocatable humanitarian workers in Darfur. The World Food Programme has also negotiated a commitment from the Government for military escorts every 48 hours on major supply routes into Darfur, and we are pressing the Government to honour this.</p>

	<p pid="c.1186W.5/1">The Government of Tanzania terminated Biwater's contract for failure to deliver. It is clear from this that private sector organisations selected to provide water and sanitation services must have the capacity and skills to deliver these services in a way that meets the expectations of governments and more importantly the people who receive or would like to receive the service. This stresses the need for rigorous assessment by partner governments and donors of potential private sector organisations bidding to deliver water and sanitation services. The Department for International Development (DFID) has ensured that these lessons are taken on and applied by those working on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.1188W.2/2">New Government regulation and legislation usually goes through the impact assessment process. Impact assessments are listed in command papers regularly published by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) each year, which are available in the House Library or from BERR's website:</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/bre/policy/scrutinisingnewregulations/Regulatory%20Reporting/page44948.html">http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/bre/policy/scrutinisingnewregulations/Regulatory%20Reporting/page44948.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/4">Impact assessments consider the costs and benefits of proposed new regulation especially for those directly affected. It is usual that key stakeholders across the relevant sectors, which include non-departmental public bodies, are consulted on the identified costs and expected impact in advance of the regulation or legislation being made.</p>

	<p pid="c.1190W.5/1">New Government regulation and legislation usually goes through the impact assessment process. Impact assessments are listed in command papers regularly published by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) each year, which are available in the House Library or from BERR's website:</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/bre/policy/scrutinisingnewregulations/Regulatory%20Reporting/page44948.html">http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/bre/policy/scrutinisingnewregulations/Regulatory%20Reporting/page44948.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.5/3">Impact assessments consider the costs and benefits of proposed new regulation especially for those directly affected. It is usual that key stakeholders across the relevant sectors, which include non-departmental public bodies, are consulted on the identified costs and expected impact in advance of the regulation or legislation being made.</p>

A full revaluation was undertaken as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> by professionally qualified internal valuers and external valuers in accordance with Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors guidance.
