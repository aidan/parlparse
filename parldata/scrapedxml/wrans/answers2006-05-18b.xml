This approach is based on the National Framework for the Fire and Rescue Service which requires fire and rescue authorities to collaborate in six key areas of work through the regional management boards. Outside London, the regional management boards (RMBs) are responsible for delivering improvements on procurement, training, human resources, specialist services, regional control centres and resilience, through regional collaboration. Individual fire and rescue authorities (FRAs) in each region continue to be accountable for the day-to-day operation of their local fire and rescue service in line with their Integrated Risk Management Plan; and are accountable to their local electorates.</p>

These use a similar baseline figure to that recommended in the Treasury Green Book for the 'Value of a Prevented Fatality or Prevented Injury', of around &pound;1.2 million. However, UKAEA also applies the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) principle in setting dose levels for its employees. ALARP introduces a further factor of safety and subject to the circumstances this financial limit may be increased by a factor of between two to 10 if the proposed solution is judged by safety authorities to be reasonably practicable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1148W.3/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many whole time equivalent staff there were in each (a) (i) customer facing and (ii) benefit processing district and (b) call centre (A) before Customer Management Service (CMS) and (B) after full or partial CMS implementation. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/5" class="indent">Our staffing information is not held in a format that allows any specific distinction between customer facing and benefit processing functions, as the majority of our benefit delivery staff have regular contact with customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/6" class="indent">I attach a table which provides a breakdown of the number of Full Time Equivalent staff for the period ending <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase>, immediately prior to the commencement of implementation of CMS in October 2003, and in March 2006. It differentiates between Jobcentres (including Jobcentre Plus offices), Social Security Offices and Contact Centres. The data includes some Districts for which Jobcentre Plus implementation is not yet complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/7" class="indent">A number of factors have contributed to the changes in staffing volumes over the period, including progress towards the Government's efficiency challenge. The implementation of Jobcentre Plus introduces significant process changes, such as the introduction of work-focussed interventions for all new claims, which attracts additional resource in Jobcentres, but also some transfer of new claims work to Contact Centres. Comparisons of staffing numbers pre and post CMS implementation cannot therefore be directly attributable only to the introduction of the new information technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.1148W.3/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1158W.8/2">However, I recognise that all tourism businesses have a major role to play in helping protect and enhance the environment, in line with the Government's wider goals of sustainable development. I therefore welcome the participation of hospitality businesses in schemes such as Hospitable Climates (a programme that has saved over 130,000 tonnes of carbon through reducingCO2 emissions since 2000) and the David Bellamy Conservation Award (held by over 500 holiday parks).</p>
	<p pid="b.1158W.8/3">English Tourism Council research during 2003-04 showed that 84 per cent. of customers surveyed would choose an attraction or accommodation which was a member of a &quot;green&quot; accreditation scheme, over one that was not&mdash;and that 68 per cent. would pay more for doing so. Currently over 10 schemes exist at national and local level, including the David Bellamy Award and the Green Tourism Business Scheme (over 500 businesses across England and Scotland). We are working with tourism stakeholders in England to develop a national framework for such schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171W.14/1">The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 helped focus attention on gender equality in policy making and in particular the focus on services to strengthen women's health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1171W.14/2">The Department is committed to improving the health and well being of the general population, including the promotion of healthy lifestyles. The Department is currently taking forward a number of initiatives, including gender specific screening programmes. Some initiatives address particular aspects of women's health which take account of vulnerable and hard to reach populations. Examples include work related to the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. The standard contains a number of recommendations including ones to address improving maternal health and the needs of pregnant women experiencing domestic violence. Many of our initiatives help to promote empowerment of women, by encouraging choice and partnership working with professionals over care, therefore fulfilling the commitment given in Beijing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1171W.14/3">In March, the Department wrote to Baroness Prosser at the Women's National Commission in response to its annual violence against women audit. We provided information on a range of subjects from domestic abuse and female genital mutilation to the gender equality public sector duty, which all public bodies will be legally bound to uphold from April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173W.8/1">The Stewart report in 2000 comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature and concluded that &quot;the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures below international guidelines do not cause health effects to the general population&quot; (<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk">www.iegmp.org.uk</a>). More recently, &quot;Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot; reiterated the Stewart report's conclusions noting that &quot;there is a lack of hard information showing that the mobile phone systems in use are damaging to health.&quot; The report [Documents of the National Radiological Protection Board, Volume 15, No. 5] is available on the Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division's (HPA-RPD) website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>. Both these reports, additionally, recommended further research and a precautionary approach to the use of mobile phone technology pending the availability of more robust scientific research results.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173W.8/2">The independently managed mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme was set up in 2001 in response to the Stewart report recommendations. It is currently supporting a number of studies into the possible health effects of mobile phone technology and these are described on the MTHR's website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173W.8/3">All mobile phones and base stations in this country comply with international guidelines that are based on comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature. Measurements undertaken by both the HPA and by Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>) have consistently shown that exposures to radio signals from base stations are lower than the international guideline levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184W.2/1">Schedule One to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 now lists the majority of bodies and offices which are subject to the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/2">In drawing up Schedule 1, central and local government bodies, the health, police and education sectors were largely listed by generic descriptions, the majority of which refer to the statutory basis for those bodies' functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/3">Parts Six and Seven of the Schedule list &quot;other public bodies and offices&quot; in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/4">The bodies and offices in these Parts have been identified as meeting the two criteria set out in section 4 of the Act, namely:</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/5" class="indent">that the body or office was established by virtue of Her Majesty's prerogative, by an enactment or subordinate legislation, or in any other way by a Minister of the Crown, a government department, or the National Assembly for Wales;</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/6" class="indent">that the body or office is wholly or partly constituted by appointment made by the Crown, a Minister, a government department or the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/7">In drawing up this Schedule, departments were asked to identify the bodies for which they were responsible which met these criteria. Many of these were already to be found in Schedule 2 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1976 (as amended), and hence were already subject to the non-statutory Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184W.2/8">The Secretary of State has a discretionary power to amend Parts 6 and 7 of the Schedule to add new bodies and offices which meet the necessary criteria, and remove references to bodies which have ceased to do so, or which no longer exist. Amending Orders of this kind are made annually.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189W.2/1">DFID's approach to improving maternal health is outlined in our 2004 strategy document &quot;Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action: First Progress Report&quot;. This sets out four priority areas for supporting better maternal health; specifically advocacy, scaling-up and improving services, helping remove barriers to access, and research to develop better technologies and policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.2/2">We have recently reviewed our performance; copies of our Progress Report have been deposited in the Libraries of the House. The report notes that DFID spending on reducing maternal mortality (together with reproductive health services) has increased by 41.3 per cent. over the past three years, and we are committed to continuing to increase our support to maternal health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.2/3">But we still need to see more governments give greater priority to this issue. Some progress has been made in Asia, for example in Nepal, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. In many parts of Africa, however, weak health services, conflict and HIV have combined to constrain overall progress. Improving this situation will require long term and sustained help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.2/4">The Progress Report makes several recommendations, one of which is to use maternal mortality as an indicator through which to track progress in health systems strengthening. Functioning health systems are essential in seeing improvements in maternal health, and we will indeed wish to monitor maternal health outcomes as we scale-up our support to basis health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189W.5/1">In 2005, the Ministry of Health incurred expenditures of US$155 million. According to the World Health Organisation, these expenditures were covered by international aid (23 per cent.), domestic taxation (25-29 per cent.) and clearance revenues from Israel (42-46 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1189W.5/2">Following the appointment of the Hamas-led Government and its failure to comply with the Quartet's conditions of renouncing violence, recognising Israel and accepting previous international agreements, all three sources of funds have declined. We are aware of reports that the Palestinian Ministry of Health does not have sufficient funds to purchase vital supplies and pay its staff. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase>, the Quartet invited the European Union to design a temporary international funding mechanism to help meet Palestinian basic needs. We are working closely with the European Commission to take this forward as quickly as possible, with a focus on direct funding of health sector expenditures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191W.11/1">The merits of using amphibious aircraft to service the island of St. Helena were assessed as part of the 2004-05 feasibility study. This option was rejected for a number of reasons. There are no civilian seaplanes currently in operation that could provide a reliable service in the sea conditions that exist in St. Helena, where there is no shelter from the South Atlantic swells that regularly prevent cruise ship passengers from disembarking. Even if it were possible to make an acceptable safety case to the regulator for this type of operation, ticket prices would be high, unaffordable to the local population, and long flight times would discourage tourism.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191W.11/2">St. Helena requires reliable, affordable access that islanders and tourists alike can depend upon if it is to build its economy and work towards its own goal of financial self-sufficiency. Construction of an airport that supports scheduled flights from a recognised international hub is the best and, in the long term, most cost effective way of achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192W.5/2">DFID and other development partners assessed the situation of women in Sudan as part of the Joint Assessment Mission (JAM), which reported last year. Women have a vital role to play in the recovery and development of Sudan, following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and more recently the Darfur Peace Agreement. However, women are marginalised and poorly represented across most of society and the overall challenge is to promote gender equality and empowerment to support progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. DFID promotes the interests of women within all its programmes and we are supporting a range of initiatives in governance and rule of law; gender based violence; capacity building, and basic social services where women stand to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192W.5/3">The UK Government has also funded the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights and the Sudanese Organisation Against Torture to implement a national campaign calling for the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). We have also supported a media campaign conducted by the UN Mission on Gender Based Violence, part of which drew attention to the deplorable crimes of rape and sexual violence in Darfur. DFID continues to assess and monitor the situation of women in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, as part of the international response. The Government of Sudan has formulated an action plan to eliminate violence against women and we continue to press for its prompt and effective implementation.</p>

The residual element of payments will be made as soon as possible to those who have received a partial payment, and those who to date have not received either full or partial payment will be dealt with thereafter. Against that background and in order to safeguard the interests of UK taxpayers, a request was made last month to the European Commission to extend the EU regulatory payment window until <phrase class="date" code="">15 October 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.1199W.0/1">In line with Cabinet Office guidelines, introduced in 2003, central Government Departments are required to conduct an Equal Pay Review at least once every 3 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/2">Defra conducted and completed its first review back in 2003 and submitted this together with an action plan to Cabinet Office in April 2003. The review covered core-Defra and two of its agencies, Pesticides Safety Directorate and Veterinary Medicines Directorate, for which the core-department has pay remit responsibility for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/3">The review found that there were no significant pay gaps within the department, provided that Defra's multi-year pay settlement was fully rolled out for future years up and including 2005-06. The final year of the settlement was rolled out last year and runs until the end of June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/4">Defra is now in the process of conducting a second Equal Pay Review. This will cover core-Defra and six of its agencies, Pesticides Safety Directorate, Veterinary Medicines Directorate, State Veterinary Service, Rural Development Service, Marine Fisheries Agency and Government Decontamination Service. It will examine whether the objectives of the multi-year pay settlement and the implications of the of Action Plan from the previous review have been have been met in full.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199W.0/6" class="italic">Rural Payments Agency</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/7">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) submitted an Equal Pay Review and action plan to Cabinet Office in 2003 in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines. This Review was completed in March 2004 and found that there were no significant pay gaps as a result of gender difference. The results were subsequently discussed with RPA's Trade Union Side and a summary of proposed actions was agreed, which included reviewing Allowances paid to specialist staff to ensure no differences relating to gender existed in these additions to pay; to improve levels of ethic and disability recording; and to carry out a further comprehensive Equal Pay Review in 2006, once RPA had completed its restructuring. These actions are ongoing and the full Review is now scheduled for 2007, when RPA is projected to reach its organisational 'steady state'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/8" class="italic">Central Science Laboratory</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/9">The Central Science Laboratory completed its Equal Pay Review in April 2003 and the resultant action plan was submitted to the Cabinet Office in May 2003. No significant pay gaps were identified as a result of gender difference and subsequent pay settlements have been subject to equality-proofing. In 2005 CSL concluded a three year pay deal that invests in both the shortening of pay ranges and the delivery of an effective pay progression system to further ensure that gender related pay gaps do not emerge in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/10" class="italic">Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/11">In line with Cabinet office guidance, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) completed an Equal Pay Review and submitted this together with an action plan to Cabinet Office in April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/12">The review found that there were no significant pay gaps as a result of gender difference. There were individual problems as a legacy from earlier pay arrangements; these were addressed in the action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/13">The action plan was taken forward as part of CEFAS' multi-year pay deal (April 2005-March 2008). The deal was accepted through union ballots. Year two of the deal was implemented in April 2006.'</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/14" class="italic">Veterinary Laboratories Agency</p>
	<p pid="b.1199W.0/15">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency completed its Equal Pay review in April 2003 and the resultant action plan was submitted to cabinet office in May 2003. The review found that there were no significant pay gaps as a result of gender difference, but the issues continue to be the subject of consultation, with the Trade unions. Subsequent pay awards have been subject to equality checks and a further review will be undertaken in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1200W.5/2">I understand that Farming Connect is administered by Cumbria rural enterprise agency on behalf of Rural Regeneration Cumbria (RRC), using funding provided by the Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA). There is no Defra funding involved and no involvement by Defra or its agencies in running the scheme. Defra does not therefore hold the information requested, which the hon.

	<p pid="b.1202W.3/2">Financial support is given to the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER) by its parent Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), through an annual core strategic grant. IGER may also secure BBSRC funding via other funding routes. Defra invests at IGER through a range of research contracts to meet specific research requirements. Some are placed with IGER as preferred supplier while others are won by IGER through open competition. In addition, IGER also undertakes research for consortia of which Defra is one of a number of sponsors, for example through LINK programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.3/4">IGER remains a very important research partner for Defra in the development and delivery of our policy objectives. This is reflected in the department's continuing significant investment at IGER, where we are already committed to investing around &pound;5 million in research programmes in 2006-07. Further project proposals are under negotiation and we anticipate the Department's final commitment will be nearer &pound;5.5 million, excluding our contributions to relevant LINK project consortia. By comparison, Defra's research investment at IGER in 2005-06 was approximately &pound;5.8 million, excluding LINK projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204W.5/1">Since April 2002, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have been financed through a Single Programme budget (the &quot;Single Pot&quot;). This consists of money from various Departments (DTI, DCLG, DfES, Defra, DCMS and UKTI).</p>

	<p pid="b.1205W.5/1">There has been no tallow ban. Installations may burn tallow provided they comply with regulatory requirements. If, as is usually the case, the tallow is waste within the definition given in the EU Waste Framework Directive, the regulatory requirements include one for a permit issued under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 incorporating the requirements of the EU Waste Incineration Directive (WID).</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.5/2">In response to representations by HM Government, the European Commission has set up a study to help establish whether the WID controls are proportionate and necessary to the protection of the environment. The study is expected to report by the autumn, and the Government are pressing the Commission for the study to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.5/3">I have encouraged the industry meanwhile to enter technical discussions with the environmental regulators (the Environment Agency or, for smaller plants, local authorities), to determine how individual plants might move over time to comply with the WID if the study were to conclude that the WID controls are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205W.5/4">The study is not about whether waste tallow is a fuel-it manifestly is a fuel. However, the proposed Directive on Waste currently under negotiation in the EU contains a provision under which a technical committee could determine the point at which specified waste materials cease to be waste. The European Commission has already identified waste tallow used as fuel as a candidate for this procedure if it is included in the finalised Directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207W.2/5">The 1986 Act requires that all experiments shall be carried out under local or general anaesthesia unless the Secretary of State judges that the anaesthesia would be more traumatic to the animals than the experiment itself, or that anaesthesia is incompatible with the objective of the experiment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216W.5/1">There are currently 57 probation employees in the probation borough of Barking/Dagenham/Havering of which Romford and Havering are a part.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.5/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, London Probation will be working to the Offender Management Model. This working structure is being launched in line with the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and will apply to Probation nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.5/3">End-to-end Offender Management focuses on one continuous supervision approach for each offender, whether in a custodial or community setting. The emphasis is on the quality of the relationship between staff and the individual offender, and the importance of experiencing delivery of the sentence as a coherent whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.5/4">Following a consultation process and a series of test Borough 'walkthroughs', the London Arrangements were approved by the London Probation Offender Management Project Board. The arrangements take account of the commitment given to the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit regarding the achievement of timely delivery of reports to Courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1216W.5/5">From November 2005 to March 2006, the end-to-end Offender Management implementation sees a phased approach, with a detailed plan, overseen by the Project Board. Within each borough, a Borough Implementation Team was created to address and manage the implementation in their borough. This covers the areas of Human Resources, IT, Health and Safety, and Premises. A Project Manager, responsible for overseeing their group of boroughs, and overall, coordinates, manages and feeds back the progresses of the Boroughs to the central Project Manager.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217W.0/1">Regional Offender Managers will be commissioning services from prison and probation areas through Service Level Agreements from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Their main responsibilities will include building relationships with providers, other commissioners and key stakeholders; agreeing and monitoring SLAs; and delivering on Reducing Re-offending Action Plans. The current legislative framework which sets out the statutory duties of probation boards remains in place, and is unchanged by the creation of Service Level Agreements. However, the SLAs are the key mechanism for introducing commissioning, and signed SLAs will demonstrate the strength of the relationships, and any legal authority derives from the fact that ROMs are Crown servants exercising the powers of the Secretary of State.</p>

The 10 busiest offices will open for 60 hours per week over six days. Given this variation in the number of days of opening, an average figure for hours of opening could be misinterpreted.

Around 59 per cent. of men on remand, 40 per cent. of sentenced men, 76 per cent. of women on remand and 63 per cent. of sentenced women had suffered from a neurotic disorder in the previous week.

	<p pid="b.1224W.2/1">The Government are committed to reducing re-offending by both adults and younger offenders. We recognise that, in the case of those released from custodial sentences, this can be achieved only through successful reintegration into the community. This, in turn, requires action from the earliest stages to address offenders' needs; examples of activity taking place in prisons include basic skills training and work to increase offenders' employability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/2">In recent months we have launched a series of complementary initiatives, to reduce re-offending. Last November we published the National Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan, setting out our plans over the next 18 months for tackling re-offending, working in partnership at national, regional and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/3">At the same time we launched three important new alliances, which will develop existing links with the corporate sector and with the faith and voluntary and community sector; we will also build on links with local authorities and other non-CJS partners, through the Civic Society Alliance. The alliances reflect the reality of our intention to develop partnerships at all levels to reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/4">Last month, we published &quot;A Five Year Strategy for Protecting the Public and Reducing Re-offending&quot;. This sets out our wider vision of how the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) will work with its partners in the coming years, to reduce re-offending, to cut crime and to help create a safer, more secure society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/5">Also last month, the Youth Justice Board published its Youth Resettlement Framework Action Plan community prisons. The framework focuses on seven resettlement pathways: Case Management and Transitions; Accommodation; Education, Training and Employment; Health; Substance Misuse; Families; and Finance, Benefit and Debt. It highlights the main actions required at local, regional and national level, emphasising the need to take account of the reducing re-offending alliances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/6">The framework will be continually influenced by developing practice and monitored by a strategic steering group of key partners at national level. This group will provide an overview for the NOMS Programme Board and the Youth Justice Board, promoting and disseminating practice as it develops. The framework will be revisited in 12 months time when a formal review of its impact will be conducted by the Youth Justice Board. The regional reducing re-offending partnership boards will be instrumental in implementing effective resettlement for young people and links have already been established.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.2/7">One of the pathways in the Reducing Re-offending Delivery Plan focuses on offenders' children and families. It will help offenders maintain family relationships and provide support while they are serving sentence and in sustaining changes in behaviour thereafter. The pathway is in the early stages of development and we are working to establish governance arrangements, including establishing a cross-Government sub-board. The sub-board will enable us to ensure our policies across government are aligned and mutually supportive, highlighting good practice while preventing duplication of effort and resources. As an important element of the work, a three year project to establish a regional pathfinder is now getting under way under the management of the regional offender manager for the West Midlands.

	<p pid="b.1226W.3/2">Release on temporary licence (ROTL) is used by prison governors to improve resettlement opportunities for prisoners and to maintain family ties. In conjunction with a stringent risk assessment process, ROTL plays a key role in the management of prisoners in the resettlement estate. This comprises 30 establishments, mainly open prisons, which provide specific regimes for longer term prisoners, including life sentence prisoners, during the final two years of their sentence. The resettlement estate provides opportunities for prisoners to address offending behaviour, educational and training needs, and to undertake unpaid community work and, finally, paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226W.3/3">The number of prisoners released on ROTL for resettlement purposes varies slightly over time.

	<p pid="b.1227W.11/2">Local activity to support the strategy, including the development of routes out for those involved in prostitution, is funded from a number of existing sources. For example, 87 Local Strategic Partnerships receive neighbourhood renewal fund to kick start the improvement of services to tackle deprivation. There are also 35 neighbourhood management pathfinders with a focus on changing the way in which key mainstream services are delivered so that they meet the needs and priorities of neighbourhoods, and 39 new deal for communities partnerships to address the priority needs of neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.11/3">The safer and stronger communities fund is also part of the local area agreement approach and can be used to address crime and antisocial behaviour, and to reduce the harm caused by illegal drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.11/4">Women trapped in prostitution frequently have a complex range of needs which can include drug treatment and other health needs, and housing. A key objective of the strategy is to ensure that these needs are recognised and that services are accessible to this group. The most urgent need for many is for drug treatment. In addition to NHS funding through primary care trusts and social services funding streams, central Government provides funding for drug treatment through the pooled treatment budget, which increased by 18 per cent. from &pound;253 million in 2004-05 to &pound;299 million in 2005-06. The other urgent need is for appropriate and stable housing. The strategy encourages local authorities to ensure that relevant services, such as those provided via the Supporting People programme, are made accessible to women exiting prostitution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.11/5">Other sources of Government funding are available to support this aspect of the strategy. For example, since 2004 the Home Office has placed &pound;5.25 million into the victims fund to support the development of support services for victims of sexual offending. A number of projects involved in the provision of support for those involved in prostitution have received grants from this fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.1228W.5/2">Due to the number of late applications there is a four week delay checking and scanning applications onto the licensing system. Once on the system, the Security Industry Authority (SIA) aim to process 80 per cent. of applicants within six weeks. In the four months prior to Christmas, (excluding the effect of bank holidays) the SIA completed processing of 23,191 applications, 86 per cent. within the six week target.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.5/3">At <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> there were 23,191 applications with the SIA being processed. Of those 628 (2.7 per cent.) had been on their system for more than three months and 139 (0.6 per cent.) for more than six months. These circumstances are for the protection of the public and arise when the SIA or the CRB (provider of the criminality checks) are waiting for information from the applicant. The main issues are either confirmation of training or further CRB enquires where there are doubts about the identity of the applicant, often requiring fingerprint verification by the police. Other smaller numbers are where payments have failed and not been rectified or where overseas criminality checks are outstanding. Of the 628 over three months, 217(35 per cent.) were awaiting training confirmation and 305 (49 per cent.) were awaiting further identity checks by the CRB.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.2/1">The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is required to be self-financing from the licence fee income but it was always anticipated that the SIA would not break even in its first couple of years, because of the gradual introduction of licensing, which will eventually meet all the SIA's running costs. The deficit in the first year, 2003-04, was &pound;7.1 million as the SIA had no licence income. In 2004-05, the deficit was &pound;13 million, and the estimated deficit for 2005-06 is about &pound;3.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.5/1">The assumptions made in the answer pursuant to question 52038 reflected original assumptions made by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) which were subsequently modified. The original SIA planning assumptions were based on the number of door supervisors registered under local authority registration schemes applicable to individuals working in premises licensed for the sale and consumption of alcohol. Such schemes extended to approximately60 per cent. of local authorities, and numbers for England and Wales were extrapolated from this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/2">The SIA discussed the assumptions with specialist sector bodies. It based its current assumption on the experience in the pilot region where the numbers applying for licences were significantly lower than expectations. Once the offence date had passed the SIA obtained information through its compliance team and enforcement partners on the numbers of licensed and unlicensed individuals they were finding during visits to premises and their joint compliance operations. At the time this was approximately 80 per cent. licensed and 20 per cent. unlicensed; on this basis the SIA revised its numbers for the pilot region and extrapolated them to the other regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/3">These figures have been reviewed a number of times but are believed to be the best data available. The SIA also believes, but as yet have no firm evidence, that a significant percentage of door supervisors have de-selected themselves because they would not meet the licensing criteria, and that a percentage may have been working in the informal economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.0/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, it became a criminal offence for manned guards to carry out security activities without a licence under the terms of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (PSIA). Enforcement is the responsibility of the Security Industry Authority and the police. The SIA published an enforcement policy on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> which stated that, while they want the private security industry to be compliant with the law as quickly as possible, they will take into account a number of factors when deciding what enforcement action to take. These factors include the progress an individual has made towards getting or renewing a licence, the current licensing processing time, the time elapsed since the activity became licensable and any previous encounters with or warnings given by the SIA or other agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.0/2">Any individual carrying out licensable activities without a licence will be committing a criminal offence, unless they have received a license dispensation notice from the SIA under the Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS). This allows accredited firms to legally deploy a proportion of their staff who have completed their training but whose applications are still being processed. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May</phrase>, it is estimated that around 30,000 individuals are being deployed lawfully under the ACS Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.3/1">Parole Board decisions on whether or not to award parole focus primarily on the risk to the public of an offence being committed at a time when the offender would otherwise be in prison. In assessing whether the safety of the public will be placed unacceptably at risk, the board is directed to take into account that the risk of violent or sexual offending is more serious than a risk of other types of offending. This must be balanced against the benefit, both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the community under a degree of supervision which might help rehabilitation and so lessen the risk of re-offending in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235W.9/1">In the last five years the UK has requested the European Union Satellite Centre to provide analysis of earth imagery for five national tasks, all in 2003. Three of these related to arms control tasking in Asia and the Middle East, and two concerned humanitarian and rescue tasking in Africa. These taskings took place before the costs of such national requests became recoverable from the member state. These national taskings should be distinguished from UK proposals for the EU to task the Satellite Centre in support of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. These proposals comprised five arms control tasks across the Middle East and Asia, one imagery analysis request in the Middle East and geospatial information in preparation for the G8 meeting in Gleneagles.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.5/2">The Iraqi Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT) is responsible for producing official statistics on the unemployment rate and has conducted three Labour Force Surveys since 2003. The latest November 2005 survey, reports an unemployment rate of 18 per cent. across Iraq (not including the Kurdish Regional Government or Al Anbar province). Unemployment rates for individual provinces are not published by COSIT or any other organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.5/3">It is important to note that there has been considerable debate over Iraqi employment statistics, and widely differing unemployment rates have been reported. One report from the Brookings Institution (Iraq Index, April 2006) at http://www.brookings.edu/iraqindex estimates the current unemployment rate to be between 25 and 40 per cent. The use of different definitions of unemployment may account for some of this variation. For example, Iraqi data has traditionally counted only those working 15 hours or more per week as &quot;employed&quot;, whereas the International Labour Organisation (ILO) considers anyone working 1 hour or more per week to be employed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238W.8/1">We share President Musharrafs concern about the Talibanisation of Waziristan. The Pakistani Taliban have at various times taken control of parts of Waziristan, including the town of Miramshah, but not for extended periods. The Government of Pakistan currently has over 80,000 troops deployed in the region, who are engaged in almost daily skirmishes with al-Qaeda and Taliban elements. We take the threat posed by the Taliban very seriously and continue to work closely with the Government of Pakistan to try to contain it. This is important not just for stability in Waziristan, but also to help reduce the risk to British forces deployed in Southern Afghanistan. The exact strength of the Pakistani Taliban is difficult to assess.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239W.3/1">I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-18">18 April 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-04-18.88W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 88W</phrase>, and to my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary's (Mr. Straw) written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-01-20.37"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 37</phrase>-38WS. The expectation that a State will seek permission reflects an aspect of the principle of State sovereignty over territory, which is a longstanding principle of international law. The findings of the review of the Government's files back to 1997, which were summarised in the then Foreign Secretary's written ministerial statement, demonstrate that this has been a consistent requirement; that it has been made clear to the United States authorities; and that they have sought such permission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239W.6/1">We are deeply concerned at the recent upturn in violence in Sri Lanka, notably the suicide bombing of the army headquarters in Colombo on<phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase> and the attack at sea on a troop-carrying vessel on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May</phrase>. These Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) attacks are a clear violation of the Cease-fire Agreement, break the commitment they made at talks in Geneva in February, and threaten prospects for peace. There is no excuse for terrorism. The LTTE is a proscribed organisation in Britain and is likely also to be listed by the EU as a terrorist organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.6/2">But the background to the violence in Sri Lanka is complex and we are also very concerned by reports of killings of civilians and the continued atrocities committed by armed groups. It is essential that the Government of Sri Lanka also live up to its responsibilities in preventing such groups from operating.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.6/3">We continue to believe that dialogue is the only way to achieve a negotiated settlement to the internal conflict in Sri Lanka. Violence cannot solve internal differences nor bring sustainable peace. All sides need to exercise restraint and act in a constructive and patient way. We fully support the Norwegian facilitated peace talks and will continue to work for a settlement that takes full account of the legitimate demands of all communities within a democratic and stable Sri Lanka.</p>
