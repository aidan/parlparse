The Department has published research by consultants Halcrow and Rand Europe and WSP into factors affecting the level of use of motorcycles, which included preliminary assessments of environmental effects of greater use, although not specifically in the context of allowing motorcycles to use bus lanes. The Government is aware of a number of concerns relating to motorcycling in bus lanes which is why we are working with local authorities to evaluate the safety and other effects of this before revising our guidance.

	<p pid=".8W.3/1">The Soil Guideline Values Task Force is an initiative of the Cabinet Office Business Regulation team and the Government Departments and Agencies most involved in the publication of the Defra/Environment Agency soil guideline values and related materials. This technical guidance helps in assessing risk to human health in connection with land contamination, for example when considering regulatory action or proposals for development of land. Two subgroups have recently been set up to explore training and possible additional guidance. The Local Authority Standing Conference on Land Contamination is represented on the Task Force, and all local authorities in England were notified about the initiative earlier this year. No other guidance has been given to local authorities in respect of the Task Force. We currently expect proposals from the Task Force later in the year, and that these will be made publicly available.</p>

Specific programmes, such as the Strategies' English as an Additional Language (EAL) pilot and Aiming High &quot;Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils&quot;, also address the needs of particular groups of under-achieving pupils which include African-Caribbean pupils, Gypsy and Traveller pupils, pupils from mainly Muslim backgrounds and isolated minority ethnic pupils.

Although the EU will take all relevant factors into account in its review of the EU Arms Embargo, any decisions arising from it are for the EU alone.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.6/1">Member states' percentage contributions towards the budget of the European Defence Agency are based on assessments of their gross national income. The agency's budget for 2004 covered the period from its formal establishment in July to the end of that year. The United Kingdom contributed 17.28 per cent. of this budget, equating to &euro;308,775.51. For the calendar year 2005, the UK contribution is 18.07 per cent. equating to &euro;3,596,803. There are no formal estimates of the agency's budget for the next five years. However, the budget for 2006 is expected to be less than the 2005 budget which included non-recurring costs associated with the initial set-up of the agency.</p>

However, it can be revealed that the total cost of the work, including the FSL refit and the installation of additional MOD supplied equipment, is in excess of &pound;20 million.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.6/1">Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) were introduced in April 1999. From data reported to the Home Office, we know that up to September 2004, 3,826 ASBOs have been issued since they were introduced. An ASBO is a civil order, but a breach of it is a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.6/2">The granting of the ASBOs is not the end of the process. Local agencies need to work with those subject to ASBOs as well as their families to ensure that the ASBO is observed and complied with.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.6/3">Since February 2004, Parenting Orders can be attached to ASBOs issued to 10&ndash;15 year olds. Since May 2004, Individual Support Orders can be attached to ASBOs issued to a 10&ndash;17 year old to direct the young person to activities that can address the underlying causes of the antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".33W.6/4">In the Drugs Bill currently, before Parliament there is a proposal for an Intervention Order that could be attached to an ASBO issued to an adult and which would direct the individual to activities to address the underlying causes of their antisocial behaviour when these are drug related.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.3/2">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Coventry, South constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/3">For example, between March 1997 and September 2004, the number of police officers in West Midlands police force increased by 917 from 7,113 to 8,030. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 134 CSOs on West Midlands streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, the West Midlands police force area has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 35 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 28 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/4">West Midlands police force is receiving &pound;426.5 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 6.81 per cent. (&pound;27.2 million) over 2004&ndash;05. West Midlands also gains around &pound;0.8 million from the Amending Report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 7.0 per cent. General grants funding to West Midlands has increased by 34 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, West Midlands will also receive around &pound;29 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/5">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/6">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Four CCTV projects in the Coventry CDRP area received a total of &pound;528,226 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/7">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;1.93 million has been allocated to Coventry CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.03 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office regional director in the West Midlands for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/8">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Coventry set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/9">The Government's crime reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/10">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Coventry a total of 73 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-04">4 March 2005</phrase>. Coventry is one of the 50 antisocial behaviour action areas across the country set to get extra help to tackle antisocial behaviour. In addition, &pound;25,000 has been awarded to Coventry to tackle families who cause nuisance and misery. Nuisance neighbours are offered intensive family support and given a &quot;last chance&quot; to turn around their behaviour, by nuisance neighbour expert panels. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/11">Tackling drug misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/12" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/13" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/14" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/15" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/16">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Coventry has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the through care and aftercare elements of the Drug Interventions Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Coventry drug action team amounted to &pound;2.08 million, rising to &pound;2.83 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Coventry, South constituency can be obtained from the Coventry drugs action team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/17">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the future builders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/18">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.3/19">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.2/1">Reliable statistical data in relation to international students who had their visa applications rejected and whose appeals the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) subsequently upheld are available only for the year 2003. Full year data for 2004 have not yet been collated. Data for years prior to 2003 are not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.2/2">In 2003,1,772 appeals by students who had been refused entry clearance were allowed.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.2/3">Data on the number of appeals made by international students relate to appeals lodged with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate rather than with the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA). In 2003, 6,900 appeals were lodged by students who were refused entry clearance. The IAA heard 6,430 student entry clearance appeals. In addition 1,805 appeals were lodged by international students in the United Kingdom whose leave to remain application had been refused.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.2/4">In relation to a breakdown by visa issuing post of the number of appeals made by international students (excluding student nurses) who had their visa applications rejected, UK Visas has provided the following data covering the full five-year period. This information was obtained from UK Visas' Central Reference System. It should be noted that, due to the complexity of UK Visas global business, including occasional inconsistencies in data entry across over 150 offices, 100 per cent. accuracy cannot be guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-04">4 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/2">The Government has put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for all parts of the UK. For Scotland these are devolved matters for the Scottish Executive and for Northern Ireland are matters for the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/3">In England and Wales between March 1997 and September 2004, the number of police officers increased by 12,977 from 127,158 to 140,135. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 4,599 CSOs on the streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, there has been a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 23 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/4">Expenditure on policing supported by Government grant or spent centrally on services for the police in England and Wales has increased by over 53 per cent. (26 per cent. in real terms) between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/5">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area in England and Wales has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/6">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/7">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;301.3 million has been allocated under these initiatives. A further &pound;20 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to Home Office Regional Directors for CDRP capacity building.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. There are currently 50 TOGETHER antisocial behaviour action areas in England and Wales. Between April 1999 and September 2004 a total of 3,826 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued. Further information on tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and its policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the House Library.) Under this, the Government has invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs can be obtained from <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs. gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/16">The Government is working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. The Home Office has allocated &pound;15 million in grants under the Connecting Communities race equality grant scheme over the three years (2003&ndash;06). Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a></p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/18">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

	<p pid=".57W.2/1">The prison elements of the National Offender Management Service Drug Strategy provides a comprehensive framework to reduce the amount of illegal drugs in prisons. Passive drug dogs are used to detect traces of drugs on visitors, and other dogs are used actively to search for drugs within prisons, as part of a general drug search strategy. Closed circuit television systems are installed in all visits areas to monitor behaviour, and fixed and low-level furniture is used in visits areas to make it difficult to pass drugs undetected. Sanctions are taken against visitors suspected of smuggling drugs, including visit bans and closed visits. Where there is adequate evidence they are prosecuted. Prisons and police share intelligence about drug routes into prisons.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/2">Each month a random sample of the prisoners in each prison (5 per cent. or 10 per cent. depending on the size of the prison) is required to submit to a drug test, and a positive test result will lead to disciplinary proceedings. All establishments use and contribute to a drug supply reduction good practice guide and a monthly security bulletin, both of which share information on ways of protecting against drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/3">Prisons work with the Police Scientific Development Branch to strengthen physical and technical barriers, particularly in prisons, such as those in city centres, where public spaces are close to perimeter walls. Prisons have a Professional Standards Unit to help identify staff who may be involved in or at risk of corruption. It will provide relevant information to facilitate investigations.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March</phrase>, we will issue RJ implementation guidance for Local Criminal Justice Boards and their constituent agencies, encouraging them to develop provision of restorative justice at local level, particularly as a service to victims.

	<p pid=".60W.2/3">We have successfully reduced the number of rough sleepers by 70 per cent. since 1998 and we are continuing to sustain this reduction. All local authorities had to appoint a rough sleepers' co-ordinator and we continue to work closely with local authorities to monitor their progress on their homelessness strategies and to offer them advice and support to prevent people from becoming homeless.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has produced a range of good practice material guidance and advice notes for local authorities, housing associations and other agencies on effective ways to tackle homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/5">We are making around &pound;60 million available in 2005&ndash;06, rising to &pound;74 million in 2007&ndash;08, to help local authorities and voluntary organisations take action on homelessness prevention. In addition, we are investing &pound;90 million in capital works over the next four years to bring older hostels up to 21st century standards so that they provide better opportunities for homeless people and prevent them from becoming homeless again. This will help sustain reductions in rough sleeping and go further in tackling single homelessness.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with the Home Office in the delivery of the Reducing Reoffending National Action Plan. A number of developments are under way to ensure that all prisoners receive a housing needs assessment through custody and into the community. In addition the Prison Service will be introducing a shadow Key Performance Target in April 2005 to measure the housing need assessment at induction. Data will also be collected showing where prisoners at risk of homelessness will be returning to, so that housing authorities and advice agencies can plan services and support.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also working with the Home Office's Active Communities Unit and the voluntary sector to develop a new approach to capacity building and infrastructure support for the homelessness sector. The Change-Up programme will be providing additional funding of &pound;650,000 to improve refuge provision for the victims of domestic violence and to strengthen the voluntary sector by improving leadership, information exchange and best practice, create regional and sub-regional support arrangements and develop practical support for smaller, harder to reach, frontline agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.0/1">All schemes approved under the Special Constables (Amendment) Regulations 2002 are locally funded. It is for the police authority, following a recommendation by the chief constable, to decide whether an allowance scheme for specials offers value for money. To date, five forces&mdash;Cumbria, West Midlands, Humberside, Thames Valley and Durham&mdash;have put forward proposals for allowance schemes for specials. All the applications were approved. The schemes in West Midlands and Thames Valley operate in one basic command unit only. The Cumbria scheme has been discontinued at the request of the force in the light of evaluation results. The remaining schemes are subject to ongoing evaluation by forces.</p>

	<p pid=".62W.3/2">The programme contains a commitment to develop a community based one-stop-shop approach to tackling the different factors which impact on women's offending. We are attracted to the idea of having local community supervision and support centres for women where they can access a whole range of interventions and services to meet their needs, including housing, child care, mental health, substance misuse, histories of abuse, employment and training. Following the announcement of funding in the 2004 Spending Review, we are considering how this will be used to develop radical new approaches for women offenders and provide community interventions and support specific to women's needs.</p>

As a result of the 1997 review, notice was given that the Certificate was to be revoked, and that a new application would be considered only if 16 pre-conditions were met to remedy the problems uncovered. A fresh application was subsequently received, with evidence the 16 pre-conditions had been met, and a new Certificate granted. The 2001 compliance review revealed no new management failings related to the Certificate of Designation.</p>
	<p pid=".65W.5/3">Conditions of issue attached to all Certificates are periodically reviewed. This was last done as regards Huntingdon Life Sciences in October 2004.</p>

There are however concerns about the possible indirect consequences for UK defence industry if action were taken in the US in response to a lifting of the embargo. We do not consider that such action&mdash;which would be damaging to both countries' interests&mdash;would be justified. We continue to work with the US to achieve a satisfactory conclusion.

The UK said the Competitiveness Council should focus on delivering practical outcomes in the key areas of Better Regulation, Chemicals (REACH), Services and the 7th Framework Programme on Research and Development (FP7).

	<p pid=".68W.8/3">The Council held an exchange of views on Better Regulation and the Simplification process, which are seen as key elements in the Lisbon agenda and increasing competitiveness.

The UK welcomed the Commission's renewed commitment in this area and underlined the importance of the Better Regulation agenda.</p>

These are situated between 3 km west (Sandside) and 13 km east (Thurso) of Dounreay. Reassurance surveys of Melvich beach, some 10 km west of Dounreay, have been carried out on two occasions and an extensive survey of Dunnet beach, approximately 23 km east of Dounreay, has now commenced. The foreshore at Dounreay is also monitored by the vehicular system.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/3">UKAEA have advised the department that:</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/4" class="indent">Radioactive particles have only been found on one public beach, Sandside (although on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-02">2 March</phrase>, the third day of a 60 day survey, a stone-like object emitting low levels of radioactivity was found at Dunnet Beach which has been taken to Dounreay for laboratory analysis). When a particle is detected it is immediately removed.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/5" class="indent">The monitoring detects radioactivity down to a level in the top 10cm of sand that is below that considered by independent experts to be of significant risk to human health.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/6" class="indent">The current monitoring has been demonstrated to be capable of being compliant with the regulatory requirements of SEPA.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/7" class="indent">All particles detected during monitoring are removed and returned to Dounreay for analysis. The results are reported to regulators.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/8" class="indent">UKAEA is currently investigating whether there are detection systems which are superior to those available at present for beach monitoring.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/9" class="indent">In the case of particles buried in the seabed off Dounreay, UKAEA have undertaken an extensive series of research programmes aimed at understanding the distribution, mobility and properties of particles in the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/10" class="indent">Since 1997, divers have been mapping the number and distribution of particles in offshore sediments. As part of this work, the divers have detected and retrieved over 800 particles from the seabed off the coast at Dounreay.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/11" class="indent">UKAEA is concerned about the inherent occupational risks associated with extensive use of divers. Consequently, UKAEA seeks to limit the use of divers and has developed with their contractor a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) capable of crawling the seabed and identifying the radiation emitted by particles present within the sediment. Last year, it mapped the locations of over 120 buried particles in survey areas totalling 30,000 sq. metres.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/12" class="indent">A further 2 or 3 year programme of mapping of the offshore particles will commence in summer 2005 using a remotely operated system. The information from this work will be used to assess the extent of the particle distribution offshore, to validate a computer model of particle dispersion and to assess the risks to any of the local beaches.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.5/13" class="indent">This information from offshore studies will be used, together with the information from beach monitoring, as inputs to the consultation process which will identify the Best Practicable Environmental Option for dealing with this legacy.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.2/2">However I am informed that in recent years, a number of independent expert organisations including the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee and the National Radiological Protection Board have investigated and advised the Government, UKAEA and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on the potential health risks from particles of radioactive material found on Sandside Beach. This advice has considered both the likelihood of exposure to such a particle by inhalation, ingestion or skin contact and the resultant health risks should such an exposure occur. COMARE tells the DTI that the probability of a member of the public encountering a particle remains extremely small and the estimated radiation dose to an individual consequent upon ingestion of a typical particle from Sandside Bay is roughly equivalent to the average UK-annual background radiation dose (2 milliSieverts). SEPA has commissioned additional research to further refine this latter estimate.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.5/1">I refer to my previous answer to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/2">I represented the UK at the EU Energy Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>.The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom. Chief among these were the Energy Services Directive and the Security of Electricity Supply Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/3">A general approach on the Security of Electricity Supply Directive was agreed, though the Commission, which seeks a more interventionist regulator-led approach to promote actively new interconnector build and thereby competition, maintained a reserve on Article 7 on interconnector construction.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/4">Council conclusions were agreed on the Commission's Communication on the share of Renewable Energy in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/5">An orientation debate was held on the proposed Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. Member states expressed a strong preference for indicative not mandatory energy saving targets though views were mixed on whether a uniform target at EU level would be helpful; many delegations preferred individually set targets. There was general recognition that the public sector could play a leading role in promoting energy efficiency but the majority of member states opposed specific targets for the sector. On the question of the placing of obligations on suppliers there was a clear preference for a broader more flexible approach rather than a focus on one energy efficiency approach-energy services. There was broad agreement that a harmonised approach to measuring energy savings was needed, but there was a split on whether a top down or bottom up approach was best.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/6">The UK noted our support for a uniform, but indicative, six-year target taking account of already captured efficiency gains; a more broadly defined obligation on energy suppliers to actively offer and promote energy efficiency; and agreement with the Presidency proposal for either a top down or a hybrid approach to measuring efficiency gains.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/7">The Commission's preference for a mandatory target reflected what they saw as the poor record of achievement against indicative targets and they suggested that flexible mandatory targets might be the way forward. The Presidency concluded by proposing an annual debate on progress towards achieving indicative national targets, the first of which would fall to the UK Presidency, and looked forward to concluding the dossier in the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/8">The Commission reported progress on the negotiations of the Energy Community for South East Europe Treaty, which it hoped would be a model for other sectors. Signature was foreseen for 2005. Some member states had substantive comments on the language regime, others on the distinction between participating and observing member states. The next negotiation meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> will be an opportunity to discuss outstanding matters.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/9">The Commission reported on its communication on progress on the EU/Russia energy dialogue 2000&ndash;04, claiming it showed positive outcomes across a range of fields. More progress in Russia was needed on the reform process, energy efficiency and Kyoto implementation, promoting and protecting investment and positive developments in the gas and oil markets. The Commission undertook fully to involve member states.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/10">The Presidency concluded by noting, in the context of the recent &quot;Energy in Motion&quot; conference aimed at improving cleaner road traffic, that transport accounted for a third of energy consumption. The conference conclusions would be discussed at the next Transport and Environment Councils and the Commission were urged to take account of them.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/11">Luxembourg finished by saying they would take forward the Dutch Presidency approaches and singled out Energy TENS as a priority dossier.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.3/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

	<p pid=".79W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what action was taken by Ministers to establish that the Registrar General had statutory authority to state that personal information from the 1981 and 1991 decennial population censuses for England and Wales would be retained for 100 years before being released. (221179)</p>
	<p pid=".79W.2/4" class="indent">A Registrar General is empowered to conduct a census under the provisions of the Census Act 1920 as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991. The protection of personal information is covered by Section 8(2), which makes provisions with respect to unlawful disclosure of information. Censuses from 1921 onwards have been taken under this Act and, as records which are retained in my custody, remain covered by these provisions. The necessary permission to retain these census records once they are over 30 years old has been granted by the Lord Chancellor under the provisions of Section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958, and has continued to be granted at periodic intervals.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.2/5" class="indent">Particularly at the time of a census there is great public concern about confidentiality and the use to which personal census information is put, and it has been the practice to give strong declarations of strict confidentiality including on the front of the census form, to allay these concerns. At the time of the 1981 and the 1991 Censuses, there was legislation in force that closed Census records for a period of 100 years. This legislation was Instrument 12 dated 1966 made under the provision of Section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958. The declarations however, did not specifically make reference to this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.2/6" class="indent">In an attempt to simplify the confidentiality message on the front of the 1981 and the 1991 Census forms, the assurances, as worded, stated that the Registrar General had authority himself to retain the records for 100 years. This pledge asserts authority that the Registrar General does not have. As explained above the authority for the Registrar General to retain Census records rests with the Lord Chancellor. Notwithstanding this, the legal basis of access to, and confidentiality of, Census records was not affected. Assurances given on the 2001 Census form, however, more accurately referred to the relevant statutory authority as existed at the time.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/12">Projections are based on the number and value of residential and commercial transactions, derived from the Survey of Property Transactions in England and Wales, projected to the required year, in line with the pre-Budget 2004 forecast for price and volume trends. By comparing UK stamp duty receipts with England and Wales survey estimates in historic years it is possible to derive projections for the UK. However forecast trends for price and volume are not produced for countries and regions of the UK to enable production of reliable stamp duty projections at the sub UK level.</p>

Tables 1 and 2 attached below, show, for those resident in each Parliamentary Constituency in Wales, the numbers and rates for long-term unemployment, and long-term youth unemployment. Long-term is classified as those unemployed for 12 months or more. The data are for the twelve-month periods ending from February 1999 to February 2004. Comparable information for earlier years is not available. As with any statistical sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to sampling variability.</p>

For the years 1996 to 2004, Tables 3 and 4 show, respectively for all JSA claimants and those aged 18&ndash;24, the annual average numbers and percentages of claimants resident in each Parliamentary Constituency in Wales claiming for over 12 months. Comparable information for the years 1984 to 1995 is not available for Parliamentary Constituencies in Wales according to their present boundaries. Information for these years for the Constituencies, according to their boundaries as they were from 1984 to 1995, could be compiled, but only at disproportionate cost. The information needed to produce those estimates is accessible by the House of Commons Library via the Nomis system.</p>

Since 2001 the FCO has maintained this cadre, and continued to develop staff with these specialisations. The figures for Arabic speaker positions in the Gulf region show a 10 per cent. increase between 1999 (40 positions) and 2004 (44 positions).

	<p pid=".98W.2/1">A customer for any of these benefits may express a need for immediate financial help any time during the new-claim process. The action to take will depend upon what stage the request is made.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/2">Where a benefit claim has been assessed and payment of benefit is due, the payment is issued immediately.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/3">If the request is made at First Contact Stage, wherever possible, an urgent appointment (preferably the same day) is made with the Financial Assessor and Personal Adviser to complete the claim process and allow any payment due to be released.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/4">If an immediate appointment cannot be booked or the benefit claim cannot be assessed, because for example information is outstanding, an interim payment is considered. An interim payment is a payment on account of benefit and is considered when, from the information provided already, it appears the customer may be entitled to benefit but it is not possible to fully assess the claim immediately.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/5">Where a benefit claim has been assessed, but it is established the first payment is not due immediately, then consideration can be given to a Social Fund Crisis Loan.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about the planned closure of Dursley Jobcentre. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.2/4" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-22">22 October 2004</phrase> we wrote to our stakeholders to inform them that Dursley Jobcentre had been earmarked for closure, providing the reasons why and inviting views from stakeholders. As a result of the consultation exercise, the final decision concerning the closure of Dursley Jobcentre was made in February 2005 and the office will close on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>. The communication of this decision began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-04">4 March</phrase> via a press release, then in writing to Jobcentre Plus customers and other stakeholders. At no time between October 2004 and February 2005 did we confirm the closure of Dursley Jobcentre and therefore our announcement was not brought forward.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is currently in local negotiations with Gloucestershire County Council for provision of a Flexible Service Delivery (FSD) option in Dursley Library. This negotiation has not yet been concluded as the Local Authority are considering the terms of the formal written agreement proposed by Jobcentre Plus. The FSD option includes the provision of a free telephone link and the use of the Library Internet services. Interim arrangements have been made to provide a limited service to customers from the existing Jobcentre site on one day per week until the FSD option is in place and fully operational.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.2/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has taken every appropriate step in redeploying staff affected by the closure of Dursley Jobcentre. There are currently two staff members who have yet to agree a permanent alternative. The provision of a continuing staff presence in Dursley was fully considered in light of stakeholder feedback.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.2/7" class="indent">It is important to remember that the shape of the network in future is in response to the changing business need. Increasingly we will be delivering our services through the premises of our partners and siting facilities such as touch-screen Jobpoints or free telephone access in local public buildings. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by different business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch web-site.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.14/1">Since 1997, employment nationally has risen by over two million and the number of people in work is up in every region. While every region has an employment rate above the EU average, describing the labour market at regional level can be misleading as there is much greater variation within, rather than between, regions.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.14/2">Around 90 per cent. of all local authority districts in Great Britain have an employment rate above the EU average, and a key element of the Government's labour market policies is improving the performance of the relatively small number of areas within each region where this is not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.14/3">Since 1997 claimant unemployment has halved, long-term unemployment has fallen by more than three quarters and the number of lone parents on benefit has fallen by a fifth. In addition, the number of people on incapacity benefits has peaked after two decades of substantial growth. The improvements have been greatest in the areas where, in 1997, benefit receipt was highest.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.14/4">While this has moved us closer to the aim of full employment in every region, the Department's five year strategy set out the Government's long-term aspiration to achieve an employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. This will mean continuing to focus on those who can get back into work, including people on incapacity benefits, lone parents, older people and the long-term unemployed.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the target time for holding a Work Focused Interview (WFI) following an initial claim to Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance, and the average time between the initial call and the interview being conducted at the Jobcentres in Blandford, Bridport, Christchurch, Poole, and Wareham. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.0/5" class="indent">Under Jobcentre Plus operations, a claim to Income Support, Incapacity Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance usually starts with a telephone call to the Contact Centre. After obtaining initial details, Contact Centre staff call the customer back to obtain the necessary information to complete a claim to benefit. They also arrange an appointment for the customer to attend their local office to see both a Financial Assessor and a Personal Adviser.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.0/6" class="indent">At present Jobcentre Plus has separate targets for processing Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support and Incapacity Benefit. These are known as Actual Average Clearance Targets (AACT). The target for Jobseeker's Allowance is 12 days from the first contact with the Contact Centre and the processing of the claim. For Income Support the target is again 12 days however this commences from when a customer has provided all the necessary information to process the claim because Income Support claims are subject to the Evidence Requirement. Incapacity Benefit claims have a target of 22 days from the date of claim to the date of processing. The WFI stage is a component part of the process.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.0/7" class="indent">There is no current target for the holding of a WFI following the initial claim to benefit although it is our aim to conduct the interview within 5 days of initial contact. Unfortunately as there is no target the information you require on the performances of particular offices is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.0/8" class="indent">As part of Jobcentre Plus' future performance measures, we are looking into the possibility of introducing an internal key performance indicator to measure the time between the customer's initial call and the WFI being conducted. This would be included in a suite of measures to manage the end to end process from when a customer makes contact with us to when they find work or are awarded benefit. A decision will be made on this later in the year.</p>

It was in December 2003 that sexual orientation was added as a ground on which to base a complaint of discrimination and, consequently, does not appear in the figures you request for the past four years, as there was no expenditure on legal assistance for that ground in December 2003-March 2004 period.

	<p pid=".113W.0/1">It is assumed that this question is referring to the proposed changes to the pension schemes for civil servants, staff employed in the NHS and for teachers.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/2">Consultation on proposed changes to pensions, including those for ill health retirement, of the main civil service pension scheme in Great Britain and the NHS and teachers schemes for England and Wales are currently under way. As the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme for Northern Ireland, the Health and Personal Social Services Superannuation Scheme, and the Teachers Superannuation Scheme in Northern Ireland operate on a principle of parity with these schemes, the normal approach would be to introduce similar changes for Northern Ireland staff.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/3">The proposals relating to ill-health retirement in the consultation document &quot;Building a Sustainable Future&mdash;Proposals for Changes to Civil Service Pension Arrangements&quot; are broadly similar to those presently available to members of the premium arrangement of the current civil service pension provisions with the recognition that higher benefits should be paid to those who are most incapacitated. The proposals relating to ill-health retirement for the teachers pension schemes are similar to those proposed under the civil service scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/4">The proposals are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/5" class="indent">Where the scheme's medical adviser agrees that a member's ill-health is such that they are no longer able to do their job and that this is likely to continue to pension age, the member should receive their pension immediately without any reduction for early payment.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/6" class="indent">If the scheme's medical adviser considers that the member is virtually unable to do any job, not just their present job, they should receive an increase to their pension, under a formula yet to be determined.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/7">Civil service members who are covered by the current classic arrangements are subject to a slightly modified approach, compatible with an employee contributions rate of 1.5 per cent. rather than the premium contribution rate of 3.5 per cent. Regardless of the degree of incapacity a single level of ill-health pension will be payable.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/8">The review partners of the NHS pension scheme consider that the pension scheme cannot deal with ill health in isolation and that it is important that any changes to the pension scheme are part of an integrated approach to managing ill-health absence. They have proposed that a separate partnership review of sickness and ill-health arrangements should be carried out, which will help the pension review determine this aspect of pension scheme design. The consultation document is seeking views on this approach to reviewing sickness and ill-health retirement arrangements.</p>

A number of measures to mitigate the negative equality impacts were identified, including the provision of discounts for certain low income households.

	<p pid=".118W.0/1">In common with the other Whitehall Departments, the Northern Ireland Office reports progress against the targets and objectives in the public service agreement (PSA) in its Departmental Report and Autumn Performance Report. In the 2004 Spending Review PSA, the NIO agreed seven main objectives and, within these, four key target areas which commit it to a specified level of performance or achievement. Since the SR2004 PSA commences in April 2005 no material is available to monitor progress against these targets. However the Department has provided extensive public information on progress against the PSA targets agreed as part of the SR2002 settlement. Because the targets are clearly measurable they are reported on in detail in the Departmental Report and Autumn Performance Report. Progress against objectives is reported on in more general terms.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.0/2">The NIO's 2005 Departmental Report is in draft and will be published soon on a date to be set by HM Treasury. It will provide detail on the targets and give information on performance to the end of the SR2002 PSA period. It and the Autumn Performance Report are available from the Stationery Office or on the NIOs website (<a href="http://www.nio.gov.uk">http://www.nio.gov.uk</a>). In addition, HM Treasury's performance website (<a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/performance/index/cfm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/performance/index/cfm</a>) currently reports specifically on performance against the targets in the SR2002 PSA and will be updated regularly to report on SR2004 PSA targets.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.2/1">In developing water and sewerage charging options for Northern Ireland, careful consideration was given to the existing regimes in Great Britain. As in the rest of the United Kingdom, the proposed self-financing arrangements will mean that customers' bills will, in general terms, reflect the costs which that customer imposes on the water and sewerage systems for a supply of clean water and the disposal of dirty water. Details of the approach taken to developing the proposed water and sewerage charging regime are set out in the Integrated Impact Assessment Policy Proposals Paper published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-29">29 November 2004</phrase> <a href="http://www.waterreformni.gov.uk/consult2004.asp">http://www.waterreformni.gov.uk/consult2004.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/2">In England and Wales, unmeasured domestic charges, in general, consist of a standing charge and a charge based on the property's rateable value. It is proposed in Northern Ireland that charges will consist of a standing charge and a charge based on the property's capital value&mdash;which will be the basis for calculating domestic rates in NI from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. In Scotland unmeasured charges are based on the council tax band which, in turn, is based on the property's capital value.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.8/2">In general terms, the primary care trust or local health board in whose area a patient is registered with a general practitioner (GP) practice will have responsibility for commissioning his or her care, regardless of what particular health problems he or she might have. When a patient moves across the border between England and Wales, we would expect that person to register with a GP practice at their earliest convenience, which then determines the authority responsible for their care. Their records will then be transferred to the new practice.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.8/3">Some adults who have been in contact with mental health services will be subject to the multi-agency public protection panel arrangements. The arrangements for the tracking of individuals considered a risk to the public are detailed in paragraphs 76 and 77 of Probation Circular 54/2004, &quot;The MAPPA Guidance&quot;. This places the responsibility firmly on the responsible authorities (the relevant police and probation services) initiating the transfer to ensure that the receiving authorities have both the information and the time to put suitable arrangements into place. The arrangements for moves between Wales and England are the same as those between English regions. Health bodies have a duty to cooperate with police and probation services in making these arrangements function effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.5/1">&quot;Getting Ahead of the Curve&quot;, the infectious disease strategy published by the Chief Medical Officer in January 2002, made clear the intention of reviewing infectious disease law. No specific timetable for the review has been set as yet: we have always intended that it should be carried out at the point when it can make the most effective contribution to improving the control and prevention of infectious disease.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/2">Our top priority, in terms of improving health protection, has been the legislation to establish the Health Protection Agency (HPA). It has existed since April 2003 as a special health authority in England and Wales and will be established from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> as a United Kingdom-wide public body under the Health Protection Agency Act 2004. As a result of the creation of the HPA, consultants in communicable disease control (who generally discharge the &quot;local authority proper officer&quot; function under the 1984 Act) are in England all now employed by the HPA. This is an improvement on the previous position; when such consultants were in effect single-handed practitioners, each based in a local national health service body, which could offer them relatively little specialist support.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/3">In preparation for the planned review of the law, we asked the HPA last year to consider first how public health practitioners might make more effective use of the powers currently provided by the 1984 Act; and second, what difficulties practitioners find with the current powers and what changes might be desirable. We expect to receive the results of this work from the HPA in the first half of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/4">We are contributing to the development of new International Health Regulations (IHR) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO aims to adopt the new IHR at the World Health Assembly in May 2005. Many of the requirements of the current IHR are reflected in regulations made under infectious disease law in the UK, which will need to be revised once the new IHR are in place. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 has provided new emergency powers which complement those provided through public health legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/5">We will take decisions on the timetable for the review of public health law in the light of the work being carried out by the HPA and of progress with agreeing and implementing the new IHR.</p>

	<p pid=".140W.6/1">In September 2001, the Department asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to design a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of quinacrine as a potential treatment for variant Creutzfeld Jacob disease (vCJD). Pentosan polysulphate was not included in the trial protocol because expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the CJD therapy advisory group in 2002 and again in 2003, did not support its use as a possible treatment for CJD on grounds of safety and efficacy. Both these expert committees will continue to review new data on pentosan polysulphate.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.6/2">At the request of the Department in December 2003, the MRC agreed to offer patients receiving pentosan polysulphate treatment the opportunity to participate in standardised clinical monitoring. It is for the MRC to decide, in consultation with the families concerned and their clinicians, what would be the most appropriate information to collect, and how it should be collected.</p>

	<p pid=".144W.2/1">The Government announced a review of the operation of the Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) programme on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>. This review is now under way. Its terms of reference are to review the operation and outcomes of the Disabled Facilities Grant Programme and to make proposals to improve its efficiency and fairness. A number of financial and policy issues affecting the programme, including the operation of the means test and the maximum grant limit will be evaluated. Officials are due to report back to Ministers in May this year and any proposals for change will then be published for consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".144W.2/2">The DFG means test takes account of an applicant's income and capital over &pound;6,000, but not of any financial outgoings such as mortgage payments. Instead total income is compared with a range of expenditure allowances and premiums which are up-rated periodically to keep them in line with increases in the cost of living. This is standard practice for many state benefits where a means test is applied.</p>
	<p pid=".144W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not collect information on how many disabled people have applied for DFG, or the number of people waiting for DFG. We have not undertaken a formal assessment of the abolition of the DFG means test for families with a disabled child in Northern Ireland, but the effects of this change will be considered as part of the DFG Review.</p>

	<p pid=".147W.0/1">Last summer's public consultation on implementing the high hedges provisions in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 identified a number of issues which have necessitated further work. These issues were the whole question of fees which a complainant must pay to the local authority for investigating their case and a streamlined appeals process which will place less of a burden on local authorities and the Planning Inspectorate. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently revising the Regulations and guidance for local authorities in the light of the consultation responses, with a view to laying Regulations before Parliament shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/1">Following the publication of the Sustainable Communities Plan (February 2003) effective arrangements have been established to identify land that becomes surplus to the public sector and to consider whether it has a continuing use within the public sector.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through English Partnerships has set up the Register of surplus public sector land. The Register lists landholdings held by central Government and its agencies that are surplus to requirements. Any Department wishing to dispose of surplus land is required to place that land on the Register for a period of 40 working days before the land is marketed. The Register currently consists of over 800 parcels of land totalling almost 4000 hectares. The majority of the sites are brownfield and include previously developed land and buildings that are vacant or derelict and have the potential for redevelopment. The Register is currently being developed to allow on-line access by early April 2005 to central Government users. Brownfield and greenfield land will be easily identifiable. English Partnerships will publish a quarterly return of surplus sites on the Register.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/3">English Partnerships has also established an agreement with Defence Estates to work closely together on the future use of surplus defence land. This will allow Defence Estates to deliver its disposal programme and for English Partnerships to help deliver the objectives set out in the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan. English Partnerships acquired the former RAF staff college site from Defence Estates in February 2004. Housing proposals for this site are currently being taken forward.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/4">In April 2004 my right hon. the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Health announced that a portfolio of about 100 surplus NHS sites would be transferred to help deliver the objectives of the communities plan. We expect the first sites in this portfolio to be transferred to English Partnerships shortly. English Partnerships has also acquired a portfolio of surplus brownfield sites across London to provide 2000 affordable homes for sale out of a total development of about 4000 units. Development will start in 2005&ndash;06 and the homes will be delivered over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and English Partnerships have now also published information on individual sites reported by local authorities for the National Land Use Database(NLUD) of Previously-Developed Land. The information is on the NLUD website <a href="http://www.nlud.org.uk">www.nlud.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.5/6">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister anticipates that a significant number of vacant surplus sites will be used for housing development to tackle the problem of housing shortages and the demand for affordable homes. This will be determined through local planning policies and strategies in the normal way.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.2/1">I regret that it is not possible to provide such an estimate, which would depend on assumptions about the number of tenants who would have exercised their Right to Buy if the changes to maximum Right to Buy discounts in February 1999 and March 2003 had not been made. This means that the overall effect of the changes on tenants' perceptions and behaviour, and hence on the overall level of sales, the amount of discount for which they would have qualified, and the amount of capital receipts that would have generated cannot be assessed with any accuracy.</p>

In such cases applicants would have to demonstrate that there were very special circumstances that clearly outweighed the harm that the development would cause to the Green Belt. Draft PPS10 expects regional planning bodies and planning authorities to prepare and deliver planning strategies that protect green belts but recognise the particular locational needs of some types of waste management and that the wider environmental and economic benefits of sustainable waste management are material considerations that should be given significant weight in determining whether proposals should be given planning permission.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.6/1">The Building Regulations requirements are functional rather than prescriptive to enable compliance in practical and cost-effective ways and to leave open the possibilities for innovation. It would therefore be inconsistent to prescribe particular technologies such as solar electricity. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing the energy efficiency requirements however and amendment proposals were published for consultation last July. The proposals include setting minimum overall building performance standards at levels much higher than at present and providing new technical guidance on low and zero carbon systems to further encourage take-up of these systems.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.9/1">The provision of sport or recreation facilities is a legitimate use of planning obligations (s106 agreements), where they meet the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's policy tests (set out in DoE circular 1/97 and the revised draft circular published in November 2004) of being necessary; relevant to planning; directly related to the proposed development; fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development; and reasonable in all other respects. Planning Policy Guidance note 17 also gives further guidance on the appropriate use of planning obligations to secure sport or recreation facilities alongside new developments.</p>
