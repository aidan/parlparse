	<p pid="a.1573W.3/2">ASBO data are available broken down by age group 10-17 and adults aged 18 and over, year of issue and Criminal Justice System (CJS) area level. CJS areas are coterminous with police force areas and the information is shown in table 1 placed in the House Library. The number of ASBOs breached for the first time in each year is shown in table 3 placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1573W.3/3">The Home Affairs Select Committee Report on Anti-Social Behaviour (2004-05) found that inappropriate issuing of ASBOs, for example to people with mental health problems, is not a major problem in practice. Legislation allows the terms of an ASBO to be varied or for the order itself to be discharged if circumstances warrant it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1573W.3/4">Home Office published material and training events stress the need for a staged and incremental approach to tackling antisocial behaviour and for specialist professionals to be involved in an assessment of people who have special needs. This advice is available to all antisocial behaviour practitioners, including those practitioners working in social services, in the form of a website, an extensive range of leaflets and the Respect Actionline, which provides professional advice by telephone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1573W.3/5">We monitor the overall use of ASBOs on an ongoing basis and adjust policy in response. For example we recently made changes to the ASBO legislation in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 that juveniles' ASBOs should be reviewed after one year.

The security situation in BiH is stable and current troop levels are considered sufficient.

The handling of the audio/video recording in question is being investigated. I will write to the hon. Gentleman when the investigation is complete and place a copy of the letter in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/3" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Julian Lewis:</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/4" class="indent">You will recall that I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-11">11 September 2007</phrase> about the investigation into the handling of the US cockpit recording of an attack on a UK light tank in Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-28">28 March 2003</phrase>. We have now received the Joint Army/RAF investigation report on the unauthorised disclosure of the cockpit recording and I am therefore able to give you a substantive response to the specific questions you asked in your parliamentary question (Reference 122369, <i> Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March 2007</phrase> columns 1642/3W).</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/5" class="indent">I can now confirm that officials were informed of the existence of the CD recording when preparing for the Board of Inquiry into the incident. The recording, among other material, was requested by the Board of Inquiry from the US authorities and received on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-23">23 April 2004</phrase> via the MOD's Permanent Joint Headquarters. Ministers received written advice about the existence of the CD recording and its unauthorised disclosure on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February 2007</phrase> in relation to the issue being raised at the Coroner's inquest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/6" class="indent">As a result of the failings identified, remedial action is being taken. A new security education programme is being introduced as part of a wider security awareness campaign to ensure that those involved in the handling of classified and sensitive material are aware of the rules and procedures to be followed. An instruction on the release of US (and other third country) material during legal proceedings has also been issued to all MOD personnel to remind them of their responsibilities in respect of the secure handling of protectively marked US material, and we are in the process of establishing new arrangements for the management of Boards of Inquiry and Inquests to ensure a more consistent approach across the Department. The US authorities have been informed of the investigation's findings and of the remedial action taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.5/7" class="indent">I can assure you that I take the protection of classified material, especially that entrusted to us by a close ally, very seriously, and the Permanent Secretary has asked the chain of command to consider whether administrative or disciplinary action against any individual is appropriate in light of the finding of the report.</p>

The report's recommendations and the programme of work that has been agreed with the Commission do not include extending the provision of video conferencing in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589W.6/3">For Members who do wish to use this type of service a portable video conference facility can be booked via the room booking service for use in some of the meeting rooms in Portcullis House and PICT can offer some advice to Members on the products that they could consider and their cost if they wish to use this service in their own offices.</p>

The UK independent slot co-ordinator is not aware of any cases at present where an airline is flying empty aircraft to retain an airport slot. Such cases are very rare, the cost of fuel being a disincentive. Hence we have not made an assessment of the environmental impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.1592W.13/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) has the UK lead in supporting education in Afghanistan. You will be aware that DfID provides funding (&pound;55 million in 2007-08) to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. This fund pays the salaries of over 100,000 teachers and 90 per cent. of the Ministry of Education's wage bill. In this way DfID funding has contributed to an increase from one million pupils in 2001 to six million today, and an increase from approximately 21,000 teachers in 2001 to more than 128,000 today. In addition, since 2002, over 2,000 schools have been built or reconstructed. Officials at our embassy in Kabul work closely with the Afghan Minister for Education, parliamentarians, officials, non-governmental organisations and teachers as they work to improve education in Afghanistan.</p>

Before the devastating cyclone hit Burma, we called for urgent action ahead of the <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase> referendum because, as currently conceived, the process designed by the Burmese regime will not deliver the reconciliation, stability and prosperity that Burma needs.

	<p pid="a.1595W.0/5">The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.0/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied; and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.0/7">The 2006 FCO annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.0/8">Information on requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (that is, meeting the deadline or within a permitted extension) in 2007 was 98 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.0/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOIA exemption or Environmental Information Regulations exception was applied. For 2007, the number of such requests was 254, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are dealt with as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596W.5/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) has had discussions with officials of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India on population issues in the context of the Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH-2), to which DFID contributes. DFID has committed &pound;252 million to the programme from 2005 to 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.5/3">RCH-2, launched in April 2005, is the Government of India's key programme to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for reducing maternal and child mortality. The programme seeks to expand the range of information and services available on contraception, particularly to the poorest populations. The programme will increase access to reversible methods of contraception, which will allow young women to delay childbearing and all women to have a longer interval between births. This will improve the health of children as well as mothers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.5/4">The most recent joint government and donor review of this programme took place in February 2008. The review found that there has been an increase in the provision of family planning, and particularly of reversible methods of contraception.</p>

	<p pid="a.1596W.8/2">Under CPA17, contractors are not subject to Iraqi laws and regulations in matters relating to the terms and conditions of their contracts.

The sending state may, however, waive immunity for contractors if requested.</p>

The FCO would also bring the matter to the attention of the UK police and/or the authorities of the individual's nationality. The decision whether to pursue a UK criminal investigation, and ultimately whether a prosecution should be undertaken in an individual case, would be a matter for the UK police and prosecuting authorities, acting independently from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1596W.8/4">In the case of suspected non-criminal misconduct, we would take up the matter with the employing organisation, and either investigate the matter or have the employing organisation do so and report to us, depending on the circumstances and the nature of the allegations.</p>

The complainants were interviewed promptly and in detail by senior members of our embassy staff. However, as the allegations were made both by and against employees of a company contracted by the FCO, we asked the company concerned to send staff from its UK office to take forward the investigation. They did so thoroughly and professionally in June 2007 and we accepted their conclusions and recommendations.

	<p pid="a.1600W.3/2">The withdrawal of the Agricultural Buildings Allowance (ABA) is part of a package of measures introduced at Budget 2007 which also saw the reduction of the main rate of corporation tax and the introduction of a &pound;50,000 Annual Investment Allowance (AIA), allowing 95 per cent. of businesses to write off all their expenditure on plant and machinery (excluding cars) in the year in which it is made. The effect of this package will vary according to the particular circumstances of a business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600W.3/3">Slurry storage facilities may be considered plant and machinery and therefore be eligible for plant and machinery capital allowances (both the AIA and writing-down allowances) at 20 per cent. a year on any balance of expenditure not covered by the AIA where the storage of the slurry is incidental to its final use.</p>

	<p pid="a.1603W.3/1">There is a range of stock assessment measures in place for shellfish at regional, national and EU levels, but there are no national or EU measures which explicitly relate only to the six-12 mile zone. Sea Fisheries Committees (SFC) have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a number of measures for the explicit purpose of gaining Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) accreditation. For instance South Wales SFC's management of the Burry Inlet cockle fishery, and North East Sea Fisheries Committee's (NESFC) attempt to gain accreditation for the local lobster fishery. These SFC measures, however, apply out to six miles only.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603W.3/2">While none of the aforementioned measures have been introduced specifically for the purpose of enabling accreditation schemes to demonstrate sustainability, such measures are seen as an integral part of any shellfish management plan which would be a pre-requisite for gaining accreditation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1605W.12/1">The Government are ready to transfer responsibility for policing and justice as soon as the Assembly requests this. The people of Northern Ireland want to see policing and justice devolve. Significant progress has been made on this since last May, not least with the publication of the Assembly's report which I laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-25">25 March 2008</phrase>. I hope the parties will reach agreement on the timing without delay and complete the process of devolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606W.12/1">Our ambition for higher intermediate skills (level 3) is critical to our future competitiveness and economic success. The Government's response to Leitch 'World Class Skills: implementing the Leitch review of skills in England' (July, 2007) committed to the Leitch level 3 ambition, which equates to 1.9 million more adults achieving level 3 by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.12/2">In terms of milestones, this will mean moving from 49.2 per cent. of the adult population (19+) with level 3 or higher qualifications in 2006 to 56 per cent. by 2011 and up to 68 per cent. by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.12/3">Using actual and planned learner numbers on full level 3 qualifications it is possible to estimate the level of public funding invested in these qualifications. This estimate covers expenditure on all full level 3 qualifications as data are not collected on the number of learners undertaking a first full level 3 qualification. The following table sets out information from 2005-06 to 2010-11 based on the structure of the 2008-09 Grant Letter to the Learning and Skills Council. It covers the years that we are able to estimate on the overall level of investment in full level 3 qualifications.</p>

Students should have access to local provision offering flexible courses to suit their needs. We are therefore delighted by the interest that our new university challenge has generated. This policy also offers places the opportunity to unlock the potential in their area by working with those involved in regeneration and economic planning to provide locally-based HE provision. We have already agreed to meet delegations from towns in North Northamptonshire to discuss these issues. Any proposals for new university campuses or centres of HE will be assessed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England.</p>

The backdating variable in the Single Housing Benefit Extract was introduced relatively recently in April 2007 and accordingly we have no means of corroborating the data's robustness against historical data. Furthermore, given that the data only goes back six months, we currently have an insufficient pool of evidence to derive reliable figures from the data. These concerns should be allayed with time as the scan data improves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1620W.0/1">The Welfare Reform Act 2007 provides for the new employment and support allowance, which will be supported by the new work capability assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620W.0/2">The new work capability assessment will be a fair, robust and accurate assessment of a person's capability for work, reflecting the activities needed in today's workplace and concentrating on what people can do rather than what they cannot do. The current personal capability assessment needed a thorough review to ensure that the new assessment is up-to-date and accurate, and that it will identify those people who should be entitled to employment and support allowance, including those with long term-and fluctuating conditions such as myalgic encephalopathy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620W.0/3">The work capability assessment is not a snapshot of a person's condition on the day of the assessment. In assessing whether a person can carry out any given activity, healthcare professionals must take into account the person's condition over a reasonable period of time. If there is a change in a person's disabling condition, there will be a provision to refer the person to an approved healthcare professional so that we can determine afresh whether or not the person has limited capability for work, or limited capability for work-related activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1620W.0/4">The disability living allowance guidance on myalgic encephalopathy and chronic fatigue syndrome was developed in conjunction with a group of experts in this area of medicine. It gives benefit decision-makers a greater understanding of this illness and the consequent care needs and mobility difficulties, and will enable them to make better-informed decisions on a person's entitlement to disability living allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1621W.2/1">Information on the number of pension credit claims that end because the recipient has gone abroad for more than four weeks is not collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.2/2">For planning purposes we estimate that around 50,000 pension credit recipients go abroad for between four and 13 weeks each year, based on data from the International Passenger Survey on the number of visits abroad by length of stay for the general population of people aged 65 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.2/3">Customers would have to make a new claim for pension credit on their return, processed in the usual way. This is burdensome for both the customer and the Pensions Disability and Carers Service staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.2/4">Extending the period to 13 weeks will be of sufficient duration to allow nearly 90 per cent. of those customers who would otherwise have had their pension credit stopped after four weeks of a temporary absence, to retain entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.2/5">We estimated that the net cost of extending the absence abroad period from four to 13 weeks over this comprehensive spending review period could be around &pound;2 million in each full year from introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1621W.2/6">The proposal to extend the period of time people can go abroad and still keep their pension credit from four to 13 weeks forms part of a package of pension measures that will make claiming benefit entitlements simpler and less intrusive and deliver extra support to pensioners. Taken together the wider package of measures represents more than &pound;500 million of additional spending on pensioners over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1639W.0/1">These are matters for Ofsted. The Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and copies of her replies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-24">24 April 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/3" class="indent">Parliamentary question number 200786: To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, how often Ofsted requires (a) nurseries, (b) childminders and (c) nannies to repeat Criminal Record Bureau checks to maintain registration on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/5" class="indent">The voluntary part of the Childcare Register has only been in operation since April 2007, Ofsted has yet to decide upon a policy of repeat Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks for any of the types of provision eligible to apply to join the voluntary part of the Childcare Register. However, it might help to mention that as part of the application suitability check process Ofsted carries out an identity check and an enhanced CRB (unless Ofsted has already obtained a CRB check in respect of that person and that person has a continued history with Ofsted in the previous three years) of all applicants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/6" class="indent">The law sets out the categories of people Ofsted must check in relation to the voluntary part of the Childcare Register. For childminders and nannies, Ofsted will check the childminder. In relation to other childcare such as nurseries, Ofsted will usually check the applicant where the applicant is an individual and the nominated person where the applicant is an organisation. Ofsted will also check the manager. Ofsted may also check others who make up an organisation that provides childcare if it has concerns about an individual. Providers are expected to ensure that others who work or are in regular contact with children are suitable, or that those who are unchecked are not left in unsupervised contact with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/7" class="indent">We will repeat CRB checks if we judge it necessary, on the basis of information we have received either through inspection or from another source such as a complaint, to determine that a person continues to be suitable. We will recheck those on the register as part of their application to join the Independent Safeguarding Authority scheme which starts in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/8" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Beverley Hughes MP, Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1639W.0/10" class="indent">Parliamentary question number 200791: To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, how Ofsted assesses whether applicant (a) nurseries, (b) childminders and (c) nannies seeking registration on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register have completed training in core skills as set out in Common Core of Skills and Knowledge for the Children's Workforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/11" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/12" class="indent">The Common Core of Skills and Knowledge (the Common Core), reflects a set of common values for people who work with children and young people. They promote equality, respect diversity and challenge stereotypes, helping to improve the life chances of all children and young people and to provide more effective integrated services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/13" class="indent">The regulations for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register state that, as part of the ongoing requirements of registration, providers must ensure that: &quot;At least one person who is caring for children on the premises has successfully completed training in the core skills as set out in the document 'Common Core of Skills and Knowledge for the Children's Workforce'.&quot; This is soon to change in revised regulations to be either &quot;the common core&quot; or a level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/14" class="indent">If the childcare provider has received training in all of the common core areas, or will have done so before they start caring for children, they can apply for registration on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register. As part of the application process, the applicant is asked to confirm (by signing a set of declarations) that they have received, or will receive before caring for children, relevant training in the core areas. There is no registration visit for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/15" class="indent">If we have any concerns about any details of an application, we check with the applicant and seek confirmation of the declaration. To do this the applicant must produce relevant course certificates or demonstrate how they are able to meet the common core through an existing qualification. They may also need to provide further details of the course, such as the course content. There is no definitive list of qualifications that satisfy the requirements, and in lieu of such a list we currently accept all qualifications on the Early Years and Playwork Qualifications Database as meeting the qualifications requirement, as well as other training or qualifications that the applicant can demonstrate are common core compliant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/16" class="indent">At any inspection, registered providers must demonstrate that at least one person has had training in the common core. During inspections, we check compliance with the requirements governing continued registration. At the inspection visit we also look for evidence within the organisation that the skills and knowledge from common core training are put into practice. If we find a provider to be non-compliant then we set an action telling the provider what they must do to remain registered. We currently inspect 10% of those on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register, as agreed with the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

	<p pid="a.1639W.0/25" class="indent">The voluntary part of the Childcare Register has only been in operation since April 2007. During the period April 2007 to March 2008, Ofsted had registered 1,421 settings. The method of categorisation Ofsted uses does not fit precisely with the types that you have indicated, but I can confirm that of the 1,421 registered settings, 70 are other childcare (for example, activity-based settings such as sports coaching or tuition; short-term care, such as cr&egrave;ches); 33 are childminders; and 1,318 home childcare (nannies). Nurseries usually require compulsory registration as they cater for children aged under five.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/26" class="indent">Ofsted do not have a duty to inspect provision on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register, and only inspect a proportion of those who are registered. Between April 2007 and March 2008 Ofsted has completed six inspections with a further eight scheduled for inspection up until the end of April 2008. Of these, five were home childcare inspections and one was a childcare inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/27" class="indent">Of those inspections carried out between the periods April 2007 to March 2008, two providers were found not to be meeting the requirements for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register.</p>
	<p pid="a.1639W.0/28" class="indent">Ofsted has not removed any providers from the voluntary part of the Childcare Register. The two providers did not meet requirements at inspection have since done so.</p>

Data for the 2006-07 school year show reductions in overall absence from all state-funded schools (6.49 per cent. compared to 6.96 per cent.), which is the lowest on record, and in persistent absence from state-funded secondary schools (6.7 per cent. compared to 7.1 per cent.). We are continuing our focus on reducing persistent absence across all local authorities and their schools, and on minimising avoidable absence through early identification of pupils developing patterns of absence and tackling the underlying causes of these patterns. We expect schools and local authorities to work with the pupils and their families on an individual basis to resolve the problems that cause the absence, with the support of other agencies and partners such as the local community, social care workers and the police, reintegrate into the school community and catch up with their peers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1649W.2/2"><i> C. difficile</i> is a bacterium that lives in the gut of about 3 per cent. of healthy adults in England (ie about 3 per cent. of healthy adults are colonised). It is kept at bay by normal gut bacteria; but if those bacteria are killed by antibiotics, <i> C. difficile</i> can take over. Patients with <i> C. difficile</i> excrete large numbers of spores in their faeces which contaminate the environment. <i> C. difficile</i> is spread by a person swallowing the bacteria or the spores it produces. Spores transferred to other people can subsequently develop into bacteria that grow in the colon. People are normally only susceptible to <i> C. difficile</i> infections if they are on broad spectrum antibiotics, which kill normal gut bacteria. This is why good antibiotic prescribing practice is particularly important and effective for reducing <i> C. difficile</i> infection.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652W.5/1">National surveys of the quality systems related to effectiveness and efficiency of both national health service and independent sector suppliers of decontamination have been undertaken since 1999. The most recent published report is 'The Decontamination of Surgical Instruments in the NHS in England - Update report - A step change', published in June 2005. This demonstrates improvements in virtually all areas of quality systems and control over the 1999 to 2004 period. Copies of this publication have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.5/2">The Chief Medical Officer has requested a further survey during the present year. This is referred to as the National Decontamination Survey 2008 and is currently in progress. The survey will visit some 35 NHS trusts including several which use commercial suppliers of decontamination services. The trusts have voluntarily agreed to take part and the focus is on those institutions, which pursue high-risk tissue surgery in respect of the theoretical risk of human prion disease transmission. It is expected that the full survey will be complete by August 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1660W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises that many populations in the world rely heavily on working animals and livestock for their household income. Natural disasters can have a devastating impact on livestock numbers and health, cause severe damage to animal shelters and deplete fodder resources. This can result in increased vulnerability and suffering of livestock dependent, populations. DFID's humanitarian policy underlines the need to reduce risk, protect against extreme vulnerability and strengthen social protection for populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1660W.5/2">People who depend on livestock or the sale of livestock products for most of their income and consumption continue to fall victim to disasters, for a complex variety of reasons that include pre-existing vulnerability and also climate change. DFID has recently carried out a review of its work with such 'pastoralists' and developed a specific pastoralist policy paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.1660W.5/3">DFID has provided funding to humanitarian actors for livestock projects in natural disasters, and will continue to do so where and when necessary and appropriate. DFID is also funding Tufts University's Feinstein Centre to produce Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) for the design, implementation and assessment of livestock interventions to assist people affected by humanitarian crises.</p>
