	<p pid="c.296W.8/1">In the Future of Transport White Paper (Cm 6234) the Government set out that, without radical measures, including more effective demand management, road congestion would get worse. That is why we need to look at whether road pricing would allow us to get more out of the network, particularly at peak times.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/2">A national scheme of road pricing which covered all roads, charging motorists on the basis of distance travelled and varied according to how congested a road is, could potentially cut urban congestion by nearly half. But moving to a national system of road pricing would be a huge and complex task. That is why the Road Pricing Feasibility Study, which was published alongside the White Paper, recommended that local or regional schemes should be used to pilot approaches to road pricing.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/3">The Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-07-05.172"><i>Official Report</i>, column 172</phrase>, that the Government would ensure that up to &pound;200 million would be available from the Transport Innovation Fund to support local pilots that combine demand management, specifically road pricing, with better public transport. If more good schemes emerge, then more would be made available. The Transport Innovation Fund guidance, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-07-05.66WS"><i>Official Report,</i> column 66WS</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>, sets out how local authorities and areas can bid for this funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/4">Because the development of these schemes will be a complex undertaking the Government have made &pound;18 million of pump priming funding available between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08 to help support the work of local authorities in developing local demand management schemes. The first allocation to seven areas was announced in <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-11-28.4WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 4WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.8/5">Local highway authorities in England and Wales already have discretionary powers under the Transport Act 2000 to introduce such road user charging (road pricing) schemes. For a scheme to come into force an Order has to be approved by the appropriate national authority, which is the Secretary of State for transport in England.</p>

	<p pid="c.300W.9/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.9/2"><i>(a)</i> The Brazilian Government is committed to eradicating slave labour practices. Legislation has now been prepared to confiscate farms that practise forced and child labour. This issue continues to be a matter of serious concern and our embassy in Brazil is monitoring developments closely. We welcome the engagement of civil society in Brazil and internationally on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.9/3">More broadly, the Government have played a leading role in ensuring that the international framework to tackle abuses of workers' rights throughout the world is in place, particularly through its work with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) whose 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-Up works towards the elimination of forced labour and child labour, the ending of discrimination in employment and the right to organise and collective bargaining; and has provided specific support to the ILO's action programme on combating forced labour.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.9/4"><i>(b)</i> With regard to deforestation, the UK has contributed &pound;14 million to the multi-donor pilot programme for the preservation of Brazilian rain forests and is a major contributor to the global environment facility (GEF) which is creating and maintaining protected areas in the region through the Amazon Region Protected Areas Programme. The managers of the GEF have approved or endorsed funding for 29 projects in Brazil, with a value of approximately &pound;150 million. The UK also continues to support projects in the Amazon through multilateral organisations, including the European Commission and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="c.300W.9/5">In terms of beef exports to the UK, our records indicate that there was a slight decrease in the amount of Brazilian beef entering the UK in 2005 compared to 2004. The UK still needs to import beef as, until very recently, we were only 70 per cent. self-sufficient in beef production. However, we do expect beef imports to now fall.</p>

This study and the measurement of warm, salty flows passing into Arctic to the NW of Scotland, funded by the Scottish Executive and predecessors for over 100 years, form important elements of the international Arctic-Subarctic Ocean Flux Study (ASOF), which investigates all aspects of the role of the Northern Seas in Climate; ASOF, now the largest ocean-observing system in the Northern Hemisphere, is chaired by CEFAS.

	<p pid="c.305W.2/1">We recognise that a bilateral agreement such as the Voluntary Partnership Agreements outlined in the EU's Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) regulation will never be watertight. Partner countries can import and export timber to third countries outside of the FLEGT scheme. The Commission's original proposal attempted to tackle this issue by requiring all imports of timber into the EU to require a certificate of origin. Customs experts felt it would not work in practice and risked a challenge under the WTO by putting a requirement on third countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/2">Despite concerted efforts by member states, no alternative measure to tackle this problem through the licensing system has been found. Instead, circumvention is tackled by making it explicit that timber defined as legally produced&quot; will include timber imported from third countries (and therefore which could be illegally felled) and making it a requirement for Partner Countries to report on timber import levels and their actions to tackle circumvention.</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/3">The Government see the bilateral approach of the Forests Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) dossier as an important way to develop experience in tackling illegal logging and to build the consensus that could lead to a multilateral agreement. The UK is working very hard with other consuming countries to address issues of trade with third party countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.305W.2/4">Illegal logging was one of two topics of discussion at the first ever G8 Environment and Development Ministerial meeting in Derbyshire in March 2005. Ministers agreed to a range of actions, and officials will meet in 2006 to review progress. The UK has also led in promoting and supporting Regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) processes in order to intensify national efforts and strengthen bilateral, regional and multi-lateral collaboration to address violations of forest law and forest crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.306W.0/2">The Protection Against Cruel Tethering Act 1988 created a specific offence under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 of causing unnecessary suffering to a horse, ass or mule by the manner or condition of its tethering.

Anyone deliberately abandoning a horse is likely to be found guilty under the Bill's new Welfare or Cruelty Offences. Alongside the Bill we intend to produce a code of practice on tethering and keeping of horses and ponies. This will also address issues relating to stray animals.</p>

This includes looking at outright ban on the importation of illegal timber.

	<p pid="c.308W.0/1">The principal action being taken by Government to tackle the import of illegally logged timber is implementation of the Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) regulation. This developed out of the European Commission's FLEGT Action Plan, published in May 2003. It describes a package of measures to tackle illegal logging, including proposals that the EU enters into partnership agreements with timber producing countries to establish a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/2">The Government are delighted that the proposal for a licensing system was adopted by the EU in December 2005, under the UK's Presidency. Government believe that as a first step to address illegal logging, it is necessary to build consensus with producing countries and make sure that we do not discriminate against legitimate trade. The EU FLEGT licensing scheme, with its innovative approach of bilateral trade agreements and development assistance for improving forest governance, will achieve this in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/3">Although formal negotiations have not yet started with any country, discussions leading to negotiations have been underway with several countries where illegal logging is recognised to be a problem, and we hope that the first agreements will be in place during 2006. The UK is leading the negotiations with Ghana.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/4">The Department for International Development (DfID) has recently announced that it will be setting aside &pound;24 million over the next five years for this FLEGT negotiation process and for tackling illegal logging more generally.</p>
	<p pid="c.308W.0/5">The FLEGT Action Plan also proposes that the Commission look at other options to tackle illegal logging, including using Government procurement and introducing legislation to prevent the importation of illegally logged timber at a member state or EU level. They will be preliminarily discussed in Brussels at the end of January, after which a final report will be presented at Council to EU Ministers later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.310W.5/1">There is on-going research funded by the Department and carried out by the Sea Mammal Research Unit to monitor bycatch in all relevant UK fishery sectors and to develop mitigation measures to reduce the bycatch of marine mammals. The Department also obtains strandings data under the Defra-funded Cetacean and Turtle Strandings Scheme, carried out by the Natural History Museum in partnership with the Institute of Zoology and Scottish Agricultural College.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.5/2">Post mortems from strandings can identify whether dolphins have died as a result of bycatch (if the carcasses are in a good enough state) but cannot at this stage identify individual fisheries such as the bass pair trawl fishery. Research into net marks found on cetaceans is also being undertaken but is at a very early stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.310W.5/3">Results for the 2004&ndash;05 pair trawl fishery for bass show a marked decrease from the preceding year for the total numbers of dolphins observed as bycatch and the number of dolphins stranding in the south west coast has similarly decreased this year. It would however be speculative on the basis of one year's data alone to link these reductions and further analysis of the effectiveness of the 12 mile ban on sea bass pair trawling will be undertaken as further data becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="c.313W.2/1">With colleagues from 16 other countries HM ambassador in Tokyo delivered a Demarche to the Government of Japan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January</phrase>, protesting in the strongest terms on Japan's plans to expand its so-called 'scientific' whaling activities. The UK Government, in common with those of a majority of International Whaling Commission (IWC) members, have regularly criticised Japanese scientific whaling programmes in both the North Pacific (JARPN) and the Southern ocean (JARPA) as being of little scientific value and urged Japan to terminate them forthwith.</p>

	<p pid="c.320W.0/1">The QinetiQ flotation is not unsuitable for private investors. Private investors are able to apply for shares through a private client stockbroker if they so wish, although there is no guarantee any specific applicant will be successful. Based on advice from our financial advisers, the Government do not believe that significant expenditure on a retail offering to encourage private investors to apply for shares would present value for money for the taxpayer. Once trading has commenced private investors will also be able to buy shares in the normal way.</p>

Two of those areas are licensing authority income and costs and the consequence of the new fees regime on not-for-profit groups.

The Panel have recently written to all Licensing Authorities in England and Wales to request details of the income they have received under the new licensing regime from different licensed sectors, including sports clubs and village and community halls, which they believe they require in order to support them in the next stage of their work. The Panel are due to present their Final Report and recommendations to Government in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="c.325W.0/1">The Department does not hold information specifically on rural pub closures. However, the Government recognise that access to local pubs, as well as other services, is essential to ensuring that rural communities thrive and helps combat social exclusion. That is why, in settlements of less than 3,000 people, the Government have extended 50 per cent. rate relief to pubs, as well as village shops, petrol stations and small scale, non-agricultural enterprises on farms.</p>
	<p pid="c.325W.0/2">Also, the Countryside Agency has been a key partner in supporting the 'pub is the hub' initiative which is encouraging diversification by rural pubs to further enhance their contribution and help sustain them as businesses.

	<p pid="c.332W.9/1">DFID's aid allocation to particular countries is guided by a formula which takes into account the country's level of poverty and consequent need for aid, and its institutional capacity to make effective use of aid. We also take account of how much aid countries receive from other donors. Once allocated, the aid is spent through a range of channels as appropriate in the country context. These can include support through Governments to deliver their poverty reduction plans, support through civil society organisations or through international organisations such as the UN.</p>
	<p pid="c.332W.9/2">DFID believes that effective aid partnerships with developing country Governments depend on shared commitments to reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening public financial management to reduce the risk of corruption. DFID uses these commitments both as our criteria for deciding whether to provide aid through Government, and as conditions for our aid. Once aid has been committed to a partner Government, DFID will only reduce it if the Government moves away from one of these three partnership commitments.</p>

	<p pid="c.336W.2/1">The UK has committed a further &pound;3 million UK contribution in response to the food crisis in Kenya. Of this new commitment, &pound;1 million will be channelled through the World Food Programme (WFP) for food and the balance of &pound;2 million will be used to help with access to water. The total UK contribution stands at &pound;13.8 million since June 2004, out of which &pound;6.3 million has been provided through the WFP.</p>
	<p pid="c.336W.2/2">An estimated total of &pound;2.5 million people mostly in the north eastern and eastern parts of Kenya are affected by the drought. The results of a national assessment due in a week's time will determine the level of current and future needs but it is clear from my recent visit that the levels of malnutrition are unacceptably high and urgent action is needed by all parties; Government, donors, NGOs, and communities to help save the lives of those at risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.336W.2/3">Food aid is critical in saving lives in an emergency but, on its own, it will not prevent another crisis happening. Each drought increases the numbers of people facing hunger. People are unable to escape poverty even in good years because they have lost or sold the assets they need to rebuild their lives. If people are to escape from this trap they need concerted effort by Governments to invest in these areas. Our support to education and health go some way towards helping. The provision of safety nets such as timely, adequate and guaranteed payments of cash or food on a regular basis to the neediest also helps rebuild lives.</p>

	<p pid="c.337W.5/1">Many African countries lack the physical, human and institutional capacity to take advantage of either regional or global trade opportunities. Infrastructure, an enabling climate for the private sector and more efficient customs at borders are high priorities for regional trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.337W.5/2">DFID has committed to trebling 'aid for trade' to &pound;100 million by 2010&mdash;aid which will be used to build up the country's capacity to trade, develop infrastructure to facilitate trade and provide transitional support as global trade barriers are removed. For example, we have pledged $20 million in support of a new Infrastructure Consortium in Africa to better co-ordinate and target financing for regional infrastructure. We have also pledged $30 million towards an Investment Climate Facility which will help make Africa a better place for business and commerce (e.g. by reforming customs to support regional trade integration). Under the UK presidency, G7 Finance Ministers also endorsed Aid for Trade, calling on the international community to increase its global contribution to $4 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.337W.5/3">In addition, DFID is helping build the trading capacity of pan-African institutions (such as the African Union-New Partnership for African Development and Regional Economic Communities in southern, east and west Africa). For example, DFID's Regional Trade Facilitation Programme in southern Africa has helped countries to analyse their trading interests so they can participate more effectively in trade negotiations. We are also developing trade programmes in southern Africa to facilitate cross-border trade by establishing One Stop Border Posts.</p>

	<p pid="c.339W.9/2">There is a statutory requirement on local authorities and schools to limit the size of infant classes for five, six, and seven-year-olds taught by one teacher to 30 or fewer pupils. There is no legal requirement to limit class sizes in any other age group, but since 1997 the average class sizes in primary schools have fallen from 27.5 to 26.2.</p>

	<p pid="c.347W.2/10" class="indent">In response to PQ 46392, the PANDA (Performance and Assessment) report issued to all mainstream maintained secondary schools in England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase> was part of a series of reports published in 2005/06. Six sets of PANDA reports have been produced and made available to schools so far in 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.347W.2/11" class="indent">For all 18,000 mainstream maintained primary schools in England the following PANDAs were produced:</p>

	<p pid="c.347W.2/19" class="indent">The total cost to Ofsted of developing, producing and supporting schools and inspectors in using the PANDAs in 2005/06 was &pound;290,000. Appendix A provides a breakdown of these costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.347W.2/20" class="indent">This annual cost includes the development costs associated with the release of a New Style&quot; PANDA in September 2005. This and subsequent PANDAs contained new analysis using more sophisticated techniques and improved presentations.</p>

However the cost of developing, producing and supporting schools and inspectors in the use of this particular PANDA has been estimated to be &pound;50,000, equal to 1/6th of the annual cost of producing the six sets of PANDA reports released in 2005/06.</p>

The analysis in table 3.4.14 excluded A* grades from the calculations. The error required one line of programming code to be corrected. Following the correction, the production of the revised documents required IT processing time which incurred no additional cost. The only additional cost was for a letter sent to all secondary schools informing them of the error and the remedial action being taken. This additional letter cost &pound;1,500.</p>
	<p pid="c.347W.2/23" class="indent">In response to PQ 46644, a corrected New Style&quot; PANDA based on 2005 unvalidated data was made available for schools to download from the Ofsted website on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.3/1">The Counter Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF) has been created to give the Afghans greater ownership of the counter-narcotics agenda and ensure assistance is targeted effectively. The Government of Afghanistan are encouraging international donors to make un-earmarked contributions to the fund to give the Government maximum flexibility to allocate funding in accordance with the four priorities highlighted in its National Drugs Control Strategy: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; and developing state institutions at the central and provincial level. However, in recognition of the budgetary and policy constraints under which different donors operate, it will be possible to earmark funds for one or more of the following eight pillars of activity (building institutions, information campaign, alternative livelihoods, criminal justice, law enforcement, eradication, demand reduction, regional co-operation). It is not envisaged that the wages of permanent counter-narcotics staff working for the Ministry of Counter Narcotics will be funded through the CNTF&mdash;rather the fund will be used to cover projectised activity. The United Nations Development Programme will administer the fund which will ensure transparency and accountability.</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.6/1">In November 2005, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed the opium poppy cultivation and opium production figures for the 2004&ndash;05 season from their annual survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes, a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004, despite a significant reduction in cultivation (a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares in 2004 to 104,000 ha in 2005). Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for the increase in yield in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.6/2">The UNODC publishes figures for global illicit cultivation of opium poppy and production of opium and heroin in its annual World Drugs Report. Full details can be found on their website <a href="http://www.unodc.org">http://www.unodc.org</a>. According to the 2005 report, the potential heroin production for 2004 was estimated as 500 tonnes, if all the opium produced was converted to heroin. Figures for heroin production in 2005 in Afghanistan will not be available until the publication of the Report in June this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.6/3">We estimate that around 95 per cent. of heroin in the UK originates in Afghanistan.</p>

The Government have not made any separate representations to the Government of Belarus specifically concerning Pastor Sabilo or the Belarusian Evangelical Church.

	<p pid="c.352W.8/1">Countering the threat of missile proliferation remains one of the Government's strategic priorities, particularly where such proliferation might contribute to the delivery of weapons of mass destruction. We seek to monitor missile-related transfers to Iran in this context. Assessments of proliferation activity often draw on highly classified information; it is impossible, therefore, to comment on specific aspects.</p>
	<p pid="c.352W.8/2">The Government support the decision of the European Council in December 2003 to review the EU arms embargo on China. This review is on-going&mdash;it was last discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at December's General Affairs and External Relations Council. The Government do not wish to exclude any options for the review, or to pre-empt the conclusion of the review. There is no consensus at present in the EU for lift. Further consultations in the EU and with other international partners are necessary before any decision is taken. In the context of these discussions the EU recalls the European Council Conclusions in December 2004 that any decision on the arms embargo would not result in an increase of arms exports to China in either quantitative or qualitative terms.</p>

	<p pid="c.368W.2/1">In the last 12 months, the Identity Cards Programme has received four representations from individuals concerning the photographic element of identity cards. None of the correspondents disclosed their religion, and the focus of their representations was a concern that individuals required by their religion to cover their face should not be exempted from the requirement to have their photograph taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/2">In December 2004, the Identity Cards Programme conducted a special issues research which included individuals from various faith groups. The full results can be found on the website at <a href="http://www.identitycards.gov.uk">www.identitycards.gov.uk</a>. However, Muslim and Sikh women expressed concerns about removing their religious garments at an enrolment centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/3">A head and shoulders photograph showing features of the face will be included on the card. Regulations about types of photographs will be in line with those currently in place for passports and driving licence photographs. The UK Passport Service exercises its discretion as far as possible. However, the over-riding rule (set by international standards) is that the applicant's photo should show a full face and that all features should be clearly distinguishable.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/4">At some DVLA offices, Muslim women are offered a facility to go to a private office and reveal their face to a female member of staff so that their face can be matched against the photograph. The operation of ID cards will include guidance along these lines to ensure discretion and sensitivity.</p>

	<p pid="c.368W.5/2">The most recent study of identity fraud in other countries is contained in the 2002 Cabinet Office publication Identity Fraud: A Study&quot;. This study is available from the publications archive page on the identity cards website&mdash;<a href="http://www.identitycards.gov.uk">www.identitycards.gov.uk</a>. Chapter 6 summarises the results of research on the extent and nature of identity fraud overseas and action taken to counter identity fraud. The countries examined which had an identity card scheme were, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, France, Spain and Germany. The other countries involved were, the USA, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, all of which do not have identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.5/3">One of the main conclusions of the research was that all countries experience difficulty in establishing levels of identity fraud. The research also suggests that countries which use existing identifiers as pseudo identity numbers&quot;, such as the social security number in the USA, encounter many problems with identity fraud and with establishing the validity of the number, not least because it was not intended to be used for the wide variety of purposes that have become commonplace in the absence of a securely issued identity number.</p>

The Association of Chief Police Officers' Committee on Terrorism and Allied Matters sets policy and strategic direction for counter terrorism policing at a national level. Police counter-terrorist efforts are co-ordinated regionally and nationally through the Regional Intelligence Cells, the work of the National Coordinator of Special Branch and the National Coordinator of Terrorist Investigations while ensuring that force special branches maintain the essential link to local policing and local communities. The Metropolitan Police Service also has national counter terrorism responsibilities including a number of specialist units which provide support to forces. As with other aspects of policing, these structures are kept under constant review.</p>

While the police do not target the use of anti-terrorist powers against rail enthusiasts, photographing trains and railway stations can be an indicator of possible hostile terrorist reconnaissance and officers who encounter such activity may deem it appropriate to use stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000, when appropriate</p>

	<p pid="c.394W.0/2">Central to this will be the development of a new range of clinical assessment and diagnostic services&mdash;Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services (ICATS), provided in a variety of primary and secondary care settings. This will ensure that all patients are seen quickly by the most appropriate healthcare professional and will include a range of assessment, treatment, diagnostic and advisory services. A new Electronic Referrals Management System is being established to support ICATS and to ensure that patients have a central point of contact and will be informed of the next step in their treatment within five days of being referred by a GP.</p>
	<p pid="c.394W.0/3">The way in which out-patient waiting lists are managed and monitored is also being improved. Partial booking systems are already being implemented in all out-patient specialties and Out-patient Improvement Managers are being put in place in all trusts to ensure that services are more responsive to patients' needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.395W.2/4" class="indent">It is estimated that less than 1 per cent. of households in Northern Ireland are not connected to the public water supply. Water Service does not, at present, have a database of all household customers connected to mains water and cannot therefore supply the information on a constituency basis. However, a comprehensive customer database is currently being developed in preparation for the proposed introduction of domestic charging from April 2007 and this will identify any households not connected to the public water supply.</p>

	<p pid="c.396W.0/4" class="indent">It is estimated that less than 1 per cent. of households in Northern Ireland are currently not served by the public water supply and connecting all these, wholly at the public expense, could cost up to &pound;20 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.0/5" class="indent">While Water Service currently has a duty to provide water services, it is not required to do anything which is not practicable at a reasonable cost. For this reason, Water Service has always operated a policy of reasonable cost allowances for the purpose of determining whether applications for first time services can be fully met at public expense. The allowances for watermain schemes are &pound;5,000 for properties, which were occupied and on which rates were being paid on or before <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-31">31 May 2000</phrase>, and &pound;2,900 for other properties. The higher reasonable cost allowance for existing properties not connected to the public watermain reflects the importance attached to reducing the number of such properties. The policy provides Water Service with an objective mechanism to consider applications for new water services in a consistent and equitable manner. The policy seeks to strike a balance between the interests of householders and taxpayers, within the context of resources made available for water services.</p>
	<p pid="c.396W.0/6" class="indent">Where the cost of providing a first-time service exceeds the total reasonable cost allowance. Water Service will proceed with the scheme if he householders who will benefit from the scheme agree to meet the balance.</p>

	<p pid="c.412W.6/2">HMRC use a number of sophisticated tools to help them detect wrong and fraudulent claims. Cases requiring compliance intervention are selected using a risk-based approach, which examines the overall features of a claim, not the individual's nationality.</p>
	<p pid="c.412W.6/3">In addition, HMRC also consider all allegations of fraud seriously and will investigate any matter where there is sufficient risk. Where it is established that a claimant has provided incorrect or fraudulent information, HMRC have a number of measures available to them including the use of financial penalties. In the most serious cases HMRC will investigate with a view to securing a criminal prosecution under the new criminal offence of tax credit fraud.</p>

	<p pid="c.414W.8/1">Many of the supplies made by charities are not subject to VAT. Charities also benefit from VAT reliefs on their purchases worth more than &pound;200 million per year. This forms part of the total tax reliefs for charities worth &pound;2.4 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.8/2">Under agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs throughout the EU, successive Governments have agreed with European partners not to extend any existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. The scope of the exemptions from VAT is similarly limited by European agreements. It is therefore not possible for the Government to introduce any new VAT zero rates or exemptions for supplies or purchases made by charities.</p>
	<p pid="c.414W.8/3">Charities VAT costs have been considered by the Government in two major reviews since 1997. In the course of these reviews it was not possible to find a solution that was practical, efficient, affordable, well-targeted and based on principle. Available resources are better and more effectively deployed through targeted initiatives and support, such as the Futurebuilders investment fund, rather than through a general VAT refund scheme for all charities.</p>

	<p pid="c.421W.2/1">The usual procedure is that receipts received in one month are paid into the Consolidated Fund on the eighth banking day of the following month. However, to avoid problems with year end accruals, the usual practice is to pay over the March receipts before our accounting system closes in March. Although the intention was to do this in March 2005, it was inadvertently overlooked and the payment was made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.421W.2/2">This transaction concerns the transfer of money between two central Government accounts at the Bank of England and therefore did not involve any loss of interest, or any risk to taxpayers' money. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> the national non-domestic rates (NNDR) requiring payment to the Consolidated Fund was &pound;824 million. As it was year end, the amount received was lower than the usual monthly amount, which is typically about &pound;1.6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.421W.2/3">Procedures have been put in place to ensure that this oversight will not happen again and that future relevant payment will be made in March.</p>

It is understood that a draft RSS will be submitted by the SWRA for public consultation later this year. No guidance has been given by Government to the SWRA as to what specific housing numbers should be proposed in the draft RSS. Government guidance on the content of the RSS is contained in PPS11 Regional Spatial Strategies&quot; and in PPG3 Housing&quot; on planning for housing.</p>

	<p pid="c.429W.11/1">It is Government policy that social rents should be restructured and that over time tenants in social housing should pay similar rents for similar properties regardless of landlord.</p>
	<p pid="c.429W.11/2">The three-year review of rent restructuring policy, which reported in 2004, made a number of recommendations. One was to use the same formula for restructuring local authority rents as that which is currently used for restructuring Registered Social Landlords (RSL) rents, and adopt the Retail Price Index (RPI) as the inflation measure used in calculating local authority rent increases. Individual property valuations are unchanged, but the formula used to calculate rents now uses the average 1999 value for RSL properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.429W.11/3">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> that we would introduce in full the recommendations made in the review in 2006&ndash;07, reinforcing the steps already taken to create a fair and transparent rent setting system in the social rented sector. We have provided additional protection for council tenants by capping at 5 per cent. the average cash increase in rents in any local authority for each of the next two years. This is in addition to the caps and limits that have been in place since the policy was first introduced.</p>

The Customer Management System (CMS) is an integrated, information-gathering system for working age customers that is being rolled out across the Jobcentre Plus network. Most local authorities are now receiving at least some of their housing benefit and council tax benefit claims via CMS. In October 2005, changes were made to the system that brought a number of improvements for local authorities, the most significant being a reduction in clerical documentation with three forms being reduced to a single local authority Input Document. We are continuing to monitor and evaluate the impact of CMS on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.435W.2/2">We are currently piloting a new electronic link between the Department and local authorities. The link will use modern technology to pass information about DWP benefits to local authority housing benefit and council tax benefit staff. We expect the new IT to be more efficient than current links, to provide local authority staff with access to a wider range of information about DWP benefits and enable them to process the benefits that they administer more quickly. Subject to an evaluation, the new link will be rolled out nationally by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.436W.3/7" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> In September 2005, 297,000 cases were in receipt of maintenance via the Agency's collection service.

	<p pid="c.436W.3/12" class="indent">i) In 2003&ndash;04 the Family Resources Survey (FRS) reported that there were 550,000 Parents with care (PWCs) who were receiving maintenance direct from the NRP. It is likely that this figure will also include those cases in which the Agency has carried out a calculation or assessment and the NRP is then paying the PWC direct (i.e. maintenance direct&quot; cases, of which there were 84,000 in April 2004). However, it is not possible to quantify the extent to which such maintenance direct cases are, or are not, included in the FRS estimate.</p>
	<p pid="c.436W.3/13" class="indent">ii) Analysis of the 2004 Family and Children's Survey suggests that 131,000 households have a court order in force with an absent parent, and that 580,000 households have a voluntary agreement in place. As with the FRS, it is possible that there might be an unquantifiable overlap with Agency's maintenance direct&quot; cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.437W.5/5" class="indent">Information to answer this question is not available for old scheme cases on the old computer system (CSCS).

	<p pid="c.438W.8/1">Jobcentre Plus' main programmes and interventions are subject to a major programme of ongoing evaluation, analysis and monitoring by the Department, supported by a programme of commissioned independent research. Commissioned evaluations of outcomes and effectiveness are published and are publicly available. They can also be found on the DWP website and include all of the new deals and pilot initiatives such as Pathways to Work.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.8/2">The Department also evaluates the outcomes and effectiveness of services provided by the private and voluntary sector, the most significant of which is the Employment Zones evaluation. Independent research on customer outcomes include the working age research and analysis publication No. 176 (2003) which compared the job outcomes for people on New Deal 25 plus, before it was re-engineered, with those on the Employment Zone provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.8/3">Major evaluations also include a full cost benefit analysis and are carried out by DWP economists or by independent experts or a combination of both. Comparing the cost-effectiveness of Jobcentre Plus and private and voluntary sector services is difficult because Jobcentre Plus works in partnership with the private and voluntary sector. The current Employment Zones evaluation, however, will include a cost-benefit assessment. This will be carried out in-house, with administrative data analysis assessing the overall effectiveness of Employment Zones using valid Jobcentre Plus comparisons. This will be available in the autumn of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.8/4">The Department will also commission a short feasibility study to explore the possibility of assessing the overall impact of Jobcentre Plus as well as some of its larger labour market programmes on a range of macroeconomic variables. Results from the feasibility study should be available in the latter half of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.440W.5/1">The purposes to which longitudinal data matching are used within the Department for Work and Pensions are published on the Departmental website and are held in the Library. Longitudinal data held within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study are used to perform a range of statistical and research analyses, and some limited operational purposes, to give the Department further opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of its businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.5/2">We do not use longitudinal data matching when investigating individual benefit fraud cases. Therefore we have made no assessment of potential inaccuracies from using such a method.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.5/3">The majority of operational data matching for identifying fraud is still being undertaken on the Department's Generalised Matching Service; however longitudinal data are being used to inform longer term strategies for dealing with Fraud and Error. The combining of these two areas of work will allow the Department to assess and identify possible new areas of risk or inaccuracy not previously identifiable from simple data matching of current information.</p>

	<p pid="c.441W.3/1">The Social Fund Cold Weather Payments scheme was introduced in October 1988. It replaced a similar but not identical Cold Weather Payments scheme which had begun in December 1986. Prior to that there had been a system of payments based on local office discretion.</p>

Under the scheme, a Cold Weather Payment is made when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0&deg;C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer's postcode. Eligible customers are now those awarded pension credit, or those awarded income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have a pensioner or disability premium or a child who is disabled or aged under 5, when the temperature criterion is met for their postcode.</p>

	<p pid="c.443W.5/2">Around 3.6 million customers of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) currently have their benefit or pension paid into a Post Office card account. (HM Revenue and Customs and the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency also pay some of their customers into a Post Office card account, taking the total number of card accounts to around 4.25 million.)</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.5/3">The Post Office card account was introduced in April 2003 to help support the conversion of some customers from order books to Direct Payment. It was aimed at those who did not already have a suitable account and was designed as a stepping stone&quot; to help people who had not used a bank account before get used to banking before moving on to an account offering more features.</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.5/4">In line with our wider policy on financial inclusion, we have always made it clear that payment into a bank or building society account is the best option for the overwhelming majority of customers. The Post Office card account is a simple account with limited functions. It can only receive payments of benefits, pensions and tax credits. It does not, for example, allow customers to make savings on fuel bills by paying by Direct Debit; it cannot receive payments of wages; cheques cannot be paid in to the Post Office card account; and it does not pay interest on balances.</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.5/5">Although the card account was designed for those who did not already have a bank or building society account, 70 per cent. of people who have opened one already have an account. And the remaining 30 per cent. have shown that, by managing to open and operate a Post Office card account, they can use other easy to operate banking products&mdash;including basic bank accounts, which are widely available and accessible at Post Office branches. The Post Office card account has allowed some customers to move from receiving their benefit or pension through cashing an order book at the Post Office counter to getting used to the basics of banking. In practice, there is no real difference in accessing money at the Post Office via a bank account compared to a Post Office card account&mdash;customers can collect the same money, on the same day as they do now at the Post Office, by using a plastic card and a personal identification number.</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.5/6">The Post Office card account contract runs between 2003 and 2010. There was never any expectation that the Government should provide funding beyond that date and there is no case for doing so. The Post Office card account does little to promote financial inclusion. Customers will still be able to collect their benefit or pension at the Post Office by using their bank or building society account there. Around 25 different bank accounts can be accessed at Post Office branches.</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.5/7">We also understand Post Office Limited is developing new banking and savings products which will be aimed at existing Post Office card account customers. We would like every DWP customer who currently has a Post Office card account to do their banking at the Post Office if that is in their best interests. DWP can help people move off Post Office card accounts to having their benefit or pension paid into more suitable bank or building society accounts, and help them open new ones which can be used at the Post Office if necessary. We will work with the Post Office and other stakeholders to develop a strategy to move customers from the Post Office card account.

	<p pid="c.454W.3/20">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.3/21">1. Data are for the latest 12 months from October 2004 to September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.3/22">2. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.3/23">3. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.</p>
	<p pid="c.454W.3/24">4. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</p>

	<p pid="c.460W.8/34">Finished consultant episode (FCE)</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.8/35">An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.8/36">Patient counts</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.8/37">Patient counts are based on the hospital episode statistics (HES) unique patient identifier, HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid="c.460W.8/38">Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&ndash;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&ndash;97, 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.</p>

	<p pid="c.462W.2/1">The improving working lives (IWL) standard was launched in October 2000 with an initial allocation of &pound;9 million to health organisations and funding to promote IWL in subsequent years is in the table. IWL supports the aims of the NHS Plan in relation to increasing the national health service workforce. IWL is a feature of every day management in the NHS with successful implementation of modern employment practices and follows seven areas of good practice, which include flexible working and flexible retirement, child care and support for carers.</p>

Other options on flexible working include the use of different rosters and working patterns to reflect service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/16">The flexible careers scheme for hospital doctors was introduced in November 2001 and extended to general practitioners in 2002. The scheme supports flexible working and return to practice for doctors and general practitioners and Departmental funding from central programme budgets which is shown in the table.</p>

	<p pid="c.462W.2/29">Flexible working is now well embedded in the NHS through implementation of modern employment practice and legislation. The management and funding of the scheme is in the process of being devolved to local health organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/30">The NHS child care strategy had over &pound;70 million invested between 2001 to 2004 to provide 150 nurseries for NHS staff. In addition, the Government committed the &pound;100 million savings from Shifting the Balance of Power (StBoP) to extending the child care strategy, to ensure that the child care needs of all staff are met. From 2004&ndash;05 responsibility for child care has been devolved to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/31">In 2004&ndash;05 support for child care was extended to NHS students in the form of NHS student child care allowance. In 2004&ndash;05, &pound;7 million was provided from central programme budget and in 2005&ndash;06, the investment will rise to approximately &pound;16 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/32">The golden hello scheme for general practitioners was replaced in April 2005 by the primary care development scheme with the aim to provide funding, targeted locally, at those areas that have the greatest recruitment difficulties in general practice. The Department allocated &pound;13 million to support the scheme in 2005&ndash;06 to strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/33">The NHS delayed retirement scheme was replaced from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> by the new seniority arrangements negotiated for the new general practitioner contract. Retaining staff approaching retirement and encouraging staff to work beyond conventional retirement age one of the key features of IWL.</p>

	<p pid="c.472W.2/1">National health service trusts and general practitioners (GPs) will not be required to transfer handwritten notes to the NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) when the services goes live locally. Rather, each patient's care record will be populated using data from existing electronic systems. Trusts and GP practices will, however, be free to supplement the transferred data from paper records where they feel it to be clinically and logistically appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.2/2">GPs already frequently transfer patient records to another GP when a patient changes their address or GP. It is the responsibility of the individual clinician to ensure that electronic data they have entered or transferred to a new or replacement electronic system is correct. An electronic facility to assist this process is currently under development&mdash;the 'GP2GP' record transfer service. This will reduce the amount of re-keying required by enabling the direct transfer of the electronic component of a patient's existing care record.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.2/3">The Data Protection Act 1998 establishes a set of principles with which users of personal data must comply. These include the duty to ensure that information is accurate and up to date. This duty would extend to individual GPs and other clinicians when transferring local electronic records, or transcribing or scanning paper records, to the NHS CRS. Guidance for transcribing paper records developed by the Royal College of General Practitioners and issued by the Department makes it clear that responsibility for the quality of the necessary processes lies with the individual practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.2/4">When the NHS CRS is deployed locally, a senior clinician, for example, the principle practitioner in a GP practice is responsible for approving the transfer of data. This only occurs after industry-standard testing procedures have demonstrated that the data has been safely transferred. Verification is by a series of quantitative and qualitative pre- and post-validation checks that ensure that the data stored on the new system is the same as the original.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.2/5">It is considered to be good practice for NHS trusts and GP practices to preserve the existing paper records. The facility exists to easily store a case note reference on the electronic system that allows ready identification of the paper record where this may be required.</p>
