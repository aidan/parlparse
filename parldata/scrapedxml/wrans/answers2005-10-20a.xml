	<p pid="a.1125W.3/1">Improvements in access to the Parliamentary Estate for people with disabilities have been ongoing for many years. A Disability Access Audit Report was produced in April 2004 which set out the then current situation and recommended a continuing programme of improvements. Notable recent projects have included installation of ramps, such as in Star Chamber Court; installation or modification of lifts and the installation of hearing loops in Committee Rooms. There is an ongoing programme of work to improve lifts in and around the Parliamentary Estate to aid access for people with disabilities and access audits have been commissioned for each building comprising the Parliamentary Estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1129W.5/1">An important part of DEFRA's Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre is specifically directed towards better understanding of how the frequency and intensity of severe weather events may be changing in response to changes in global climate, as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Recent research by Hadley Centre has shown for example that the European hot summer of 2003 was up to four times more likely to have happened because of the increased levels of greenhouse gases. Studies also suggest that the frequency of droughts and extreme rainfall events may increase overall in response to global warming although there will may well be local and regional variations. The effect of global warming on storminess is less clear but the Hadley Centre has recently published work indicating a significant increase in the number of severe storms over the UK as a whole since the 1950s, which may be at least partly related to global warming.</p>

	<p pid="a.1129W.8/1">Certain aspects of Contraction and Convergence are appealing, including the identification of a fixed level for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations, and comprehensive global participation. However, one key element of any future regime must be its workability and one particular concern with contraction and convergence is the question of how globally acceptable, and in consequence how workable, it would prove to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1129W.8/2">First, we do not yet see evidence that other key Annex I countries are likely to support this approach. The US has already indicated that it is opposed to a per-capita approach, and as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, their inclusion will be vital if we are to solve the problem. Australia, Canada and New Zealand would also need to take on much more stringent targets under this regime. Many of the major developing countries, such as China, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil are approaching, or have passed the level that would be permissible for per-capita emissions, and would be forced to take reductions in the short-term if the scheme were implemented. They would be very unlikely to support the proposal as it would be seen as a curb on their development. Experts from these countries have shown some interest in alternative frameworks including an element of historical responsibility and capacity to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1129W.8/3">Second, the approach requires upfront agreement to a global stabilisation target, but many countries outside the EU are reluctant to discuss this. Logically, it would make sense to agree a stabilisation level and then from this the respective responsibility of each country would flow. However, the complexity of the issues and political reality is such that a sequential approach is unlikely. The UK is therefore pursuing a two-pronged approach&mdash;pressing for agreement on a long-term stabilisation limit while simultaneously maintaining pressure on countries to take ambitious short-term action to mitigate emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133W.3/1">The North American ruddy duck was introduced to wildfowl collections in the UK in the 1940s, from where a small number escaped from captivity and began to breed in the wild. As the UK population of wild ruddy ducks increased, so did the number of ruddy ducks on the European mainland. Hybridisation with the Spanish population of the globally threatened white-headed duck, now numbering some 2,600, is recognised as the most significant threat to that species' long-term survival.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.3/2">Initial research on control methods was carried out by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (Hughes, 1996) and the three year UK Ruddy Duck Control Trial, commissioned by my Department, sought to verify their findings. The report (published in July 2002, copies available in the Library of the House) indicated that eradication of ruddy ducks from the United Kingdom was feasible within 10 years, and that shooting on over wintering sites was the most effective means of control.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.3/3">In a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>, Elliot Morley announced that the Government agreed in principle to the eradication of the ruddy duck in United Kingdom. Since that time DEFRA has been funding additional research to refine the effectiveness of the control strategy, and to investigate the effectiveness of alternative control measures such as egg oiling and pricking. A report of the research undertaken to the end of September 2005 is due to be published imminently, and will be available in the Library of the House in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.3/4">A bid for funding under the LIFE Nature programme was recently approved by the European Commission, which supports eradication as part of efforts to protect the globally endangered white-headed duck. DEFRA's decision to co-fund the eradication programme was informed by the report of the control trial and by the additional research findings, and a licence has now been issued to the Central Science Laboratory to allow them to commence work. Detailed information about the LIFE project can be found on the Commission's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133W.3/5">The Government have also issued, in England, a general licence to remove the protection afforded to ruddy ducks by domestic legislation. The licence has been kept under review since it was first issued in July 2003, and has been revised to ensure the licence conditions are appropriate. The current licence was issued in December 2004, and is available on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="a.1136W.2/1">The requirements relating to environmental impact assessment of development falling within the planning system are set out in the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/293).</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.2/2">For some types of development environmental impact assessment (EIA) is mandatory. For others it is required if the local planning authority considers that the particular development would be likely to have significant effects on the environment. Where EIA is required, the developer must provide environmental information (called an Environmental Statement) which includes: a description of the development comprising information on the site, design and size of the development; a description of the aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected including, in particular, population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between all these aspects; a description of the measures envisaged to mitigate any significant adverse effects; an outline of any alternatives considered; and a non-technical summary of the above information. The Environmental Statement is circulated to statutory consultation bodies, and made available to the public, for comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.2/3">The Regulations do not specify when the EIA has to be carried out. However, a planning authority is prohibited from granting planning permission unless an Environmental Statement has been provided. If the authority considers there are deficiencies in the Environmental Statement it can require an applicant to provide further information or produce evidence needed to verify any information in the Statement. In determining an application the planning authority must take account of the Environmental Statement, any further information provided, and any comments or representations made by statutory consultees and the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139W.5/1">Table A presents the 25 local authorities in England reporting the highest number of households on their housing register as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, and Table B presents the 25 local authorities with the largest number of households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty, and in temporary accommodation (with their households) arranged by the authority awaiting a settled home as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.5/2">Local authorities do not hold a waiting list for homeless applications; as soon as they have reason to believe that a person is homeless or threatened with homelessness they must make inquiries to determine whether any duty is owed under the homelessness legislation. Information about the length of time taken by local authorities to process applications is not collected centrally, but The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Homelessness Code of Guidance recommends that wherever possible inquiries should be completed, and the applicant notified, within 33 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.5/3">The duty owed to an applicant, on behalf of the household, accepted as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need is to secure suitable accommodation for the applicant and his or her household. In many cases, a settled home is not immediately available, and the local housing authority will secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. In such cases, the applicant household will usually join the housing register for an allocation of housing under Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996 (although other housing options such as a qualifying offer of an assured shorthold tenancy can also bring the homelessness duty to an end).</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.5/4">The Government's homelessness strategy Sustainable Communities: settled homes; changing lives sets out the challenging aim to halve the number of households in insecure temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142W.0/1">Article 8 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 says that no application may be determined until 21 days have elapsed since notice of the application was displayed or served. This period is to allow people time to comment. Most householder and other minor development must be publicised by notice near the application site, or by letter to those with land adjoining it. Larger schemes should also be publicised by advertisement in local newspapers and on the authority's website. In DoE Circular 15/92, &quot;Publicity for Planning Applications&quot;, authorities are urged to do more than comply with the legal requirement. Moreover, the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires each authority to prepare Statements of Community Involvement, which should include the authority's policy for community involvement on planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142W.0/2">No statistics are kept on the numbers of complaints about the consultation process for planning permissions. If a planning decision ignores some crucial, relevant consideration, it might be open to challenge through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142W.0/3">An authority sets its own closing date for representations about a proposal. There is nothing in law to prevent it accepting a late comment if appropriate. However, if the matter is to go to committee, the authority will need to make sure it complies with the Local Government Act 1972 as amended, which requires relevant committee papers to be made public at least five days before the committee discusses the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145W.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling human trafficking. It has a comprehensive strategy encompassing legislation, law enforcement, prevention, international cooperation and support for victims. The Government provides &pound;20 million of funding annually to Reflex, the multi-agency task force which coordinates the law enforcement response to organised immigration crime, including people trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.2/2">In the year to March 2005 Reflex carried out 343 operations which led to 149 disruptions, 1,456 arrests and the seizure of over &pound;5.5 million in criminal assets. The UK has made people trafficking a priority during its EU presidency. It is working closely with the Commission in developing an EU plan on preventing and combating trafficking in persons. In March 2003 a small scale Home Office-funded pilot scheme was launched in partnership with Eaves Housing for Women to provide safe accommodation and one-to-one support for adult women who have been trafficked into the UK to work as prostitutes. The Scheme has recently been formally evaluated and overall findings were positive on the model and quality of support provided. A copy of the summary findings from the evaluation can be obtained from:</p>

	<p pid="a.1150W.2/2">The report recommended that a motorsport development board be created to lead, coordinate and prioritise development activities and an RDA-led Government motorsport unit should be formed to coordinate available Government resources towards the motorsport cluster. The board and the RDA-led unit are collectively known as motorsport development UK (MDUK).</p>
	<p pid="a.1150W.2/3">The projects now being taken forward by motorsports development UK are based upon the panel's priorities. These have not been revisited and it would be for the organisation itself to recommend any changes, either to the projects or the way in which they are being implemented. Assessment of the propriety and value for money of each project is carried out in line with the established procedures of the funding body concerned and action is taken where necessary to safeguard public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150W.2/4">There has been some encouraging progress particularly in the use of bio-fuels in motorsport and also engaging young people to take part in engineering activities with a motorsport theme&mdash;the &quot;Learning Grid'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150W.2/5">Spending to date on the five projects now being pursued is shown in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.1151W.2/1">The Equal Opportunities Commission's survey &quot;Dads and Their Babies: Leave Arrangements and the First Year&quot;, published earlier this year and part-funded by DTI, found that nine out of 10 fathers take time off work to spend with a new child and that over two-thirds of fathers currently take up the paternity entitlements available to them. The survey also found that a large percentage of employers are providing support for fathers which goes beyond the statutory provision and that almost three-quarters (72 per cent.) of the surveyed fathers who took paternity leave took at least some of this at full pay. We estimate that around 415,000 working fathers are eligible for statutory paid paternity leave.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158W.0/1">The statutory National Curriculum Science Order requires that all pupils should learn about the effects of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, schools are expected to use the non-statutory frameworks for Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) and Citizenship at key stages 1 and 2, PSHE at key stages 3 and 4 and the Citizenship programme of study at key stages 3 and 4 as the context for developing drug and alcohol education further. In 2004 all schools were issued with guidance on all aspects of drug education, including alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.0/2">Since 1997, we have made over &pound;70 million available to local education authorities to support drug, alcohol and tobacco education and prevention in schools. Over the last three years more than 3,000 teachers have undertaken the PSHE certificate which sets standards in the teaching of PSHE, including alcohol education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.0/3">Together with the Home Office and Department of Health, we are supporting a national five year research programme called &quot;Blueprint&quot; to test the effectiveness of drug education initiatives in schools. It will make a significant contribution to developing a UK evidence base for drug, alcohol and tobacco education.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163W.0/1">None, although we have received some representations from concerned members of the public about nuisance and road safety issues arising when such vehicles are ridden by children or adults on the public highway.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.0/2">In the Department's view it is illegal to use vehicles not compliant with road traffic law on the public highway. It is for the courts to provide an authoritative interpretation of the law, and two High Court judgements have confirmed miniature motor scooters to be motor vehicles within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended. We believe it likely that a similar judgement could be made on other vehicles, such as miniature motorcycles, should a court case arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.0/3">Powered vehicles on the public highway must meet relevant construction requirements and be registered, taxed, insured etc. Drivers/riders must hold an appropriate licence and where necessary wear a suitable helmet. Enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for individual chief officers of police. In addition police forces can counter irresponsible use with powers under the Police Reform Act 2002 to seize vehicles being driven in a careless and inconsiderate manner or off-road without consent and in a way which causes alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.0/4">I understand that the packaging on powered items such as miniature motorcycles or scooters generally includes a warning that they are not for highway use. However it may be that, once such packaging is discarded, this is overlooked or ignored. My Department and the Home Office have both issued guidance on our websites to remind the public about responsible use of these vehicles and possible penalties for mis-use.</p>

	<p pid="a.1166W.9/1">The 2002 cross-cutting review on health inequalities recognised age as one dimension of tackling health inequalities. &quot;Better Health in Old Age&quot; published in November 2004, helped to ensure that people are treated on the basis of their needs, rather than their age. There has been a major increase in elective surgery for most old-age related needs and there is now a wider appreciation and awareness across health and social care of age discrimination as an issue. Action is being taken at a local level and national health service organisations have been advised to check their written policies to ensure they have no age bias.</p>

The work now under way is designed to implement the recommendations in particular how burns services should be stratified. This is a complex exercise being undertaken by the national health service. The need to ensure a transparent and evidence-based process has required a greater level of analysis and discussion with burns services than originally envisaged. The options sub-group of the national burn care group are not now anticipating making recommendations before spring 2006 with a public consultation likely in summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174W.11/1">The Department does not routinely collect information centrally about misdiagnosis by general practitioners. However, the Government established the National Patient Safety Agency in July 2001 to improve the safety of national health service patient care and to set up a national reporting and learning system (NRLS) for adverse events. This system has now been rolled out across the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/2">No cases have been reported to the NRLS to date where the patient died as a result of misdiagnosis reported to the NRLS. However, the NRLS has received only a relatively small number of incidents from primary care. Two deaths have been reported where there was a delay in diagnosis, one as a result of delay on the part of the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/3">GPs are expected to learn in training the skills needed to deal with all their patients, including effective diagnosis. Government do not specify the content of the GP training curriculum. This is the job of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB), which is the competent authority for postgraduate medical training in the United Kingdom. PMETB is an independent professional body.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/4">Regulations specify seven competencies which must be tested and which the curriculum must therefore teach:</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/5" class="indent">factual medical knowledge sufficient to enable the doctor to perform the duties of a GP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/6" class="indent">the ability to apply factual medical knowledge to the management of problems presented by patients in general practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/7" class="indent">effective communication, both orally and in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/8" class="indent">the ability to consult satisfactorily with general practice patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/9" class="indent">the ability to review and critically analyze the practitioner's own working practices and to manage any necessary changes appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/10" class="indent">clinical skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/11" class="indent">the ability to synthesize all of the above competencies and apply them appropriately in a general practice setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.11/12">All GPs are also subject to annual appraisal. This involves the GP discussing their practice with a trained appraiser against the headings of the General Medical Council's (GMC) &quot;Good Medical Practice&quot; guidance. Agreed areas for improvement are taken forward into a personal development plan which informs the doctor's training and development, which is reviewed over the following year. More serious concerns are dealt with outside of this process through a number of local and national arrangements, including retraining or reference to the GMC.</p>

	<p pid="a.1183W.3/1">Information is not available in the requested format. The Department only collects waiting times for consultant led services and since the majority of referrals for psychological therapies would be to other mental health professionals such as clinical psychologists, this information does not capture the volume of activity accurately. At the end of June, there were 362 people waiting for an outpatient appointment with a psychotherapy consultant. Of these, 25 had waited 13 to 17 weeks, 77 eight to 13 weeks, 127 four to eight weeks, and 133 less then four weeks. A further six people were waiting for an inpatient appointment with a psychotherapy consultant. Of these, three had waited less than a month and the other three had waited less than two months. In line with the Government's manifesto commitment, the Department will continue to improve services for people with mental health problems at primary and secondary levels and this will include extending the availability of psychological therapies of proven effectiveness.</p>

The number of beds in national health service facilities varies, depending on the range and type of services they provide and the way in which the admission and discharge of patients is managed.

	<p pid="a.1185W.8/2">The Department highlighted stroke as one of eight standards in the older people's national service framework (2001). In recognition of the need to increase understanding of stroke prevention, care and treatment, the Department is investing &pound;20 million over five years in a new United Kingdom stroke research network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185W.8/3">The Department's public health campaigns make a significant contribution to preventing strokes. These include campaigns on smoking and healthy eating, and the Food Standards Agency campaign on reducing salt consumption.</p>

	<p pid="a.1187W.2/2">The Your Health, Your Care, Your Say consultation is a deliberative process designed to find out what the public wants from community health and social care services to meet its everyday needs. The programme includes four regional public engagement events, held in Gateshead, Leicester, London and Plymouth and a national event in Birmingham. Local health and social care communities, as well as stakeholder and voluntary organisations, are being encouraged to facilitate local public engagement events. People can also take part in the consultation by completing an on-line questionnaire at <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/yoursay">www.nhs.uk/yoursay</a>. The estimated eventual cost of the nationally organised elements of the consultation is expected to be about &pound;1.2 million, funded from the Department's running costs budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.1188W.10/1">Child benefit recognises the costs of children for all families by directing weekly support for each child to the main carer irrespective of income. The rate of child benefit for the first child has risen by 25 per cent. in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.10/2">The Government have recently taken powers to extend child benefit to young people over the age of 16 in unwaged training and to 19-year-olds who are finishing a course of education or unwaged training they started before they turned 19. This extension will be implemented from April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1197W.8/1">There is no legislation in place to prohibit the importation of timber on the specific grounds that it was illegally logged. It is expected that a council regulation to establish the forest law enforcement governance and trade system will be adopted by the council in November 2005. This regulation will prohibit the importation of timber and certain semi-processed timber products into the EU without a valid licence issued by the relevant authorities of the exporting country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.8/2">The importation of some species of wood is restricted under council Regulation 338/97 (on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein), which imposes import controls throughout the EU on all species (and their parts and derivatives) set out in the appendices to the convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES).</p>
	<p pid="a.1197W.8/3">HM Revenue and Customs made 30 seizures of ramin wood in the last three years for the absence of CITES import permits, export permits or both. In 2003 customs concluded an investigation into ramin imports from the previous year that breached the import restriction by compounding proceedings under section 152 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. However, HMRC cannot say whether the ramin in any of these cases had been illegally felled.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.3/1">The hon. Member will be aware that, following the June European Council, the future of the constitutional treaty is uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/2">Article III-293 of the EU constitutional treaty, which sets out the role of the European Council in defining the strategic interests and objectives of the Union in external policies, provides that &quot;the European Council shall act unanimously&quot; not by qualified majority. Only European decisions defining a specifically identified Union action or position on these unanimously agreed strategic interests and objectives can be adopted by qualified majority, under article III-300(2<i>(a)</i>).</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/3">A wide range of themes and regions have already featured as areas of common foreign and security policy activity. However only three of these&mdash;Russia, Ukraine and Euromed&mdash;have had strategic interests and objectives identified for them in a manner similar to the provisions in article II-293.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/4">Under article I-28.2 of the constitutional treaty the European Union Foreign Minister (EUFM) would carry out his role in common foreign and security policy &quot;as mandated by the Council&quot;&mdash;ie the member states acting unanimously. Questions of &quot;jurisdictional controversy&quot; between the EUFM and a member state would therefore be unlikely, and would undoubtedly be addressed and settled amicably in discussions in the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.3/5">There is no provision in the European Union constitutional treaty which places an obligation on member states or other international organisations to provide the EU Minister with a seat at international forums attended by the UK. My right hon. Friend the then Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. MacShane), set out in more detail the relationship proposed by the constitutional treaty between the EU Foreign Ministers and international organisations, in a letter to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1598" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Library of the House (House of Commons reference: DEP 07/0072).</p>

Importantly, IPTLs need to acquire and maintain a global understanding and expertise in the market of their particular business area to maximise opportunities and technological benefits to create a healthy and competitive environment aimed at securing the best solutions and value for money for our acquisition requirements. Decisions to visit bidders and potential suppliers, or to undertake any other visits, are based on business requirements and are in accordance with the normal departmental travel and subsistence rules. Travel and subsistence costs must be authorised and records maintained as appropriate for audit purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1210W.5/1">The MOD's policy is not to pay bid costs. However, it is in the interests of MOD and industry to minimise the time and costs of tendering. MOD makes every effort to do this through a well established selective tendering process aimed at choosing the tender offering the most effective solution and best value for money. The general policy includes normally inviting a maximum of six bidders, specifying tender assessment criteria designed to facilitate early decision-making and a structured selection procedure to &quot;preferred bidder&quot;. The process was recently reviewed and continues to be monitored for effectiveness. The newly formed more effective contracting initiative applies a phased approach to contractual commitment and provides for the option of early down-selection during the assessment phase.</p>

	<p pid="a.1211W.2/1">The focus of the UK Government's space policy is on civil and scientific uses. However, we also derive important security benefits from its military use. Like many countries, the UK uses satellites for a wide range of military functions such as secure communications, meteorological predictions, and effective monitoring of various arms control treaties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.2/2">Although the military use of space is integral to our security responsibilities, the UK Government have no plans to deploy weapons in space. As one of the depository states (along with the US and Russia), the UK Government continue to fully support the 1967 Outer Space treaty, which places important constraints on the use of space, including prohibiting the development of weapons of mass destruction in space and military activity on the moon and other celestial bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1211W.2/3">The main forum for discussing the military use of space is the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. We have taken part in informal discussions on the possibility of a further treaty banning weapons in space, although there has been no international consensus on the need for such a treaty. We continue to support the annual resolution on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) at the UN.</p>

The NAO report &quot;The Management of Defence Research and Technology&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-10">10 March 2004</phrase> shows how competition will affect QinetiQ's share of the elements of the research programme that equated to applied and corporate research. QinetiQ's assured share of these elements of the research programme will decline over time, dropping to less than 10 percent. by financial year 2008&ndash;09.

Initial preparatory work is being undertaken by officials on possible options for the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent. However, Ministers have not yet begun to consider the position on this issue in any detail.

	<p pid="a.1220W.6/2">Northern Ireland has one of the best survival rates among cystic fibrosis sufferers in the United Kingdom, and outcomes are comparable to the best cystic fibrosis centres in the world. This may be attributed to early diagnosis, with neonatal screening in place in Northern Ireland for over 20 years, and to the expert care provided by clinical staff, particularly in the specialist centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.6/3">The management of patients with cystic fibrosis requires a multidisciplinary team approach. A major objective of treatment is to promote enhanced self-management and to enable people to maximise their health and well being in the community. This is supported by general and specialised services as required, and tailored to the individual patient's needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1221W.0/2"><i>(a)</i> Within the cervical screening programme there are internal and external quality assurance systems which measure the performance of the programme against agreed national standards. The data for 2002&ndash;03 (the most recent year available) show that the Northern Ireland programme is meeting the national standards, in all board areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1221W.0/3"><i>(b)</i> The number of cervical cancers diagnosed each year in Northern Ireland and the number of deaths attributed to this form of cancer are relatively small&mdash;about 80 new cases and 30 deaths. With such small numbers it is difficult to prove effectiveness but over the last few years there has been a small but gradual decline in the number of deaths here. However figures for England, Scotland and Wales show a sizeable reduction in death numbers, a situation which contrasts with the Republic of Ireland which does not have a comprehensive population-based screening programme. In addition it is noteworthy that there has been an improvement in the five year survival rate which is now 72 per cent. compared to 61 per cent. 10 years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.1222W.11/2">The nature of the information sought is not available as prior to April 2004 Departments did not specifically categorise support to church or faith based groups they were recorded as voluntary community groups. From April 2004 with the establishment of the Northern Ireland Government funding database Departments are now recording the nature of organisations, their activity focus and geographical area of operation. The following table lists funding since 2004 to those organisations which have identified themselves as faith based groups and which council area they operate in. This does not include organisations that may have designated themselves as charitable, voluntary or community groups which however are led by faith based organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1222W.11/3">The database is still being populated by Departments. It will be possible in future years to provide more comprehensive information.</p>

	<p pid="a.1233W.5/1">In response to concerns about the number of violent attacks on patients and staff, the Department issued guidance to health and personal social services employers. This guidance urged employers to regularly review the assessment of risk associated with different facilities/locations, to introduce a standard method of recording all incidents of verbal and physical abuse and to regularly train staff and ensure that the training is appropriately tailored for the different staff disciplines. Employers were also encouraged to press charges in situations where staff have been the subject of violent or abusive behaviour and to provide lone peripatetic workers with a mobile telephone and develop protocols to monitor the safety of the worker. The guidance also advised that the number of entrances to A and E departments should be restricted, particularly late at night and that limits should be placed on the number of persons, not themselves requiring treatment, given entry to an A and E department.</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/2">In implementing the guidance, some trusts have installed emergency panic buttons and CCTV in A and E units, and toughened transparent screens at interview hatches.</p>
	<p pid="a.1233W.5/3">The Department has launched a publicity campaign, designed to emphasise the message that violent attacks on staff are a crime and that the perpetrators could face a prison sentence. The Department and PSNI have also developed joint protocols for reporting incidents of verbal and physical abuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.1234W.2/1">Trained staff employed from overseas does not have the effect of creating savings in training costs. Ethical recruitment of overseas staff has been carried out in recent years to partly address serious work force shortages when the level of departmental funding for training would not have supplied sufficient numbers of trained staff for the health service. Departmental spending on training has since increased considerably with the annual intake of student nurses being increased from 480 in 1999 to the current level of 750; an additional 63 medical students will enter Queen's University in September 2005, bringing the annual intake to 250.</p>
