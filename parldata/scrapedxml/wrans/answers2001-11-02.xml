This is the cost to either the police or the local authority and includes the staff costs associated with evidence gathering, preparing the case and attending court.

	<p pid=".863W.5/2">There is no specific offence of using a hand-held mobile phone while driving, and accordingly no guidance has been issued. Existing legislation places the responsibility on drivers to have proper control of their vehicles at all times. Any motorist who fails to do so, for whatever reason, is liable to be prosecuted by the police. Drivers may be charged with failing to exercise proper control of a vehicle, careless and inconsiderate driving, or even dangerous driving, if using a mobile phone causes them to drive in such a manner.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.5/3">In line with the commitment given in the Road Safety Strategy we are keeping under review the case for specific legislation. At present, however, we share the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers what existing legislation provides sufficient powers to prosecute successfully any driving offences that may arise from the use of mobile phones. Our focus is therefore on raising awareness of road safety risks.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.0/2">There are two major schemes for which my Department has made expenditure allocations during the period with reference to the Index of Multiple Deprivation.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.0/3">The Department allocated &pound;75 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund for Space for Sport and Arts. Expenditure will start this year and extend into 2003&ndash;04. This scheme, sponsored with the Department for Education and Skills, seeks to provide in the areas of greatest need around 300 new sports and arts facilities in primary schools for use by both pupils and the wider community. This funding is being supplemented by Lottery funding of &pound;25 million from Sport England, &pound;25 million from the New Opportunities Fund and &pound;5 million from the Arts Council of England. The Department invited 65 local education authorities to participate in the scheme. These were selected using a number of indices of educational, socio-economic, sporting and cultural deprivation&mdash;including the DTLR's indices of deprivation 2000; meeting the criteria for other programmes such as Education Action Zones, Excellence in Cities, Sports Action Zones and Health Action Zones; nomination by Regional Arts Boards; and being within the Arts Council of England's priority regions.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.0/4">The Department has also allocated &pound;40 million (&pound;15 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;25 million in 2003&ndash;04) to the Arts Council of England for the establishment of 16 pilot Creative Partnerships in deprived areas to provide exciting and challenging opportunities for young people to experience, learn from and enjoy artistic and creative activities. The partnerships, which will be run by the Arts Council, will focus on bringing together schools, arts and other creative organisations and commercial creative industries to provide enhanced opportunities for every school child in the chosen areas of deprivation. DTLR's Index of Multiple Deprivation, was used in determining these areas. Other measures of economic and educational deprivation and an assessment of cultural deprivation were also taken into account. The Department also considered the capacity of the areas selected to deliver Creative Partnerships, the need for balanced geographical spread and the inclusion of rural and coastal areas as well as urban ones.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.0/5">In addition, many programmes and initiatives run by Lottery distributors are targeted at deprived areas, using the Index of Multiple Deprivation and a variety of other indicators.</p>

	<p pid=".868W.9/1">The Government have been at the forefront of global initiatives to tackle the unsustainable debt burden facing some developing countries, and led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which was agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in September 1999. So far, 23 countries have qualified for this exceptional relief. More than $23 billion of debt relief has been agreed for those countries, which together owe $74 billion, so a major part of their debt has been written off.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.9/2">In December 2000, the Government announced that the UK would go further than is required under the HIPC initiative and would provide 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief to countries when they qualify for HIPC relief. We will hold all debt payments received from HIPC countries in trust and, at that point, will return these payments to them. In addition, the UK has pledged over $300 million to the HIPC trust fund to meet the costs to the multilateral development banks of delivering HIPC debt relief. This includes our share of $85 million in EC contribution. We have also provided $43 million to assist the IMF with their share of such costs.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.9/3">Most of our partner states in the European Union have also made bilateral contributions to the trust fund, on top of their share of the EC contribution. In addition, those member states that are major creditors deliver bilateral debt relief through the Paris Club of Official Bilateral Creditors to countries that have qualified for HIPC relief, with the majority providing 100 per cent. debt relief on their remaining bilateral debts.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.4/1">The Government are very aware of concerns about the operation of the GB gas market in the light of rising gas prices. While we remain convinced that the primary reason behind the increase is arbitrage across the interconnector with high oil related gas prices in the European market, we are aware of the need to consider the impact of the operation of the other parts of the gas chain on the downstream market. Indeed, this forms an integral part of our strategy to address gas prices.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.4/2">The Government have therefore today published a consultation document entitled &quot;A Consultation On Concerns About Gas Prices And Possible Improvements To Market Efficiency&quot;, which considers the various concerns made about the gas market. The document also considers the wider benefits to the gas market of increased information flows between the onshore and the offshore. This builds on a joint workshop with the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association held on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-10">10 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.4/3">The intention behind the document is to stimulate debate and to see if the concerns stand up to scrutiny. If we find any evidence of actual anti-competitive behaviour we shall bring it to the attention of the appropriate competition authority.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.4/4">Copies of the consultation document can be found on the Department of Trade and Industry's website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy">www.dti.gov.uk/energy</a></p>

	<p pid=".874W.8/2">HSE licenses all explosives factories and stores holding more than 7,200 kg of fireworks. Stores holding less than 7,200 kg must either be licensed by the local authority or, depending on the quantity held, registered with it.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.8/3">Where HSE is the licensing authority it considers a range of issues including the nature of the processes, the layout of the site and the construction of the buildings. In particular it will wish to ensure that adequate separation distances are maintained between explosives buildings and other buildings both on and off site. The draft licence is then submitted to the local authority for its assent. HSE will also make an inspection visit before operations start to ensure that the factory or store complies with the licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.8/4">Where the local authority is granting a licence it will normally check on the construction of the store and whether the distance between it and neighbouring inhabited buildings meets the minimum requirements. Registered premises are also subject to legal requirements. However due to the relatively small quantities involved local authorities would not normally undertake checks prior to registration.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.12/1">I have no plans to merge the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO). Both organisations are recently formed and have clear and distinct responsibilities, as set out in the Strategic Defence Review. The role of the DPA is to procure new equipment capability for the armed forces and to deliver this in accordance with agreed parameters for time, cost and performance. The DLO has been established to provide joint logistic support to the armed forces for training and operations, only one element of which is equipment support.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.12/2">Although I am not considering a merger of the two organisations, the Ministry of Defence continues to explore improvements to the way the DPA and DLO work together on the equipment programme. We are also introducing simpler, common processes and systems to improve interoperability. This is being pursued through a joint steering group set up to manage work under a number of approaches, key among which are finance management, human resources management, through-life management, e-business, key supplier management and common tools for integrated project teams.</p>

	<p pid=".876W.17/1">It is not UK policy to comment in detail on targeting issues. Attacks are limited strictly to military objectives, including those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation, in the circumstance ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Every effort is made to avoid incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects when selecting targets for attack.</p>
	<p pid=".876W.17/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>, the total number of targets attacked is somewhat in excess of 100, of which around one half have been attacked more than once.</p>
	<p pid=".876W.17/3">Following an attack on a target, Battle Damage Assessment is conducted to establish the success of that attack. Although we investigate all claims carefully, it is impossible to make a precise assessment of exactly how many civilians may have been killed or injured as a result of coalition action. Painstaking efforts are taken to minimise any unintended injury or damage but, regrettably, on occasion mistakes will happen and where we know this has happened, the coalition has said so publicly. However, we are clear that Taliban reports of civilian casualties are grossly exaggerated.</p>

However, in order to enable her to continue to operate until then, she will require a routine docking period. It had been planned to begin this work in January 2002 at Portsmouth, but due to current operational circumstances it has been decided to postpone the docking period. Instead, some essential maintenance work will be undertaken at her base port, Devonport, when she returns from the Gulf in late November. This will enable Ocean to be made available for operational programming early in 2002 rather than in late spring, which would have been the case had her docking period proceeded as planned.</p>

The Government have said they will complete an assessment of the five tests within two years of the start of this Parliament. Once the assessment has been completed, the Government will make a decision on UK membership of the single currency. If the Government recommend UK entry, it will be put to a vote in Parliament and then to a referendum of the British people.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.8/2">Monitoring quality of care is primarily a matter for primary care trusts (PCTs), although we recognise that commissioning care overseas raises particular issues. To aid them in this task the Department will publish guidance for PCTs on commissioning treatment for National Health Service patients overseas based on the experience of the three test-bed sites which are currently working up plans to send patients to mainland Europe. The Department will also develop through an open tendering process a list of approved providers/intemediaries whom PCTs may approach when considering sending patients overseas. Finally, officials are considering what role the Commission for Health Improvement might play in monitoring standards of foreign providers.</p>
	<p pid=".894W.8/3">Primary care trusts will need to satisfy themselves through paper evidence, through clinicians visiting the relevant providers and through the contractual process that their patients will receive good clinical care. Although this process should be rigorous, it need not take many weeks. Our aim is that, if possible, the first patients travel to receive treatment in mainland Europe before the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".899W.2/1">The recommendations of the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team (12) report on Young People centred around four themes; improving the way Government develop and implement policy and services for children and young people; a new focus on preventive services; improving individual services for children and young people; and designing policies around their needs, especially through involving children and young people in thinking about policies and services. Substantial progress has been made in all these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.2/2">To improve the way the Government develop policy the Prime Minister has established a new cabinet committee on children and young people's services, created the interdepartmental ministerial post of Minister for Young People and established the interdepartmental Children and Young People's Unit to be responsible for this work.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.2/3">A new focus on preventive services and action to address the social exclusion of children and young people has been provided by the new Children's Fund. The Fund is worth &pound;450 million over 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04, of which &pound;380 million is devoted to the development of preventive services by partnerships throughout England and &pound;70 million is devoted to the Children's Fund Local Network making grants to voluntary organisations working on projects to tackle child poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".899W.2/4">Improving individual services for children and young people was a key theme of the Spending Review 2000, in particular through the introduction of the Connexions service for 13&ndash;19 year olds. The first Connexions Partnerships began to deliver services from April this year. &pound;420 million is being invested in Connexions in 2002&ndash;03, rising to &pound;455 million in 2003&ndash;04. To ensure that national health service provision is designed around children we have announced the establishment of a new NHS National Service Framework. Targeted programmes to support children and young people's individual education needs were set out in the White Paper, &quot;Schools&mdash;achieving success&quot; (Cmd 5230). This progress will be further promoted through the cross-cutting review on children at risk announced by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in response to a written question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1035" name="Jackie Lawrence">my hon.

The range and type of proposals that a School Organisation Committee may itself consider in relation to school organisation will be unaffected. Nor does the proposal affect the range of decisions that a SOC may make, except where a proposal it is considering clashes with one which the LSC has submitted to the Secretary of State, in which case consideration by the SOC would be delayed until a decision is made on the LSC proposal.</p>

	<p pid=".900W.5/1">The most recent assessment made by my Department was in the Student Income and Expenditure Survey 1998&ndash;99, published in December 2000, which was the fourth survey since the series began in 1988&ndash;89. This showed that average spending on essential items such as food and accommodation had not risen in real terms since 1995&ndash;96 but average spending on clothes and discretionary items such as entertainment had gone up sharply. Student income from all sources had risen since 1995&ndash;96 by 12 per cent. in real terms, with greater commercial borrowings, earnings from employment and withdrawal from savings. Since 1998&ndash;99 the value of the student loan has continued to be increased annually in line with inflation.</p>

Northamptonshire has also been invited to develop a smaller scale Sure Start programme as part of the &pound;22 million wave of programmes announced in July 2001, aimed at rural areas and small pockets of deprivation. Local stakeholders also decided to locate this programme outside of the Northampton, South constituency.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.7/1">My Department has been in close contact with members and officials at the London borough of Hackney over the last 12 months and prior to that on occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.7/2">The council has well chronicled financial and governance problems that have contributed to failures in the delivery of key services. Following an inspection of the whole authority, the Audit Commission advised me in July of this year that the council was not complying with its statutory Best Value responsibilities. It recommended the use of intervention powers under Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.7/3">We consulted the council about the form of the Directions, as required by the statute. Their response was constructive and they have accepted the urgent need to improve their performance.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.7/4">On <phrase class="date" code="">12 October</phrase>, I gave Hackney five Directions under these provisions. The Directions require the council to produce a strategy for bringing its budget back into balance; and to improve services such as financial management, education, social services, benefit administration and waste management.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.7/5">The purpose of the Directions is to restore financial accountability and control within the authority, and to protect and improve front-line services. The Directions set a clear timetable for improvements to be made and we expect the council to achieve these with tailored financial and other support. I have placed copies of the Directions in the Library of the House.</p>

He made it clear that our support for land reform depended on action by the Government of Zimbabwe to implement the commitments it made in Abuja. We have so far seen little evidence of such implementation. We understand that UNDP have an assessment mission in Zimbabwe at the moment looking at the prospects for a credible land reform programme. We welcome this. But in the circumstances, it is too soon to speculate on a possible UK financial contribution and the possible arrangements for payment.</p>

The Agency will be undertaking a study of the flooding from the River Blackwater in the Bocking area of Braintree. Within Essex the Agency is currently undertaking a flood defence scheme at Chadwell Cross in Tilbury and works on two sections of the River Crouch near Battlebridge and at Hullbridge.

	<p pid=".912W.9/1">DEFRA has policy responsibility for flood and coastal defences in England, and the National Assembly for Wales has similar responsibilities for Wales. I plan to reduce the risk of flooding by investing in effective flood warning arrangements and in flood defences in the highest risk areas. Funding for the Department's programme is increasing from &pound;66 million in 2000&ndash;01 to &pound;114 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.9/2">This Department provides funding to the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards for capital flood and coastal defence works that meet certain criteria. DEFRA encourages authorities to take a strategic approach to flood and coastal defences and to draw up shoreline management plans. These consider natural processes; planning pressures; current and future land use; flood and coastal defence needs; and environmental needs. The Shoreline Management Plan covering Bridgwater Bay to Bideford Bay was produced for a consortium of the EA and local authorities, each of whom have coastal defence responsibilities. It considered a range of options and identified one for each management unit along the coast from Brean Down, Somerset to Hartland Point in Devon. I understand that managed retreat was the preferred strategic option for the shingle ridge at Porlock. For the lengths between Stolford and Fanning Island, and along the west bank of the River Parrett to Combwich, an observe and monitor strategy was proposed, while consideration is given to managed retreat on undeveloped frontages to promote saltmarsh growth for nature conservation and coastal defence purposes.</p>

	<p pid=".914W.6/3">No formal assessment of the benefits has been made on a national scale since these depend on the local intensity of rainfall for which individual sustainable drainage systems are designed. Such systems can assist in reducing the impact of intense rainfall and they can be as economical as conventional drainage systems. The use of sustainable urban drainage systems is generally encouraged in the new Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 issued in July 2001 but decisions by developers to install them must be based on site-specific assessments of the loads they would need to deal with.</p>

A byelaw is a local law, which is made by a statutory body, such as a local authority, under an enabling power established by Act of Parliament. Byelaws create criminal offences and cannot come into effect unless they have been confirmed by a Secretary of State. There are no plans to change this policy.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.2/1">The recently adopted Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/EC sets minimum standards for a variety of plants that burn waste, including municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs). The UK Government are committed to transposing the EU Waste Incineration Directive, into UK law by <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-28">28 December 2002</phrase>. Its provisions will apply to all new incinerators by this date, and to existing plant by <phrase class="date" code="">28 December 2005</phrase>. This directive tightens dioxin limits to 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup> (0.1 billionth of a gram). This standard will be the maximum amount of dioxin permitted to be emitted from MSWIs.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.2/2">There is no dioxin limit in the Municipal Waste Incineration Directives (89/429/EEC and 89/369/EEC). In 1996 the Environment Agency chose to implement a 1.0 ng/m <sup>3</sup> emission limit as achievable using the best available technique not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC). In 2000 the Agency took a similar decision on BATNEEC and MSWIs were required to either (i) reduce dioxin limits to 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup> (that is 10 times lower than the earlier limit); or (ii) on plant which could immediately achieve that level, to report on how they would achieve it. As a result, we estimate that dioxin emissions from incinerators in the UK have fallen several hundred-fold.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.5/1">There is currently only very limited information available on the distribution in the national flock of the 15 known genotypes that determine levels of susceptibility and resistance to scrapie. It is not therefore possible at this stage to produce reliable estimates. However, the limited data available suggest that about one quarter of the breeding ram population may be resistant to scrapie, and about two thirds of the slaughter population may be at least semi-resistant. There will be significant variation between different sheep breeds. It should be possible to produce more reliable estimates as an increasing number of breeding sheep come to be genotyped under the national scrapie plan.</p>
