However, tackling the record budget deficit and achieving sustainable, balanced, private-sector-led economic growth are the Government's priorities for the duration of this Parliament. Tackling the deficit is unavoidable and while there will have to be cuts in order to restore health to the public finances, the forthcoming spending review will be a crucial stepping stone on the way to recovery.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.2/1">The Academy Model Articles of Association provide for a structure which would allow those who are setting up the academy trust (for example the existing governing body of a converting Catholic school) to decide who should be the members of the academy trust. The members are in turn responsible for deciding who should appoint, and who should be, the governors of the academy trust. Where the school has an existing foundation-for example in the case of voluntary aided faith schools-we would expect that foundation to be the lead member of the new academy trust which could then appoint a majority of the governors. There is no impediment to the members of the academy trust agreeing that a majority of foundation governors be appointed by a religious trusteeship.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.2/2">Similarly, section 124A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 allows academies with a religious character to take faith into account in the appointment of its-teachers, including the posts of head teacher, deputy head teacher and head of religious education. This means that an academy designated as a Catholic school would have equivalent freedoms in this area to a voluntary aided school in the maintained sector.</p>

For particulate matter (PM10), EU limits are already met with the exception of very few areas in London. The Government have been working with the Mayor of London, and in May this year, submitted evidence to the European Commission showing that full compliance with the PM10 limits in London is expected by the extended deadline of 2011 as set out in the EU ambient air quality directive (2008/50/EC).</p>

We plan to use the provisions in the ambient air quality directive to secure the additional time available (up to 2015) to meet the NO2 limit values. DEFRA is currently in discussions with the Mayor of London, local authorities and other Government Departments, to determine what can be done to achieve the NO2 limit values as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.29W.2/1">Options for managing flood risk are considered on a case by case basis by the responsible operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards). The cost will vary from place to place depending on local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.29W.2/2">DEFRA's guidance is that all technically feasible options should be considered and appraised in an open, transparent and comparable way to establish which is the most cost-effective and appropriate.

	<p pid="b.32W.2/1">'Dickeya solani' is a bacterium (not yet officially named) of the Dickeya genus which affects potatoes. It is already present in Europe and is spreading on seed potatoes of Dutch origin. In consultation with industry representatives, it has been confirmed that quarantine status (i.e. exclusion and control through the EU Plant Health Directive (2000/29/EC)) would not be appropriate for 'D.solani' due to its distribution in the EU. It is controlled; like every blackleg (bacterial disease of potatoes), through visual inspections during seed potato classification. Laboratory analysis is necessary to differentiate the 'D. solani' strain from other blackleg causing strains (Pectobactehum atrosepticum and Dickeya dianthicola). The Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS) includes tolerances for blackleg, including 'D. solani' where these are exceeded the crop involved is downgraded or failed.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.2/2">In 2009 there were 16 positive cases of 'D.solani' in England and Wales from seed and ware potato crop samples submitted to the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) by growers or Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSI), who operate the SPCS in England and Wales. The origin of the seed stocks involved was the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.2/3">A survey of seed potato crops conducted by Fera during seed potato classification in 2010 has shown that there were 18 (7%) cases of 'D.solani' in England and Wales from 256 seed potato crops showing symptoms of blackleg. In 15 of the 18 cases the seed potatoes-involved originated from the Netherlands. In the other three cases the seed potatoes had been multiplied in England, but the original source of the seed was not traced. Other blackleg causing organisms were responsible for the remaining 238 (93%) of cases in seed potatoes from UK and overseas sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.2/4">There were also 24 cases, of 'D. solani' in samples of seed and ware potatoes submitted to Fera by growers or Fera PHSI. The origin of the seed stocks in these cases, where disclosed, was the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.2/5">In addition to the visual inspections already undertaken in the SPCS for blackleg and the specific survey for 'D. solani' referred to above, Fera is collaborating with the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Crop Research Institute to conduct research on 'D. solani'. This includes a newly proposed three year project funded by the Potato Council and Scottish Executive which incorporates a survey of seed potato crops in England and Wales to further explore the distribution of 'D. solani' within the SPCS.

	<p pid="b.34W.8/1">In its August analysis of the June Budget the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) sought to include some previously un-modelled reforms. In order to do this, it made some strong assumptions, for example around disability living allowance, housing benefit, and in-year tax credit changes. It is therefore necessary to treat the results of their modelling with appropriate caution, given that the choice of assumptions will have a clear impact on the conclusions reached. The model also omits a number of key policy measures that are difficult to assign to households, but which are likely to impact on incomes and/or employment-for instance, changes to corporation tax and capital gains tax. For these reasons we cannot treat the IFS results as definitive.</p>

	<p pid="b.36W.8/2">Since Connaught entered administration large parts of their business have already been bought out by other contractors; Morgan Sindall (who have taken over the majority of the social housing arm) and Centrica (who have bought the electric and gas compliance part of the business). This has safeguarded the majority of jobs at risk following Connaught's collapse.</p>

	<p pid="b.39W.9/1">The Youth Citizenship Commission report was commissioned by the previous Administration. New Ministers are currently considering developing proposals for the future of youth services and on new approaches to giving young people a voice and strengthening youth scrutiny over national and local policy. Officials from my Department, with colleagues from the Department for Education, are working to assess the impact of current approaches to youth empowerment and democratic engagement and are drawing on the mechanisms and experience of youth organisations to involve young people directly in this work. Both Departments are also working with the Office for Civil Society to support the National Citizen Service (NCS) programme. Young people were involved in the work that led to the creation of NCS, and their direct contribution to its continuing development is an essential part of future plans for the programme.</p>

Charity relief provides an 80% discount on business rates bills which may be topped up to 100% by the relevant local authority. Not-for-profit relief is payable at the discretion of the relevant local authority and provides up to 100% relief. Decisions on whether a particular social enterprise satisfies the relevant eligibility criteria are a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

Ministers, MPs and officials provide opportunities for young people to shadow them and learn more about politics. Local government also provides opportunities, including youth councils who work with all levels of local government and give young people a voice in their local area. The British Youth Council reports that there are currently over 620 youth councils active across the UK. Other opportunities for young people to participate in politics include the UK Youth Parliament (UKYP) elections, the UKYP debate in the House of Commons and departmental advisory groups. We will continue to encourage these activities where we can.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.0/1">Following the extension of the statutory minimum bus concession in April 2008, to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England to eligible older and disabled people, the Department for Transport has provided special grant funding to local authorities of &#163;212 million in 2008-09, &#163;217 million in 2009-10 and &#163;223 million in 2010-11. This is in addition to the funding that the Department for Communities and Local Government provides each year for concessionary travel through the formula grant process. Local authorities spent &#163;1.025 billion on concessionary travel (including their own discretionary enhancements) in 2008-09. Figures for 2009-10 have not yet been published.</p>

These figures also represent the total for Great Britain (as the agency does not hold such information by individual region) and to perform such an exercise would incur disproportionate costs. The increased forecast costs are due to: leasing contracts due for renewal at increased costs, introduction of new tasks, business adviser trainers numbers reduced resulting in more travelling to cover a wider geographical area, setting up of new Central Processing Unit resulting in initial additional travel costs regarding training etc. Additionally the Central Processing Unit (set up in March 2010) will result in increased travel costs of senior managers covering Swansea and Manchester Central Processing Units. The departments Corporate Assurance Services will be carrying out significantly increased numbers of External Data User Visits to ensure security. The forecast also includes leases for vehicles to replace trucks that were owned. This cost is new to 2010-11.  5. Relates to (a) purchase, (b) leasing, (c) service, maintenance and repair and (d) fuel. The table represents the expenditure for the GCDA fleet which is located in London. Included in these figures are 16 vehicles that operate out of Cardiff and Bradford, these are rotated among the fleet to level out mileage. The cost relating to these could be separated out only at a disproportionate cost.&quot;  6. Relates to expenditure on the Traffic Officer Vehicles and Winter Maintenance Fleet (except 2007-08 which relates to Traffic Officer Fleet only). The Traffic Officer Vehicle figures do not include fuel and consumables. Traffic Officer Vehicles are provided on a lease basis and the Highways Agency is charged a combined monthly fee that includes lease and maintenance. The Highways Agency is forecasting to spend &#163;12.5 million on the purchase of new winter service vehicles this financial year, with &#163;5 million spent to date, over the period April to June 2010. The vehicle supply contract for the new winter fleet was not awarded until January 2008 and as such, costs were not incurred under the contract until later in 2008-09 being year 1 of the supply contract. Before this Highways Agency used the old fleet which was purchased a number of years previously.  7. Relates to (a) purchase, (b) maintenance and (c) fuel in England. Further regional breakdown is available only at disproportionate cost.  8. Figures calculated include: fuel service maintenance and repair insurance premium-we have commercial fully comprehensive insurance GCDA fleet management fees capital purchases, including conversion work all vehicles have been included, e.g. Powers to Stop (PtS), High Risk Traffic Initiative (HRTI) PtS, Roadside Check vans (mobile office) pool cars<br/> 2007-08-fuel cost has been calculated pro rata using five months recorded data due to a change in how the data were captured. To calculate actuals would incur disproportionate costs. 2008-09 and 2009-10 had major capital investment for HRTI project and replacement Roadside Check vans.  9.

	<p pid="b.52W.2/20">A reported drink drive accident is defined as being a collision on a public road reported to police in which someone is killed or injured and where one or more of the motor vehicle drivers or riders involved either refused to give a breath test specimen when requested to do so by the police (other than when incapable of doing so for medical reasons), or one of the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.2/21" class="indent">(i) failed a roadside breath test by registering over 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 ml of breath</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.2/22" class="indent">(ii) died and was subsequently found to have more than 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.2/23">Alcohol was not necessarily a causal factor in all of these accidents and there may have been fatalities in other accidents in which alcohol was a causal factor but no drivers/riders involved exceeded the legal drink drive limit. Estimates for drink drive casualties by age group in 2009 will be available in summer 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.2/24">The previous Government commissioned Sir Peter North to head an independent review of measures available to combat drink and drug driving. Sir Peter's report covers a wide range of issues and makes 51 detailed recommendations, which we are considering carefully with other Government Departments. We hope to publish a response to the report at the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.56W.2/1">The Department for Transport recognises the importance of travel advice and information to enable disabled people to plan their journeys on public transport confidently and independently.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.2/2">We are currently working to improve the accessibility information available to the public through the Transport Direct journey planner, to enable disabled people and people of reduced mobility to plan their journeys during the Olympic Games. This should have an ongoing legacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.2/3">On buses, audio visual equipment is a useful addition to bus services and is especially useful to those with visual impairments. The Department has commissioned a project to research the costs and benefits of audio visuals on buses, and consider ways of increasing uptake of these systems. The project is due to report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.2/4">On rail, the Department has been working closely with the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) to improve the information available to disabled passengers via the National Rail Enquiry Service (NRES). During 2008-10, &#163;500,000 was contributed to a programme of access audits for every station in the country and a detailed new station journey planner, 'Stations Made Easy', which is available on the NRES website.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.2/5">Since then, the Department has continued to work with ATOC on plans to improve the Assisted Passenger Reservation Service, which disabled people can use to enquire about facilities and book journey assistance. A further &#163;250,000 has been offered to support this project which is currently in progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.56W.2/6">For those who are not confident using public transport, the Department will champion increased levels of travel training by local authorities, produce a website of good practice by the end of 2010, and use the Olympic Games to raise the profile of these schemes.</p>

The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 came into force in 2000 and apply to any public service vehicle with a capacity exceeding 22 passengers used to provide a local or scheduled service in Britain. The requirements include making provision for a wheelchair space as well as fitting features on the bus to assist disabled people.

In addition to the existing legislation covering the provision of information (primarily the Railways Act of 1993 and the Local Government Act of 2000) the Government's Transparency Agenda promotes the freeing up of public information to the developer community to facilitate the creation of new, innovative information services.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.2/2">The Department has already released over 120 datasets on data.gov.uk, including NaPTAN (all public transport access points) and NPTDR (an annual snapshot of public transport services) and we will work with colleagues in local government and the transport industry to make more data available over the next 12 months.

	<p pid="b.62W.2/1">The Asthma Deaths Audit is a year-long audit of asthma deaths in England, which is due to commence in 2011. The primary intention is to understand the circumstances surrounding asthma deaths in order that any avoidable factors are identified and ways to avoid such factors are understood and addressed by those designing and providing services for people with asthma in future. These 'lessons' will be communicated to the respiratory community so that practice can change accordingly, and used to inform future policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.2/2">This study will be undertaken in the tradition of 'confidential inquiries' which have enabled the examination of the circumstances surrounding deaths to be explored in order that changes can be made to future care. In this study, it will not only be the medical care the patient received that will be investigated, but also factors such as awareness in schools and the workplace-where appropriate, environmental conditions prevailing at the time of death, the patient's understanding of their condition and ability to self-manage, and the views of the close family of the person who has died. All these perspectives will help us to understand the circumstances surrounding the deaths, and enable the learning to feed into future policy and services for people with asthma.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.2/3">We are in discussions with the devolved administrations about whether they would like to be involved in the Asthma Deaths Audit and are actively exploring the possibility of making the audit cover the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.63W.5/1">We want to improve survival outcomes for all cancer patients, including children. It is now generally agreed that the most important reasons for lower survival rates in England compared with other European countries are low public awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, delays in people presenting to their doctors, and patients having more advanced disease at diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.5/2">We have asked National Cancer Director, Professor Sir Mike Richards, to lead a review of the 'Cancer Reform Strategy' (CRS). The review will align the cancer strategy with the White Paper, 'Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS' which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>; set the direction for the next five years, taking account of progress since the CRS was published in December 2007; and show how outcomes can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.5/3">Key areas for consideration will be how to increase public awareness of signs and symptoms of cancer to ensure that people are more likely to go to their general practitioner if they experience persistent symptoms, and how we can support primary health care professionals to diagnose cancer earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.63W.5/4">The review will consult and utilise the experience of various CRS initiatives, existing advisory groups, cancer charities, industry and professional groups. The Children and Young People's cancer advisory group, co-chaired by both Mike Richards (National Cancer Director) and Sheila Shribman (National Clinical Director for Children, Young People and Maternity Services), will be contributing to the review. We aim to publish an updated strategy in the winter.</p>

However, most orthodontists work as independent contractors in primary care settings. In addition, some general dental practitioners also undertake simple orthodontic treatments. Information on the number of independent contractors is not held centrally but relevant information is contained in the &quot;Report of the Orthodontic Workforce Survey of the United Kingdom February 2005&quot;, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.79W.3/1">The White Paper Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS and subsequent engagement document Liberating the NHS: Commissioning for Patients set out our intention to devolve power and responsibility for commissioning services to local consortia of general practitioner (GP) practices. To support GP consortia in their commissioning decisions, we will also create an independent NHS Commissioning Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.79W.3/2">Under our proposed model, GP practices will jointly form consortia to commission the vast majority of health care required for their local population. However, GP practices will remain independent contractors and therefore able to choose who they work with locally in providing primary medical care to their registered population. Nevertheless, we believe, most practices will see the benefits from working closely within their local community to both commission and provide the best care and appropriate services for the people they serve. That is why practices will have flexibility within the new legislative framework to form commissioning consortia in ways they think will secure the best healthcare and health outcomes for their patients and locality.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.6/1">The Government are developing a new strategy for mental health and well-being in England that is based on an alliance of government departments, local government, the independent sector, professions, communities and individuals. It will address services, outcomes from services and wider public health issues. The strategy will support the aims of Equity and excellence: liberating the NHS and forthcoming policy on public health and social care. It will also recognise the needs of people with mental health problems as a whole, specifically the links between mental and physical health and the role of social services.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.6/2">Rather than stipulating how services should be delivered at local level, our focus will be on making services patient-led, based on the best clinical evidence, responsive both to patients' choice, and their wish to manage their own care.

	<p pid="b.81W.6/3">Our confirmation of the final &#163;70 million instalment of growth funding from the current spending round for the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme is enabling primary care trusts to broaden the geographical coverage of services, meaning more people can get help, and to increase the range of therapies available, giving people more choice and access to the right psychological support.</p>
	<p pid="b.81W.6/4">Mental health matters for all of us, and we know that mental well-being is linked to physical ,health outcomes, and people's life expectancy, productivity, educational achievement and to potential reductions in violence and crime. The Government will set out its programme for public health in a White Paper on public health later this year, closely co-ordinated with the strategy on mental health. The forthcoming Health Bill will support the creation of a new Public Health Service (PHS), to integrate and streamline existing health improvement and protection bodies and functions. The PHS will aim to secure improvements in the health of the population as a whole, including, of course, the health of people with mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.87W.14/1">In November 2009, the Department and the then Department for Children Schools and Families published &quot;Teenage Pregnancy and Sexual Health Marketing Strategy&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. The document sets the evidence from risk factors and a number of research studies to identify the groups most at risk of teenage pregnancy and poor sexual health.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.14/2">The Department has also commissioned the Central Office for Information to carry out a review of the existing evidence on the factors that positively or negatively affect sexual health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outcomes in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Department made a funding contribution in 2008-09 to the 2010 National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles. This is the third decade in a row that such a study has been completed across the UK and includes 15,000 men and women aged 16-74. The work outlined will help to inform and evaluate interventions designed to improve sexual health status of all people regardless of their age or sexual orientation.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.14/3">The Health Protection Agency undertakes surveillance of and supports research in the acquisition of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the results of which contribute to the development of policies for HIV and STI prevention. In many of these projects, young people are part of a wider study population. Study data are usually presented stratified by age and sexual orientation. These data have highlighted the high burden of infection, the risk of re-infection subsequent to being diagnosed with an STI and the degree of high risk sexual behaviour among young people.</p>

This includes periods when they are exercising and training, but excludes the short time spent completing basic sea safety training and carrying out post refit trials. The tasks may include the integrity of UK waters, the defence and security of overseas territories, intelligence collection, defence diplomacy and support to British interests. They contribute to the standing commitments of the NATO reaction forces and provide platforms for wider maritime security operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what assistance his Department is providing to those resident in Coventry who have been made redundant in the last 12 months. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/4" class="indent">The Rapid Response Service (RRS) is the starting point for all support for residents in Coventry, who have been made redundant. Jobcentre Plus works with partners to deliver the RRS while employees are under notice of redundancy with the aim of helping as many as possible back into work quickly. The service is offered automatically to all employers declaring at least 20 redundancies (i.e. all those covered by the statutory requirement to provide advance notice to the Insolvency Service). The service is also offered when Jobcentre Plus is aware of employers declaring less than 20 redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/5" class="indent">Individual employees are offered a comprehensive package of practical support in coping with redundancy, claiming benefits, applying for jobs and updating their skills or gaining new skills based on the needs of the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus works closely with the Better West Midlands Project, contracted to the Skills Funding Agency to deliver RRS support for individual employees under notice of redundancy. Other partners are: Coventry City Council, Business Link, National Apprenticeship Service, Consumer Financial Education Body and Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire Partnership offering the Next Step careers advice service to individuals. All customers are able to continue accessing these partners' services after redundancy if they are unable to move into a new job immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/7" class="indent">Individual customers who have been made redundant are also able to take advantage of the Response to Redundancy Programme, delivered by JHP Training on behalf of the Skills Funding Agency. JHP Training delivers a range of training opportunities to any unemployed people aged over 18 who are seeking work during the first six months of unemployment. A package of support, typically between 2 and 8 weeks, helps people refresh their existing skills or begin the work of retraining in a different occupation to aid their progression into sustainable employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/8" class="indent">The Secretary of State has also asked me to reply to your further questions asking what assistance his Department is providing to those resident in Coventry and in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance, including those in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for more than 12 months, to secure employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/9" class="indent">All customers can use jobpoint screens in Jobcentres or the Jobseeker Direct telephony service to search for suitable job vacancies as well as accessing them via the internet if they prefer.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/10" class="indent">Residents of Coventry in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) receive personalised help through the Jobseeker's Regime and Flexible New Deal. Jobcentre Personal Advisers are at the forefront of supporting customers with their employment and skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/11" class="indent">The Jobseeker's Regime and Flexible New Deal is a combination of regular reviews of a customer's job seeking activity, group information sessions, Personal Adviser interviews at key stages and work focused training. Through this, we provide customers with information and access to jobs, personalised job search advice, opportunities to develop the skills needed to help them improve job prospects and other help to overcome barriers that may be making it harder to find work. The level of support we give increases the longer a customer is out of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/12" class="indent">Newly unemployed JSA customers from professional and executive occupational backgrounds who require help because they have no recent job search experience can attend information sessions delivered by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. These sessions help jobseekers to acquire the knowledge, skills and confidence to quickly find relevant jobs, using up to date job search tools and recruitment channels.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/13" class="indent">Jobseekers who remain on JSA for more than 12 months enter Flexible New Deal which is a programme of tailored, individualised support for each customer delivered by a contracted external provider. Flexible New Deal providers are tasked with providing an innovative and flexible service to deliver the best method of getting jobseekers into sustainable employment. Our contracted providers in Coventry are Serco and Pertemps People Development Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/14" class="indent">Jobseekers in Coventry who need additional advice about the local labour market and the skills required can access individual careers advice from Next Steps advisers who are located in Jobcentre offices as well as other locations in the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/15" class="indent">The Government have set out a number of major welfare to work reforms, including a core Work Programme which we aim to introduce by summer 2011. It will be an integrated package of personalised support providing help for people who find themselves out of work. The Work Programme will be delivered by contractors drawn from the private, public and voluntary sectors.</p>

The forecast spend in 2011-12 is subject to spending review decisions. This is because the FJF payment model allows for 60% of the unit cost of an FJF job to be paid over the six-month period following a job start.

	<p pid="b.114W.2/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) currently have the governmental lead on fuel poverty. Their main grant-funded programme is the Warm Front scheme, which can provide a package of tailored insulation and heating improvements and energy advice for private sector households across England. The scheme is aimed at vulnerable, fuel-poor households, some of whom may be terminally ill. Eligibility is determined by receipt of certain means-tested and disability benefits, including disability living allowance (DLA). The number of disabled people receiving Warm Front assistance has increased since 2005-typically, approximately 38% of all those receiving help are in receipt of either DLA or attendance allowance (AA).</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/2">DLA and AA provide people who have severe disabilities with a contribution towards the extra costs they face because of the effects of their disabilities. People who are terminally ill automatically qualify for the highest rate care component of DLA (they do not have to serve the three-month qualifying period and the benefit is usually paid within 10 days from receipt of claim) or the higher rate of AA. Recipients of DLA or AA have the choice to spend their benefit according to their own priorities, and in a way that best suits their circumstances, including meeting the cost of household fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/3">Terminally ill people may also receive support through employment and support allowance (ESA). While ESA for the most part uses functional descriptors to assess someone's eligibility for the benefit, there are some non-functional descriptors that would find someone eligible-terminal illness is one of these non-functional descriptors. If someone claims ESA under 'special rules', which apply to those who have a life expectancy of no more than six months, they will be fast-tracked to the ESA Support Group and receive the highest rate of benefit. This will be done on paper-based evidence alone without the claimant having to undergo a face-to-face medical assessment or serve any of the normal assessment phase of ESA.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.2/4">Additional help is available to people receiving any of the income-related benefits through the disability premia included in these benefits. Cold weather payments are also available to help certain vulnerable people-including those receiving the main phase of income-related ESA or disability premia in the income-related benefits-with the extra heating costs which result from very cold weather in their area.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.8/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has not received any recent reports referring specifically to the effects of health worker shortages on rates of TB, AIDS and Malaria. However, there is a clear body of evidence that the global shortage of health workers, amounting to as many as 3.5 million, affects the poorest countries most. The high rates of AIDS, TB and Malaria in many less developed countries will be controlled only through a comprehensive approach to health service delivery that addresses health worker numbers, skills and deployment, essential drugs and commodities and early prevention, accurate diagnosis and quality treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.8/2">DFID is currently developing plans to accelerate its support to malaria control and to reproductive, maternal and newborn health. Health workers are an important dimension in addressing these priorities, and it should be noted that AIDS, TB and malaria cause a large proportion of maternal mortality. These business plans will be released in early 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.11/1">Recent research shows that a vaginal microbicide containing 1% tenofovir reduced HIV infection by 39%. These early results are encouraging but the optimism should be tempered with caution. There is some uncertainty about the exact nature of the follow-up research required to confirm these findings and funding agencies are in discussion with researchers and regulatory agencies. Once there is greater clarity and consensus about the way forward the Department for International Development (DFID) will be able to consider whether additional funding is required. In the meantime DFID continues to fund the Microbicide Development Programme and the International Partnership for Microbicides.</p>

	<p pid="b.137W.11/1">The Ministry of Justice accounting systems do not centrally collate the amount of money reimbursed to staff for expenses. Expenditure on staff expenses is recorded according to the type of expenditure incurred not the mechanism of payment. Expenditure on travel and subsistence can be incurred by direct booking with the Department's designated suppliers, via Government Procurement Card or by reimbursement of expenses incurred personally by officials.

	<p pid="b.137W.11/5" class="indent">ensure that their rules provide for claiming recompense, including verification and authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.137W.11/6">All expenditure on expenses is made in accordance with published departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety that are based on the principles set out in Government Accounting and supported by the Department's published internal guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.137W.11/7">During the course of 2010-11, the MoJ is rolling out an online expenses system (iExpenses) that will make claiming expenses more efficient and easier to monitor in future. Full information will be available from 2011-12.</p>

If the damage exceeds &#163;5,000 and the case is tried in the magistrates court the maximum penalty is six months' imprisonment. If tried on indictment the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment, and 14 years if the offence is racially or religiously motivated.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.5/3">This is an emotive issue and we fully understand why many people think the existing sentencing framework does not reflect the seriousness of the crime. But judges and magistrates can-and do-have regard to the special status of war memorials when sentencing an offender for criminal damage. That special status may aggravate any sentence imposed, within the constraints of the maximum penalties agreed by Parliament for this type of offence.</p>

This support is provided by Jobcentre Plus, skills bodies, development agencies and local authorities. The administrator is liaising directly with the Jobcentre Plus national account manager who is co-ordinating the assistance through to local levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.167W.2/1">Some of BBSRC's public engagement activities since 1997 have included consideration of GM technologies, some of which <i> (a)</i> explicitly invited public views while others <i> (b</i>) were focused more on communication and raising awareness.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/2"><i> (a</i>) BBSRC's public engagement activities which have included consideration of GM technologies and explicitly invited public views:</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/3" class="indent">A co-sponsor of 'Future foods' exhibit at the Science Museum from November 1997 to March 1998</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/4" class="indent">Interactive exhibition launched at the 1998 Royal show on GM that provided a focus for people to consider the issues and record their opinions</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/5" class="indent">A display at the 1999 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition that invited discussion on GM crops and their uses</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/6" class="indent">Public consultation (with NERC) on gene flow in plants and micro-organisms in 2000</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/7" class="indent">In 2000 BBSRC commissioned a short study of attitudes to GM bioremediation that made use of a novel tool, the Ethical Matrix.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/8" class="indent">In 2001 BBSRC hosted a web-based tool that explored hypothetical novel foods as part of a Foresight Food Chain and Crops Industry Panel initiative</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/9" class="indent">In 2003 BBSRC held a consultation on the future direction of crop science research</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/10" class="indent">The recent synthetic biology dialogue, published in June 2010 covered public views on agri-environmental science as one part of a workshop that explore views around science and technology generically. A later workshop with in the synthetic biology dialogue explored food and crop applications of synthetic biology.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/11"><i> (b)</i> BBSRC's public engagement activities which have included consideration of GM technologies and were focused more on communication and raising awareness:</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/12" class="indent">In 1999 BBSRC published two discussion documents on issues surrounding the use of GM in agriculture</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/13" class="indent">In 1999 BBSRC supported an BA and Royal Society of Edinburgh forum that debated GM foods</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/14" class="indent">In 2001 BBSRC supported a public evening meeting that accompanied the EUCARPIA XVI congress in Edinburgh, the meeting covered issues surrounding plant biotechnology</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/15" class="indent">A panel discussion on future renewable bio-energy, including artificial photosynthesis in 2007</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/16">BBSRC has also supported its funded researchers through a small grants scheme to engage with the public, some of these grants have been used to discuss issues around GM, for instance: a 1998 discussion meeting on GM with the National Federation of Women's Institutes; a 2003 series of schools debates on 'genetic futures'; and a 2005 public discussion in Plymouth on GM.</p>
	<p pid="b.167W.2/17">None of these Research Councils have funded a separate research project specifically into public attitudes on GM since 1997. However, under the previous Government, the Food Standards Agency was asked by Ministers to carry out a public dialogue project looking at Food - the use of GM. Government have recently announced that this dialogue will not continue in its current format. The details of the Government's policy on the use of GM technology in food and agriculture are still being determined, but all policies will be based on robust evidence. Developing effective and appropriate public engagement will need to be an element of this.</p>

	<p pid="b.169W.2/1">This Department sponsors the Technology Strategy Board, which operates across all important sectors of the UK economy, ranging from the creative industries to high value manufacturing, but focusing on those opportunities which offer the greatest scope for boosting UK growth and productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/2">The Technology Strategy Board provides funding opportunities (with support from other Government funders) to enable UK-based business and research communities to work together on collaborative R&amp;D projects from which successful new products, processes and services can emerge.

Businesses receiving funding must comply with strict rules on manufacture of products. The company shall not, without prior written consent, manufacture or permit the manufacture of articles incorporating the results of work done with the aid of this grant outside the European economic area for a period starting from the date of the offer letter and ending five years after the date on which final payment is made.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/4">This Department is also considering the recommendations from Sir James Dyson's Report &quot;Ingenious Britain&quot; and will consult with business this autumn. This will include a review of the taxation of intellectual property and the support that R&amp;D tax credits provide for innovation. This Department is similarly considering options for the future delivery of its 'Solutions for Business' portfolio of business support within the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/5">Also, UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) does much to help businesses invest and locate in the UK and grow internationally. They do this through impartial advice-information related to funding, financing, staffing and operations; introductions to professional advisers and key contacts; access, through its partnership programmes, to a range of possible business partners and professional service organisations; practical help on the ground, including visits to suitable locations, finding business partners and accessing financial incentives; as well as an aftercare service, including advice on maximising investment in the UK, through domestic and international expansion.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.0/1">Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) and other local partnerships have played a strong role in preventing crime and we want them to continue to do so. In order to free local partners from central bureaucracy we are considering whether we can repeal some of the more prescriptive elements of CSP regulations. In addition, the new Police and Crime Commissioners will be enabled to play a considerable role in relation to community safety, and the Government are currently consulting publicly on how Commissioners can best work with criminal justice and community safety partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.0/2">We have recently considered the available international evidence of the effectiveness of partnership working in a crime and disorder context and concluded that it supports the general principle that collaborative working between partners is more effective in reducing and preventing crime than agencies working alone; there is also some evidence that working in partnership has the potential to create efficiency savings by reducing duplication and fragmentation of services.</p>

We have published a consultation document, &quot;Policing in the 21st Century&quot;, setting out proposed national changes to policing. These include encouraging citizens to play their part through joint patrols with the police, looking out for their neighbours and passing on safety tips as part of Neighbourhood Watch groups or as community crime fighters. Officials have had discussions with police partners, community crime fighters and others to develop these ideas.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.6/2">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was established under Part V of the Police Act 1997 and was launched in 2002. The service provided by the CRB enables organisations across England and Wales in the public, private and voluntary sectors to make safer recruitment decisions by identifying candidates who may be unsuitable for certain work, especially roles that involve working with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/3">The performance of the CRB is measured against a number of Published Service Standards (PSS) which include to issue 95% of Standard CRB checks within 10 days and 90% of Enhanced CRB checks within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/4">In the last period for which figures are available, August 2010, the number of days the CRB took on average to complete an Enhanced check is 27.7. This figure includes the data for Enhanced applications handled by the CRB where the data provided on the application form are complete and there is no requirement to write to the registered body for clarification of information.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/5">The average length of time taken to process a Standard certificate is unavailable as the data are not collated by the bureau. Standard applications represent only 4% of all applications received and the CRB are currently exceeding their PSS in relation to these checks, issuing 99.8% in 10 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/6">At present the CRB is issuing 88.2% of Enhanced certificates within the 28-day PSS. There can, however, be a number of factors that can affect the timely completion of CRB checks, including but not restricted to:</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/7" class="indent">the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with and submit the initial application;</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/8" class="indent">the accurate completion of the application form;</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/9" class="indent">the clarity of the information provided, and</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/10" class="indent">the existence of conviction or non-conviction information and the operational effectiveness of the disclosure units of the police forces involved in the CRB checking process.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/11">The CRB works very closely with the police in demand planning and addressing the problems associated with delays. It does this by:</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/12" class="indent">working with police forces on issues such as recruitment needs and lead-in times, retention of staff, IT systems and capacity, accommodation constraints and local force vacancies;</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/13" class="indent">where police forces get into difficulty the CRB support them in developing recovery plans to reduce the build up of work, and</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/14" class="indent">proactively manage and report performance on a weekly basis across all police forces</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/15">Over the past 12 months the CRB have been working with forces to reduce the backlog of older cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.191W.2/2">The Government are committed to ending the detention of children for immigration purposes. Our aim is to achieve this in a way which promotes the welfare of children while ensuring the return of families who have no right to be in the UK. Significant progress has been made and we are now piloting new approaches. We are also continuing to work on alternative ways of securing the removal of those families who refuse to comply with our new approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.191W.5/1">The UK Border Agency has a policy of not separating children from both parents, or from one in the case of a single-parent family, for immigration purposes other than in exceptional cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.5/2">For example, there may be circumstances where a prisoner, who is also a parent, is released from prison and a decision is made to maintain their detention under immigration powers in order to effect their deportation. Such assessments are made on a case by case basis taking into account public and child protection concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.5/3">However, family separations may occur for other reasons, such as for child protection purposes (which would be a matter for local authority children's services) or where the parent has chosen to split the family by deliberately hiding the whereabouts of their children. Where children are missing the UK Border Agency will work with other statutory agencies, such as the police and local authorities, to try to locate the children and reunite them with their parent.</p>

	<p pid="b.192W.5/2">We are committed to tackling violence against women and girls. We have deferred, not halted, the pilot scheme of the domestic violence protection order (DVPO) so we could understand their potential impact better and be sure that they would work before committing public funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.5/3">We have had representations from a range of organisations and will keep the Association of Chief Police Officers and other partners involved in discussions about this. In the meantime the police and courts have a wide range of powers available to them to deal with domestic violence through the criminal justice process including the setting of bail conditions. Where there is insufficient evidence to bring civil charges a range of civil powers are available to the courts to protect victims, including non-molestation and occupation orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.192W.5/4">The costs of implementing DVPOs across England and Wales would be impacted by a range of factors, including take-up, and it is not possible to accurately estimate these until a pilot has taken place and been evaluated. The estimated cost for piloting the scheme within two police force areas was &#163;700,000 based on an assumption of 250-300 possible applications for DVPOs across a six to 12-month period over the two areas.</p>

There is a difficulty for the police being able to identify whether a firearm used in an offence was legally or illegally held, particularly if that firearm was not retrieved. As a result, the data for this period were not published. Because of these concerns, and following consultation with police force representatives, the data ceased to be collected centrally from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.199W.0/3">Detention is, however, an essential part of our ability to enforce an effective immigration control. It is generally used where we need to establish a person's nationality or identity, to consider applications for asylum from those claims which can be concluded quickly, to remove those with no basis of stay who have either failed or refused to leave the UK, or to hold those committed of serious offences pending their deportation.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.0/4">The average daily cost of detaining a person in an immigration removal centre (IRC) is &#163;110.</p>
	<p pid="b.199W.0/5">The UK Border Agency seeks to keep length of detention to the minimum period although where it does become prolonged, it is invariably because the detainee is failing to co-operate with the removal process, including providing incomplete or false information about their identity.</p>

The Bill would require each Boundary Commission to propose recommendations for constituency boundaries that are in accordance with the Rules for the Distribution of Seats set out at the new schedule 1 to the 1986 Act. The Bill requires that the Boundary Commissions take whatever steps they see fit to inform people of their proposals; and to make copies available for inspection. There follows a 12 week period for representations on Boundary Commissions' proposals. A second 12 week period for representations will follow where proposals are revised. Any further revisions would then be final. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Speaker, as the ex-officio chair of the Boundary Commissions, is required to lay before Parliament a &quot;progress report&quot; in the January of the year before a deadline and each subsequent January until a final report containing the recommended constituencies is submitted to Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.6/2">However, it is an offence under section 61 (2) (a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 to vote more than once at an election for the same body. Thus, while a person can vote in different local elections where they are validly registered, they cannot vote twice in a UK General election or European Parliamentary election. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, section 61 (2) (a) above is applied (with the necessary modifications) for the purposes of the UK Parliamentary voting system referendum.</p>

	<p pid="b.233W.5/1">The Commission's draft EU budget for 2011 proposed a level of payments of &#8364;130 billion, an increase of 5.8% on 2010. This is out of step with the economic and fiscal reality across Europe. Within that, the Commission's proposal includes a 4.4% increase in EU institutions' administrative spending, to &#8364;8.3 billion. This is unacceptable at a time when Governments across Europe are taking difficult decisions to reduce the financial burden of their own administrations.</p>
	<p pid="b.233W.5/2">There is clear potential for efficiency savings in this draft EU budget and the UK is therefore calling for a cash freeze in the 2011 Budget. In doing so, we have pushed against increased administrative spend for additional staff in the EU institutions, called for greater value for money in areas of expenditure such as agricultural market interventions under the Common Agricultural Policy and questioned budget increases which have been proposed without proper justification or in areas with a track record of poor implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.233W.8/2">Meanwhile, the EU budget for the period 2007-13 was agreed by the previous Government in 2005, meaning the UK's contributions cannot easily be reduced. However, the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers use every available opportunity, including ECOFIN to impress upon counterparts the importance of containing the cost of the EU budget to the UK and delivering value for money. For example, the Chancellor has pressed for a cash freeze in the EU budget for 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.6/1">The Treasury welcomes the innovative approach the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) has taken to its revised analysis of the Budget and is open to exploring new ways of assessing the potential impact of Budget measures. However as the IFS states, in order to include previously un-modelled reforms, the report makes a number of assumptions which add uncertainty to the analysis. It is important that policy is informed by analysis that is proven to be robust. The Treasury has relied on a well-established methodology, similar to that adopted by the IFS in its post-Budget analysis. On the basis of this robust approach, the Budget is progressive and has no measurable impact on child poverty over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.6/2">The Government take account of a range of external views, including those of the IFS, when making its assessment of the UK economy and in policy formulation. The interim Office for Budget Responsibility provided an assessment of the UK economy, which took account of Budget measures on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.238W.6/3">It is not appropriate to pre-judge the outcomes of the spending review process, but it should be noted that the Government set out in the spending review framework that they will &quot;look closely at the effects of its decisions on different groups in society, especially the least well off, and on different regions.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.241W.0/1">The June 2010 Budget announced a &#163;1,000 increase in the personal allowance for under 65s to &#163;7,475 in 2011-12, with benefits focussed on individuals on low and middle incomes through accompanying changes to the basic rate limit and national insurance upper earnings and profit limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.241W.0/2">As a result of these measures 880,000 of the lowest income taxpayers will be removed from tax altogether. It is estimated that those on incomes below &#163;7,475 account for around 0.8% of total incomes above the personal allowance before the Budget announcement and 1.4% of the total benefits. These estimates are based on HMRC's personal tax model, based on 2007-08 Survey of Personal Incomes data projected to 2011-12.</p>

The current number of open websites reported by Government Departments on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-10">10 August 2010</phrase> is 742 that are operated by Departments and their NDPBs plus 103 operated by museums, charities, limited companies and partnerships in which government have a role.
