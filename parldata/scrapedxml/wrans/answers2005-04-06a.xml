The delivery of UKTI trade services for each region is in line with the Regional International Trade Strategy (RITS), which is closely linked to the Regional Economic Strategy, and drawn together by UKTI and the RDA, in consultation with business representatives, to reflect regional priorities.

I am replying on behalf of Mr Anderson as one of the Directors of the Jobcentre Plus Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479W.5/4" class="indent">Up to 60 minutes is allowed for a Work Focused Interview (WFI) although actual timings will vary. Evidence shows that in practice 40 minutes is sufficient to complete an initial WFI, with the balance of 20 minutes available if required, for supporting activity such as referral to jobs, the New Deal or other appropriate provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479W.5/5" class="indent">Customers making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance are required to attend WFIs, at the start and at set intervals throughout their claim, as a condition of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479W.5/6" class="indent">WFIs for lone parents were introduced in October 2000 for lone parents making new or repeat claims to Income Support in three pathfinder areas and were then introduced nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479W.5/7" class="indent">WFIs for customers claiming Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Carer's Allowance or any Bereavement Benefit were introduced as part of the rollout of Jobcentre Plus integrated offices from October 2001. WFI conditionality requires customers making a claim for these benefits to attend a WFI at the start of their claim and at set intervals throughout their claim and, as such, are not part of any mandatory or voluntary New Deal although referral to such a programme may be the outcome of a WFI. Currently WFI conditionality for these benefits operates in around 50 per cent. of Jobcentre Plus offices but we expect rollout to be complete by the summer of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1479W.5/8" class="indent">The available information is that, since 2001, there have been 3,209,000 WFIs that have been conducted at the outset of a claim.</p>

	<p pid="a.1480W.6/1">The Government remain committed to encouraging applications for public appointments from all sections of society. Data are not collected centrally on applications and appointments from more specific groups, but the Cabinet Office does monitor progress on the Government's broader targets to ensure that the make-up of the boards of public bodies is representative in terms of gender, ethnicity and disabled people. The latest report, &quot;Delivering Diversity in Public Appointments 2004&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase> shows that the proportion of public appointments held by people from a minority ethnic background was 7.7 per cent. in 2004, up from 7.4 per cent. in 2002. The report also sets out targets set by individual Departments and action plans to achieve those targets.</p>

It has been a useful confidence-building measure, and combined with the strengthened mandate and more robust approach of the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, is helping to maintain pressure on the Forces D&eacute;mocratiques de Lib&eacute;ration du Rwanda, who declared in Rome on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> that they would disarm. We call on them to do so.</p>

We work closely with other international partners to encourage all parties to maintain the ceasefire and to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible. The British Government have not provided any assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka directly in relation to peace talks with the LTTE.

	<p pid="a.1495W.0/2">The demand for mother and baby places at Askham Grange has declined over the last 12 months. A decision was therefore made to reduce the number of mother and baby places available at that establishment. The change was carried out through natural reductions without the need to relocate mothers and babies. The decision was taken in order to match supply more closely to demand and provide more flexible use of existing accommodation. It was not taken to achieve savings and no estimate has been made of any reduction in mother and baby unit costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495W.0/3">The decision to reduce capacity at Askham Grange was taken as part of a wider review of all mother and baby places.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-06a.203677.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-06a.1495W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/917" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="1495W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050406/text/50406w12.htm#50406w12.html_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1495W.6/1">No such requests have been made by the Home Office. Where investigation by a UK law enforcement agency identifies a child abuse image being hosted in another jurisdiction, it will seek to notify the appropriate authority in that country of its presence so that they can seek its removal and take further appropriate action. A similar process is also undertaken by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). The IWF was formed in 1996 following an agreement between the Government, police and the internet service provider industry that a partnership approach was needed to tackle the distribution of child abuse images online. The IWF operate the only authorised hotline in the UK for the public to report their inadvertent exposure to illegal content on the internet. The hotline provides internet users with a means of reporting potentially illegal content that are located on websites that specifically contain images of child abuse (hosted anywhere in the world), criminally obscene content (hosted in the UK) or criminally racist content (hosted in the UK). As a result of these arrangements less than one per cent. of potentially illegal content is apparently hosted in the UK. Figures for the number of instances on which such requests have been made to other jurisdictions by UK law enforcement are not collated. The legal basis for removing such sites will be dependent on the legislation in place in the particular country in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495W.6/2">More generally, the Government continues to talk with our international partners about further measures which can be taken to combat the abuse of children and remove such images wherever they are hosted. The G8 countries have adopted a strategy on protecting children from sexual exploitation on the internet. As part of this strategy the UK is leading the development of an international child image database, housed at Interpol which aims to act as a global repository of images of child abuse contributing to the identification of victims and offenders and analysis of images.</p>
	<p pid="a.1495W.6/3">The UK also leads in promoting co-operation among law enforcement agencies through the creation, by the National Crime Squad in 2003, of the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT). This is an international alliance of law enforcement agencies delivering innovative crime prevention and crime reduction initiatives to deter and prevent individuals from committing child abuse on-line offences. The VGT is engaged in a number of initiatives which compliment and support the work of existing law enforcement agencies. These include Operation Pin, a website purporting to host child abuse images but which in fact directs those searching for child abuse images to a law enforcement page. The VGT have also developed an international website (<a href="http://www.virtualglobaltaskforce.com">www.virtualglobaltaskforce.com</a>) which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January 2005</phrase>. This acts as a gateway to a wide range of information on how to use the internet safely and links to a range of support agencies around the world that advise and support parents, children and victims of abuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.1500W.2/2">Where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office receives information that an individual with a conviction for a serious sexual offence will be travelling to the UK then the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) will be informed. NCIS may also receive information directly from the foreign authorities through Interpol. Where it is judged to be appropriate, NCIS will then liaise both with appropriate police forces and ports of entry in order to arrange a meeting with the offender on his arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.1500W.2/3">The notification order, introduced by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, is a civil preventative order designed to ensure that offenders who receive convictions or cautions for sexual offences overseas can be made to sign on the sex offenders register while they are in the UK. Application for such an order is made by the police to a magistrates court. If an offender fails to comply with the registration requirements then he commits a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1500W.2/4">The 2003 Act also provides for sexual offences prevention orders (SOPO). SOPOs are made on application from the police to a magistrates court and impose prohibitions on a sexual or violent offender who poses a risk of serious sexual harm. They also require the offender to sign on the sex offenders register. When making a SOPO courts set such prohibitions as they consider necessary. For example, an offender could be prohibited from being alone with children under 16 and/or from being within a certain distance of a school, a playground and/or a swimming baths etc. If an offender breaches a SOPO then he commits a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1503W.2/1">The Home Office conducts an assessment of public attitudes to prison and its alternatives through its own research, including the British Crime Survey, as well as through the consideration of other research and representations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/2">While prison is the right place for serious and dangerous offenders, community sentences can be an effective alternative to short-term imprisonment for less serious offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/3">We have made community sentences both tough and demanding while providing the opportunity for offenders to pay something back directly to the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/4">There is a national visibility scheme in place to identify community work done by offenders. The 'Clean-Up Week' campaign, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase>, involved thousands of people in deciding which local projects should be undertaken by offenders. These included cleaning up prominent eyesores and enhancing the local environment as part of their community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1503W.2/5">Publicity about the new sentences introduced this month under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides an opportunity for further information to be given to the public about the range of sentences available to the court and the need to target them effectively so as to reduce reoffending, protect the public and increase public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1504W.5/2">Research suggests that the main reason for the fall in numbers is external commitments, with ineffective management and deployment also contributing. A number of specials leave to join as regular officers so there is no overall loss to the policing family. The Government are working with stakeholders (particularly the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)) on range of measures to improve Specials' recruitment, management and deployment, including the implementation of Home Office/ACPO Good Practice Guidance designed to help forces attract and hold on to Specials, ensuring their time and skills are properly valued and used to best effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1504W.5/3">A survey of forces recently conducted by ACPO reveals that at <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase> the number of specials had increased to 12,100 with a further 2,500 applications in the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1508W.0/1">Studies have been carried out into the effect of the presence of roadside advertisements and other potential distractions to road accidents. It is, however, difficult to derive a direct causal relationship because accidents are often the result of several factors. Studies have also monitored the duration of drivers' eye movements from the road to roadside distractions, including signs, which provides an indicator of accident potential. I am not aware of any specific consultation with drivers that has been undertaken as part of the research. I do not propose to commission a study on the potential for distraction of temporary wheeled billboards placed next to motorways. It is for local planning authorities to use their enforcement powers to remove unlawfully displayed advertisements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1519W.2/2">The DfES and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) will agree each year an overall indicative budget for the funds that should be used to support education and training programmes which do not lead to qualifications. Nationally, this will be based on the broad proportion of LSC funds currently spent on this type of learning. But within it, the range of provision needs to keep evolving so that it best meets changing learner and community needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1519W.2/3">We will therefore continue to provide significant non-vocational provision to meet the needs of a wide range of learners. However it is learning providers and local LSCs who are best placed to assess the learning needs of their communities and to prioritise funding accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1523W.2/1">The Spending Review 2004 reconfirmed Defra's public service agreement (PSA) target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels in line with our Kyoto commitment and to move towards a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2010.

	<p pid="a.1523W.2/2">The UK Climate Change Programme published in 2000 sets out the Government's approach to tackling climate change. It contains policies and measures intended to achieve the emissions reductions necessary to deliver the UK's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol and move towards the national goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Progress towards the Kyoto Protocol commitment and our national goal are discussed by Ministers regularly, in particular through the Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN), whose Ministerial Group, which is jointly chaired by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, oversees the delivery of the Energy White Paper commitments and the current review of the UK Climate Change Programme. The .review of the UK Climate Change Programme provides an opportunity for the Government to look carefully at whether to introduce new policies and measures, and/or strengthen existing ones, to put us back on track towards the national goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1523W.5/1">The Countryside Agency, in England, is required by Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the Act) to prepare, in turn, draft, provisional and conclusive maps of open country (mountain, moor, heath and down) and registered common land to which the public will have a new right of open access on foot. In order to map such land, the Countryside Agency divided England into eight mapping areas. These mapping areas are based on national park and local authority boundaries rather than traditional county boundaries. The Countryside Agency is mapping sequentially around the eight areas and the new right of access is being introduced in each area once the mapping exercise has been completed. We are on track to introduce the new right across England by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1523W.5/2">The county of North Yorkshire has land included in four different mapping areas: Lower North West; Upper North West; North East; and East (which includes the City of York). To date, the new right of access has commenced in one of these areas, the Lower North West, and, as a result, the new right of access currently applies to 4,884 hectares of land in North Yorkshire. Maps showing where the right of access applies in England are displayed on the Countryside Agency's website: <a href="http://www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk">www.countrysideaccess.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1524W.8/1">Since its establishment in 2001 Defra has put in place a comprehensive programme of action on issues including sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of our achievements to date can be found at http://defra/corporate/achievements.htm. I am confident that the Pendle constituency will have benefited from these. Through our national strategy for waste we are committed to delivering a step change to more sustainable waste management, including tough national targets to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&ndash;04 and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-06a.222384.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-04-06a.1525W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="1525W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050406/text/50406w19.htm#50406w19.html_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/1">Contrary to some views, there is no need for high environmental standards to conflict with industrial competitiveness or economic success. In many cases, high environmental standards can bring both the benefits of a good environment and direct economic benefits to sectors of industry. Well designed environmental regulation can be a stimulus to innovation and industrial efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/2">Defra's aim is sustainable development, which means a better quality of life for everyone. We understand that quality of life is dependent on a strong, fair society, economic prosperity and the quality of people's current and future environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/3">In all the policy making that we undertake, we therefore attempt to properly balance the effects of our policies on each of the social, economic and environment areas and to maximise the net benefit&mdash;so that each of our policies take the country closer to sustainable development. Ensuring the UK has industries that can trade competitively in international markets is a key part of maintaining economic prosperity in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/4">Policy proposals pass through an option appraisal,&mdash;the regulatory impact assessment&mdash;looking at the net costs and benefits of each option proposed. This includes the benefits and costs which do not have a market value (for example, ecosystems) and will include the impacts on competitiveness. In many cases, the benefits of policy in one area&mdash;for example an improvement of people's environmental quality&mdash;are traded off against smaller costs in others, for example costs to consumers to particular service. That is very different to an impact on the UK's competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/5">The Government take the issue of impacts on competitiveness very seriously. Nevertheless, it is not easy to predict the impact of any policy on competitiveness of the UK as a whole&mdash;the dynamic effects of any stimulus rely on complex interactions. To appraise impacts on competitiveness&mdash;rather than just the static impacts on any industry which are already appraised&mdash;the Government are developing a methodology for use in cost-benefit analysis. Defra is fully committed to using this methodology to take better account of any impacts, good or bad, or our policy on competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/6">Defra therefore is serious about setting goals with net benefits for the UK and achieving those goals in the most efficient way, maximising benefits and reducing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/7">Most environmental legislation comes from Brussels. We are influential in shaping that policy to meet our broad sustainable development goals. Pushing the better regulation agenda&mdash;to increase the efficiency of policy, set appropriately balanced goals and reduce unnecessary burden on business&mdash;is one of our five priorities for our presidency of the Council during 2005. We are already seeing success in the use of better impact assessments and simplification of existing measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/8">Further, my Department is leading the way in Whitehall in reducing the administrative burden of regulation, something that may impact on the UK's competitiveness. We have committed to reducing the information and form filling burden on those industries we regulate by 25 per cent. of the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/9">The impacts of policy on industrial sectors depend significantly on the regulation and inspection of firms and individuals by the agencies and bodies responsible for that task. My Department continues to work with its sponsored delivery bodies to cut unnecessary administrative burden, a process which will lead, amongst other things, to a consolidation of functions over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/10">These are only some of the steps that my department will be taking to meet the joint goals of economic prosperity and high environmental standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1527W.9/1">We have no plans to examine methods of control of birds of prey. We are aware of increasing concerns from grouse moor owners, racing pigeon fanciers over the impact of rising raptor populations on bird numbers, including songbirds. A Raptor Working Group was set up in 1995, jointly chaired by the DETR and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The recommendations from the Raptor Working Group's final report, published in 2000, provides the basis for and inform efforts to find an effective and acceptable solution to the problems caused by birds of prey.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527W.9/2">Work is now being taken forward by the country conservation agencies, and other organisations. In addition, English Nature has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moorland Association on addressing the issue of raptor predation in the uplands.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527W.9/3">A paper on progress in implementing the recommendations of the Raptor Working Group Report was presented to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and noted by them, in September 2003. The paper is publicly available on their website at: <a href="http://www.incc.gov.uk/management/committee/papers03-09/incc03N06.pdf">http://www.incc.gov.uk/management/committee/papers03&ndash;09/incc03N06.pdf</a>. Copies of the Raptor Working Group report are available from the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527W.9/4">Birds of prey are usually the top predators in their food chains. As with other predatory species, populations of birds of prey are normally heavily influenced by their prey populations rather than the other way around. The available evidence suggests that recovering populations of birds of prey are not responsible for recent declines in some songbirds and that other factors related to habitat change and the intensification of farming are mainly to blame.</p>

	<p pid="a.1529W.2/1">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales and it advises the Secretary of State accordingly. The agency's current assessment is that even with average rainfall over the next six weeks there may still be some localised water supply problems in southern England this summer. Below average rainfall is likely to result in more serious problems for water companies in the South and this may extend towards the South-West and into the Midlands and East Anglia. Water companies may need to activate the measures in their drought plans, such as hosepipe bans, if the rainfall deficit does not diminish.</p>

	<p pid="a.1529W.5/1">The Environment Agency is the statutory body which has a duty to secure the proper and efficient use of water resources in England and Wales and it advises the Secretary of State accordingly. Each water company in England and Wales produces a water resources plan setting out how it proposes to maintain the supply and demand balance of water for the next 25 years. The plans are assessed by the Environment Agency and reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.1529W.5/2">The plans were updated as part of the recent periodic review of water company prices. The agency reported to Ministers, in July 2004, on these plans in &quot;Maintaining Water Supply&quot;, which is available on its website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1529W.5/3">The agency concluded that all water companies should be able to meet their customers' needs in the short term, although some companies need to work quickly to address security of supply issues. It believes that greater attention to demand management measures could offset the need, identified by some companies, for new or enlarged reservoirs that are expensive and potentially damaging to the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534W.2/1">The average producer milk price in Northern Ireland was 18.26 pence per litre in 2004, which was an increase of 0.26 pence per litre (+ 1.5 per cent.) on the previous year. This compares with an average milk price for the UK as a whole of 18.56 pence per litre in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534W.2/2">The milk price in Great Britain is slightly higher because around 50 per cent. of total milk production goes into the higher priced liquid market.

	<p pid="a.1536W.8/1">Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-31">31 March 1999</phrase>. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2004&ndash;05 will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1542W.2/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) help dentists to set up national health service practices in a variety of ways. We do not hold records centrally of all their initiatives. In helping dentists, PCTs have been able to draw on the &pound;59 million we made available in 2004&ndash;05, of which &pound;35 million was for grants to improve facilities, &pound;15 million for local access initiatives and &pound;9 million for use by the NHS dentistry support team to target assistance to PCTs with some of the most pressing access problems. PCTs can also offer dentists a personal dental services contract to set up a new practice. Under the terms of these contracts, dentists have a guaranteed level of earnings provided that they meet the agreed service requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1549W.9/3" class="indent">better, more responsive services&mdash;for example through training in cultural awareness for all mental health staff;</p>

	<p pid="a.1549W.9/6">Implementation of the action plan is being led by Professor Kamlesh Patel QBE, head of the centre for ethnicity and health at the university of central Lancashire and chair of the Mental Health Act Commission.

	<p pid="a.1549W.9/8">The objectives of &quot;Delivering Race Equality&quot; are supported by the Department's wider equality and human rights programme and by a 27-point cross-Government action plan on mental health published by the social exclusion unit (SEU) in June 2004. The SEU plan recognises that people with mental health problems are among the most excluded in society; its implementation is being led by the National Institute for Mental Health in England, in collaboration over 20 Government Departments and other organisations at national level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1554W.2/2">A recent study of survival and disability in children born at 25 or fewer completed weeks of gestation confirms the association with mortality, and with morbidity and disability for survivors, which may persist into later life. It also notes that the greater introduction of antenatal treatment with corticosteroids and surfactants are important determinants of the increased survival of extremely preterm infants and observes that this may have some bearing on long-term outcomes. The study, entitled EPICure, is available on the following website: <a href="http://www.nottinaham.ac.uk/human-development/EPICure/">http://www.nottinaham.ac.uk/human-development/EPICure/</a>.</p>
