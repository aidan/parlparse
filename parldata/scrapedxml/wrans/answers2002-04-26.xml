The exception policy is a special provision that applies only to rural areas and to sites, within or adjoining a village, where permission would not otherwise be given for new housing development. We have proposed to replace the present system of negotiated planning obligations with a tariff set by local authorities which will widen the type of developments contributing to affordable housing. The tariff would be spent in line with the priorities set out in local development plans, based on local and regional assessment.

	<p pid=".466W.5/1">Proposals to install telecommunications masts are for the Local Planning Authority to determine in the first instance, taking account of local planning policies and national planning policy guidance. Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 8 (revised) (PPG8). Advice on proposed development in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks is given in PPG7&mdash;The Countryside. Advice on proposed development in world heritage sites and conservation areas is given in PPG15&mdash;Planning and the Historic Environment.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.5/2">The Government attaches great importance to minimising the impact of telecommunications development on the environment. Our policy is to encourage mast and site sharing and to make good use of existing buildings and other structures for the siting of antennas. The mobile phone industry has pledged to provide local planning authorities with annual rollout plans for each authority's area. We strongly encourage the use of pre-rollout discussions based upon these plans and collaboration between the operators and authorities as a means of overcoming potential technical and environmental constraints, particularly in designated areas. These discussions should also provide an early opportunity to explore possible alternative approaches, particularly the opportunities for mast and site sharing and also in terms of the location and alternative design of the apparatus.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.8/1">The Government's policy on Gypsy sites and planning is set out in Circular 1/94. This puts Gypsies on the same footing as others in relation to the planning system whilst recognising their special accommodation needs. Inspectors will also have regard to other relevant planning policies set out in Planning Policy Guidance Notes and Circulars. As with all planning decisions, each must be considered on its particular circumstances and merits.</p>

Further periods of detention up to a maximum of 96 hours can be approved by a magistrates' court.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.10/3">Where a person arrested is charged with an offence they must be released from police detention unless certain conditions apply, such as where the custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the person charged will fail to appear in court to answer to bail. Where such a person is kept in police detention they must be brought before the relevant magistrates' court as soon as is practicable and normally not later than the first sitting after they are charged with the offence.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.10/4">Where a person charged with an offence is arrested on warrant for failing to attend a magistrates' court, they must be taken back to that magistrates' court as soon as practicable. If a person is arrested in a different part of the country they must appear not later than the first sitting of the magistrates' court after their transfer back to the relevant area.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.10/5">All persons detained in police custody have their detention reviewed on a regular basis. The first review is no later than six hours after the detention was first authorised. The second review is no later than nine hours after the first review. Subsequent reviews are at intervals of not more than nine hours.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.10/6">A mentally disordered or mentally handicapped person who has been detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 can be taken to a police station as a place of safety to be assessed. The person can be detained only until such time as they have been interviewed and examined by an approved social worker and a registered medical practitioner, and suitable arrangements have been made for their treatment and care.</p>
	<p pid=".477W.10/7">There are currently several strands of work focused on improving police practice in relation to mentally ill individuals. The Home Office, the Department of Health and the Association of Chief Police Officers are considering the development of national protocols covering the interaction between the police and health services in dealing with the mentally ill. The current review of the PACE Codes of Practice is seeking to strengthen further the protections for mentally ill detainees, particularly in terms of assessing their vulnerabilities and fitness for interview. In addition, the review of the Mental Health Act which is underway recognises that police cells are not generally appropriate places for assessing whether a person needs medical treatment.</p>

There is an early focus on pilots in five establishments with a range of changes being made, including physical improvements to reception and induction areas, and more first night support centres and safer cells. Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators have been trained and appointed at 30 high-risk prisons, and revised risk assessment tools are being devised.</p>
	<p pid=".479W.9/5">The Prison Service's internal review into the prevention of suicides and self-harm found that those serving life sentences are at higher risk than those with determinate sentences. Research to find out at what stage in their period of custody life sentenced prisoners are most at risk, and how the self-inflicted deaths of life-sentenced prisoners differ to those in other sentence categories, is now being planned.</p>

The DMO is today also publishing its Business Plan for 2002&ndash;2003. I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library. The DMO, with HM Treasury, will in due course be reviewing its planning objectives in the light of the decision that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-25">25 March</phrase> to integrate the National Debt Office (NDO) and the Public Works Loans Board (PWLB) into the DMO with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase>. <i>Targets for the Debt Management Office 2002&ndash;03</i></p>

To ensure that the maximum time taken to issue the results of gilt auctions does not exceed 40 minutes, that for structured Treasury Bill tenders does not exceed 30 minutes, and that for ad hoc Treasury Bill or other tenders does not exceed 15 minutes, while achieving complete accuracy. <i>[Target met in 2001&ndash;02]</i></p>
	<p pid=".497W.8/4">3. To achieve complete accuracy, within agreed accounting tolerances, in the recording and reporting of transactions through the Debt Management Account (DMA), and in delivering money (and reconciling payments) to the National Loans Fund (NLF) and to meet the statutory deadlines for publication or submission for audit of the annual accounts of the DMO Agency, and DMA. <i>[First half of target met in 2001&ndash;02.

	<p pid=".497W.8/5">4. To acknowledge all letters and e-mail enquiries from the public within 5 working days and for at least 95 per cent to be sent a substantive reply within 2 weeks. <i>[Target met in 2001&ndash;02]</i></p>
	<p pid=".497W.8/6">5. To achieve less than 6 breaches of the operational market notices (excluding any breaches that the Treasury accept were beyond control of the Office). <i>[Equivalent target met in 2001&ndash;02]</i></p>
	<p pid=".497W.8/7">6. To ensure that the statutory constraint on DMO market borrowing (not to exceed its deposits with the NLF and Bank of England) is always met. <i>[Target met in 2001&ndash;02]</i></p>

	<p pid=".497W.8/9">8. To ensure that instructions to counterparties, agents and external systems are complete, accurate and timely, and that monitoring of the progress of transactions through to settlement is effective, so that DMO achieves at least 99 per cent (by value) successful settlement of agreed trades on the due date. <i>[Target met in 2001&ndash;02]</i></p>

In particular on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-14">14 March 2002</phrase> there was a premature release onto the web site of market sensitive information on the breakdown of planned gilt sales in 2002&ndash;03.

	<p pid=".498W.2/2">The Common Customs Tariff of the EU has over 10,400 tariff lines. Over the past ten years the EU has progressively reduced its tariffs in accordance with its GATT/WTO obligations. Over the same period for most tariff lines &quot;preferential&quot; (i.e. lower) rates have been charged on imports from a range of countries. In addition, on around 1000 tariff lines the EU has autonomously suspended duties on goods not produced or not available in sufficient quantity in the Community. As well as reducing tariffs, the EU has introduced anti-dumping or countervailing duties in response to unfair trade.</p>
	<p pid=".498W.2/3">Within this complex framework of multilateral obligations, preferential agreements, tariff nomenclature changes, autonomous suspensions and remedies to unfair trade, the EU has imposed and modified a wide range of duties.</p>
	<p pid=".498W.2/4">The detail of all these changes could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".505W.0/1">The Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES), now marketed as The Warm Front Team.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.0/2">The New HEES was launched on 1st June 2000, replacing the more basic scheme that had operated since 1991. The Scheme is administered by two scheme managers, TXU Warm Front Limited (Eastern, East Midlands &amp; Yorkshire and the Humber) and Eaga Partnership Limited (the rest of England).</p>
	<p pid=".505W.0/3">The original scheme provided low income and disabled households with a single main insulation improvement, or a combination of smaller measures, mainly in the social housing sector. The new Scheme provides packages of insulation and heating measures, linked to the condition of the property and the householder's needs and is focussed on the private sector. To provide these packages the grant maximum was increased from &pound;315 to &pound;2,500 in the case of low-income households aged 60 years or more.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.0/4">Under the original. Scheme, the role of the scheme manager was relatively limited. Their main role was the management and payment of appointed installers. The average management cost per household was &pound;15 excluding recoverable VAT.</p>
	<p pid=".505W.0/5">The current Scheme introduced a significant shift in the role and responsibilities of the scheme managers. They are now responsible for marketing the scheme, the set up and maintenance of local referral networks, carrying out independent surveys of properties, providing householders with energy efficiency advice, advising and agreeing the most appropriate measures for properties, recruiting and managing heating and insulation contractors through open competition, and managing payments to contractors for work completed. This additional work has increased the average administration cost to &pound;77 for EAGA and &pound;86 for TXU per household excluding recoverable VAT. These costs exclude one-off start-up costs paid by the Department.</p>

	<p pid=".506W.5/1">This year has witnessed considerable pressure on the farmgate price of milk, due in a large part to weak international markets for dairy commodities and to high current levels of domestic milk production. Official figures show that in February the average farmgate price of milk had fallen to 18.33 pence per litre. I am aware that some purchasers have recently announced more price cuts that are not yet reflected in official figures and which will further depress the average farmgate price of milk.</p>
	<p pid=".506W.5/2">It is unlikely that prices at these levels are sustainable in the long term under the current milk regime and there are some potentially hopeful signs on world markets. The USA has recently exhausted its GATT commitment for subsidised exports of skimmed milk powders, while substantial quantities of New Zealand milk powders have already been sold. Furthermore, the EU has taken action&mdash;strongly supported by the UK&mdash;to assist dairy exports. We may therefore see some recovery in international markets that could ease pressure on domestic farmgate prices.</p>

	<p pid=".507W.5/1">The National Pig Association (NPA) has made representations to the Government about the cost to pig farmers of the Government's proposals for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. It drew particular attention to the greater difficulty that pig farmers will encounter with the export of surplus manures to neighbouring farms in the proposed, larger, new zones. The Government has considered this representation and proposes to increase the cost assessment in recognition of the need for additional slurry storage capacity to provide more flexibility with the management of exported manures on pig farms.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/2">The NPA urged the Government to introduce a grant scheme to assist farmers to adapt their manure storage facilities to the meet the standards required by the NVZ Regulations. The Government expects to extend the existing Farm Waste Grant Scheme to the new zones when they are designated.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.5/3">The NPA also argued that the cost assessment for the keeping of additional records should be increased. The Government is not proposing to make changes to the record-keeping component of its cost assessment, which is based on an estimate of the average cost across all farmers affected. We recognise that within this average the costs that individual farmers face will vary depending on the nature and scale of their operations.</p>

A number of measures are in place to protect all forests in the UK, including ancient semi-natural woodlands, where the biodiversity and cultural heritage values are highest. In particular, the felling of any type of woodland is controlled through felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls because they are within designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest or Special Areas of Conservation.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.5/1">The Government has, with advice from the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG), put in place a wide-ranging research programme into bovine TB. The programme is described in the ISG's reports which are available on DEFRA's website at <a href="http://defraweb/animalh/tb/">http://defraweb/animalh/tb/</a>. &pound;1.4m is being spent annually on vaccine research and although the sequencing of the <i>M. bovis</i> genome announced recently is an important step forward, the ISG has cautioned that it is likely to be 10 years or so before a successful vaccine is found. On husbandry issues, a vital element of the research programme is an epidemiological questionnaire (TB99) which will give an insight into risk factors associated with husbandry practice and biosecurity. The research programme includes projects on genome sequencing postgenomics and genotyping of <i>M. bovis.</i></p>

	<p pid=".512W.3/1">Government surveys show that the majority of children consume diets which contain enough calories, protein, vitamins and minerals to meet their requirements. However, there are concerns about the balance and variety of foods in children's diets.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.3/2">Around 14 per cent of children's average energy (calorie) intake comes from saturated fat (compared to 11 per cent recommended), around 17 per cent of children's average energy intake comes from added sugars (compared to 10 per cent recommended) and average intakes of salt are up to twice the recommended amount. The percentage of children meeting current dietary recommendations varies by age. However, only around 15 per cent of all children meet the recommendations for added sugars, around 8 per cent meet the recommendations for saturated fat and around 42 per cent meet the recommendations for total fat.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.3/3">Intakes of fruit and vegetables are particularly low&mdash;average intake is only 2 portions per day and one in five 4 to 6 year olds eat no fruit at all in a week. There are also concerns about differences in diet between social groups. For example, children from the lowest social group tend to eat 50 per cent less fruit and vegetables than those from the highest social group.</p>

The Food Standards Agency liaises with this Committee, as do the Governmental health agencies of other EU countries.</p>

	<p pid=".514W.0/1">The safety of high caffeine drinks, often termed &quot;energy drinks&quot; is currently being assessed at European level and new data, including that on possible interactions with alcohol, are being reviewed by the EU Scientific Committee on Food, which is expected to complete its assessment later this year. In the meantime, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has advised that, based on the available evidence, moderate consumption of stimulant drinks by adults is not a cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.0/2">A can of energy drink contains about the same quantity of caffeine as a cup of coffee. The FSA advises that stimulant drinks and other foods containing significant amounts of caffeine should be consumed in moderation by pregnant women and may be unsuitable for those sensitive to the effects of caffeine, including children who are not regular consumers of tea and coffee.</p>
	<p pid=".514W.0/3">The FSA advises that these drinks are not suitable for use as rehydration agents following sport or other strenuous activities. Moderate consumption of these drinks prior to exercise is not a cause for concern, based on the available evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".515W.11/2">The capital cost of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners will vary according to the exact specification of the equipment. Annual revenue costs will also vary dependent on age and specification of the equipment, staffing levels and workload and casemix at the particular hospital. The following costs are provided for guidance:</p>
	<p pid=".515W.11/3" class="indent">The current list price of a well-specified <i>(a)</i> CT scanner is approximately &pound;0.5 million and <i>(b)</i> MRI scanner is approximately &pound;1 million. These costs are not inclusive of value added tax or any necessary installation or building works.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.11/4" class="indent">Annual revenue costs will incorporate both pay and non-pay costs, such as maintenance, film, drugs or contrast agent. Total revenue costs will therefore vary according to staff numbers, scanner activity and type of maintenance contract. However, the average total annual revenue cost for both <i>(a)</i> CT and <i>(b)</i> MRI scanners could be estimated at &pound;0.3&ndash;&pound;0.4 million.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.11/5" class="indent">The majority of hospitals elect to take out a fully comprehensive maintenance contract for both CT and MRI scanners. The cost of all servicing and repairs is included within a fully comprehensive annual maintenance contract, which costs approximately <i>(a)</i> &pound;50,000 for a CT scanner and <i>(b)</i> &pound;70,000 for a MRI scanner.</p>
	<p pid=".515W.11/6" class="indent">Under a fully comprehensive maintenance contract, a supplier of CT or MRI scanners will usually quote an uptime guarantee for new equipment of 98 per cent. This means that the supplier is confident that there will be no more than 2 per cent unplanned downtime, which would roughly equate to 5&ndash;6 days per year. Older equipment may have greater servicing requirements and the cost of a maintenance contract with a 98 per cent guarantee could be significantly more expensive.

	<p pid=".519W.11/2">We do not collect waiting times for scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans play an important role in the diagnosis of many cancers. The NHS Cancer Plan sets out new goals to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. The target is that by 2005 no one should wait longer than two months from urgent General Practitioner referral to beginning cancer treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice. This target period includes the time for necessary scans and diagnostic tests. Data collection on the waiting times to treatment targets will be introduced as we roll out the Cancer Plan waiting times targets.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.11/3">We are also encouraging hospitals to streamline their services, for example by providing multi assessment one stop clinics where several tests can be carried out at the same visit. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition with emergency cases needing to be seen immediately whilst other cases can be carried out as quickly as possible. To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners: 29 new MRI scanners, 81 CT scanners and over 330 pieces of equipment for breast screening delivered to the NHS since April 2000. In addition workforce initiatives are underway to develop new ways of working and improve recruitment and retention of staff.</p>
