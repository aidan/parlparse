	<p pid="b.1445W.6/1">DFID is very concerned about the humanitarian situation for internally displaced people in Burma. We have been working hard to find innovative ways to increase the amount of aid reaching them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/2">There are three types of internally displaced people in the east of Burma, near the Thai-Burma border. These are (with the latest available numbers from October 2006):</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/3" class="indent">(1) people in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas under ethnic nationality administration (287,000);</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/4" class="indent">(2) villagers who have been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into designated relocation sites (118,000); and</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/5" class="indent">(3) civilians hiding from the Burmese army in areas most affected by armed conflict (95, 000).</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/6">In response to the 2006 military offensive against the Karen, which has swelled the number of civilians hiding in conflict areas, DFID has provided emergency assistance by working through local community groups inside Burma. The local community groups also provide support to internally displaced people in relocation sites and other areas controlled by the Burmese authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/7">This support complements that of relief teams working cross-border from Thailand, as each approach accesses different groups of internally displaced people who may not be reached by any other means. And we recognise the importance of maintaining coordination with all those funding and delivering assistance both in-country and cross-border to ensure that the international community manages to reach as many internally displaced people as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/8">DFID also provided support to internally displaced people in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas in eastern Burma (mostly in Karen State) through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2006. Approximately 75 per cent. of our &pound;500,000 contribution was used for protection work with displaced people in this area, and the delivery of medical supplies and improvement of their water supply and sanitation. Following the forced closure of ICRC's field operations later in the year, DFID, with the British embassy in Rangoon, has been continuing to press the Burmese authorities to reconsider their decision. We remain in close contact with ICRC on the developing situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/9">In addition, our health, education and rural livelihood projects provide assistance in eastern Burma, and support internally displaced people in temporary settlements and designated relocation sites, as well as other vulnerable people. For example, in Karen State, our Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar supports World Vision projects in two townships, Save the Children UK projects in four townships and Care projects in five townships, as well as supporting other national non-governmental organisations. DFID-funded rural livelihoods and pre-primary education projects are about to start in Karen State.</p>
	<p pid="b.1445W.6/10">Furthermore, DFID funds non-governmental organisations working among displaced Burmese (mainly Karen) people in the refugee camps on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border&mdash;as a grant to the Thai Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) of &pound;1.8 million over three years. The UK contributes approximately the same amount again as its share of the EC's support to TBBC. The British embassy in Bangkok advocates on behalf of Burmese refugees living in Thailand through the United Nations high commission for refugees to improve the situation in the refugee camps in Thailand and to bring about a relaxation of the regulations prohibiting freedom of movement and employment outside the camps.</p>

It is not therefore possible to provide figures on either the total number or value of Chinese arms exports to Africa. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, Ministers and officials hold regular discussions with the Chinese Government on a wide range of international issues, including Africa and the arms trade. Within this dialogue we encourage China to increase the transparency of its arms exports and we work with China as it seeks to improve its export controls. The UK is leading calls for an international arms trade treaty, with the aim of ending irresponsible arms trading that fuels internal conflict, external aggression or regional instability, and human rights abuses. We are encouraging China to engage positively in the UN process that will take this initiative forward.</p>

We continue to support the UN's increased focus on this issue and have fully supported the Security Council resolutions on children and armed conflict. We raise our voice to roundly condemn the recruitment and use of children in this way. We support strategies to address this issue through demobilising the children, and then rehabilitating and reintegrating them into their communities. The UK is also actively involved in the UN Security Council Working Group on children and armed conflict.</p>

It is important that MONUC retains sufficient military and civilian capacity to continue its role in stabilising the DRC until the new government has bedded down and has extended its own authority across the country. This will be a gradual process, and the future drawdown of MONUC's capacity will therefore need to be well planned and reflect the situation on the ground.</p>

But successful elections, for which the UK was the leading bilateral donor, should help the process of stabilisation.

We will work with allies and EU partners over the coming weeks and at the May 2007 NPT preparatory committee to lay the groundwork for this.

It will measure the prevalence of participation in all forms of gambling, estimate the prevalence of problem gambling and investigate the socio-demographic factors associated with gambling and with problem gambling. The Gambling Commission has undertaken to carry out a prevalence study every three years. They also work closely with a number of other organisations which carry out research into gambling and problem gambling.

The value of HLF's share of income in the last three years was &pound;246 million in 2003-04, &pound;266 million in 2004-05 and &pound;270 million in 2005-06. My Department's current projections for the income of which HLF will receive a share is that it may fall by about 8 per cent. in 2006-07 and 2.5 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1461W.6/1">The National Agreement on Raising Standards and Tackling Workload, signed in January 2003, heralded a number of changes that have now been made to the way in which schools can use support staff in schools. For the first time, there are clearly laid out conditions under which support staff can be deployed to assist or support the work of teachers, for example by providing cover for teacher absence. Schools can either use support staff to provide cover supervision for pupils during teacher absence, or higher level teaching assistants to undertake specified teaching and learning activities. Whether or not schools choose to use support staff to cover teacher absence is entirely a matter for them, but those who do believe that it is a more effective way of maintaining learning than bringing in an unfamiliar supply teacher.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/2">Although the amount schools spent on supply teachers fell between 2002/03 and 2004/05, it rose in 2005/06. We are nevertheless aware that some supply teachers have reported a fall in the amount of work they have been offered. Any such falls can probably be attributed both to the impact of the school workforce remodelling changes and to the buoyant supply of primary teachers. Supply teachers retain a vital role. Cover supervision is appropriate only in certain circumstances, for example to cover for short-term absence, and schools will continue to use supply teachers for cover, especially for medium to long-term absence, and in primary schools where&mdash;in the vast majority of cases&mdash;they are expected to teach. In secondary schools supply teachers are typically used to supervise pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.1461W.6/3">A recent Headspace survey of school leaders indicated that over half believed that standards of teaching and learning had improved as a result of workforce reform. Whilst it is for individual schools to make an assessment of the impact of their cover strategies on their budgets and on the performance of their pupils, we and the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group continue to monitor closely the impact of workforce reform, including the use of support staff for cover. We do this through a number of mechanisms, including a major research project looking at the deployment and characteristics of support staff and exploring the impact of support staff on teaching and learning, and monitoring activity by the Training and Development Agency for Schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1464W.0/1">To date, six local authorities have signed contracts for their Building Schools for the Future (BSF) projects. The first of these was Bristol in June 2006, which marked the establishment of the first Local Education Partnership (LEP), a long-term public private partnership which is the preferred model for delivering local BSF projects. Greenwich and Manchester signed contracts with their respective private sector partners in October and November 2006, followed by Lancashire, Bradford and Lambeth in December 2006. We expect several more contracts to be signed in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/2">Five schools are scheduled to open in 2007 under the BSF programme. These include the first schools to be delivered through BSF in Bristol. A further 23 BSF schools are scheduled to open in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/3">Speedwell Technology College in Bristol will be the first school to open under the programme, in September 2007. It is one of four new schools in Bristol's BSF project and is being financed by PFI credit funding of approximately &pound;36.8 million out of the &pound;154.99 million PFI credits allocated for the whole project. The PFI contract is for 27 years and covers designing, building, financing and operating the schools. The Department is not a party to the contract and therefore we do not have a breakdown of design and construction costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1464W.0/4">We do not hold details of how much has been spent on fees under BSF as this is a matter for individual local authorities. BSF funding includes an allowance for professional fees (including architects and other design consultants, as appropriate) of 12.5 per cent. of construction costs for new build projects and 15 per cent. of construction costs for refurbishment projects. It is for local authorities to manage all project costs, including fees, within the available funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1475W.2/1">There is no statutory number or proportion of hours per week of the timetable that schools should dedicate to teaching GCSEs. At Key Stage 4, school timetables are determined by the individual school's curriculum and qualifications offer and the requirements of the examining bodies' specifications. Guidance from examining bodies suggests that around 10 per cent. of the timetable should be spent on studies leading to each of the new science GCSE and the additional science GCSE in both Years 10 and 11.</p>

	<p pid="b.1485W.0/1">The requested information is not held centrally. As part of the Schools' census (SC) collected in January each year, schools are required to record ethnicity data to reflect the main categories used in the 2001 national population census. Children from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are recorded under the ethnic category &quot;Any Other White Background&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1485W.3/5" class="indent">Individual subjects are not inspected during Ofsted's programme of three-yearly school inspections. There is therefore no specific focus on physical education and school sport. It does, however, feature in several aspects of the inspection and the report: what provision the school has made to promote pupils' knowledge and understanding of fitness and health; whether statutory requirements of the National Curriculum are met; opportunities for extra curricular sporting activity and the development and accreditation of leadership skills through sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1485W.3/6" class="indent">The amount of evidence on physical education and school sport will vary according to the priorities and focus of the inspection. For example, schools with specialist sports college status will have their distinctive aims and characteristics taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1485W.3/7" class="indent">Ofsted's complementary subject survey programme looks in detail at physical education and school sport in a sample of schools across the country. A number of different areas are reported on, including: standards and achievement; teaching and learning; the curriculum; subject leadership and management; and inclusion. The outcomes of these inspections are reported on a three yearly cycle. Additionally, as part of the subject programme, Ofsted continues to inspect the impact of the Physical Education, School Sport and Club Links national strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1489W.3/3">Schools are generally safe places for pupils and staff, and we have helped school managers to act against rare but serious incidents in order to maintain that level of safety. On trespass, we have advised schools on how they can ban nuisance intruders from the school site and then prosecute if banned intruders persist in causing a nuisance. Schools are right to take strong action against any verbal or physical abuse of staff or pupils. On vandalism, we have advised schools on how to secure their site and advised schools and local police to liaise closely in order to act strongly against any crimes of vandalism. On weapons, we have announced that schools can screen pupils without suspicion, and will soon be able to do hands-on searches with suspicion; on these we plan to issue guidance in the spring.</p>

Lantra and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA) are working together to raise levels of management and business skills associated with the wood industry. Another of Lantra's initiatives is a joint project with the Forestry Commission on skills issues relating to sustainable green woods.

	<p pid="b.1507W.2/1">Carers already have access to a wide range of support to help them back to work depending on whether they are, for example a lone parent or a disabled person, and the type of working age benefit they receive, such as income support or incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/2">In taking advantage of this support, carers may be able to attend a work-focused interview where they can get advice from a personal adviser on the programmes available to help them search for work or on training to update their skills. When making the transition into work, the personal adviser will also give advice on the financial assistance available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/3">We have also listened to the concerns of carers in drawing up proposals in the Health and Social Care White Paper when a commitment was made to improve respite care. In addition, the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, promotes cooperation between authorities and requires councils to inform carers of their right to an assessment which takes into account their outside interests including work, or the desire to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1507W.2/4">Flexible working practices are good for business, employees and their families. In April 2003, we introduced a new right for parents of children up to the age of six and disabled children up to the age of 18 to request flexible working and put a duty on the employer to consider their request seriously. From April 2007, this right will be extended through the Work and Families Act to carers of adults. This will support carers who wish to remain in or return to work and will particularly help those aged 45 to 64, around one quarter of whom are carers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1507W.5/1">The Department already provides a wide range of information about benefits for carers which can be obtained through Jobcentre Plus offices, Pensions centres, advice agencies, libraries, doctors' surgeries, helplines and from the Directgov website. Both the claim pack and the award notifications for carer's allowance contain general advice for carers. In addition many local authorities produce material to advise carers about the financial and practical support that may be available to them, which can include details of local services available to carers. Finally, the Department of Health has announced plans to establish a carers helpline, as part of its 'new deal' for carers. Accordingly, we believe that carers should be free to choose how they obtain the information about financial support and services which they need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1508W.2/2">The level of carer's allowance is increased in April each year in line with the annual movement in prices as measured by the retail price index, and we have no plans to change these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/3">Unlike incapacity benefit and jobseeker's allowance (contributions-based), entitlement to carer's allowance does not depend upon the payment of national insurance contributions; hence, the level of carer's allowance has always been less than other income maintenance (contributions-based) benefits such as incapacity benefit and jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508W.2/4">Income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance are available to carers in lower-income households. They are not payable at standard rates, but are assessed on the basis of an individual's personal circumstances. Carers entitled to carer's allowance have the carer premium of &pound;26.35 a week included in the assessment of these benefits, and of housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they are aged 60 or over, they have the equivalent additional amount for carers included in their pension credit assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1513W.5/1">Work is, and continues to be, the most sustainable way out of poverty. Through the introduction of the national minimum wage and working tax credits, we have made sure that work pays. Those in employment face much lower poverty risks than those who are not. People who move from welfare to work benefit beyond the financial returns; they are less likely to experience social exclusion, and have the opportunity to develop social networks and to benefit from workplace-based training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1513W.5/2">While those in work are at much lower risk of being poor than the workless, we recognise that because of a combination of low pay and households not able to work sufficient hours, work is not enough to lift all families out of poverty. Key to raising rates of pay is developing the skill base of the workforce, particularly those in low skilled work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1513W.5/3">Train to Gain, the Government's new National Employer Training Programme, offers employers access to free flexibly delivered training for their low skilled employees to help them achieve their first full level 2 qualification; the equivalent of five GCSEs. This provides individuals with the platform they need to progress to higher level skills where the rewards are greater.</p>
	<p pid="b.1513W.5/4">Early results are promising with over 50,000 low skilled employees in learning of whom over 4,000 have already achieved their qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1513W.5/5">The Government are considering their response to Lord Leitch's recommendation to expand Train to Gain as part of our efforts to address the UK's long-term skills needs, particularly for those at the greatest risk of poverty.</p>

If the deadline had been <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>, around 150,000 more people in Great Britain would have become eligible to receive a payment at an additional cost of approximately &pound;21 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516W.0/2">The qualifying week for winter fuel payments is set in legislation as the third full week in September. We use this date in order to establish entitlement and make payments before Christmas. The process to establish entitlement of over 11 million pensioners takes six weeks and the first payments, to the poorest pensioners, are sent in early November. Payments continue to be sent through to December. If a later date were used, the payment exercise could not be completed in time for the payments to be available by Christmas. We agreed to make all automatic payments by Christmas to reassure pensioners that they will have extra money available to pay for heating their homes during the coldest part of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1519W.5/1">Since 2002-03 every local housing authority in England has received a grant from my Department to help deliver its homelessness prevention strategy, including the delivery of key Government targets around rough sleeping, Bed and breakfast usage and achieving a 50 per cent. reduction in the use of temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1519W.5/2">In 2004-05, 36 local authorities received a reduction in their homelessness grant compared with the previous year, as a result of a redistribution of the Department's overall homelessness grant to better reward performance and focus on priority areas. As part of the same exercise, 18 local authorities received an increase in grant. In general, there has been no evidence of the reductions resulting in a negative impact on homelessness acceptance levels in the areas concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.5/1">The Government recognised the need to increase investment significantly in order to tackle rough sleeping in a sustainable way. This helped achieve the Prime Minister's target of a two-thirds reduction in rough sleeping from the 1998 baseline of 1,850 rough sleepers on the streets of England on any single night. The target was met ahead of time and to date is being sustained. In 2006 there were just over 500, a figure which represents a 73 per cent. reduction on the baseline level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/2">Historically, there has been capital expenditure by the Housing Corporation under several rough sleepers initiatives. The rough sleepers unit was set up in 1999 with a budget of almost &pound;200 million over its three-year lifetime. Almost &pound;80 million was administered by the Housing Corporation for permanent accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/3">Since 2002-03 local authorities have been responsible for tackling rough sleeping as part of their homeless strategies. Homelessness grant is allocated to support local strategies to ensure the rough sleeping target is sustained. The &pound;90 million Hostels Capital Improvement Programme for 2005-06 to 2007-08 is bringing further improvements by making hostels places of change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/4">Finally, the Supporting People grant programme allocated through 150 administering authorities enables the provision of housing-related support services to a wide range of vulnerable groups, including rough sleepers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/5">The following table sets out details of the funding for rough sleepers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1529W.0/1">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate last visited Nafovanny's two main facilities in Long Thanh, Vietnam in March 2005. They identified shortcomings in animal accommodation and care and we informed the breeding centre that once pending orders for animals for use in the United Kingdom were supplied, its status as an approved centre would cease. By the end of 2005 we had received reassurances and evidence that significant improvements had been made. Subject to being satisfied that further additional safeguards and welfare-related measures are in place, we believe Nafovanny should be able to meet the standards we would expect of such a centre. Should Nafovanny wish to continue to supply animals for use in the United Kingdom we will revisit the relevant facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1531W.0/1">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) do not conduct 'raids' against asylum seekers. Officers undertake operational visits to detain and remove persons who no longer have the right to remain in the UK and do so in line with operational policy and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531W.0/2">In terms of representations the following were consulted during the course of the review of IND's family removals processes, which included the consideration of the timing of detention visits:</p>

	<p pid="b.1531W.0/18">Legal advice on immigration enforcement visits with regard to the right to family life was sought when the Human Rights Act came into effect in October 2000. Legal advice was also provided on the instructions to IND officers, contained in the operational enforcement manual (OEM), with regard to conducting early morning visits. The advice provided was that actions of officers had to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of maintaining an effective immigration control as set out in the Immigration Act 1971, and that each case had to be assessed on its individual merits. IND is aware of the possible traumatising effect of early morning visits when they seek to remove the families of failed asylum seekers. Every effort is made to conduct an immigration enforcement visit with the least disruption to the children and at the best time of day to pick up a family as an entire unit, e.g. before any children depart for school or parents depart for work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531W.0/19">Information on notifying schools of family detention visits is contained in the chapter 58 of the OEM, and the family removal policy notice (EPU 2/06), both of which are available on the IND website. Chapter 46 of the OEM contains information on early morning visits and about notifying the police of all enforcement operations. Where a person has legal representatives, they are sent copies of all enforcement decision notices which inform the person of their liability to removal. Information on notifying a person of removal directions and the opportunity to seek legal advice is contained in chapter 44 of the OEM.</p>

	<p pid="b.1534W.3/1">Data from the Court Proceedings Database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform on the number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts in Sussex police force area show that one person was prosecuted in 2004 under the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 Section 3, while four persons were prosecuted (two in 2003 and two in 2004) under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 Section 87 for depositing litter.

These data are submitted on an annual basis by local authorities to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1534W.3/3">In addition, the penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme was introduced in England and Wales in 2004. Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons suspected of committing specified minor offences, including littering, with a fixed penalty notice of &pound;50. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability to conviction for the offence. The number of PNDs issued for littering in Sussex police force area for the years 2004-06 (January to June 2006 provisional data) can be found in PND table 1. PND data cannot currently be broken down further than police force areas. PNDs cannot currently be issued for the offence of dog fouling.</p>

The drugs worker will ensure that there is at all times co-ordination of the care plan, which in addition to drug treatment may include support with issues relating to accommodation, finances and rebuilding family relationships.

	<p pid="b.1537W.2/2">While the Kent police has a key role to play in enforcing the closure of unlawful encampments it should be noted that responsibility for dealing with such does not rest solely with the force. Other stakeholders and agencies, including private landlords, also possess discretionary eviction powers to deal with such sites and will, on occasions, take the lead in this. The force works closely with these partners, whose various responsibilities are captured in a locally agreed 'Memorandum of Understanding'. As such, the action taken by Kent police should not be seen in isolation, but is instead often part of a joined-up response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/3">Where the force takes primary responsibility for dealing with an unlawful encampment the decision to use statutory powers will reflect all the attendant circumstances, including the social, economic, educational and medical needs of those so encamped. In the event immediate eviction would be disproportionate to the issues at hand, existing policy allows for the exercise of discretion by allowing the trespassers to remain for a limited period before further action to enforce closure is taken. Where this is so, the decision not to automatically evoke an eviction order is the subject of robust scrutiny and is fully recorded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/4">Kent police maintains records of all of the unlawful encampments it has dealt with, however it is only since 2006 that they have gathered sufficient detail to answer the question as framed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/5">Records show that in 2005 the force recorded 136 unlawful encampments of which approximately 50 were closed as a result of enforcement. In 2006 it recorded 141 unlawful encampments. Of these 58 encampments were closed as a result of enforcement, while a further 75 were resolved when the trespassers left voluntary, most likely following discussions with the police or other parties. A breakdown of the enforcement figures show that 10 of these cases were resolved directly by police using the powers under section 61 and 62 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, while the others followed action by other partners under the same Act, or by bailiffs or upon a court direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/6">In carrying out its work, Kent police is mindful of its statutory obligation under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 to:</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/7" class="indent">Eliminate unlawful racial discrimination</p>
	<p pid="b.1537W.2/8" class="indent">Promote equality of opportunity</p>

	<p pid="b.1538W.8/2">It is not possible for the Identity and Passport Service to break down the total non-permanent staff costs by individual project area for 2005-06. Also non-permanent staff were also employed within corporate support areas. The breakdown of the 2005-06 costs between projects overall and corporate support is shown as follows.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1538W.8/5"> <td colspan="2"><i> Non permanent staff costs</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1538W.8/6"> <td><i> 2005-06</i></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1538W.8/7"> <td>Projects</td> <td>9,078,259</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1538W.8/8"> <td>Corporate Support</td> <td>8,108,570</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1538W.8/9"> <td>Total</td> <td>17,186.829</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1538W.8/12">The main reason for the increase in spending since 2003-04 is the need to support, through proper project management arrangements, delivery of a highly complex change programme which has included the introduction of e.passports, interviews for first time applicants, the application of the personal identity process to first time adult applicants, and its development through other data sharing arrangements, the trialling of facial recognition as an anti-fraud tool and preparation for the launch of the Identity and Passport Service. Much of this activity required specialist skills not readily available within the Agency, and skills that would not be required permanently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538W.8/13">The Agency remains committed to replacing wherever possible, non-permanent resources with permanent staff through the training and development of its own existing staff, and other means.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538W.8/14">The Agency expects to have spent &pound;450,000 on re-branding from UK Passport Service to the Identity and Passport Service which represents 0.1 per cent. of the expected total Agency spend in the 2006-07 financial year. This expenditure includes costs associated with the brand development, external signage and website development.</p>

The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. There is a slight lag in reporting which means that the provisional number mentioned here will rise a little in the coming months. Additionally, such numbers need to be interpreted with caution as some assault incidents may involve more than one victim, e.g. a prisoner and a member of staff. In such cases the incident management system does not distinguish who received the injuries so there may be an element of over counting.</p>

	<p pid="b.1553W.7/1">Central records of the investment in accommodation over the past 25 years are not available as, until 2003, investment such as on estate maintenance, was incurred through a vast number of contracts placed by a number of budget holders across the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1553W.7/2">The initiative to re-launch Defence Estates as an agency in 2003 has resulted in a major reduction in the number of contracts and central recording of maintenance expenditure. I can therefore say that in 2004-05 we spent some &pound;650 million on military accommodation with that figure rising to &pound;700 million for 2005-06 and this financial year. We are also planning to spend over &pound;5 billion on housing and accommodation in the next decade.</p>

For example, the terms and conditions of service in the armed forces are continually being reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate to the requirements and that entitlements are best targeted to enhance recruitment and retention. There are a number of specific initiatives currently being undertaken such as the strategic remuneration review and the defence living accommodation strategy which will contribute towards this effort. In addition, we have made improvements to travel allowances to permit personnel to get home more easily and continue to refine the operational welfare package while also promoting measures such as work/life balance and career breaks to improve the day-to-day lives of service personnel and their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.1559W.2/1">The 2003 Defence White Paper: &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot; described the nature of the security challenges facing the United Kingdom and the defence response to them. The paper highlighted the complex and inter-related threats posed by international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the range of risks associated with weak and failing states. We expect these to remain the security priorities for the UK. However, we also recognise that there are a number of pressures which may complicate or exacerbate this picture up to and beyond 2020, and that unexpected strategic shocks might also alter these priorities. We have therefore developed balanced and flexible armed forces which are able to respond to the inherent uncertainty of the future. This assessment informed the recent White Paper, &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994), published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1564W.5/1">The Government remain fully committed to raising product standards and encouraging consumers to use the most energy-efficient domestic appliances available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.5/2">The Government have put in place a comprehensive package of policies and measures to drive an increase in energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy. Within this programme, we are working hard to encourage the take up of low-energy light bulbs as widely as possible, including through the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC)&mdash;an obligation on energy suppliers to promote improvements in household energy efficiency. Under the first three-year phase of EEC to 2005, around 30 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were distributed, and this number is expected to rise to over 40 million during the current three-year phase to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.5/3">The Government's Market Transformation programme (MTP) supports measures such as the mandatory EU energy labelling scheme which, for domestic light bulbs, has been mandatory since <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>. Energy labels provide clear and easily recognisable information about the energy- consumption and performance of domestic products on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;A&quot; (most efficient) to &quot;G&quot; (least efficient), thus enabling consumers to make a considered choice when purchasing energy- consuming products. Furthermore, minimum energy performance standards have resulted in the removal of the most inefficient fluorescent lamp ballasts from the market. (Lamp ballasts are required to control the current passing through fluorescent discharge tubes, which dissipate energy and can affect the light output efficiency of the fluorescent tube itself).</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.5/4">MTP also works with the Lighting Association, the Lighting Industry Federation, the Energy Saving Trust and Energy Efficiency Partnership, to promote energy- efficient lighting which is both commercially viable and acceptable to consumers. The Energy Saving Trust endorses and vigorously promotes the best lighting products under its energy efficiency recommended scheme and building regulations require new housing to have a minimum number of energy-efficient fittings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.5/5">Looking to the future, we can expect further advances in lighting technologies including, for example, solid-state LEDs which have the potential to provide high-efficiency, low-cost and long-life alternatives for a range of ordinary, decorative and reflector bulbs. We hope this will then lead to acceptable and affordable energy-efficient alternatives across the whole range of lighting products.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-01-22b.116686.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-01-22b.1572W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="1572W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070122/text/70122w0029.htm#07012239003520">
	<p pid="b.1572W.3/1">The following table shows the number of high-growth start-ups in the UK that registered for value added tax (VAT) in each year from 1994 to 2001, the total number of VAT registrations in each year (both rounded to the nearest 100) and the percentage of all VAT registrations that were high- growth start-ups. VAT registrations are the best official guide to the pattern of business start-ups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1572W.3/2">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.1581W.10/1">Waiting times for abortion are not available as the majority of procedures take place in the independent sector, but we consider that gestation at procedure is a good indicator of waiting times. The latest data for 2005 show that progress is being made to increase early access: 64 per cent. of national health service-funded abortions took place at under 10 weeks&mdash;compared with 51 per cent. in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1581W.10/2">The earlier in pregnancy an abortion is performed, the lower the risk of complications. The Government are therefore working to ensure that women have access to abortion services as soon as possible. We have invested &pound;8 million to improve early access and set a standard of a maximum waiting time of 3 weeks. Also, primary care trusts' performance in this area is being measured as part of their annual healthcheck.</p>

	<p pid="b.1584W.9/1">Counselling services are increasingly available in and through primary care services, however, the availability of these services is quite varied. The Healthcare Commission is therefore considering commissioning a detailed audit of the availability of psychological therapies within primary and secondary care. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' research and training unit is currently identifying priorities for this audit and planning how it will be conducted if it is commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.9/2">In addition, a programme to improve access to psychological therapies was launched in May 2006. This programme is considering the national requirements for evidence-based psychological interventions for common mental disorders as set out in the NICE guidance, and two demonstration sites have recently been established.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.9/3">The sites will test the theory that improved access to talking therapies can help tackle suffering, promote the well-being of the general population and have a significant economic impact by helping more people with depression or anxiety return to work or help them stay in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.9/4">To date, the demonstration sites have seen in excess of 2,000 patients with depression and anxiety disorders, and early indications with regard to clinical outcome and overall patient satisfaction are very favourable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1585W.2/1">Crisis resolution home treatment teams (CR/HT) are set up to engage with adults aged 16 to 65 years who experience severe mental illness with an acute psychiatric crisis such as schizophrenia, a manic or a severe depressive disorder.

	<p pid="b.1587W.3/1">The United Kingdom national infant feeding survey takes place every five years and asks mothers about the benefits of taking folic acid during pregnancy. In 1995, three-quarters (75 per cent.) were aware of the benefits of taking folic acid and this increased to over nine out of 10 (92 per cent.) by 2000. Most women who knew of the increased benefits of taking folic acid had taken some action to increase their intake of folic acid. Three in 10 (31 per cent.) had changed their diets and almost three-quarters (73 per cent.) had taken supplements, with some women doing both. The 2000 survey was not able to differentiate whether the action was prior to conception or after they were aware that they were pregnant. The report did not provide any further breakdown based either on age or demographic groups.</p>

Nearly four out of five mothers (79 per cent.) reported increasing their folate intake during pregnancy. The proportion of mothers taking action increased with age from 32 per cent. for those aged 16 to 24 up to 60 per cent. for those 35 years and older. Slightly more than four in 10 (43 per cent.) mothers in the most socio-economically deprived areas were likely to increase their folate intake compared with seven in 10 (70 per cent.) mothers in the least socio-economically deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1588W.2/1">The circumstances of each national health service foundation trust (NHSFT) are different, which is why the legislative framework for NHSFTs gives them freedoms of local flexibility to tailor their governance arrangements to their individual circumstances and those of their community, over and above minimum legal requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1588W.2/2">It is up to each NHSFT to consider whether to set up committees or sub-committees of its board of governors and determine the circumstances under which these should operate. Schedule 1 of the Health and Social Care Act 2003 states that the constitution of each NHSFT must include details on the practice and procedure for the board of governors, and may also make other provision about the board of governors as the trust sees fit. Reasons for exclusion from meetings are determined locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1591W.5/1">An eight-week consultation has recently been launched by the six primary care trusts (PCTs) in Cumbria and Lancashire to seek the views of the public on the planned establishment of a new clinical, assessment, treatment and support (CATS) service. The consultation runs from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March 2007</phrase>. The PCTs are consulting specifically on the details of the local implementation of CATS services in Cumbria and Lancashire, which fall into four areas: the location of the sites, their impact on the wider health services, how to ensure that they fit seamlessly into the pathway from GP referrer through to local hospital treatment, and the proposed clinical specialities.</p>

NHS Trusts provide these notifications to NCAS on a voluntary basis, either on forms sent to ONS or via local congenital anomaly registers.

In 2005, registers covered 45 per cent of births in England and all births in Wales.</p>

The aim is to effect lasting and transformational change in the way in which equality and diversity is addressed in the commissioning and delivery of health services. To date, considerable work has focused on laying firm foundations. This has involved both the Department and the SHAs in making appointments to the programme, compiling baseline data, running learning workshops, engaging with local stakeholders and communities (some of whom are hard to reach), and undertaking other essential background pieces of work. As a result the SHAs and participating trusts have been able to select the change ideas that they will work on in the coming years. In addition, the programme has been successfully launched in one SHA area and further launches are planned for the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="b.1602W.5/1">Funding is allocated to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each PCTs' target share of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of health services for populations in similar need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.5/2">The components of the formula are used to weight each PCT's crude population according to their relative need (age, and additional need) for healthcare and the unavoidable geographical differences in the cost of providing healthcare (market forces factor).</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.5/3">The weighted capitation formula is used to set targets, which then inform allocations. The formula does not determine allocations. Actual allocations reflect decisions on the speed at which PCTs are brought nearer to target through the distribution of extra funds (pace of change policy). Pace of change policy is decided by Ministers for each allocations round.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.5/4">For the latest allocations round, covering the period 2006-07 and 2007-08, it has been decided to move PCTs more quickly towards their fair share of funds. In 2003-04, the most under-target PCT was 22 per cent. under target. However, moving to reach target allocations in one three-year set of allocations was not possible. The 2006-08 revenue allocations move PCTs more quickly towards their target shares and by the end of 2007-08, no PCT will be more than 3.5 per cent. below its fair share.</p>

	<p pid="b.1603W.0/1">The figures for private finance initiative (PFI) investment on page 44 of the Departmental Report 2006 show the Department's estimate for costs that are incurred by private sector contractors during the years in question in building hospital facilities that will be made available to the national health service under PFI contracts. The figures do not represent liabilities because the schemes are regarded under accounting standards as being 'off balance sheet'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.0/2">Under a PFI contract, trusts may terminate the contract with notice at any time, without having to prove right and regardless of any prejudice to the private sector. Under these circumstances, compensation would be payable to the contractor on a trust default basis aiming to put the contractor in a position that is no better, no worse than it would have been had the contract run for its full length. A value-for- money case for exercising this option must be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.0/3">In working up their preferred option in the business case process, which is developed into the eventual PFI solution, trusts re-assess fundamentally their service configuration and patient pathways, taking on board the provision of new IT, equipment, new construction methods and innovations. It is therefore not possible to directly compare like-for-like annual expenditure before and after a PFI contract is signed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1607W.0/1">The Government have supported the development of a range of specialist roles within nursing. Ministers and officials meet regularly with representatives from the national health service, the Royal College of Nursing and other stakeholder groups, to discuss issues including the nursing work force. There are 404,161 nurses working in the NHS. This represents an increase of 85,305 or 27 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1607W.0/2">It is for local trusts in partnership with local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly; this includes provision of specialist nursing posts. Where agreements have been made for alternate funding of these posts, this is a local matter and concerns about these arrangements should be taken up locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1607W.3/1">In accordance with the national statistics code of practice (2002), the statistics heads of profession in the Department of Health and The Information Centre for health and social care have final responsibility for determining, pre-announcing and, if necessary, altering the dates of publication of national statistics and other relevant statistics produced by their bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1607W.3/2">Any decision to change a pre-announced publication date will be based on a range of purely professional considerations such as the completeness of the underlying data, their fitness for purpose, the need for consistency and coherence, the need to promote widespread access and informed debate, or any earlier accidental or wrongful release. In reaching their decisions, the heads of profession will also take into consideration the detailed procedural guidance given in the national statistics protocol on release practices. Copies of the code and its 12 supporting protocols are available in the Library of the House, and are available at:</p>

Data Quality: Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled  from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies  and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  2. Finished consultant episode (FCE): An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.  3. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis): The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.  4. Low numbers: Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between  1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). To avoid calculation of suppressed values from the totals, the next lowest number has also been suppressed and replaced with an &quot;*&quot;.  5. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>
