	<p pid="a.1941W.6/1">I share my hon. Friend's concern hat people must be able to seek redress against lawyers where appropriate. In our White Paper &quot;The Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First&quot; we set out proposals for an independent Office for Legal Complaints. This will be a direct point for all complaints about providers of legal services. Where things go wrong, it will provide full, fair and swift redress to the consumer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1944W.10/1">In response to the Modernisation Committee's recommendations, the Commission authorised the recruitment of dedicated outreach officers, two of whom were recruited to start work in the education unit in September 2005. Since their appointment they have been meeting other organisations involved in promoting and teaching citizenship to identify how Parliament can most effectively contribute to the teaching of political literacy. Over the coming months they will be travelling to local education authorities and schools around the country to gather ideas on how the services of the education unit can be delivered to young people who are currently unable to visit Parliament. This fieldwork, along with a draft outreach strategy, will be completed before the summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.10/2">In October 2004 the Commission authorised the extension of the education unit's autumn visits programme. Room A in 1 Parliament street has been equipped for presentations to school groups, in addition to the use of the Macmillan Room in Portcullis House, while an allocation of tickets in the public gallery has increased the opportunity for visiting groups to see the work of the House. To enable the unit to increase the number of school parties it can support on a daily basis, a new visits officer was appointed earlier this month with a second due to start in April. These changes will allow a further 20,000 young people each year to visit and learn more about the work of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.10/3">The House authorised the Commission to take forward work on a guide for new voters in January 2005. Since then qualitative research with groups of young people has been undertaken by an external agency in order to find out what kind of guide would be most effective. Following a competitive exercise an external creative agency was then appointed to produce the guide. Draft versions of the guide are going to be presented to groups of young people&mdash;again, by an external agency with expertise in the field&mdash;to test their effectiveness and see how they can be improved. A revised draft guide will be produced in the light of that research and will be made available to the Modernisation and Administration Committees for comments. The Commission hopes to agree a final version of the guide soon, so that from the second half of 2006 the guide can thereafter be sent to young people on or around their eighteenth birthday. The guide is intended to encourage more new voters to make sure they are registered to vote and to use their votes in the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.1945W.3/1">Acid rain is the term given to precipitation which has been made acidic by airborne pollutants. It causes acidification of sensitive ecosystems, such as certain soils and freshwaters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.3/2">Acid rain is a transboundary phenomenon, so the best way to tackle it is through international action. The UK has played a major role in the development of a succession of Protocols under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution to reduce the emissions that lead to acid rain. These emissions are also controlled through the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.3/3">Much progress has been made over the last few decades in reducing the emissions that lead to acid rain, and progress continues: between 1990 and 2002, emissions of sulphur dioxide decreased by 73 per cent. and emissions of nitrogen oxides by 43 per cent. Emissions of ammonia reduced by 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.3/4">The Government support an extensive research programme to examine and understand the effects of acid rain on the environment, and there is now evidence of the beginnings of recovery in some of the most acid sensitive sites in the UK. But more remains to be done, and the Government continue to work in both the UNECE and the EU to ensure the next generation of international agreements will deliver further improvements in line with the principles of sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid="a.1947W.5/1">The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) was published in 1994 as part of the UK response to the Convention on Biological Diversity signed in Rio in 1992. Under the plan there are costed and targeted national action plans for 436 of our most threatened habitats and species in the UK. These are supported by approximately 150 local biodiversity action plans, often at county level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.5/2">Progress on the UK BAP is reviewed every three years. Results from the most recently completed reporting round were published in &quot;UK Biodiversity Action Plan&mdash;tracking progress&quot; in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.5/3">By the end of 2002, 26 per cent. of BAP species were either stable or increasing, and the rate of decline had slowed for a further 8 per cent. of species. 26 per cent. of habitats were either stable or increasing and the rate of those in decline had slowed by 31 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.5/4">Information for 2005 is currently being collated. This will address not only on how individual species and habitats are faring, but also emerging influences by sector and constraints to delivery. A report will be published in 2006. Notable successes of the UK BAP so far include genuine results for species like the corncrake, bittern, cirl bunting, field cricket, lady's slipper orchid and otters, and for habitats including cereal field margins and native pinewoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.5/5">In addition, the UK Biodiversity Partnership is currently undertaking a review of the targets set for UK priority species and habitats and a review of the UK priority lists themselves. We will publish new priorities, targets and plans for meeting our target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010, once these reviews have been completed.</p>

That proposal included a provision allowing member states to voluntarily transfer up to 20 per cent. of their funding for CAP market support and direct payments to rural development. The Government have always supported moving funds in this direction, and will continue to do so. The agreement in December also contained a commitment to review all EU expenditure, including the CAP, in 2008&ndash;09. A debate has already begun ahead of that review. On <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>, the Government made its first contribution to the debate, with the publication of a paper setting out the UK's vision for reform of the CAP.

	<p pid="a.1950W.11/1">Government spending on research into environmental matters comes from a range of sources. The Department's research budget is allocated to specific Directorate Generals, and within each budget there will be specific projects addressing questions about the environment.

	<p pid="a.1950W.11/16">In the 2005&ndash;06 period, DTI has committed &pound;30 million to projects which will cover clean production, waste minimisation, design and manufacture of sustainable products and contaminated land assessment and remediation, and has also allocated &pound;20 million to low carbon energy technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.11/17">DTI also provided funding for Grants for Research and Development, delivered through the Regional Development Agencies in the period 2005&ndash;06, which includes enabling environmental industries to successfully investigate environmental technologies, although it is not currently possible to separate out this expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1952W.6/1">The concept and delivery of favourable conservation status is central to the implementation of the EU habitats directive. A broad definition of the term favourable conservation status is given in the habitats directive, but there remains a lack of clarity in the interpretation of this term or the means by which to implement it. The European Commission plans to produce supplementary guidance later this year and the UK is supporting work to draft this guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952W.6/2">Member states are required to report on their implementation of the habitats directive every six years. The next report is required in 2007, and this will cover the period from 2000 to 2006. For the first time, this will also include reports on the conservation status of listed habitats and species.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952W.6/3">The UK has already started work to gather and assess current status and then to assess whether it is favourable. No formal decisions have yet been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952W.6/4">The Noble crayfish <i>Astracus astracus</i>, while listed in Annex V of the habitats directive, is not ordinarily resident in the UK. As it is an introduced species, the UK will not be reporting on the status of this species. Under section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as amended it is, in fact, an offence to release this species into the wild.</p>

	<p pid="a.1955W.9/1">The Red Kite Reproduction Programme has involved the release of 292 young red kites in four separate areas of England between 1989 and 2005. It has been a great success with breeding populations now well established in three different areas; in 2005 an estimated 385 pairs were breeding in these areas.

Much of the funding is provided by external partners and sources such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Landfill Tax Credits Scheme. English Nature has contributed approximately &pound;20,000 per year to the programme, as well as providing considerable staff time for those involved in the work. Gateshead council has committed &pound;250,000 over five years for the Northern Kites project.

	<p pid="a.1956W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase> the UK presidency achieved political agreement on the proposed Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH). Based on the agreed text, substances imported in articles (i.e. finished products) only require registration if the substances are intended to be released from articles and where they are present above one tonne. Otherwise importers need to notify the authorities only if the article contains a substance of very high concern. The agency may request the registration of any substance in an article if it poses a risk to human health or the environment. The UK Government will appoint a competent authority who will be responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of these provisions in conjunction with other UK bodies as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1956W.2/2">All substances manufactured or imported into the EU above one tonne will have to register with the European Chemicals Agency. The registration of a substance involves the submission of a technical dossier of information about the chemical including a testing package. The testing requirements are outlined in Annexes IV to IX of the regulation. To avoid duplicate testing and minimise the cost to industry, sharing of animal test data is mandatory. To simplify the system, the sharing of non animal data has been made mandatory if requested by a potential registrant. Reduced registration requirements apply to substances manufactured below 10 tonnes. Only substances meeting one of the criteria in Annex Ic need to provide the full testing package outlined in Annex V of the regulation. It will be up to companies to identify whether a substance meets these criteria. A key part of the REACH proposal is that the onus is placed on industry (not the European Chemicals Agency or national Government) to identify the appropriate registration requirements and any additional testing that is required. Guidance will be available and a national help desk will be set up to assist industry in meeting these requirements. In addition, the UK competent authority could, under contract to the agency, conduct dossier evaluations to assess the testing proposals submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1956W.2/3">For substances supplied in quantities over 10 tonnes, the registration package also requires the submission of a chemical safety report. This is a risk assessment in which the registrant takes into account the risk management measures required for the safe handling of the chemical. Details of these requirements are found in Annex I of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1956W.2/4">To inform consumers and the public, basic data held by the European Chemicals Agency about a registered substance, such as its classification and labelling, the results of environmental and health impact studies and guidance on the safe use of a substance, will be made publicly available over the internet. The UK will also explore other approaches through other consumer information services such as Environment Direct.</p>

	<p pid="a.1957W.2/1">Within the UK, the draft regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) was subject to a partial regulatory impact assessment in 2004 which estimated the direct cost to UK industry to be in the region of &pound;515 million over the 11 year implementation period. A further impact assessment was carried out in 2005, which examined the indirect impacts for some downstream sectors. This concluded that the potential annual costs of REACH to the sectors studied were relatively low under most of the scenarios examined, with only worst case assumptions giving rise to significant costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.2/2">One of the factors limiting the costs of REACH in the case studies is the large volume of information already available for a significant number of the bulk chemicals acting as inputs to the manufacturing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.2/3">Across the EU, REACH has been subject to over 50 regulatory impact assessments. This includes the European Commission's extended impact assessment of October 2003, which estimated that changes made to its draft proposals could save up to &euro;10.6 billion (around &pound;7.5 billion). The Commission also carried out a further impact assessment in 2005 in partnership with industry, trade unions, consumer and environmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.2/4">The considerable amount of work carried out in assessing the impact of the REACH proposals has been invaluable in determining costs and benefits, and in informing the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase> the UK presidency achieved political agreement on a REACH text. This includes a number of measures aimed to reduce the cost of REACH-such as 'one substance, one registration', reduced registration requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities less than 10 tonnes and the removal of an expensive test in the 10&ndash;100 tonnage band. The UK Government will update its impact assessment to reflect the changes made in the agreed text. An updated impact assessment is expected in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1958W.2/1">There have been no estimates made of the number of animals required for testing per year across the EU when the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation comes into force, not least since it is not possible to predict in advance the precise timing of any testing carried out by or for registrants. The total number of additional test animals needed as a consequence of the introduction of the regulation has been estimated by the Commission at &pound;3.9 million based on the Commission's original proposal. The text of the Political Agreement of December 2005 goes further still in minimising the amount of animal testing required, for example through the incorporation of &quot;One Substance, One Regulation&quot; (OSOR), a UK proposal with strong rules on the mandatory sharing of animal test data by companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1958W.2/2">The Commission's interim strategy during the implementation stages of REACH will focus on developing guidance, through REACH Implementation Projects (RIPs), on information requirements on intrinsic properties of substances, aiming in particular at developing integrated testing strategies based on alternative methods of testing which will allow the minimum use of test animals. The RIPs are supported by the UK in providing expertise to the RIP project teams and by funding specific research into developing alternative methods.</p>

	<p pid="a.1959W.2/1">The roman snail is a non-native species to the UK. However, we recognise that as European populations have been reduced, the British population may be important in terms of conservation of the species as a whole.</p>

This includes four schemes that will capture an estimated 20,000 megawatt hours of waste heat per annum. This cannot be expressed in percentage terms as we do not collect figures on the total amount of heat wasted.

	<p pid="a.1963W.7/1">Arts Council England does not make funding decisions based on an applicant's religion. It funds artistic practice according to strategic priorities and on the basis of artistic merit. However, it may fund artists for whom Islam happens to be a part of their artistic inspiration. The Arts Council has supported an extremely diverse range of young artists, some of which are Islamic, through an inclusive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.7/2">One of the Arts Council's priorities is to encourage funding applications from people from a diverse range of backgrounds, and in many regions it is, where possible, facilitating community programmes and encouraging artists to apply for funds through the Grants for the Arts (GfA) programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.7/3">There are some excellent case studies such as the West Midlands artist called Mohammed Ali. Mohammed received a GfA grant of just under &pound;10,000 to undertake an exhibition of art work in Dubai titled Salam in the City. This exhibition is to be held late February/early March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.7/4">Ulfah Arts has also received a GfA award of around &pound;13,000 to support the development of their organisation, which encourages increased engagement in the arts for women across all faith groups but with a particular focus on Islam.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.7/5">Pillars of Light, a year long programme across the Yorkshire and Humber region, aims to explore interactions between Muslim cultures and other cultures, within the context of their heritage and contemporary reality. Events throughout 2006 will focus on the visual arts, literature, film, music and theatre. Pillars of Light is being funded through Yorkshire's 'Illuminate' Urban Cultural programme, which is in turn being funded through the Arts Council and the Millennium Commission. Alchemy Anew, an Islamic Arts charity funded directly by the Arts Council, is coordinating it. Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust are one of the key participating organisations in Pillars of Light and are currently hosting the &quot;Palace and Mosque&quot; exhibition on loan from the V&amp;A museum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.7/6">Another exciting project is the innovative and ambitious new cultural building being created by Rich Mix to serve London's many communities. The building work is currently underway in Tower Hamlets, which is one of the most deprived areas in the country and has 48 per cent. ethnic minority population, the majority of which is Bangladeshi and Muslim. Rich Mix, due to open in spring 2006, combines workshop and performance spaces, managed workspaces for creative industries, training and education spaces and houses a three screen cinema. Rich Mix has raised &pound;23 million from funders, including the Arts Council and the London Development Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.1964W.2/1">There is an enormous amount of work going on in the arts sector that helps to promote young Asian talent. The Arts Council has not delivered programmes specifically for the benefit of talented young artists from any particular religion or ethnicity, but has supported an extremely diverse range of young artists through an inclusive approach. One of its priorities is to encourage funding applications from people from a range of backgrounds. In many regions it is, where possible, facilitating community programmes and encouraging artists to apply for funds through the Grants for the Arts (GfA) programme. Furthermore, schemes such as Creative Partnerships and the Arts Award reach many young Asian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/2">The innovative and ambitious new cultural building being created by Rich Mix will serve London's many communities. The building work is currently underway in Tower Hamlets, which is one of the most deprived areas in the country and has 48 per cent. ethnic minority population, the majority of which is Bangladeshi. Rich Mix, due to open in spring 2006, combines workshop and performance spaces, managed workspaces for creative industries, training and education spaces and houses a three screen cinema. Rich Mix has raised &pound;23 million from funders, including the Arts Council and the London Development Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/3">Another exciting project is the Bernie Grant Centre, which is currently being built in Tottenham, North London. A &pound;14 million funding package including &pound;6 million from the Millennium Commission and &pound;3.5 million from London Development Agency has been awarded to transform the former Tottenham swimming baths into a major performance and education centre fostering and showcasing local and national artistic talent. Black and minority ethnic communities in particular will benefit from the training and business prospects that the Bernie Grant Centre will bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/4">The Inspire Fellowship programme is an initiative devised by the Arts Council in order to address the under-representation of Black African, Caribbean, Chinese, South Asian and south-east Asian curators in the museums and galleries sector. Successful candidates receive high quality training and a bursary of &pound;30,000 to &pound;42,000 (depending on experience) over a two year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/5">There are numerous examples of projects funded by the Arts Council that promote young Asian talent in all of the art forms. For example, Decibel Performing Arts Showcases is a programme aimed at significantly developing diversity in the arts in England and seeks to increase the profile of culturally diverse arts practice. The 2007 showcase will be held in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/6">Examples of music organisations which are funded by the Arts Council, and are dedicated to working with Asian young people include, Asian Dub Foundation, SAMPAD (a South Asian Arts development agency), South Asian Arts UK, Milap Festival Trust and The National South Asian Youth Orchestra.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/7">Arts Council England regularly funds South Asian dance companies Shobana Jeyasingh and Akram Khan, and a number of others such as Angika, Sankalpam and Mavin Khoo on a project basis. These companies provide essential role models and beacons of aspiration for young Asian talent All these companies provide education and outreach work. The Arts Council also funds the South Asian dance website, SADA, and the magazine, PULSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/8">There are Asian visual artists in the Arts Council Collection (i.e. Sutapa Biswas, Chila Burman, Zarina Bhimji) and the work of Asian artists is promoted through funding for publications such as Third Text. The Arts Council also established the Institute of International Visual Artists, (inlVA) London in 1994 to take forward the advocacy and support of culturally diverse artists, especially artists of the diaspora.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.2/9">In addition to receiving funding through GfA, Asian writers receive funding through the International Fellowships programme. An example is Nadeem Aslam who was a recent International Fellow at the Santa Maddalena Centre in Italy. The Arts Council also run the Positive Action Traineeships&mdash;placing young people from black, Asian and Chinese backgrounds in publishing houses to gain experience of the industry over a year/six months. Two out of five current trainees are of Asian background.</p>

	<p pid="a.1966W.3/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) only funds apprenticeship programmes that use a framework approved through a process managed by the Sector Skills Development Agency. The learning provider must also meet the LSC quality criteria. Funding is routed either through the LSC's local offices or its National Employer Service (NES) which awards national contracts for large multi-site employers. The basic criteria for awarding of a NES contract are that the business has 5,000 or more employees and that it is has the capacity to deliver at least 200 learner places. Programmes delivered through national contracts can cover a single apprenticeship or industry framework, or a number of them. Around a quarter of apprenticeships are covered by NES contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1966W.3/3">Where an employer or learning provider does not meet the criteria for a contract with the NES but does operate across local LSC boundaries alternative simplified contracting arrangements should apply. These can include a contract with a lead local LSC to cover one of the nine LSC regions or where a provider is multi-regional a national lead can be designated.</p>

However, where a local authority provides milk, it must be free to pupils whose parents are in receipt of the following support payments: income support; income based jobseekers' allowance; support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; child tax credit, provided that they are not entitled to working tax credit, and have an annual income (as assessed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) that from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> does not exceed &pound;13,910; or the guarantee element of state pension credit. In addition, children who receive income support or income based jobseekers' allowance in their own right are entitled to free school milk where it is provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1969W.3/3">We acknowledge that milk can provide a valuable contribution to a balanced diet as well as being a healthier alternative to soft drinks. We plan to launch a suite of new nutritional standards for school food later in the spring, which will stipulate water, fruit juices and milk as the only available drinks in schools. The new standards will take into account appropriate levels of daily nutrient intake, including calcium.</p>

	<p pid="a.1970W.2/2">Individuals working as self employed home tutors are not able independently to obtain a Criminal Records Bureau disclosure as the application must be signed by a person who is entitled to ask an exempted question in relation to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.2/3">The Department strongly advises parents to check the background of home tutors by requesting references and checking a tutor's registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Parents are also advised to make appropriate arrangements for a child who is receiving home tuition, for example having an adult present.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.2/4">The Department is fully aware that parents have limited access to information. The new scheme to be implemented as part of the Bichard inquiry recommendations will allow parents to check whether an individual they wish to employ to work with their children, e.g. as a home tutor, is barred.</p>

	<p pid="a.1970W.8/1">The Department's research plans fully incorporate how effectively our policies widen participation in learning, especially in areas of 14 to 19 education, adult skills, and HE. Key policies aimed at increasing and widening participation in lifelong learning are subject to detailed evaluation to establish their effectiveness and to improve their delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.8/2">For example, in the context of widening participation in HE, Aimhigher is subject to a comprehensive evaluation strategy, organised in partnership with HEFCE and the LSC. It includes surveys of young people, educational providers and Aimhigher partnerships, all conducted by independent research organisations. The evaluation seeks to identify what works, and to use this to inform further policy development and delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.8/3">In the context of increasing participation in lifelong learning, the evaluation of the Employer Training Pilots uses a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques to assess their effectiveness including; surveys of participating employers and employees (early and follow-up), ETP providers, case studies of LLSCs and all key stakeholders, quantitative random surveys of employers, and surveys of eligible employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.8/4">Other examples include the evaluations of the Union Learning Fund, IAG, and the Adult Learning Grant. Full details of the Department's research programme is available at the &quot;Research and Statistics Gateway&quot; on the DfES website, including copies of completed and published research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1970W.8/5">The Department will continue to assess the effectiveness of its policies aimed at widening participation and to share best practice among our partners in delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.1971W.2/2">The research project into the validity of the use of the US-style SAT in university admissions was presented to the Department jointly by the Sutton Trust and the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). The independent review of admissions to higher education (HE) chaired by Professor Steven Schwartz recommended in 2004 a research study to assess the idea of a national test of potential for HE. It noted that US-style SATs were worth exploring, alongside other possibilities, and welcomed the Sutton Trust's proposals for an operational pilot. Following the Department's standard procedures for the approval of research proposed and initiated by external organisations, a decision was taken to contribute up to &pound;800,000 over the length of the five year study. The Sutton Trust, NFER and the College Board in America which owns the SAT, are also making significant contributions. The research will go further than assessing the effectiveness of SATs&mdash;it will also provide valuable data to assess how pastoral support and teaching methods affect student retention and progression. The Department has received no other formal costed proposals to fund research into other forms of assessment of potential for HE.</p>

	<p pid="a.1973W.5/14">1. Figures on UK education spend for the years shown were obtained from the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1973W.5/15">2. The GDP figures used are the latest available and were updated at the end of December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1973W.5/16">3. The international definition of education expenditure used to produce the figures for the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses has changed overtime; therefore, the figure for 1979&ndash;80 is not directly comparable with the other years. The figures for 1987&ndash;88, 1997&ndash;98 and 2004&ndash;05 have been produced to the same definition and so are comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1973W.5/17">The figures for percentage of GDP spent on education remain the same whether cash or 2004&ndash;05 prices are used. This is because the same price deflator is used for education spend and GDP when calculating real terms figures.</p>

	<p pid="a.1974W.3/8">There are no plans to develop further Sure Start local programmes. We expect all 524 local programmes to develop into Sure Start children's centres. By March 2006 we expect around 90 per cent. of these local programmes to have developed into children's centres; the remainder will become children's centres by March 2008. We expect to have developed 3,500 children's centres by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.1979W.12/1">Admiral Sir Alan West, who retires in February, has overseen an important stage in the transformation of the Royal Navy. This includes the introduction of new ships and aircraft and important changes to the personnel and organisational structures of the Royal Navy, delivering a flexible and versatile force for good with an increased level of capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1979W.12/2">Admiral West has worked to raise the profile of the Royal Navy, and in particular has drawn attention to the relevance and importance of the service to national life through the medium of the successful Nelson commemorations. By doing so he will leave an important legacy from his time as First Sea Lord.</p>

We introduced a new national standard for cycle training in 2005. We also have a range of cycling publicity materials aimed at the most vulnerable cyclists, children and teenagers, with a new teen campaign planned for 2006.

Under the arrangements in the Railways Act 2005, at the start of future Access Charge Reviews the Secretary of State must provide ORR with details of the high level outputs he wants the railway to deliver and the public funding available for this.

	<p pid="a.1988W.11/1">Network Rail is making good progress towards delivering the obligations established by the Access Charge Review 2003, including its efficiency savings target. Financial monitoring by ORR indicates that Network Rail is well within its financial licence condition and the likelihood of the company becoming insolvent in the foreseeable future is therefore remote. Accordingly, no specific contingency arrangements have been considered. However, should a protected railway company be unable to or likely to become unable to pay its debts, the Railways Act 1993, as amended, includes powers for the Secretary of State to petition for a Railway Administration Order in relation to that company.</p>

	<p pid="a.1991W.8/1">There are a number of public transport passenger travel alert services already available through mobile technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/2">The Department for Transport supports Transport Direct, Britain's free online journey planning service, which offers a real time journey planning service to mobile and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) users. Users of Transport Direct's mobile and PDA service, which is subject to an ongoing development, can already:</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/3" class="indent">Find out the departure and arrival times for national rail services throughout Britain and for some bus or coach stops in areas where Short Messaging Service (SMS) codes are available for bus or coach stops (e.g. in Wales, the South West, Leicestershire and the South East, except London). The service can give the scheduled arrival and departure time and in some cases provide the expected arrival or departure times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/4" class="indent">View live travel news for car or public transport (e.g. check for delays and accidents) either for a region or for the whole of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/5" class="indent">Find out whether there is a taxi rank or private hire car firm at the rail station they are travelling to, and/or get phone numbers for taxi or cab firms serving the station.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/6" class="indent">Bookmark any useful pages they are viewing on their phone or PDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/7">The Department also supports the Traveline telephone service that is operated by transport operators and local authorities. Traveline has an SMS text service covering Scotland, Wales and parts of England. The service provides info on the next departure times of bus services from bus stops and bus stations within that region, by responding through a text message to a customer request for next bus information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/8">In addition to scheduled bus times available through the Traveline SMS and phone service, some local authorities provide real time information for bus services through mobile devices. For example the &quot;Star Text&quot; scheme in Leicester and the &quot;your next bus&quot; service in West Yorkshire provide passengers with real time information about the actual running time of their buses through a text messaging service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.8/9">National Rail Enquiries offers a text-back facility which enables mobile phone users to check whether trains are running to schedule. Users text the name of the station (or the designated three-letter station code if they know it) to 484950. By return they receive information on the status of trains that are due over the next hour, with a status report (i.e. &quot;On Time&quot;, &quot;+5m&quot;, etc.).</p>

	<p pid="a.1994W.2/1">The targeted programme of improvements (TPI) table placed in the House Library in December 2005 compares the approved full out-turn cost against the scheme cost submitted for TPI entry approval. Since April 2003 the TPI entry cost has been reported on the basis of full projected out-turn, making allowance for identified risks, inflation up to scheme completion, non-recoverable VAT and for 'optimism bias' in line with revised Treasury guidance issued in April 2003. Before then, only net scheme costs, exclusive of VAT, projected inflation and 'optimism bias' were reported at TPI entry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.2/2">This is why as stated in the footnote to the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-19">19 December 2005</phrase>, the two sets of figures in the table are not directly comparable for the 43 schemes that entered the TPI prior to April 2003. For these schemes, about &pound;0.6 billion (39 per cent.) of the &pound;1.54 billion variance against the cost reported at TPI entry is attributable to the absence of VAT, projected inflation at 2.5 per cent. and 'optimism bias'. The remainder of the variance can be attributed to underestimates in the scope of schemes and the impact of inflation. Scheme budgets have assumed that construction inflation would run at 2.5 per cent. per year. The latest indications suggest that a higher allowance may be more appropriate and more research is under way in that area. As far as the Highways Agency is aware fraud has played no factor in any requirement for budget increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.2/3">For the 39 schemes that entered the TPI since April 2003, the two sets of figures are directly comparable and only two schemes have approved budgets that have increased since TPI entry. These increases (&pound;61 million) can be attributed to a combination of underestimates (&pound;26 million) and higher construction inflation (&pound;35 million). Again, none of these increases can be attributed to fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.1995W.2/1">Since the introduction of Local Transport Plans in 2000, the local authorities in the West Midlands Local Transport Plan Area have received around &pound;402.5 million in funding for local transport projects and maintenance schemes. In addition, the authorities received approximately &pound;92.5 million in funding for major local transport schemes including &pound;28 million of funding allocated in December 2004 for the Coventry Quality Bus Network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.2/2">Between 1997 and 2000 the local authorities in the former West Midlands county received approximately &pound;175.5 million in funding for local transport capital investment. The Department for Transport does not have the data to identify a figure separately for local transport investment in Coventry south.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.2/3">The Coventry South constituency has also benefited from the &pound;7 billion investment in the west coast railway line. An additional &pound;4.2 million has also been spent on railway related park and ride schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1995W.6/2">Women's pension provision is steadily improving over time. Through various measures introduced since 1997, we have already lifted 1.9 million pensioners out of absolute low income&mdash;1.3 million of whom are women. The introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection in 1978 together with women's increased labour market participation mean that women are building up better basic state pension records. Future women pensioners will also benefit from the introduction of State Second Pension with six million more building up additional state pension than did under SERPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.6/3">Government recognises that there is still more to be done to address this problem, and that's why the Department for Work and Pensions published a report entitled 'Women and pensions: The evidence' in November 2005, which will inform the next phase of the National Pensions Debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.6/4">We are currently analysing the findings of the Pensions Commission's final report published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November 2005</phrase>, and we will consider the recommendations and options made by the Commission with a view to publishing a White Paper in the spring. Our proposals for reform will be guided by the principle that the pension system should deliver fair outcomes for women.</p>

	<p pid="a.1998W.0/2">The concentration of women in particular job sectors is one of the main causes of the gender pay gap, and we recognise the importance of working with business organisations to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1998W.0/3">Government are working with key partners on various initiatives to encourage schoolgirls to consider careers in sectors that are traditionally seen as male. The Manufacturing Forum is just one of the initiatives the Government are involved in. This is a partnership between Government, industry and stakeholders. The Forum highlighted the Image of Manufacturing as a priority area for action and set up a Image Subgroup which brought together key organisations already active in promoting science, engineering and technology to girls and women, in order to focus on how they can work together to improve the perception of manufacturing among girls and women to improve gender equality in occupations where women are currently under-represented.</p>

DTI, DfES and South East England Development Agency supported e-Skills UK with the original pilot projects. The DfES funded national roll-out of this programme was launched in June 2005. Initial research on the benefits of CC4G has indicated that 66 per cent. of the participants are now considering future IT careers.</p>

However, we would aim to implement the bulk of the legislative provisions as soon as practicable after Royal Assent, taking into account the time needed for consultation and for the system changes that the regulator and industry will need to make.

The Government considers his imprisonment to be a grave violation of his civil and political freedoms, and in particular his freedom of expression as recognised in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which includes the right 'to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'.</p>

The German authorities have made clear that this programme specifically excludes Prisoners of War (PoW) as the funds were intended to compensate foreign national civilians who were forcibly conscripted by the Nazis to work as 'slave labourers'. The IOM has administered the scheme accordingly. This meant that being a PoW was not in itself a cause for entitlement to compensation. The deadline for applications to the IOM expired in August 2001.</p>

Where we refuse a claim and the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) dismisses any appeal we consider that it is safe for that individual to return. This is one of the reasons why the Government do not routinely monitor the treatment of individuals once removed from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013W.2/2">However, if specific allegations are made that any returnee has experienced ill-treatment on return from the UK, these are followed up through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the British high commission in Nairobi as a matter of urgency. The Government consider the safety of any prospective returnee at the initial decision stage and it is also covered by the AIT at the appeal stage. These assessments are made against the background of current information from a wide range of well-recognised sources about the situation in Somalia, including inter-governmental bodies, governmental sources and non-governmental human rights organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.2021W.5/1">No analysis is currently possible on the direct association between the maintenance of family ties during custody and reconviction rates as statistical information is not routinely collected on the family ties of prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021W.5/2">However, the Government recognise the importance of family ties to prisoners and the Resettlement Survey 2003 indicated that over a third (37 per cent.) of prisoners who had at least one visit from family members or a partner reported having employment, training or education (ETE) arranged on release compared with 16 percent of those not receiving any visits. ETE is an important factor in successful resettlement and reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021W.5/3">The findings from this survey (and equivalent surveys for 2001 and 2004) form the basis of a reconviction study which is currently being undertaken. This will include an analysis of any association between family or partner visits (and other factors) and subsequent proven reoffending. Our aim is to publish later in the year.</p>

The Home Department operates a number of different arrangements for filling vacancies each with unique features. Time scales for filling a vacancy can vary considerably depending on the approach taken, the post to be filled and local circumstances.

	<p pid="a.2028W.5/1">The Immobilise Phone Crime campaign was launched in March 2003, to publicise that stolen phones could now be blocked across all UK networks. This was a key step in tackling mobile phone theft, as it removed the incentive to steal a mobile phone because it could now be rendered useless.</p>
	<p pid="a.2028W.5/2">We do not hold figures for mobile phone theft centrally, but Home Office research (HORS 235) shows that a mobile phone is involved in about half of all robberies. A number of interventions occurred at a similar time to the Immobilise campaign, most notably, the Street Crime Initiative. Figures show that robbery fell by 32 per cent. between 2001&ndash;02 and 2004&ndash;05 in the areas in which the Initiative was implemented, despite increases in mobile phone ownership. The targeted nature of the Immobilise campaign, and the link between mobile phones and robbery would indicate that the campaign may have contributed to this reduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.2028W.8/1">Figures for mobile phone theft are not held centrally as it is not a distinct offence category. However, based on Home Office research (HORS 235) we know that a mobile phone is involved in about half of all robberies. The National Mobile Phone Crime Unit (NMPCU) is a dedicated law enforcement unit set up to focus specifically on this serious crime and operates primarily in an intelligence gathering capacity. A key driver for mobile phone theft has been the ability to re-programme the IMEI number (unique serial number) of a phone, thus turning a useless object into a valuable and re-sellable commodity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2028W.8/2">The NMPCU has been proactively targeting individuals engaged in this activity. Since January 2004 there have been 400 individual operations and 34 successful cautions and convictions. This has resulted in a number of custodial sentences and fines under the Mobile Telephones (Re-programming) Act 2002 and related legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2030W.11/1">Although by the very nature of the problem it is impossible to quantify the number of forged passports circulating within the UK, it is a concern I take very seriously. Our response is led by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU), which is recognised at home and abroad as the leader in its field.</p>
	<p pid="a.2030W.11/2">NDFU conducts full forgery detection training for Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) staff. As a result, in 2004 a total of 8,285 fraudulent documents were detected at UK ports of entry, an increase of 4 per cent. over 2003. Croydon NDFU detected 1,044 fraudulent documents, an increase of 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2030W.11/3">Our experience in IND, confirmed by agencies such as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), shows that abuse of identity documents is increasing, assisted by the spread of computer technology. To combat such abuse NDFU provides forgery detection training to other organisations including the police, Customs and Excise, DWP etc, as well as to the private sector, aiding detection of falsified documents within the UK, and hindering the adoption of false identities.</p>

All life licensees are liable to recall to prison for the rest of their lives if their potential risk of harm to the public warrants such action.</p>
	<p pid="a.2034W.8/2">There are no early release programmes as such for lifers. Lifers progress through sentence under the framework of a life sentence plan (LSP). This provides the prisoner with a structured means to help him or her reduce their risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.2034W.8/3">The bulk of this work is conducted in the secure or &quot;closed&quot; prison estate. Most lifers can normally be expected to progress to open conditions in preparation for possible release, but only where the Secretary of State considers such a move appropriate on risk grounds. Consideration of release cannot take place until the prisoner has served the minimum period of imprisonment deemed necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence (the &quot;tariff&quot;). The responsibility for the release of lifers now lies with the independent Parole Board. If the lifer is not released at the tariff expiry point, the Parole Board will consider the case again at no more than two yearly intervals thereafter. The main criterion governing the Parole Board's consideration is the level of risk of serious harm that the lifer may pose to others.</p>

	<p pid="a.2040W.6/2">The report shows the proportion of offenders who reoffended within two years and were subsequently convicted, and separately identifies offenders given custodial and community sentences. The conviction for the offence is counted even if it occurred beyond the two year follow-up period. Results are given for 2000 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.2040W.6/3">Reconviction data for 1997 through 2000 were published in &quot;Prison statistics England and Wales 2002&quot; and data for 2001 were published in &quot;Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2003&quot;. Both of these publications are available on the Home Office website. These series count only those convictions that were secured within the two year follow-up period.</p>
	<p pid="a.2040W.6/4">Reconviction rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Reconviction rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published on the Home Office's website. The most recent data show that there has been a reduction in reoffending for all offenders of 0.2 per cent. against the 2000 baseline. The Home Office public service agreement target is to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.2050W.0/1">The most relevant measure of the UK trade in goods and services balance for comparative purposes is not the absolute figure, but the trade balance as a percentage of GDP. As quarterly figures can be volatile, it is more informative to look at annual figures. In 2004, the UK trade balance was in deficit at 3.3 per cent. of GDP, compared to 4.1 per cent. of GDP in 1989. The current account deficit was 2.0 per cent. of GDP over the same period, less than half the peak of 5.1 per cent. of GDP in 1989, and is readily financeable.</p>

	<p pid="a.2050W.7/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning what estimate he has made of the additional transport costs which may be incurred by jobseekers as a result of the Jobcentre Plus office closure programme; and the steps he has taken to help jobseekers in rural areas with additional transport costs so incurred. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/4" class="indent">We do not maintain a central record of actual additional costs incurred by jobseekers as a result of changes in the configuration of our office network. This is because any changes in transport costs will vary between individual jobseekers and individual locations. Furthermore the levels of Jobseeker's Allowance already take account of the costs of transport for jobsearch-related activities (which includes the requirement to attend our offices on a regular, usually fortnightly, basis).</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/5" class="indent">However, in developing the plans for their Districts, each District Manager took account of the availability, frequency and costs of transport links to our offices. In the case of jobseekers in rural areas, it is open for Managers to make arrangements for jobseekers to sign on by post, rather than attend the office in person. The general rule for allowing postal signing is where:</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/6" class="indent">a. a customer lives more than one hour, door to door, by public transport (in either direction) from the nearest Jobcentre Plus office or Jobcentre; or</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/7" class="indent">b. attendance would result in an absence from home in excess of 4 hours; or</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/8" class="indent">c. the customer has a mental or physical disability which restricts their mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/9" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Business Managers may also use some discretion in offering the postal facility to other customers, even if their journey is possible within the time limits stated above, For example, if the customer would have to use a form of transport which they could not be expected to use on a fortnightly basis, such as an Intercity train, a ferry or a plane.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/10" class="indent">Occasionally customers are asked to attend a Jobcentre Plus Office or Jobcentre on a day when they are not usually due to attend to sign on (to see an Adviser for example). In these cases travel expenses are classed as additional and are reimbursed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.7/11" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.2053W.2/1">The seventh annual 'Opportunity for all' report (Cm 6673) sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and reports progress against a range of indicators. Our current approach is to present a range of low income thresholds (50, 60 and 70 per cent.). This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.2053W.2/2">Households reporting the lowest incomes may not have the lowest living standards. The bottom 10 per cent. of the income distribution should not, therefore, be interpreted as having the bottom 10 per cent. of living standards. This is a particular issue for lower thresholds, such as 50 per cent. of median. Other higher thresholds are less affected by this.</p>
	<p pid="a.2053W.2/3">We have no plans to modify our current approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.2055W.2/4" class="indent">For employed non-resident parents who are initially non-compliant the Agency seeks to use deduction-from-earnings orders to secure maintenance. For self- employed non-resident parents these powers are inappropriate. In these cases the Agency instead uses one or more of a range of its other legal debt enforcement powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/5" class="indent">Enforcement measures available to the Agency include:</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/6" class="indent">Liability Orders</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/7" class="indent">Collection via Bailiffs</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/8" class="indent">County Court Judgements</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/9" class="indent">Third Party Debt Orders (eg bank arrestment)</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/10" class="indent">Charging Order (to realise the debt from the sale of an asset)</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/11" class="indent">Order for Sale</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/12" class="indent">Commitment to Prison or withdrawal of Driving Licence</p>
	<p pid="a.2055W.2/13" class="indent">The Agency's enforcement teams are becoming much more successful in utilising these powers. This is demonstrated by the significant improvement in the in-month cash collections achieved, rising from &pound;0.52 million in January 2005 to &pound;1.42 million in November 2005. An analysis of a sample of debt enforcement cases indicates that approximately 73 % are self-employed non-resident parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.2056W.2/1">The opportunity to work is vitally important in tackling poverty, supporting inclusion and ensuring economic prosperity for both the individual and society. The right to work is as important as the right to equal treatment or access to services. For too many people on incapacity benefit have been denied this right, written off as incapable of work and locked into lifelong dependency on benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.2056W.2/2">We know that the vast majority of people on incapacity benefit have genuine health problems or disabilities. But we also know that a large proportion of these people want to work. In the early stages of an incapacity benefit claim 80&ndash;90 per cent. of people expect to get back to work and around 1 million disabled benefit claimants want to work. So we want to ensure that they are given the opportunity to do so. Our task is to break down the barriers that incapacity benefit recipients face and give them the support they need, so that they can get a job and enjoy all the benefits that work can bring.</p>

There are an estimated 350,000 such firms at any one time, and it is estimated that around 70,000 of those are not complying with the requirement to designate a stakeholder pension scheme. Of those non-compliant firms, it is estimated that nearly 80 per cent. have fewer than 10 employees.</p>

	<p pid="a.2066W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) jointly commissioned report &quot;Homeowner Risks and Safety-nets: Mortgage Payment Protection and Beyond, University of York 2004&quot; was a major piece of research that has informed the development of the Government's strategy on sustainable home ownership. The ODPM has also been involved in research commissioned by others through its membership of the &quot;SUSHO Partnership Steering Group&quot;. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, the Association of British Insurers and Department of Work and Pensions are also members of this group, whose aim is to produce an enhanced safety-net for home buyers that results in fewer households getting into arrears and losing their homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2066W.5/2">The numbers of repossessions has fallen dramatically since the early 1990s when mortgage possessions peaked at 38,930 in the first half of 1991 and the numbers are expected to remain small: the total number of repossessions in 2004 was 6,230. The Government is working closely with the industry to ensure that home ownership is sustainable, and to improve the links between private provision and state intervention. A key part of this initiative is the wider availability and take up of mortgage payment protection insurance and similar products providing cover for borrowers during periods of difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="a.2083W.8/2">The private finance initiative (PFI) has been a major contributor to the largest hospital building programme in the national health service's history. Since May 1997, PFI has led to the construction of 48 new hospital schemes. Going into the future, we remain committed to the continued use of PFI as a mechanism for delivering the required capital investment into the NHS. Individual projects need a sound business case to be affordable and are scrutinised carefully.</p>

However there is some support for screening population subgroups that are at a higher risk of undiagnosed diabetes and coronary heart disease. Further work is required in this area and a number of pilot projects are under way elsewhere in the UK, which would influence any decisions to introduce such screening programmes in Northern Ireland. The majority of early identification of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes will take place in primary care and there are regular reviews of patients with diabetes. This would include screening and investigation of the complications which may arise from diabetes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.2/2">Much work is nearing completion on the first four strands including assessments of population projections and prisoner needs, the development of the estate, alternative approaches to contestability and options for court escorting.

	<p pid="a.2095W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> It is not possible to state with accuracy the number of people smuggled illegally into Northern Ireland over each of the last five years. The nature of facilitation is such that many of those who have been facilitated may state if encountered that they entered by themselves on a false passport or stowed away without assistance, or similar response. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is often not possible to disprove the subject's claimed method of entry.</p>
	<p pid="a.2095W.2/3"><i>(b)</i> The Police Service of Northern Ireland has conducted a number of inquiries into suggestions of people-trafficking to Northern Ireland for the purposes of prostitution. There is presently no evidence to suggest that this is taking place in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is acutely aware of the problems experienced in other jurisdictions and they continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.2098W.2/1">No. Although there will be no 'up front' charge for meter installation, the cost of supplying and installing domestic water meters will be included in the metered tariff and will, therefore, be borne by metered water customers. This is similar to practice in England and Wales.</p>
