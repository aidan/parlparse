	<p pid="b.152W.6/1">The readily identifiable costs to the defence budget of providing support to UK companies to win defence export business were approximately &pound;18.5 million in 2005-06. These costs were substantially outweighed by the benefit we regularly secure from defence exports in the form of lower UK procurement costs. As explained in the defence industrial strategy, exports create value for defence through longer production runs and the consequent spreading of fixed overhead costs.</p>

These women did not witness the 'Chuka Massacre', although it did occur close by, and at about the same time. The statements are held by The National Archives as part of file WO32/16103 under Section 40 (Personal information) and Section 41 (Information provided in confidence) of the Freedom of Information Act. In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to place copies of the statements in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.155W.5/14">The figures do not include any personnel who have received treatment for a mental health condition since leaving the armed forces. This is because on leaving the armed forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. To collate figures on medical treatment received by every veteran would require an examination of the records of every NHS trust (and every independent healthcare provider) in the country and could therefore be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.5/15">We currently only collate these figures for Iraq. However, at a time when personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres before or after deployment to Iraq (including to Afghanistan), it is becoming increasingly difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in some cases might not present itself until some time after the person's deployment ends) to service on a specific deployment. The Department is currently therefore reviewing its methods of collating figures on service personnel diagnosed with a mental health condition. I will write to the hon.

	<p pid="b.155W.5/16">Finally, as I announced in this House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November 2006</phrase>, the MOD's Reserves Mental Health Programme has since that date been providing an assessment and treatment programme for demobilised reservists at the Reserve Training and Mobilisation Centre (RTMC), Chilwell. The numbers of reservists, GPs or third parties contacting RTMC has been very low. As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January 2007</phrase>, a total of seven assessments had been booked, and, of those assessed so far, two cases referred for treatment at one of MOD's Defence Community Mental Health centres.</p>

In addition to the Very Shallow Water UUV which is currently in service, an Invitation to Tender was published in November 2006 to deliver a Reconnaissance UUV which we hope to have in service by the end of the decade. Beyond that, the Navy's Future Mine Countermeasures Strategy sets out our aspiration for a range of fully autonomous UUVs, capable of conducting mine detection, classification and neutralisation while the parent platform remains at a safe distance.</p>

Responsibility sharing will provide opportunities for improved regulation and a reduction in the regulatory burden in future. The Government will benefit from increased industry involvement in decision making, which should mean a greater ability to respond and deliver outcomes more effectively and efficiently. Defra is currently consulting on the principles which should underpin the development of this partnership approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.0/2">The position in relation to crop diseases is the subject of a parallel programme of work. The Government and industry have jointly funded an independent study of options for responsibility and cost sharing in relation to plant health controls to help inform the development of future policy. The study is due to report its findings at the end of June. The overall aim of this work is to identify measures which would improve the overall management of plant pest and disease risks through partnership working.</p>

None of the local authority personnel cleaning up the beaches, nor volunteers of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) picking up birds, have reported any dead fish. Neither have local fishermen. There is also no evidence that fish and shellfish have been seriously affected. Samples have, however, been taken to monitor the accumulation of any contaminants that may have been released.</p>

	<p pid="b.160W.8/6">As for monitoring, water samples taken by the EA show no signs of pollution from the oil, pesticides, or other chemicals from the vessel. However, monitoring activity will continue on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="b.161W.6/1">Assessment of bTB in the deer population has been the subject of Defra-commissioned research by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL). It identified four species of wild deer infected with the disease:</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/2" class="indent">roe deer (1.0 per cent. of 885 tested);</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/3" class="indent">red deer (1.0 per cent. of 196);</p>

	<p pid="b.161W.6/5" class="indent">muntjac (5.2 per cent. of 58).</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/6">Subsequent qualitative risk assessments carried out by CSL and Risk Solutions suggested that the contribution of wild deer to cattle infection is small (less than 5 per cent.), but that more data was needed to enable firmer conclusions to be drawn. Therefore Defra is currently carrying out detailed research into the disease prevalence and density of deer species in areas of high cattle incidence through a sampling survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.6/7">Under the Tuberculosis (Deer) Order 1989 (as amended), suspicion of TB in any deer (or their carcases), whether farmed, park or wild must be notified to the relevant Divisional Veterinary Manager of the State Veterinary Service. Surveillance of bTB in deer is largely based on detection of visible lesions at post-mortem inspection carried out by the Meat Hygiene Service on farmed deer and wild/park deer destined for export.</p>

With the average mix of new to existing composters experienced by the programme so far, the average diversion per bin is currently estimated as 145 kilograms per household. This suggests that the total annual diversion capacity from the programme is of the order of 170,000 tonnes. A full assessment will be published at the end of WRAP's current business plan period in April 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.163W.10/1">At the Gleneagles summit in 2005, the UK secured G8 agreement that the World Bank should lead on establishing a new Clean Energy Investment Framework (CEIF) that would operate across the international financing system. The aim of this framework is to accelerate and catalyse public and private sector investments in cleaner energy in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.10/2">The first phase of this work was discussed at the World Bank's Annual Meetings in September 2006. Countries broadly supported the approach put forward, and asked the Bank to continue work on exploring financial options to support clean energy investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.10/3">The second phase in developing the CEIF will be carried out before the G8 summit in 2008. Engaging the private sector in this work is a key priority going forward. In November 2006, the Chancellor, with the Presidents of the World Bank and the four leading regional development banks, announced a partnership with the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development. The purpose of this partnership is to explore how to stimulate private sector investment through the Clean Energy Investment Framework. A conference will be held in London in March 2007 to launch this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.10/4">In parallel, the Multilateral Development Banks have looked for ways to take forward this work. The Asian Development Bank launched an Energy Efficiency Initiative, with an annual target of providing $1 billion assistance for clean energy projects. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development launched the Sustainable Energy Initiative last year which aims to leverage &euro;5 billion of investment in cleaner energy over the next five years. The World Bank has sought to maximise its existing resources to support clean energy investments, in line with another element of the Gleneagles agreement. A recent World Bank report shows that in 2006 the Bank increased the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects by 45 per cent. to a total of $668 million, exceeding the 20 per cent. annual increase target set in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.163W.10/5">The UK has committed over &pound;15 million to the CEIF so far, including &pound;3 million for technical support in developing the CEIF and supporting discussions in developing countries; &pound;10 million to fund posts and programme budgets across the multilateral development banks and UNDP over the next three years; and &pound;3 million to the EBRD's Sustainable Energy Initiative. The UK has also announced support for one of the first projects to be developed under the CEIF framework&mdash;an investment in wind power in Mexico.</p>

Almost 40 per cent. of infant deaths occur in the first month after birth. DFID has committed &pound;25 million to a programme to reduce maternal and infant mortality. This programme aims to improve access to lifesaving obstetric and newborn care, especially those affected by HIV and AIDS, and to maintain access to family planning services, including secure provision of contraceptives. DFID has also provided UNICEF with over &pound;2 million to support the national vaccination programme to decrease the number of vaccine-preventable deaths among children.</p>

There are also a number of specialised addiction services outside the NHS, some of which are dedicated to the prevention of problem gambling and treatment of problem gamblers. The charity GamCare, runs a 24-hour helpline and provides face-to-face counselling. Its services are open to all problem gamblers, and makes special provision for women, such as female-only group counselling.</p>

	<p pid="b.176W.5/1">Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev were abducted by Hizballah in July 2006. We and the EU have repeatedly called for the immediate release of these two Israeli soldiers. Our ambassador in Beirut raised the issue several times with the Government of Lebanon. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister reiterated the UK's call for the immediate release of the prisoners with Prime Minister Siniora and the Heads of the Lebanese parliamentary committees when he visited Lebanon in September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.176W.5/2">We support efforts to secure the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Scalit, captured by Palestinian militant groups in June 2006. We have not discussed this issue with the Government of Lebanon. We have, however, discussed it with the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>

The resolution, which the UK worked hard to bring about, encouraged efforts aimed at resolving these issues. The UN regards this as a top priority, and is conducting delicate negotiations with the parties. We have regularly encouraged the UN to maintain this sense of urgency. We hope to see progress soon. We continue to stay in touch with the Governments of Israel and Lebanon about the issue of prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="b.179W.5/2">The Department has assisted over 4,600 British companies working in Africa during the past 12 to 18 months through its range of services. This figure includes providing substantive assistance to over 150 companies working in engineering field. We help British companies develop their export strategy, provide support and advice on market entry, advise on local customs, and assist in finding a local partner, dealing with red tape and understanding ways of doing business. Working with our stakeholders we arranged 65 inward missions and 62 outward missions, to African countries in recent years includingSouth Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Libya. Our ambassadors/high commissioners and senior government officials have helped British companies in their efforts to secure contracts in Africa by extensive lobbying with Ministers and officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.5/3">Through our services, we have supported UK engineering firms dealing in a range of multiple industrial projects including roads, bridges, dams, major oil and gas exploration, construction of power plants and infrastructure projects throughout the whole of Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.5/4">The UKTI 'Online Market Introduction Service' has helped some of our small to medium-sized engineering firms (SMEs) to bid for sub-contracts to supply specialist support to multi-national organisations. Examples of the service and products these companies provide are:</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.5/5" class="indent">Flexible pipeline and sub-sea production solutions using an engineering-based approach to reuse flexible pipes,</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.5/6" class="indent">Engineered solution to pipeline pigging and flow assurance products,</p>

	<p pid="b.179W.5/12">Under the Cotonou Agreement, signed in Benin in 2000, 77 African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries receive non-reciprocal trade access to the European Union. Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) will replace Cotonou on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>. EPAs will be compatible with WTO rules and are being negotiated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.179W.5/13">EPAs will be designed to deliver long-term development, economic growth and poverty reduction in all ACP countries. The UK Position Paper of March 2005 states that we will not pursue any offensive interests and that we believe that developing countries can benefit from liberalisation in the long run, provided they have the economic capacity and infrastructure they need to trade competitively.</p>

	<p pid="b.191W.8/1">The criminal law contains a range of offences to tackle crime related to fraudulent use of identity and the Government have no plans to introduce a new criminal offence of identity theft. In the Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud Consultation Paper, published in July 2002, we invited views on whether an offence of identity fraud should be created. Following the consultation period, the law was changed to align the maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment for fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport. The offences were also made arrestable.</p>

New offences were also created of obtaining services dishonestly, possessing equipment to commit frauds, and making or supplying articles for use in frauds.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.8/3">The Identity Cards Act 2006 created new offences relating to possession, control and intent to use false identity documents, including a genuine document that relates to someone else. These offences came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase> and apply to all identity documents, including identity cards to be issued under the national identity scheme.

	<p pid="b.193W.6/1">The choice of software to meet the business needs of the Home Office now largely rests with its strategic IST suppliers who are contracted, largely under the Private Finance Initiative (and PPP arrangements), to meet business requirements and provide value for money solutions, including the consideration of open source solutions.

	<p pid="b.194W.8/2">Research has found that random patrol had no impact on crime rates or on calls for service. Targeted patrol of crime hotspots was found to have an impact. Furthermore there is some evidence of a positive impact on crime and confidence in officers who had higher levels of doorstep contact with the community, rather than contact through patrol. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that patrol, as part of a neighbourhood policing strategy, is effective in its impact on crime, perceptions of crime and antisocial behaviour, feelings of safety, and public confidence in the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.194W.8/3">The Home Office's evaluation of the national reassurance policing programme was published in January 2006 and provides strong evidence of the impact of neighbourhood policing. A copy is available in the Library of the House. The roll-out of neighbourhood policing is due to be complete by April 2008. Ongoing Home Office research will evaluate its impact on police performance, and the results will be published in due course.</p>

However, this sector of the private security industry is believed to be subject to a rate of turnover and other staffing changes of between 20 and 25 per cent. per year. The licensable sector has also been increased by the introduction of a licensing requirement for those involved in related activities such as towing away or blocking in vehicles and collecting payment. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January</phrase>, there were 1,508 valid VI licences. The SIA publishes full statistical details of licensable sectors on its website at:</p>

The FE ILR was collated for the first time in 2002-03 and figures are presented from that time. The following table shows the total number of learners in Shropshire local learning and skills council (LSC) area for both ACL and FE based on the home postcode of the learner. For FE, the figures show all learners, irrespective of whether the course is subsidised by the LSC (the substantial majority), but also learners on full-cost recovery courses and those who draw funding from other bodies, such as the European social fund or local authorities. ACL providers are not required to submit ILR data on non-LSC funded learners, so the figures shown may exclude some who either pay fees themselves or are funded by other means.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.3/1">The entitlement to free tuition for a first full level 3 qualification for young adults aged between 19 and under 25 when they start their learning will be introduced from the start of the 2007/08 academic year. The introduction of the new entitlement will still mean that apprentices of any age are not asked to make a contribution to the costs of their training. The funding to learning providers for the delivery of advanced apprenticeships to 16 to 18-year-old learners will continue to be met fully from public funds. However, the rates payable to learning providers for apprenticeships for those aged 19 or above are reduced by up to 50 per cent. of the 16 to 18 rate to reflect the lower costs of training for older learners and an assumed contribution by employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.3/2">For individuals undertaking learning at level 3 outside the apprenticeship programme, the funding to further education learning providers for 16 to 18-year-old learners will continue to be met fully from public funds. This will also be the case for adults aged 19 and under 25 who are eligible for the level 3 entitlement. Adults aged over 19 and under 25 who are not eligible for the level 3 entitlement or any of the other fee remission categories will be expected to make a contribution to their learning of 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. Adults aged 25 and over who are not eligible for any fee remission category will also be expected to make a contribution to their learning of 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. By 2010, the learner contribution will rise to around 50 per cent., this is in line with the principle that individuals and employers should contribute to costs in line with their ability to pay and the benefits they receive.</p>

The figures for 2001/02 to 2003/04 are described in terms of areas of learning, the classification used by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) during that period. In 2004/05 the LSC adopted a new classification created by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in order to harmonise the categorisation of qualifications across relevant education agencies and bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Figures for 2003/04 are shown recalculated in terms of the new Subject Sector Area (SSA) classification, while figures for 2004/05 are exclusively categorised in terms of SSAs.</p>

	<p pid="b.213W.5/18" class="indent">The 2005-06 final spend has still to be confirmed but we expect this to be more than &pound;270 million on ESOL provision&mdash;just under 14 per cent. of the entire adult budget for that year. This amount is likely to increase by around 13 per cent. to &pound;306 million in 2006-07. A further 5.5 per cent. increase in funding (to &pound;323 million) is estimated for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.5/19" class="indent">From August 2007 automatic fee remission will be withdrawn and while we expect the fees collected to increase it is not possible to calculate how many learners will continue to be eligible for fee remission and therefore not possible to provide fee remission information for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.5/20" class="indent">In 'Raising our Game' the LSC makes clear our expectation that spend on ESOL will not reduce, with achievements broadly remaining the same. ESOL remains a priority area for the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.215W.2/1">I am not aware of a project of this name. However, I understand that Lancashire county council runs a specialist fostering scheme entitled 'Fostering Focus'. The scheme aims to provide highly skilled foster carers able to care for children with the most complex needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.215W.2/2">The recent Green Paper &quot;Care Matters&quot; sets out the Government's proposal for a tiered model of placement types. The tiered model would be structured around the needs of children, with carers being trained and skilled to a greater or lesser degree depending on the needs of the child. The principle behind Lancashire's 'Fostering Focus' scheme is consistent with such an approach and I welcome the steps which local authorities are taking to ensure that children are placed with carers who have the skills, training and ability to meet their individual needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.3/1">We have not produced a privacy impact assessment for the information sharing index and have no plans to do so. Our preferred approach is to develop an ongoing systematic engagement of children, young people and parents, both at national and local levels, throughout the index implementation to ensure that any concerns about privacy are addressed and that the benefits that the index will bring are explained.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/2">It is important that children, young people and their families have confidence in the way the index handles data and protects their privacy. That is why the data held on the index will be minimal, will contain no case information and will not be used to make any automated assessment of risk. Contrary to what some recent media coverage has suggested, there will be no subjective opinions or observations about a child or their parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/3">The index will simply provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners. It will help practitioners identify a child with whom they have contact, and whether that child is getting the universal services (education, primary health care) to which they are entitled. It will enable them to contact one another more quickly and easily than they can now.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/4">The national index communications strategy and plan and those developed by local authorities emphasise the importance of engaging with children, young people and parents to raise awareness and understanding of the index. Since May 2006, Triangle, an independent organisation, has engaged a Children and Young People's Reference Group in a key programme of work to share their views on the index and inform its development. The group commented on the draft Information Sharing Index (England) Regulations 2007 as part of the public consultation that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase>. One third of the 254 responses came directly from children, young people and parents. Focus groups facilitated by the British Youth Council and the Commission for Social Care Inspection (comprised of approximately 300 children and young people and 70 parents/carers) have also participated. A number of local authorities also held local/regional events to gather the views of children, young people, parents and front- line practitioners, and submitted responses on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.3/5">We remain confident that the index is a justified and proportionate measure to improve outcomes for all children.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.2/3">Also, as part of the consultation, we commissioned a number of organisations that work with children and young people to seek their views. The responses from Triangle, the British Youth Council and the Commission for Social Care Inspection represent the views of just under 300 children and young people. These were submitted as combined responses from each group. We also commissioned Triangle to seek the views of parents and carers. This single response represented the views of over 70 parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/4">Throughout the index project we continue to meet with numerous strategic and front-line stakeholders, and have set up a number of advisory groups to help inform the development of the index.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.2/6" class="indent">Regretfully the LSC does not also record expenditure on the basis of local authority boundaries. This would require significant levels of additional information to be captured and prove overly burdensome for learning and training providers, inevitably diverting focus away from the delivery of the priorities we have outlined for the sector in the LSC's Annual Statement: Raising our game<sup>((1))</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/7" class="indent">In 2005-06 &pound;252.9 million was the LSC's expenditure on programme delivery in the Kent &amp; Medway area.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.2/8" class="indent">In addition it is estimated that &pound;38.3 million was spent on national schemes such as, capital grants, financial support for learners and learndirect provision, which can be attributed to the Kent &amp; Medway area, increasing the total programme expenditure to &pound;291.2 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.5/2">It is the responsibility of local children's services to determine what help young people need when they run away, both with the immediate presenting crisis and with the underlying problems that caused them to run away in the first place. Local children's services are therefore best placed to assess the type and levels of support required, including, where appropriate, accommodation. This could include emergency foster care or short-term placement in a children's home, as well as counselling and mediation services, but the exact mix will vary according to locally determined need.</p>

	<p pid="b.221W.8/1">The Education Act 1996 requires local authorities &quot;to make such arrangements for the provision of transport and otherwise as they consider necessary&quot; for 16 to 19-year-olds to attend educational institutions, this includes consideration of provision for young learners with disabilities. It is for local authorities to decide what arrangements are necessary, paid from their normal core funding from the Department of Communities and Local Government, council tax and any other funding they receive. I understand Milton Keynes council operates a home to school/college subsidised transport scheme for 16 to 18-year-olds, including those with disabilities.</p>

Some 115 local authority areas have already attended at least one visit, and, following demand, we are planning this term a programme of learning visits particularly focused on common timetabling.

In the Road Safety Act 2006, we enabled the introduction of a new fixed penalty for people who ignore official reminders that their insurance has expired: when introduced, this will provide for a scheme of continuous insurance enforcement from the vehicle record, to complement police activities.</p>

Central to the strategy is the &pound;370 million Access for All funding, ring fenced to improve accessibility at railway stations up to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.8/3">The majority of the funding (&pound;315 million) is targeted at the busiest stations and the works are being delivered by Network Rail. To date the Department has announced 92 stations in England and Wales for Network Rail to prioritise for access improvements up to 2011. Later this year we are planning to publish a third tranche of stations for inclusion within the Access for All programme for delivery between 2012 and 2015. Llandaff will be considered for inclusion in this tranche alongside all other eligible stations.</p>
	<p pid="b.253W.8/4">In addition, up to &pound;7 million a year is available as Small Schemes Funding for train operating companies and local authorities to bid for match funding to make access improvements at local stations.

	<p pid="b.257W.6/1">Information about access to work is already available to employers in leaflets designed especially for them. The leaflets are freely available from Jobcentre Plus offices. The information is also given on the Jobcentre Plus website and Direct Gov website.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.6/2">Jobcentre Plus does not keep access to work records by type of employer. Disability employment advisers, who are often the gateway to access to work, are regularly in contact with employers locally and will raise awareness of access to work when appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.257W.6/3">There has been no advertising and promotional work specifically targeted at small and medium-sized employers in the last five years. However, Jobcentre Plus does market access to work as part of its general marketing strategy and has spent around &pound;125,000 on marketing in disability magazines in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.270W.5/1">It is Brent Teaching primary care trust's (PCT) responsibility to deliver a responsive health service and improve the health of local people. This means that the PCT will often have to make difficult decisions about how their resources are prioritised and spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.270W.5/2">I understand that Brent Teaching PCT has proposals as part of a turnaround plan to make savings across the range of its services amounting to &pound;14 million in this financial year and &pound;29 million next year. The plan is to enable it to fulfil its statutory obligation to break even by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.270W.5/3">Furthermore, I understand that Brent Teaching PCT is reviewing all the 1,150 patients it fully funds who are receiving care in the community and in nursing homes to ascertain their level of health needs, and that Brent council has been invited to participate in these reviews as well as in the decision making process.</p>
	<p pid="b.270W.5/4">Since 2003, Brent Teaching PCT has received the following allocations which have increased on a year-by-year basis:</p>

	<p pid="b.270W.5/15">NHS London is conducting a review of health care across London, with the aim of producing a framework for how the national health service will meet London's health needs over the next five to 10 years. An initial document, setting out draft proposals and models of service for patients, will be published in March 2007. A process of wide-ranging public engagement and discussion will produce a final health strategy for London which will be published in summer 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.2/1">The duty to carry out a carer's assessment, if requested, lies with the local authority and cannot be delegated except to a national health service body as part of partnership arrangements under section 31 of the Health Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/2">A local authority may arrange for the actual process of carrying out the assessment to be undertaken by a voluntary organisation on their behalf. However, the authority remains responsible for ensuring that each assessment is valid, fair and comprehensive and for considering the implications of the assessment for its provision of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/3">The number of local authorities who have made arrangements for voluntary sector organisations to assist them by carrying out the process of statutory carers' assessments is not held centrally. We have made no assessment on the outcome for carers of involving voluntary sector organisations in this way. In addition, we have no plans to take steps to encourage local authorities to arrange for the process of assessments to be carried out by voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/4">It is for voluntary sector organisations to satisfy themselves that their independence and any advocacy function that they have is not compromised by their involvement in carers' assessments.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.2/5">Regardless of who carries out the process of an assessment, local authorities retain the statutory responsibility for those assessments. Local authorities should therefore treat the results of those assessments in precisely the same way as they would those carried out by their own staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.272W.8/2">Both suppliers of diamorphine to the United Kingdom are working to their full available capacity, and are supplying the market on a regular and frequent basis. They are currently unable to produce enough to meet historic demand, although that demand may have changed due to changes in prescribing practice. We expect the situation to improve during 2007, and in the meantime we believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks, patient care is not being compromised. This is in part because we arranged for the increased production and availability of alternative drugs such as morphine when the problem arose in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.8/3">The amount of diamorphine held in the supply chain at any one time varies, according to a number of factors including the manufacturers' production schedules. All presentations are currently available.</p>

	<p pid="b.274W.2/1">In 2002, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) identified a number of infusion device incidents associated with user error. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), as soon as it had been set up, decided that this was a priority area to look into. It therefore conducted a six-month pilot study from May to November 2003 to identify baseline rates of error in the use of infusion devices. During the study 321 safety incidents were identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.2/2">On the basis of the pilot study the NPSA concluded that the national health service required further advice on the use of infusion devices. In May 2004, the NPSA issued a safer practice notice on improving infusion device safety to trusts in England and Wales. The intervening period was used to identify an effective solution and to develop the safer practice notice, which took into account the pilot study and other relevant research.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.2/3">The range of possible savings was taken from research carried out by a health economist. The reason for the wide range of savings made by the different trusts is due to the existing varying levels of implementation of the notice. There were indications that savings have been made in a number of different areas such as reduced stock maintenance costs, more efficient use of nursing time and reduced costs as a result of infusion errors. These savings would be maximised in trusts that prior to the issue of the safer practice notice had been less effective at managing their stock of infusion devices. On the other hand where trusts were already making effective use of their stock of infusion devices, the savings would be minimised. The extreme range of the savings is emphasised by year on year long-term effect of better stock management procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.275W.0/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is required, as a trading fund, to recover the costs of its medicines regulatory functions through fee income. The agency is required to assess cost pressures to ensure that fee income can fully recover costs. Fees levels were subject to significant increases in April 2006 following new legislation that expanded the agency's responsibilities in order more effectively to protect public health. In recognition of this, the agency's aim has been to keep fees increases for the coming year to the lowest possible level. The proposals set out in the agency's consultation document (MLX 335) include some fees where no increase is proposed&mdash;for instance, for wholesale dealers, and for companies who adopt the new international standard for electronic licence applications, which will have speed and efficiency benefits for both the agency and pharmaceutical companies. The average rate of the proposed increases, across the agency's business, is 4.9 per cent. The income from these increases will cover pay and other cost increases, but will in particular be focused on supporting the agency's ability to deliver further improvements in the service it provides to companies&mdash;something the industry has said it would wish to see. The consultation paper, and its supporting draft regulatory impact assessment, covers these issues in further detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.275W.0/2">The consultation on MIX 335 closes on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February 2007</phrase> with a proposed implementation date for the new fee levels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.275W.0/3">Representatives from MHRA have held extensive discussions with industry associations both before the start of the consultation period and after its publication. These discussions included the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the British Generic Manufacturers Association, the BioIndustry Association and the Ethical Medicines Industry Group. A further meeting with all these associations will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Ministers have met pharmaceutical industry representatives on a number of occasions in recent months. The issue of MHRA fees has not been raised in those discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.278W.2/1">No. The Department expects that care home closures will be handled sensitively, that arrangements will be made for the satisfactory transfer of residents to other suitable homes and that adequate time will be allowed for the process, so that residents and their relatives can have real choice over where they are to live and the minimum possible discomfort is caused to all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.278W.2/2">Care homes may close for a number of reasons, including lack of financial viability, the retirement of the owner in the case of privately run homes, or the fact that the premises do not meet modern quality and safety standards. Residents may also need to move if their assessed needs have changed and their present home can no longer adequately care for them. This is especially true in the case of older residents, whose increasing frailty may mean that their health and well-being will be best assured by their moving to an alternative home which is better equipped to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.278W.2/3">It is a matter for local authorities, as autonomous public bodies, to decide how best to meet the need for social services, including residential care, in their areas, having regard for their resources and the care needs of their populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.282W.12/1">Upon large-scale voluntary transfer a local authority may use the capital receipt arising from the stock transfer to extinguish housing debt, or may decide it makes better financial sense to continue to support the debt that might have been paid off and invest the capital receipt. There may be overhanging debt if the capital receipt from the Registered Social Landlord receiving the stock is insufficient to clear the housing related debt held by the authority with the Public Works Loan Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.282W.12/2">Any overhanging housing debt arising from a housing stock transfer is cleared by a payment from Communities and Local Government. These payments are made from an Annually Managed Expenditure Budget held by the Department. Under this arrangement debt moves from one part of the public sector to another, and in consequence there is no net increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. Around &pound;2.3 billion of overhanging debt payments have been made since 1997. The Exchequer meets the interest payments on debt that it holds.</p>
	<p pid="b.282W.12/3">When a local authority establishes an ALMO to manage its housing stock the treatment of housing related debt does not change. The cost of servicing the debt remains within the authority's Housing Revenue Account.</p>
	<p pid="b.282W.12/4">Local authorities do not use assets as security for borrowing. Rather, borrowing is secured against revenue income streams.</p>

This includes Right to Buy (RTB) sales and also, for example, large or small scale stock transfers and the sale of bare land. For 2003-04, while local authorities will have set aside receipts from all HRA disposals, we only gathered data for receipts generated by large or small scale voluntary transfers. Whether or not a local authority actually used the amounts set-aside to repay debt was a treasury management decision for them. It may have been that it made better financial sense for the local authority to keep a debt on its books and invest the set-aside elsewhere, rather than redeem the debt early and face early redemption penalties.  <sup>(2)</sup> Central Government only began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, local authorities were required instead to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. For 2004-05 onwards, figures include retained capital receipts arising from the sales of all dwellings, not just Right to Buy.  <sup>(3)</sup> Figures for 2006-07 are only for the first two quarters.

	<p pid="b.297W.0/1">The Prime Minister's target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds from 1998 levels was met ahead of time in 2001 and is now 73 per cent. lower and being sustained. My officials work closely with local authorities to ensure that levels of rough sleeping remain low and are further reduced through implementation of their homelessness strategies, required under the Homelessness Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.0/2">Local authorities undertake rough sleeping counts in accordance with guidance developed by the Department in association with the voluntary sector. Departmental officials also attend many counts and we are in the process of extending independent verification to cover all counts undertaken. Local authorities submit the outcome of a count, or their estimate, in their housing strategy and statistical appendix each year. It is these local authority figures that are published each September in the national rough sleeping estimate. Independent evaluations have confirmed the overall reduction since 1997. In addition we are looking at other ways to assess wider homelessness which may not be captured by the current count methods.</p>
