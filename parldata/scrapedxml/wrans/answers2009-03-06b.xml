	<p pid="b.1851W.5/1">We condemn recent attacks on the Burundi and other contingents of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). These attacks appear to have been aimed at blocking progress towards a long-term political solution to Somalia's problems. We have been encouraged that, despite the attacks, both Burundi and Uganda intend to deploy further troops to AMISOM.</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.5/2">While the security situation in Somalia remains fragile, there are encouraging signs that the political process is developing momentum. The new Transitional Government convened for the first time in Mogadishu on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-28">28 February 2009</phrase>. With support from AMISOM, security personnel from the Transitional Government are in control of much of Mogadishu. We, and the rest of the international community, will continue to support President Sharif's efforts to create a stable environment that will allow the new government to begin rebuilding the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1853W.2/1">The Governments of Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Southern Sudan are currently engaged in joint military action against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). We have urged all parties involved to respect fully international law, do all they can to minimise any adverse humanitarian impact and fully coordinate with the UN missions in the region. We have also called for the protection of local populations from LRA retaliatory attacks. Recent reporting suggests that the numbers of LRA attacks on civilians, which have mainly taken place in the DRC rather than Sudan, is diminishing, although it is unclear whether this is due to better civilian protection efforts, erosion of LRA capability or a change of LRA tactics.</p>

	<p pid="b.1858W.3/14">The Government are committed to rebuilding apprenticeships. Since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007/08. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&mdash;up from 37 per cent. in 2004/05. A remarkable achievement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1862W.5/1">One of the core recommendations from the Gregg Review of conditionality was the creation of a new 'Progression to Work' group. Gregg recommends that this new approach should be for those people who may not be ready to work immediately, but who with the right mix of support and encouragement could get back into employment. This model would apply to employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants (other than those in the ESA support group) and lone parents and partners of children aged one to six. The 'Progression to Work' pathfinders have been created as a result of this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/2">The claimants involved in the 'Progression to Work' group will be required to actively engage with their adviser on an ongoing basis to consider, discuss and agree an action plan comprising activities they think will improve their prospects of moving back into work. They must then undertake these agreed activities as part of their own journey towards employment following directions from advisers where these are strictly necessary. This will be underpinned with recourse to sanctions for those failing to engage with support without good cause. However, although still in the 'Progression to Work' group, lone parents and partners with children aged one and two will be encouraged, rather than required, to undertake work-related activity and will not be sanctioned for refusing to undertake work-related activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/3">This pathfinder will cover approximately 10 to 15 per cent. of the new ESA claimants and parents with a youngest child aged between one and less than seven nationally. This equates to roughly 65,000 ESA claimants, 60,000 lone parents and 10,000 partners of benefit recipients each year. These pathfinders are anticipated to begin in late 2010 and last for two years. They are likely to be across six districts and delivery will be a mixture of provider led and Jobcentre Plus led.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/4">Lone parents with children aged less than seven who are not part of the 'Progression to Work' pathfinders are required to attend six-monthly work focused interviews where they can access information about voluntary participation in the new deal for lone parents as well as access a wide range of support to help them move into, and remain and progress in, work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/5">This package of support under new deal for lone parents is also available to lone parents affected by the new benefit requirements introduced in November 2008 for lone parents with older children. However, once a lone parent has been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for 12 months, they will switch to contracted flexible new deal provision. This will provide personalised help to all participants, including specialised help for lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1862W.5/6">Partners of benefit claimants can also, through mandatory work focused interviews, access information about voluntary participation in the new deal for partners, which provides a similar level of provision to new deal for lone parents such as specialised advice, support and training in helping partners to enter or return to work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1864W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is required to review all social security benefits each year to ensure they have retained their value in relation to prices (or, for the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit, earnings). Generally the contributory benefits are increased in line with the retail prices index and the income related benefits increased by the Rossi index which is the retail prices index with the housing elements removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.5/2">The retail prices index takes account of changes in the cost of a wide range of goods and services and reflects the average increases in costs that people face year-on-year. Increasing benefits in line with this measure ensures that benefits keep their real value in broad terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.5/3">The new rates that will come into force from April have been increased in line with inflation as measured last September, when the retail prices index was 5 per cent. and the Rossi index was 6 per cent. These increases are, against a backdrop of falling inflation, in line with the highest increase in inflation last year. The increase in the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit to &pound;130 for single pensioners (&pound;198.45 for pensioner couples) represents the highest up-lift since it came into force in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.5/4">The Department recognises that different groups may currently be experiencing varying levels of inflationary pressure and is aware that the Office for National Statistics produces a quarterly 'Pensioner Prices Index' that relates to pensioners who derive more than 75 per cent. of their income from state benefits. This measure is not used to increase pensioner benefits because it is not representative of the whole pensioner population, therefore the Department does not consider that pensioner benefits should be up-rated in a different way to benefits for other age groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.5/5">Pensioners have received additional winter fuel payments this year that have increased the payments to &pound;250 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;400 for households with someone aged over 80.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.5/6">Furthermore, the Department has also increased the Christmas bonus from &pound;10 to &pound;70 and increased the cold weather payment from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25 this year. This additional support goes to entitled recipients of both pension age and working age and provides direct financial support to help vulnerable groups through the economic downturn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1866W.8/1">The vast majority of winter fuel payments are made automatically based on information held in DWP records, without the need to claim. A small proportion of people whose circumstances we do not know, because they are not on state pension or other benefits administered by DWP, do need to make a claim so that their eligibility can be assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1866W.8/2">For people newly eligible and not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP, for example men aged 60 to 65 who are in work, we can only determine eligibility once they have submitted the relevant information on a claim form. We send claim forms to customers approaching 60 who we have identified as becoming potentially newly eligible from DWP records, but are not at that time in receipt of state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.1866W.8/3">To raise awareness of eligibility of winter fuel payments and, where appropriate, the need to make a claim each year, we run an extensive advertising campaign and series of press releases in regional and national newspapers. We also make reference to winter fuel payments in government leaflets. The claim form is available on the Pension Service website, with full details available on the Direct Gov internet site.</p>
	<p pid="b.1866W.8/4">It is therefore not possible to say how many people may be eligible for a winter fuel payment and are not receiving it. We can only assess eligibility for those people who are in contact with the Department and whose circumstances are known to us.</p>

	<p pid="b.1872W.2/1">In theory the UK can export beef to any country in that the EU-imposed worldwide ban on UK beef exports was lifted in May 2006. In practice re-establishing markets for UK beef in third countries has been difficult due to continued fears over BSE and the need to negotiate market access on a country by country basis. We are working with industry to identify key third country markets so that negotiating resources can be targeted effectively. Other EU countries face similar barriers in trying to export their beef to many third countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1872W.2/2">According to HMRC statistics the UK has exported beef to 103 countries in the last ten calendar years (1999-2008). Countries with imports in excess of &pound;1 million over this period are detailed in table 1 and table 2 as follows. During the period March 1996 to May 2006, UK exports were restricted to small quantities of UK beef exported under the strict criteria in the Data-Based Export Scheme (DBES) and to foreign origin beef re-exported under the Export Approved (XAP) Scheme. It is not possible to identify only beef reared in the UK from the HMRC statistics although non-UK reared beef will only form a small proportion of UK exports after May 2006.</p>

DEFRA provided an additional &pound;27,000 to the National Bee Unit for work related to abnormal colony losses in 2007-08 and, with the Welsh Assembly Government, provided &pound;120,000 in the current year to continue this work.

These are taken as part of the UK statutory surveillance programme checking the appropriate use of veterinary medicinal products in accordance with EU legislation.

Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs also met with Commissioner Vassiliou in September 2008 to discuss our concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1879W.11/2">At the end of 2007 we secured a two year extension to the implementation date of EID until <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December 2009</phrase>. In 2008 we secured important changes to the timetable for the introduction of individual recording on movement documents up until <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-31">31 December 2011</phrase> and lifetime changes for sheep born before the implementation of EID which are moving direct to slaughter. The phasing in of the individual recording requirements will reduce the recording burden on industry, particularly in relation to older animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1879W.11/3">We also facilitated a Commission Mission of EID technical experts to the UK between 2-<phrase class="date" code="2009-02-06">6 February</phrase> to demonstrate the practical problems and challenges our industry face with implementation. We will be working closely with the Commission to see whether there is scope for further flexibility for the way in which we implement the regulation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1900W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, 1 have been asked to reply to your question asking what the estimated percentage of the electorate on the electoral register is in each local authority in the UK ranked in descending order. (260165)</p>
	<p pid="b.1900W.5/4" class="indent">ONS do not have information on the number of people eligible to vote. The closest approximation to the figures you have requested is the number of people who were registered to vote in Local Government elections as a percentage of the estimated resident population aged 18 and over. The table shows this for each Local Authority in the UK in 2007. This is the latest year for which estimates of the usually resident population are available by Local Authority. A copy of the table has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1900W.5/5" class="indent">Care should be taken when interpreting these percentages. There maybe an underestimation in some areas, as not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote. For example foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth are not eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1900W.5/6" class="indent">Conversely, for other areas the percentages may be over estimates and, in some cases, exceed one hundred per cent as figures for the registered electorate may be inflated. People who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses) and electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or died.</p>

	<p pid="b.1904W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the Authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many people were in (a) full-time education and (b) retired from employment in (i) England and (ii) North Yorkshire in each year since 1997. (260046)</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles employment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor, the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS), following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/5" class="indent">Estimates arc provided for the number of working age people (women aged 16-59, men aged 16-64) who state they are full-time students. A full time student is defined as being at school, following a sandwich course or full time at university or college. Estimates are also provided for the number of people retired from employment: this is defined as those who are economically inactive and report their main reason for inactivity as being retired.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/6" class="indent">Table 1 attached shows the number of working age persons in full-time education resident in England and in the North Yorkshire region in each year since 1997. The estimates from 1997 to 2004 are for the 12 month period ending February that year and taken from the annual LFS. Figures for 2005 to 2008 are for the 12 month period ending March that year and taken from the APS. Estimates for July 2007 to June 2008 have also been provided, as the most recent 12 month period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/7" class="indent">Table 2 attached shows the number of people who are retired from employment resident in England and in the North Yorkshire region in each year since 1998. Estimates are provided for the 12 months ending in February from 1998, the earliest period for which estimates are available, to 2004, from the annual LFS, and for the 12 months ending in March from 2005 to 2008, from APS. Estimates for July 2007 to June 2008 have also been provided, as the most recent for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.2/8" class="indent">These estimates are for subset of the population and not for the country as a whole, so they are based on reduced sample sizes. They are therefore subject to larger margins of uncertainty than are national estimates. A guide to the reliability of the estimates is given with the tables.</p>
