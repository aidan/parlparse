	<p pid="b.559W.3/1">No record is kept of the country of origin of fruit and vegetables purchased by the Refreshment Department and so it is not possible to estimate the proportion produced outside the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.559W.3/2">The Refreshment Department stipulates to its suppliers that produce should be grown and cultivated in the EU whenever possible, but it is sometimes necessary to purchase goods originating from the southern hemisphere in order to maintain quality, affordability and availability when produce is out of season in the EU. It is estimated that around 40 of the 300-plus fruit and vegetable items purchased by the Refreshment Department are affected by changes in season and so may at times be sourced from outside the EU. A further 25 lines, including staple crops such as bananas and pineapples, are classified as &quot;exotic&quot; or &quot;tropical&quot; and so are not generally grown in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.559W.6/61">The Refreshment Department is committed to responsibly sourcing fish from well-managed and sustainable fisheries, and is developing firmer procurement policies in this area. Much work has been done over the last year to educate chefs and buyers to better understand the issues and the alternatives and the Marine Stewardship Council's &quot;Good Fish Guide&quot; is used as a reference tool by chefs planning menus. Purchase specifications have been updated to avoid buying fish from overfished stocks. The Department's fish supply contract is due to be re-tendered during 2007-08, and work has already commenced to ensure that sustainability requirements are made more explicit in the contractual specifications.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.0/1">Information is not available in the form requested. However, it is not unusual for an item of expenditure not to be proceeded with if the cost is unacceptable. For example, work which is advertised for tender may come in at a higher price than had been expected. In such circumstances the scope of the work or the project design can be revisited through a &quot;value engineering&quot; exercise. A recent example was an office refurbishment where costs for new furniture were felt to be excessive. After value engineering, a mixture of new furniture and older furniture from stock was used to keep the overall cost acceptable.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.9/1">Typically, 1,549 copies of the daily part of the <i> Official Report </i>and 2,690 copies of the Order Paper are produced overnight for issue in that form. This includes copies produced, on repayment to the printer by the distributor, for sale to customers, which include the House of Lords, Government Departments and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.9/2">From these totals, the House of Commons receives 831 copies of the daily part of the <i> Official Report</i> and 2,405 copies of the Order Paper, the bulk into six Vote Office outlets; and the Parliamentary Bookshop for sale to its customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.9/3">203 copies of the <i> Official Report</i> are distributed immediately to Members by the Vote Office early morning walks service and 70 copies by the printer directly, using Royal Mail postal or Data Post services. A further 42 copies are made available to the Parliamentary Press Gallery and departments of the House. The remaining copies are retained in the Vote Office for the whole of the current and subsequent session of Parliament, as required by the House, for issue on demand over that period to anyone entitled to receive a copy. Typically, at the end on any sitting day, fewer than 100 copies of the edition of a daily <i> Hansard</i> received that day remain to cover the total future stocking requirement. Other than for purposes of management of overall paper stocks within limited storage space, which is infrequent, copies are not disposed of during this time. Any shortfalls during the period are met by reprinting copies using in-house production facilities. At the end of the period any remaining copies are disposed of as waste for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.9/4">269 copies of the Order Paper are distributed immediately to Members by the Vote Office early morning walks system and by post. 400 copies are made available to the Galleries for distribution to visitors. 373 copies are made available to the Parliamentary Press Gallery and Departments of the House. The remaining copies are retained in the Vote Office for issue on demand to anyone entitled to receive a copy. Other than a few record copies, copies of the Order Paper are not retained beyond the day of issue and any remaining are disposed of as waste for recycling. The surplus varies, but typically ranges between fewer than 100 copies and up to 200 copies. The print run is regularly reviewed to ensure any consistent surpluses are minimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.561W.9/5">The total costs of producing the <i> Official Report</i> and the Order Paper are not held in the form requested as the present printing contract pricing structure allows for payments in relation to printing consolidated classes of papers supplied complete. Internal staff, and other costs, are not associated with them or apportioned to individual documents. Historical data on the precise number of copies delivered during a particular period are not retained. The following figures have been derived from printing contract data and information given in previous answers. The total printing expenditure on the daily part of the <i> Official Report</i> for the last three financial years, to the nearest 1,000, the average number of pages per edition and an estimate of per copy price was as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.563W.2/1">The Refreshment Department does not keep a record that specifically identifies purchases of organic produce and so it is not possible to put a value on its expenditure on organic produce over the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.563W.2/2">'Organic produce' is generally taken to refer to fresh produce (meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetables, etc). In general, the Refreshment Department does not tend to specify 'organic' in its fresh food purchasing requirements, having found in the past that suppliers have been unable to maintain consistency and availability in the quantities required. Consequently, organic food purchases are generally restricted to branded items such as sandwiches, salads, yoghurts, biscuits, cakes, etc, or arise from orders for specific events or special promotions. Purchasing specifications are reviewed as and when contracts are re-tendered and may be changed in the future as organic produce becomes more widely available.</p>

	<p pid="b.566W.2/1">Overall estimates of the number of qualified individuals required to produce mandatory energy performance certificates and voluntary home condition reports remain at between 2,500 and 4,500. These are based on industry estimates of productivity and working patterns, together with data on the numbers of homes marketed for sale.</p>
	<p pid="b.566W.2/2">Numbers of qualified home inspectors will be supplemented by those who choose to undertake the Domestic Energy Assessor qualification (DEA), which will allow them to produce the mandatory Energy Performance Certificates within the pack.</p>

	<p pid="b.571W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.3/2">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has received no representations relating to unsolicited mobile telephone text messages. However, the Department of Trade and Industry does receive occasional written correspondence on this issue. It is the Government's aim to have controls that safeguard the consumer but do not hamper the development of the telecommunications market.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.3/3">Unsolicited text (SMS) messages are illegal under statutory controls that were introduced as part of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. Enforcement is undertaken by the Information Commissioner whose office is a wholly independent body, answerable to Parliament directly rather than to Ministers. The Office will investigate complaints and take formal action against those who have wilfully or negligently continued to breach the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.3/4">Industry safeguards require that consumers must be clearly informed by text about what they have subscribed to, the cost, and how to stop the service (a consumer must be able to switch off the service with the universal 'stop' command). All the UK mobile operators have signed up to these safeguards and require content providers using their networks to comply with them. If they do not comply, then the networks will suspend the provider's service for breaching the safeguards thereby blocking the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.571W.3/5">The body that governs premium rate services is the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS). ICSTIS can investigate and fine companies, barring access to services where there is found to be a breach of the regulations. ICSTIS can be contacted at ICSTIS, Freepost WC 5468, London SE1 2BR <a href="http://www.icstis.org.uk">www.icstis.org.uk</a>. Telephone: 0800 500 212 (free call; office hours).</p>

	<p pid="b.574W.8/1">Galileo is a European Union programme and the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) is the EU agency that will regulate and manage the programme on behalf of the EU. The GSA is currently in negotiations with a consortium bidding for the Galileo public private partnership (PPP) contract. It is made up of Aena, Alcatel, EADS, Finmeccanica, Hispasat, Inmarsat, TeleOp and Thales. No decisions have yet been taken on which legal regime will govern the concession contract or which courts will have jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.8/2">Vice-President Barrot recently stated that the overall financial exposure for the public side over the 20-year period of the contract would be around &euro;8 billion. The final cost will not be known until the contract is ready for signature. The public private partnership (PPP) will have a public funding ratio of roughly one-third; the remainder to be provided by a private sector concessionaire.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.8/3">Galileo will not be fully operational until 2011-12. The Council has repeatedly confirmed that it is a civil programme under civil control. The operation of any navigation aid, such as Galileo, can nevertheless have security implications for member states. The UK, along with other member states, therefore sought to ensure that any aspects of the operation of Galileo which affect member states' security can be referred to the Council structures, which will take the necessary decisions by unanimity. The GSA will have operational responsibility for Galileo safety and security matters, although final operational control arrangements within the framework of the GSA have yet to be decided.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.8/4">The GSA is temporarily based in Brussels. 11 member states, of which the UK is one, have bid to host its permanent offices. The deployment of the programme's key equipment is dependent on the outcome of negotiations with the consortium as well as the discussions between the consortium members themselves. It is expected that the HQ of the PPP company will be located in France; the operations company would be in London; Germany and Italy will host the satellite control centres, and an additional safety of life centre and a back-up control centre would be in Spain.</p>

	<p pid="b.575W.2/1">Information on how many accidents were attributed to faults in vehicles sufficient to fail an MOT test is not available. From 2005 information has been collected on contributory factors to reported personal injury road accidents, including vehicle defects. In 2005 2,289 personal injury road accidents reported at the scene by a police officer involved a motorised vehicle that had &quot;vehicle defects&quot; as a contributory factor. The contributory factors reflect the reporting officer's opinion at the time of reporting and are not necessarily the result of extensive investigation. Moreover it is recognised that subsequent inquires could lead to the reporting officer changing his opinion.</p>

This makes transmission direct from Hungary more likely, rather than from wild birds.</p>

	<p pid="b.581W.0/2">There is no simple relationship between the EU's long-term stabilisation goal and the pathways required to get there. The EU has noted that to avoid temperatures rising higher than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, global greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by between 15 and 50 per cent. with reductions in developed countries of between 60 and 80 per cent. The UK's target of a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is consistent with this approach. However, we recognise that we will need to keep this goal under review in the light of emerging scientific evidence and other developments.</p>

It concluded, following a public call for evidence, that over-implementation (including gold-plating) of EU legislation may not be as widespread as is sometimes claimed. The review did investigate three DEFRA areas&mdash;waste, fisheries legislation and the herd register for bovine animals&mdash;where concerns had been raised of potential over-implementation. The review made specific simplification recommendations for DEFRA in these areas which are being delivered through our simplification plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.582W.8/2">The review also made best practice recommendations for the implementation of European legislation which the Government have accepted in full.

	<p pid="b.585W.0/1">DEFRA fully supports the Transformational Government strategy and is taking a leading role in working with the Cabinet Office to deliver website rationalisation. DEFRA is taking a pragmatic approach to this complex process and has already begun to plan its delivery. The initial phase will review content and services of almost 50 websites for convergence on Directgov and Business Link, as outlined in the Transformational Government implementation plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.0/2">DEFRA will be working closely with website stakeholders, including those of the Sustainable Development Commission, to ensure that online resources are delivered in the most appropriate manner in line with the principles of Transformational Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.0/3">The aim is to retain and strengthen the availability and accessibility of the information and services which customers need via a smaller number of high quality websites, including Directgov and Business Link. We anticipate that the number of people benefiting from these services will increase as they become easier to find and use; we will not be closing any sites precipitously.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.0/4">In the case of Climate Challenge, we believe that by making more use of sites like Directgov, which served almost 900,000 unique visitors in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-22">22 January</phrase>, more people will visit and engage with the &quot;Tomorrow's Climate, Today's Challenge&quot; initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.586W.2/1">DEFRA is currently carrying out a review of rabies import policy to ensure that UK controls on all rabies-susceptible mammals are proportionate and sustainable. This will help to inform the UK's response to the European Commission's review of certain requirements of EU Regulation 998/2003 on the non-commercial movement of pet animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.586W.2/2">Regulation 998/2003 requires the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and Council, based on experience gained and risk evaluation. The report must be submitted, together with proposals for the future rabies regime for pets, by February 2007. The UK has already submitted scientific and field information to assist this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.586W.2/3">The UK's own review of national rabies import controls is nearing completion. The evidence received so far from Government vets, officials and veterinary risk assessments indicates that our current controls may no longer be proportionate to the risk of rabies entering the UK and we may need to consider modernising processes and regulation in this area. Our controls must also be consistent with current thinking on better regulation. I am seeking further views before reaching conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="b.588W.2/2">England's waste strategy is also currently being reviewed. In this context, DEFRA is considering the full range of tools that could encourage producers and consumers to change their behaviour regarding waste and recycling in general.

	<p pid="b.588W.2/3">Getting people to change their behaviour is a challenge, and recycling is no exception. While there are millions of dedicated recyclers, there are still too many families and people who are not engaging with local waste reduction, recycling and composting schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.588W.5/1">Although rateable values provide a reasonable basis for charging in many cases, it is not an infallible system and anomalies can arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/2">The Government commissioned and published research into alternative methods of unmeasured charging, including the use of council tax bands, as part of a review of water charging in 1998-99. This showed that switching to alternative water charging systems would be beneficial for some, but not the majority of customers. Many of those least able to afford it&mdash;notably those with the lowest rateable value properties&mdash;would be adversely affected if they were charged on this basis. DEFRA officials are currently working with water companies and Ofwat to update this research.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/3">It is essential that any proposals for new charging arrangements provide adequate transitional arrangements to protect such customers. Despite wide consultation and investigation, no wholly satisfactory new schemes have been proposed to date. Water charges relating to council tax bands have not been proposed or implemented for these reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/4">Water companies are free to bring forward proposals for alternative unmeasured charging arrangements for Ofwat, the water industry's economic regulator, to consider. Ofwat would have to consult the Secretary of State before approving the widespread introduction of new unmetered charging arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.588W.5/5">Ofwat allows companies to apply a notional rateable value or an assessed charge where properties have been merged or substantially altered, and this has invalidated the original rateable value of the property. Further details on assessed charges are set out in Ofwat's report 'Water and sewerage charges 2006-07'.</p>

	<p pid="b.592W.5/1">The answer is provided in the following table. Tax thresholds are the point at which income exceeds personal allowances. The additional tax relief that is available for older pensioner married or civil partner couples reduces the tax liability of the spouse or civil partner who claims it. The amount depends on the age of the older partner and income of the claimant.</p>

Once the organs or tissue can be released, a liaison officer will contact the family to arrange for the return or disposal of the retained material.</p>

We have proven processes in place to deliver changes to military capabilities, whether through regular conduct of force level reviews (FLR) or through the urgent operational requirements (UOR) process. Following an FLR in early summer, I announced an uplift to helicopter flying hours in Afghanistan and the deployment of two additional Chinook helicopters. Since then, commanders on the ground have made clear that they have sufficient helicopter assets to conduct operations, and no additional helicopters will be deployed as part of the roulement.</p>
	<p pid="b.600W.3/2">There will be minor increases to armoured vehicle numbers and artillery light guns as part of the 12 Mechanised Brigade roulement. We are also delivering significant enhancements to the protected mobility equipment available through the UOR process. This includes the forthcoming deployment of Mastiff, which is a well-protected, wheeled patrol vehicle with a less intimidating profile than our tracked vehicles. We are rapidly procuring 108 of these vehicles for use in both Iraq and Afghanistan. We are also deploying 100 Vector, our new Pinzgauer-based protected patrol vehicle, for Afghanistan, on top of the 62 already on contract. Vector provides better protection and increased mobility and capacity compared with the protected Land Rover known as Snatch. This makes it very suitable for the rugged terrain and long patrol distances in Afghanistan. Vector and Mastiff are not specifically part of the roulement, but will be delivered to theatre from February and March 2007 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.605W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence does not allocate in advance funds to Combat Stress. The Department meets individual costs relating to war pensioners who undergo 'remedial treatment' at one of the two Combat Stress homes in England for conditions related to their individual war pensioned disablement. The overall amount of funding is therefore driven by the number of war pensioners who receive treatment and the length of each stay, as well as the rate of the daily fee. Separate payment is provided from the Scottish Health Board for treatment of war pensioners at Hollybush House. The Ministry of Defence also meets the cost of related expenses such as travel expenses on an individual basis, including to Hollybush House.</p>

It would be our intention to build the new SSBNs in the UK. But this is dependent on proposals from industry that provide the right capability at the right time and offer value for money. Progress towards industrial consolidation and a sustainable industrial base will be an important ingredient. The current industrial structure limits the scope for system-level competition in the UK. Therefore the key to successful procurement in the UK would be to work closely with industry right down the supply chain to put in place effective contractual arrangements that run through the life of the platform.</p>

	<p pid="b.610W.5/1">We anticipate fewer parents with care will apply to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission as a result of removing the requirement that all parents with care claiming benefits be treated as applying for child maintenance. In most cases this will be where parents with care are able to make private arrangements for child maintenance, so maintenance will continue to flow, or where no maintenance would have flowed anyway, for example, where the parent with care does not have enough information about the non-resident parent for a calculation to be made in a case.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.5/2">New information and guidance measures and a higher disregard of maintenance in benefits should ensure that where parents with care will benefit from maintenance payments, they seek maintenance through one of the routes available. Tougher enforcement measures available to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will ensure that non-resident parents fulfil their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions operates a discretionary, non-statutory scheme providing financial redress for maladministration. The scheme is operated by the Department's executive agencies and detailed reasons for payment in individual cases are not recorded centrally. The general categories of payment and sums authorised during 2005-06 are in the following table:</p>

Loss of statutory entitlement may occur where an individual has lost a benefit, pension or allowance as a result of official error such as the provision of wrong or misleading advice by an official.<br/> 3. Payments in respect of actual financial loss are made to recompense individuals who have suffered some financial loss or incurred expenses as a direct result of maladministration.<br/> 4. Payments of compensation for delay are made in the form of interest and are intended to restore the value of payments that have been excessively or unreasonably delayed as a result of maladministration. The figure displayed in the table includes &pound;5.8 million paid by the Pension Service. This followed a special exercise to identify cases where extra benefit in the form of carer and severe disability premiums could be made.<br/> 5. Consolatory payments are made where individuals have suffered gross inconvenience, gross embarrassment, or severe distress in consequence of maladministration.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.614W.12/1">The Department for Trade and Industry has overall responsibility for digital inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.12/2">This Department has responsibility for disability discrimination policy. Under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), a disabled person may be able to take legal action if they are unable to access goods or services because of their impairment. DWP has taken action to raise awareness of the DDA, most recently through the &quot;Adjusting for Better Business&quot; campaign, which ran from December 2005 to November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.12/3">DWP is also the sponsoring body for the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). The DRC published the findings of its formal investigation into the issues that disabled people face when using websites in 2004. In March 2006, the Minister for Disabled People spoke at the launch of PAS (Publicly Available Specification) 78, developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the DRC. PAS78 is a set of guidelines on how to make websites more user-friendly for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.12/4">DWP is committed to improving the accessibility of its own websites. All its sites are working towards complying with the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (W3C WCAG) at level AA, in line with Cabinet Office guidance. Guidelines have been developed for site managers, and a testing and improvement programme is now in place. In a recent audit, 45 per cent. of DWP's information sites passed automated checks for level AA.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.12/5">All of DWP's information for disabled people is now published through Directgov's Disabled People section, which helps to ensure that disabled people with a wide variety of impairments are able to find and access information easily. This section of the site is promoted through a variety of means, including search-engine marketing activities, links with many other disability-related organisations and attendance at relevant events and exhibitions. Directgov complies with WAI level AA.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.5/1">My Department held a number of meetings with disability organisations and others during negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of Disabled People. These informed the UK's negotiating stance and helped raise awareness of the Convention among disabled people. In addition, my Department finances the maintenance of a website run by an independent disability and human rights expert which is designed to provide information for disabled Britons about the Convention. Other opportunities have been taken to promote awareness of the Convention, for example, a joint event with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. The cost of these activities is not readily available. Decisions about future promotional activities, and related costs, have yet to be taken. The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December 2006</phrase>. The UK supports it wholeheartedly and hopes to be among the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention.</p>

	<p pid="b.622W.3/1">The Government of Zimbabwe are well aware of our views on their treatment of farmers and farm workers irrespective of the colour of their skin or ethnic background. Their disastrous economic policies have caused massive internal displacement of farm workers and their families. They have undermined food security, eroded agricultural exports and crippled the Zimbabwean economy. In all our contacts with the Government, we underline the need for real reform to reverse the tragedy which is currently unfolding in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/2">The Government of Zimbabwe are also fully aware of our views on the use of violence to break up peaceful protests. The excessive force used to disperse lawful demonstrations and rallies over the last week is a case in point. We strongly condemn the actions of the Zimbabwean police, and call on the Zimbabwean authorities to undertake a full and fair investigation of the events.</p>

	<p pid="b.630W.2/1">Addressing the increased risks of violent or sexual crime faced by those involved in prostitution in is a key element of the Government's co-ordinated prostitution strategy. Following the publication of the strategy, the Home Office has taken a number of steps to contribute to keeping women safe. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/2" class="indent">the 'Ugly Mugs' Campaign. This joint initiative with Crimestoppers sends out a clear message that violence against those involved in prostitution is a crime and will not be tolerated. It encourages the reporting of such crimes via Crimestoppers and the sharing of information between the police and local support projects so that women are made aware of 'dodgy punters' as quickly as possible;</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/3" class="indent">funding personal safety training. This safety training, developed and delivered by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, is tailored specifically to the needs of women involved in street-based prostitution and has been made available through specialist support projects across the country;</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/4" class="indent">encouraging the development of links between Sexual Assault Referral Centres and specialist projects in their areas to encourage women in prostitution to use them if they are the victims of crime;</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/5" class="indent">funding, through the Home Office Victims Fund, a new post in the specialist project in Doncaster to develop an advocacy role to support women who may be victims of crime. This will be used as the basis for the development of guidance on advocacy services which will be made available to all specialist projects;</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.2/6" class="indent">the development of training modules for the police to provide guidance on appropriate responses to crime against those involved in street prostitution and increased partnership between the police and specialist projects.</p>

	<p pid="b.632W.0/1">To develop guidance on termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) held a workshop in May 2005 to seek professional advice on areas and issues to be included in the guidelines. From this workshop, a working group was established to produce the draft guidelines. This group met in December 2005. Representatives were drawn from a wide range of professional and specialist backgrounds including nursing and midwifery, obstetrics and gynaecology, public health, psychiatry, clinical genetics, family planning doctors and general practitioners. The draft guidance produced by the group has been legally scrutinised by Senior Counsel on behalf of the Department.

	<p pid="b.637W.9/1">The Government are keen to promote responsible lending as part of their strategy to minimise over-indebtedness. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 introduces a number of provisions that should encourage responsible lending. The Act will enable consumers to challenge unfair credit relationships and it makes specific provision for the Office of Fair Trading to take into account evidence of irresponsible lending in determining fitness to hold a consumer credit licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.9/2">It is important that lenders take proper account of an individual's credit history in taking decisions on whether to make further loans. We are currently exploring whether the opening up of information on accounts where lenders do not have the customer's express permission to share the data would help responsible lending. We are in the process of analysing the responses to a consultation on this and will report back shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.9/3">In addition, the industry's own codes of practice include provisions on responsible lending. The Banking Code is currently under review and I have made it clear to the independent reviewer that I would like to see these provisions strengthened.</p>

The Government have no plans to end these derogations and there is no end date set out in Directive 80/181/EEC.

	<p pid="b.642W.5/1">As the International Energy Agency notes in its 2005 publication, &quot;Resources to Reserves&mdash;Oil and Gas Technologies for the Energy Markets of the Future&quot;, the key problem is not the limit of geological oil resources. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The hydrocarbon resources around the world are sufficiently abundant to sustain likely growth in the global energy system for the foreseeable future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/3">Rather, the challenge lies in bringing these resources to market in a way that ensures sustainable, timely, reliable, and affordable supplies of energy. While market mechanisms will help provide the incentives for the development of these resources, as well as low carbon technologies, Governments need to take appropriate action&mdash;internationally and domestically&mdash;in support of this, and also to promote energy efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="b.648W.5/1">Carbon emitted due to the Department's use of energy in its buildings has been calculated since 1999-2000. In 2005-06 the total emissions from our London administrative estate were 1,808,162 kgC (this figure has been weather corrected). Since April 2006 all central Government official and ministerial air travel has been brought within offsetting schemes. In 2006 the Department's CO2 emissions from air travel amounted to 1,287,017 kgC. At present estimates the cost of offsetting these emissions will be about &pound;13,000.</p>

These targets are designed to deliver a step change sustainability improvement in the way Government manage their land and buildings, and to demonstrate that Government should lead by example on tackling dangerous climate change. We already purchase 100 per cent. of our energy from renewable sources, and are currently working with the Carbon Trust and others to minimise our overall energy use. We are also taking measures (such as video conferencing) to encourage staff to reduce their travel. Carbon emissions from unavoidable energy consumption will be offset from 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.648W.5/3">These emission figures relate only to the Department's main London estate. The Department also occupies a building in Leeds, where the major occupier is Department of Work and Pensions, and another building in London where the major occupier is HM Revenue and Customs. In both these buildings the cost of utilities such as gas, electricity and water are included in the rental, and we do not have details of the actual consumption incurred in those parts of the building occupied by departmental staff. Where we do not have direct control over utilities we nevertheless do whatever we can, such as by encouraging our staff to save energy, to reduce the overall CO2 emissions from these buildings.</p>

	<p pid="b.652W.2/1">The number of older people, particularly those aged over 85, is expected to rise sharply over coming years with significant implications for public services, such as long-term care for the elderly. Recent reports from Derek Wanless for the King's Fund, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and others have made important contributions to the debate around the future of social care provision, which will also be informed by individual budgets, partnerships for older people projects, direct payments and the In Control programme. In assessing proposals, as part of the long term vision of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government will consider whether they are affordable, whether they are consistent with progressive universalism and whether they promote independence, dignity, well-being and control in line with &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;, the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; and the national service framework for older people.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.2/2">The Department commissioned the personal social services research unit (PSSRU) at the London School of Economics to produce projections of demand for long-term care for older people. Their latest projections are set out in PSSRU Research Summary 35 which is available at <a href="http://www.pssru.ac.uk">www.pssru.ac.uk</a>, and in the Wanless social care report.</p>

In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety and clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>

	<p pid="b.656W.5/1">&pound;125 million was invested in audiology services between 2000-01 and 2004-05 through the modernising hearing aid services programme. In 2005-06 &pound;12 million revenue and &pound;26 million capital was allocated to national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) for audiology services as part of the general allocations.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.5/2">In 2006-07 revenue allocations for audiology services were included in the strategic health authority (SHA) bundle. The Department allocated approximately &pound;5.5 billion to SHAs as a single bundle of budgets, with the aim being to give SHAs as much flexibility as possible in the management of funding and delivery of services. It was the responsibility of individual SHAs to decide, in consultation with local stakeholders, how best to deploy the funding. &quot;The NHS in England: Operating Framework for 2007-08&quot; confirmed that there will be another SHA bundle of central revenue budgets for 2007-08 with a proposed value is &pound;6,945.8 million. The bundle will be supplemented by a service level agreement between the Department and SHAs. This agreement will include details of the services to be provided from the bundle. Decisions about funding levels for audiology services will need to be taken locally, with consideration given to the need to have sufficient direct access activity to substantially reduce waits.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.5/3">In 2006-07 &pound;26 million capital was allocated to NHS trusts and PCTs for their audiology services. A new capital regime has been put in place from 2007-08 under which NHS trusts can draw down as much capital as they can afford to service, rather than having it allocated to them. The new guidance for trusts, &quot;New Capital Regime for NHS Trusts&quot; was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December 2006</phrase>. PCTs capital allocation arrangements remain unchanged in 2007-08 with a significant increase in the resources that are allocated formulaically for investment by the sector. This increase in resources to PCTs has removed the need to allocate additional capital specifically for many initiatives, including audiology.</p>
	<p pid="b.656W.5/4">The modernisation of audiology services through the modernising hearing aid service programme required the NHS to purchase new packages of equipment to carry out the assessment and fitting of digital hearing aids. Digital hearing aids were funded from capital allocations on the basis that they were part of these packages of equipment that was classified as capital assets.</p>

	<p pid="b.657W.0/1">There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that performance and responsiveness has improved across the national health service foundation trust (NHSFT) sector. Independent case studies and assessments presented by the Foundation Trust Network Monitor (the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) and the Healthcare Commission (the statutory name of which is the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection) show that operational freedoms are allowing NHSFTs to meet the aspirations of service users by improving services, and in some cases innovating new approaches to patient care more quickly than as an NHS trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.0/2">The 58 NHSFTs now in existence are operating to a new framework which improves local accountability more than ever before. They have over 620,000 members drawn from the public, patients and staff and approximately 1000 patient and public governors. The numbers involved and degree of engagement suggests that NHSFTs are taking their local accountability obligations seriously and engaging effectively with members and governors. As organisations continue to mature and increase in numbers, we can expect membership and the role of governors to become firmly embedded in NHSFTs. Monitor's published quarterly assessments confirm that NHSFTs are delivering a good financial performance and demonstrating financial rigour. The Healthcare Commission's annual healthcheck which compares performance of all NHS organisations also showed that NHSFTs out-performed non-NHSFTs on use of resources and quality of services.</p>

	<p pid="b.662W.2/1">We have made substantial progress in delivering our programme to transform early years and child care services outlined in the 10-year child care strategy: &quot;Choice for Parents, the Best Start for Children&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/2">We are ahead of schedule on meeting, by 2010, the strategy's centrepiece commitments to establish a multi-agency Sure Start children's centre for every community, and ensure that every primary and secondary school is an extended school, offering access to a range of enriching and high quality out of school hours activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/3">There are now over 1,060 children's centres in the most disadvantaged areas, serving around 850,000 children. More than 3,800 schools (one in six of the total) are now providing access to the full extended services core offer (including child care), and we exceeded our target of 2,500 schools doing so by September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/4">We are also doing more than ever before to make good quality child care and early education accessible and affordable. The number of registered child care places across the country continues to rise. We have already met our child care places growth PSA target for 2008; and delivered on our commitments to increase the free nursery education entitlement to 38 hours per week from 2006; and to extend the tax credit support for child care costs (now running at around &pound;2 million per day), by increasing the limits, from 2005, and the proportion of costs that can be claimed, from 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/5">We have also legislated to take forward, and give statutory force to, key elements of the strategy. The Childcare Act 2006&mdash;the first legislation to be devoted to early years and child care&mdash;includes new duties, operational from 2008, to improve the outcomes of all children under five, close the gaps between groups with the poorest outcomes and other children; and to secure sufficient child care for working parents, or those looking to move into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/6">The Act also reforms and simplifies the regulatory framework for early years and child care, including establishing a new single framework for learning and development for children under five&mdash;the early years foundation stage&mdash;which will be introduced from 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.662W.2/7">The Work and Families Act 2006 includes new measures to extend maternity pay from six to nine months from 2007, and a power to introduce additional paternity leave for fathers.</p>

	<p pid="b.678W.0/1">Since 2001, over 1.9 million learners have improved their English language skills on courses funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) through the Skills for Life Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/2">Data on Further Education learners are gathered for the LSC through the Individualised Learner Record. Data is therefore a matter for the LSC and Mark Haysom, the Chief Executive has written to my hon. Friend explaining the more detailed arrangements and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom:</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary question regarding the proportion of students enrolled on to Skills for Life English for Speakers of other Language (ESOL) programmes that are learners from the European Union, asylum seekers and economic immigrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/5" class="indent">Date is gathered through the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). Its primary function is to capture learner suitability to a learning aim and ensure correct payment to the provider of learning, as such there are limitations as to what information we collect and are able to report on.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/6" class="indent">Current Skills for Life (SfL) policy means that when a learner has an identified SfL learning need this is the reason for fee remission and so no other reason is looked for or recorded on the ILR, for example whether they are an asylum seeker. Therefore we do not record whether a learner is an asylum seeker as the main reason for receiving funding is the fact that they have an identified SfL learning need. Therefore we are unable to identify asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/7" class="indent">As regards economic immigrants we do not ask the purpose for which non-nationals are living and working in the UK and so are unable to say how many of our learners come here as economic immigrants.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/8" class="indent">Within the ILR there is a field that records 'country of domicile'. This records the learner's normal country of residence, however, this is often recorded as England as this is where the learners are currently normally residing.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/9" class="indent">Analysis of data was undertaken for ESOL enrolments in 2004/05 which looked at the proportion of ESOL enrolments by country of domicile, in 3 broad categories, and these stood at:</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/10" class="indent">4 per cent. for new EU accession states</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/11" class="indent">90 per cent. for England</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/12" class="indent">6 per cent. for rest of the world</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.0/13" class="indent">Whilst this shows the majority as having the country of domicile as that of England we believe that this is not the full picture and many of these learners whilst currently living in the UK have originated elsewhere. There is no field on the ILR designed to capture this migration movement.</p>

	<p pid="b.692W.6/1">Fire Safety in schools is covered by Part B of the Building Regulations. Additional guidance can be found in DfES Managing School Facilities Guide 6 &quot;Fire Safety&quot;. DfES will be publishing a new Building Bulletin 100 &quot;Designing and managing against the risk of fire in schools&quot; later this year. This will include extensive guidance on sprinklers.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.6/2">DfES will also shortly be publishing a report on the costs of sprinkler systems in schools, a risk assessment tool, and a cost benefit analysis tool which are all intended to help Building Schools for the Future programme managers decide when to install sprinkler systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.6/3">Schools being aware of risks and managing them appropriately is the key to cutting insurance costs. To help schools manage their risks more effectively DfES is working with local authorities and insurers with the aim of reducing the number of incidents to property and people in schools. A new risk management strategy is being piloted to include a diagnostic risk ranking tool to allow local authorities to assess levels of risk in individual schools and a web based risk management toolkit to provide advice for schools on improving their risks. Both will be available shortly. More information is available at: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/vfm/">www.dfes.gov.uk/vfm/</a></p>

	<p pid="b.693W.11/1">We asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) to review the secondary curriculum with the aim of raising standards (particularly in English and mathematics); reducing prescription; and promoting innovative, whole-school curriculum planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/2">All of the compulsory subjects will remain in the new curriculum but there will be a reduction in the level of prescribed subject detail and a sharper focus on the essential concepts and skills offered by the subject disciplines. By removing overlap and highlighting connections between the subjects, the new curriculum will create time for teachers to personalise their teaching, allowing them to offer catch up lessons where needed, and to create opportunities for pupils to deepen and extend their learning in areas where they have particular interests and aptitudes.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/3">Key elements of curriculum content that have stood the test of time will remain but there will be more emphasis on using the curriculum as a whole to develop those personal attributes and life skills which young people will need at work and in their own lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/4">The common format of the new programmes of study will make it easier for schools to make connections between the subjects and to look for ways to make the curriculum more coherent for pupils. Cross-curricular themes such as diversity and creativity have been drawn out and case studies and guidance are offered on a range of additional curriculum opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/5">The new secondary curriculum will draw together the various strands of the existing personal development curriculum under the heading of Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHEE), which will cover both personal and economic well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/6">At Key Stage 4 specific changes have been made to address progression from Key Stage 3 and the introduction of functional skills in English, mathematics and ICT. The new secondary curriculum will be accompanied by guidance for teachers which will help them track the progress of their pupils, focusing on how well they have grasped the key concepts and skills in each curriculum subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.11/7">Minor changes to the level descriptions&mdash;the benchmarks for pupil achievement nationally&mdash;have been made where required.</p>
