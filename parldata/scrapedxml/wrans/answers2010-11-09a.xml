	<p pid="a.190W.2/1">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (for Scotland) are the designated authorities in the UK responsible for processing European arrest warrants (EAWs). Extraditions under the EAW process are known as 'surrenders'.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/2">The following tables show the total numbers of people <i> (a)</i> surrendered from the UK (excluding Scotland) and <i> (b)</i> surrendered to the UK (including Scotland) since 2004. It has not been possible to break these data down by member state prior to April 2009 as this would involve a manual examination of all SOCA case records for that period, which would incur disproportionate cost. In April 2009 SOCA introduced a new IT system and the number of surrenders has been broken down by member state for the financial year 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.2/3">It is not possible to answer questions 15106 and 15107. SOCA's involvement in an EAW case ceases at the point of surrender, and SOCA is not informed of the outcome of any subsequent criminal proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="a.195W.2/2"><i> </i>Officials in the Home Office reviewed the report at the time of its publication in 2008 and noted that poor mental capacity or well-being could have serious ramifications for criminal behaviour, although causal linkages are not necessarily established. However, many of the solutions lie outside the Home Office remit and we will continue to work with other Government Departments in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.195W.2/3">When developing policy we consider psychological research. For example in considering drug policy, the mental health of substance misusers, in particular young people, is particularly relevant. We seek expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to inform our policy development of the latest psychological and mental health research and we include the impact upon victims when estimating the costs of crime and of terrorist incidents. These estimates are used within the Department and more widely as inputs into policy appraisal and evaluation (for instance, in impact assessments for new policy proposals and in business cases for procurement projects).</p>

	<p pid="a.200W.5/2">Airlines have a legal obligation to carry passengers being removed from the UK under the 1971 Immigration Act. This includes cases where the airline has been identified as the inbound carrier and cases where removal is to be carried out at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.200W.5/3">Historically, almost all airlines will have refused to carry an individual on the basis of highly disruptive behaviour and/or violence prior to take off. The captain of the aircraft has authority to take that decision under the Tokyo Convention. It is not possible therefore to provide an exhaustive list given the volume of enforced removals effected by UK Border Agency (UKBA) (19,570 during 2009). In cases where an individual is offloaded, UKBA will work with the airline to rearrange the removal, including looking at alternative carriers, additional escorts, or the use of charters.</p>

	<p pid="a.208W.6/1">Compensation awards are recorded by the Tribunal Service for the discrimination and unfair dismissal jurisdictions. For other types of claims any award by the Employment Tribunal will be a statutory entitlement, such as a redundancy payment or unpaid paid wages, rather than an award of compensation. Table 1 shows the compensation awards of which the Tribunal is aware for the financial years 2007-08 to 2009-10.</p>

In 2009-10, the median award across all jurisdictions for which the Tribunals Service collates data was &#163;5,056.</p>

We have decided that the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) and the Judicial Appointments and Conduct Ombudsman will remain in place as valued independent bodies, which do much to bring openness to the way candidates are selected for judicial appointments.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/2">However, it is clear that at times the appointments process can take too long and cost too much. The first duty of the Commission is to maintain the high quality of Judicial appointments but I believe that the JAC should also focus on delivering efficiency in the selection of judges, working with the judiciary and the unified Courts and Tribunals Service. The recruitment of the new Chair of the JAC is underway and, with the Lord Chief Justice, I look forward to working with the Commission on more detailed proposals for improving the appointments process, in the first instance within the existing statutory framework. Any subsequent proposals requiring legislation would be brought forward in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="a.221W.2/1">The estimated cost to the House of administering and processing early-day motions (EDMs) in financial year 2009-10 was approximately &#163;1 million. Figures for the previous year are not readily available but there is no reason to suppose that they were significantly different in real terms, other than that the number of EDMs tabled may be higher in a longer session.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.2/2">Most of this cost was accounted for by printing and publication of early-day motions, amendments to them, and names added to them, under the House's contract with TSO. This cost nearly &#163;776,000 in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.2/3">Expenditure is incurred on staff time to process and input notices relating to early-day motions, and to index that material. Staff who deal with EDMs also undertake other duties, but a rough estimate of the full salary costs incurred from the estimated amount of their time spent on EDMs, including employer's pension contribution and national insurance, is of the order of &#163;150,000 for 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.2/4">In addition, technical support for the EDMi database and the Table Office's software application for processing EDMs cost approximately &#163;87,000 in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.223W.5/2">Tickets are protected by the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act of 2006, which makes any unauthorised sale of London 2012 tickets in a public place, in the course of a business, or for profit a criminal act. LOCOG works very closely with the Metropolitan police unit charged with working to prevent ticket fraud. A dedicated Metropolitan police team from the Specialist Crime Directorate-Operation Podium-has been working with key Olympic stakeholders to profile the risks, share intelligence and build in prevention measures associated with ticketing fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.223W.5/3">Through the launch of its 'Sign Up' campaign, LOCOG is educating the public on where the official outlets for tickets are-in the UK, tickets will only be available through LOCOG, its partner Thomas Cook and prestige ticketing suppliers. Outside of the UK, tickets will only be available for purchase through each National Olympic Committee's appointed ticket agent. LOCOG now owns significant numbers of online domain names, and where other sites claim to sell tickets LOCOG takes action, including reporting them to the police. It will be illegal to sell tickets on auction websites.</p>

LOCOG has also announced special pricing arrangements for seniors, a &quot;Pay Your Age&quot; scheme at nearly a third of all sessions for those 16 or under, and &quot;Ticketshare&quot;, a scheme where 100,000 tickets have been paid for by those buying prestige hospitality tickets which will be distributed to school children via schools registered as part of the London 2012 Get Set Network. Tickets for events in London will also include a travel card, zones 1-6 on the day of the event.

We will continue to look for opportunities to remind the Iraqi authorities that any prisoners detained without charge should be dealt with by due process and, should be treated in line with internationally accepted standards regarding fair trials and prisoners' rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.233W.5/2">The Foresight Report recognises the important role employers have to play in promoting the mental well-being of those in their care. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) already has in place many of the initiatives highlighted in the report. These include a health care scheme for staff and families posted overseas, an in-house welfare and occupational health service, access to a confidential Employee Assistance Programme, a stress management framework, based on the Health and Safety Executive's management standards and a regular programme of health promotion activities. The FCO regularly reviews its policies towards mental well-being in the light of operational experience and the prevailing academic research. Additional support is offered to staff serving in high threat posts (Iraq, Afghanistan), and to those who have been involved in traumatic incidents while serving overseas.</p>

	<p pid="a.234W.0/1">The UK remains deeply concerned by North Korea's illicit nuclear weapons programme, which we regard as a threat to regional and international security. We strongly support the tough sanctions imposed by UN Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874. These are targeted to limit North Korea's proliferation activities, and we continue to work closely with international partners to ensure that these measures are robustly implemented. We hope that the Six-Party Talks process, which we view as the most realistic mechanism for making progress towards denuclearisation, recommences soon. In the meantime, we urge North Korea to refrain from any further provocative actions.</p>

Public support for the smokefree law is high and continues to grow. Even a majority of smokers now support the law. We will keep working on the evidence base for tobacco control and will say more about our plans in the public health white paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.2/2">There are significant health inequalities associated with having a mental illness. 70%, of those resident in mental health units smoke compared to 21%, of the general population. Statistics show that the desire to stop smoking is as strong in those with mental illnesses as it is in those who do not. People with severe mental illness die on average 20 years sooner than the average and the majority of these deaths are smoking related. It is right that the incidence of smoking related early death is addressed across the population regardless of race, religion, social status, physical or mental health.</p>

	<p pid="a.241W.5/3">Food labelling rules are agreed at European Union level and prohibit false or misleading labelling. Labelling rules require that certain meat products that resemble a cut or slice of meat must mention in the name of the food any ingredients which originate from a different species to the rest of the meat.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.5/4">Local authorities ensure that food on sale in the UK complies with these labelling rules. Sampling is routinely carried by local authorities to check for added water and added protein in chicken. Where there is evidence of non-compliance in this respect, enforcement action is taken. The local authorities carry out enforcement action according to the statutory Food Law Code of Practice; this ensures that local authority practice across the UK is consistent with UK / EU food law.</p>
	<p pid="a.241W.5/5">The Government's Food Authenticity research programme develops analytical methods for food enforcement laboratories to help combat misleading labelling and food fraud. The programme is currently working with partners in Europe and the United States of America to produce a method to reliably detect undeclared pork and beef proteins used to retain added water in chicken products. The Commission is aware and supportive of this collaborative project.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.3/1">The impact of the spending review settlement on future staffing levels and the position on the need for any redundancies is complex. While the Department's core budget will be reduced by 26% in real terms over the four years to 2014-15 the Department will receive substantial extra resources to deliver a range of new measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.3/2">This position is likely to result in staffing being reduced in some areas of the Department and increased in others, and at different rates. More detailed work will now be undertaken to allocate the overall settlement to the different parts of our business and assess the resulting staffing levels. This detailed planning will need to take account of likely staff turnover rates and the potential for internal and external redeployment before assessing the need for any redundancies in the Department and its non-departmental public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.3/3">All pressures on the Department's budgets were taken into account as part of the spending review and settlements were allocated accordingly. The full costs of any redundancies, should these be unavoidable, will be met from within the Department's departmental expenditure limit (DEL) settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.257W.2/1">The Budget announced that from 2013-14 we would reform disability living allowance by introducing a new, more objective assessment to ensure support is focused on those with greatest need and distributed on a consistent, transparent basis, while continuing to tackle the inequalities that can arise from severe disability.

Local authority contracts with care homes should cover services to meet all a resident's assessed needs, including any assessed mobility needs, so an individual's care support and mobility needs should be met by residential care providers from social care funding. This measure will remove an overlap of public funds while ensuring that resources continue to be targeted at disabled people with the greatest needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.5/1">Lord Young's report to the Prime Minister of the operation of health and safety laws and the growth of the compensation culture includes recommendations aimed at low hazard business. It points to offices, shops and classrooms as examples of workplaces which can be of lower risk on the basis that the risk of injury or death is minimal.

	<p pid="a.260W.5/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has developed guidance and example risk assessments primarily aimed at lower risk businesses. HSE has been guided by the definition of risk as a concept embodying a combination of likelihood and consequence.

	<p pid="a.261W.0/1">The expertise and vision of the Foresight report has informed our approach to health and work. The relationship between health, work and well-being is right at the heart of the welfare reforms we are implementing, which is why we have designed the new Work Programme to allow employment support providers to tailor help to individual needs, and foster self efficacy and mental capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.0/2">Because promoting and protecting well-being goes beyond the remit of one Department, DWP also contributes to a cross-Government programme of action to promote well-being and improve health at work. It is in all of our interests to stop people falling out of work and onto benefits through ill health. Failure to act results in heavy costs to individuals, employers, the economy and society and can contribute to working-age ill health, avoidable sickness absence and job loss through ill health.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.0/3">As announced in the June Budget, the Cabinet Office and ONS are taking work on measuring societal well-being forward-in particular regarding the lessons for the UK from the Stiglitz, Sen and Fenoussi report. We have in the past supported the use of subjective well-being measures in research on deprivation and its impact on individual. The DWP is working closely with other Departments on exploring how to take account of subjective well-being in specific policy interventions and measuring overall economic performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.6/1">The Department's new joint strategy with HMRC for tackling welfare fraud and error contains a wide range of measures to: prevent fraud and error from entering the system in the first place; detect and correct mistakes where they do happen; deliver tough punishments for those who defraud the system; and deter those who would try to abuse the system in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.6/2">With regard to factors other than previous convictions for fraud which could identify cases at risk of being fraudulent or in error, we will develop these through analysis of common characteristics in past fraud and error cases alongside application of the most effective risk profiling techniques used within and outside Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.5/1">Information to answer the full request is not available. The Department offers a range of contracted employment provision to support jobseekers in finding employment. It is not possible to identify participants on all of the contracted provision offered by the Department due to the wide range of support available and the ways in which starts to these programmes have been recorded. However, we can identify individuals who have been recorded by DWP computer systems as participating on contracted provision offered through the following schemes: New Deal for Young People, New Deal for the Long Term Unemployed, Private Sector-Led New Deal, Employment Zones, Flexible New Deal, Programme Centres, Jobcentre Plus Support Contracts, Backing Young Britain, Young Person's Guarantee and the 6 month offer. These represent the majority of provision aimed specifically at jobseekers.</p>

However, the independent Capital Review team is working with building companies on a pilot proposal to rebuild Campsmount Technology College in Doncaster. There is a good prospect that the new school could be rebuilt ahead of the original schedule as the accelerated procurement timetable has been met, and cost savings are being identified by the private sector through the bidding process.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.5/1">Inspection is most effective where it is sharply focused on core issues and targeted at the schools, colleges and other children's services in most need of improvement. We intend, through our reforms, to reduce inspection related burdens and enhance the contribution that inspection makes to accountability and improvement. In terms of school inspection, we plan to streamline and re-focus arrangements around the core areas of achievement; teaching; leadership; and behaviour and safety, and free up outstanding schools from routine inspection. We have already signalled that the self-evaluation form, which presents a significant administrative burden on schools, will be removed from the end of this academic year. Further details on this programme of reform will be provided in the forthcoming Education White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.281W.5/1">Maintained schools and local authorities are free to choose the food products they buy and from where they purchase them, so long as the meals provided comply with the statutory school food standards for healthy food and they comply with procurement regulations. Schools and local authorities have been provided with advice about efficient, sustainable food procurement practices that use seasonal produce but such purchasing decisions will continue to be taken locally and should take account of sustainability issues, best quality and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.5/2">The coalition Government are committed to developing Government Buying Standards (GBS) for the public procurement of food and food services, which will mean that Government Departments will have to buy food that meets minimum sustainability standards. The standards will reflect the Government's overarching commitment to procure food that meets British or equivalent standards subject to no overall increase in costs. Once developed, the GBS will be mandatory for central Government Departments and their agencies and will be promoted to the wider public sector, including schools. A stakeholder review of these standards will take place shortly.</p>

However, the Government are greatly concerned about growing UK contributions to the EU budget.

In particular, at the October European Council:</p>
	<p pid="a.286W.11/2" class="indent">First, the UK won backing from 12 other member states-including Germany and France-to put a stop to the 6% increase in the 2011 EU Budget that was being proposed by the European Parliament.

	<p pid="a.286W.11/3" class="indent">Second, the UK has secured an important new principle for the EU budget in future years. From now on the EU budget will reflect the spending cuts being made by national governments. To quote the conclusions text:</p>
	<p pid="a.286W.11/4" class="indent">&quot;Heads of State or Government stressed that, at the same time as fiscal discipline is reinforced in the European Union, it is essential that the European Union budget and the forthcoming multi-annual Financial Framework reflect the consolidation efforts being made by Member States to bring deficit and debt onto a more sustainable path.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.294W.11/1">The compliance review has highlighted problems within this industry. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) set out the immediate steps it has taken in the report, including warning 129 non-compliant audited debt management firms, that they face losing their consumer credit licences unless they take immediate action to address identified areas of non-compliance, including bringing their consumer complaints handling procedures into line with the Financial Ombudsman Service's (FOS) rules. The OFT also disseminated its report to approximately 1,200 licensed providers of debt advice. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-02">2 November 2010</phrase>, a senior director from the OFT gave a speech to over 200 representatives from the debt management industry at the main trade body's (Debt Resolution Forum) annual conference which sent a strong and clear message to the industry about the improvements it must make in the coming year, including addressing the OFT's concerns about poor levels of compliance with the FOS regime. In addition, the OFT plans to update its guidance and will continue to work with the two main trade bodies, the Debt Managers Standards Association (DEMSA) and the Debt Resolution Forum (DRF) to support their initiatives to introduce higher standards into the industry.</p>

The firms were instructed to produce independently audited evidence confirming action that they have taken to address the identified areas of non compliance by the middle of December, and of the 129 firms, 30 have indicated that they will surrender their licences, 85 firms have agreed to comply and the OFT have initiated revocation action against 15 traders, but these figures may well change.</p>

At this point the agency will then confirm future funding arrangements for this qualification.</p>

	<p pid="a.305W.2/1">BIS does not make estimates on the numbers of students radicalised. We have evidence that radicalisation or recruitment takes place in some of our campuses. The problem is not widespread but is obviously very serious where it occurs. We work closely with the police and institutions to help them manage the risk of this occurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/2">The issue of radicalisation in higher and further education, and the extent to which the Government can offer more support to the most vulnerable institutions, will be looked at in detail in the review of 'Prevent', the preventative strand of the Government's counter-terrorism strategy, 'Contest'.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/3">No estimates are made by the police or agencies about the numbers of students radicalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.306W.3/1">In 2009-10 the Government Equalities Office (GEO) held a series of one-day stakeholder events with local service providers in England and Wales as part of the Department's contribution to the Government's strategy to divert women from crime following Baroness Corston's report on women in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.306W.3/2">The events brought together key agencies together, from across the third and statutory sector, in order to consider how best to utilise the gender equality duty to meet the distinct needs of women offenders.</p>
