	<p pid="a.1173W.8/1">The early learning goals relating to literacy in the Early Years Foundation Stage are the same as those which ware developed for the Foundation Stage in 2000 by experts in the National Strategies and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, with advice from a wide range of academics and professionals outside Government. More recent research and data evidence supports the view that children's early development and experience of early learning has a long term impact on their outcomes. For example, the Review found that by the age of five the majority of children have little, if any, difficulty in grasping key features of phonics and children who received good early teaching in literacy make better progress than those who did not. An Ofsted survey following the Rose review showed that children enjoyed learning about phonics around the age of five and gained satisfaction in putting their learning into practice in their reading and writing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174W.2/1">I have had a great deal of discussion, and received a range of representations on, the early learning goals in the Early Years Foundation Stage, including about their developmental appropriateness. The early learning goals are developmental milestones for children at the end of the EYFS, most of whom are aged five and over. The very strong consensus is that the majority of the goals are pitched appropriately, but some representations have questioned two specific goals on aspects of early literacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.2/2">These particular two goals are already included in the Foundation Stage currently used in early years settings. We know that around a third of children already achieve even the two goals which some representations have questioned, and that children who develop well in the Foundation Stage go on to do well in primary school. We need to make sure every child has the chance for a good start in life, and to develop and learn through enjoying active play.</p>

When we publish the final shortlist of locations with potential to be an eco-town, individual schemes will need to come forward with planning applications and this will provide opportunity for further consultation with the public and stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178W.3/1">Capacity building support is provided to enhance and develop authorities confidence leadership and skills to advance improvement and efficiency, as well as developing their capacity to learn, co-operate and share their knowledge and expertise about what works and how. It is ultimately about supporting authorities working with their local partners to deliver better outcomes, improve the quality of life in places and provide better public services. In December 2007, central and local government agreed and published the National Improvement and Efficiency Strategy (NIES). The document can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1178W.3/4">In the CSR04 period (2005-06 - 2007-08), &pound;150 million was allocated to local authorities, either directly or through partnerships, to fund capacity building. Additionally, &pound;148 million Revenue Support Grant top-slice was provided to LGA central bodies to strengthen the capacity of local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.3/5">In the CSR07 period, (2008-09 - 2010-11) up to &pound;384 million has been provided to help fund capacity building. This includes 114 million of top-sliced Revenue Support Grant provided to the LGA central bodies and &pound;270 million of support from Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.3/6">Capacity building support is aimed at all counties, single-tier and district councils, as well as fire and rescue authorities. Other local bodies such as national parks authorities can also benefit from the programme. Since 2004, roughly 300 bodies have received funding for capacity building. A full list has been deposited in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1182W.12/1">Each claim under either the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) or the War Pension Scheme (WPS) is assessed on an individual basis against the medical evidence gathered to support such an assessment. The availability of that medical information directly affects the processing times. Data are not readily available to determine the shortest and longest length of time taken to determine disability allowances under either scheme. To try and create such information would incur disproportionate effort and costs. However the average clearance times for processing total disability related claims (rejections and awards), under each scheme in working days are shown in the following table. The rise in the clearance times for AFCS between 2006-07 and 2007-08 reflects the increase in AFCS claims and the requirement to consider a worsening condition under AFCS. Worsening is where service after the AFCS introduction date may have caused or aggravated a condition being claimed under the WPS scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking the numbers of workers in employment who were born outside the UK in each metropolitan authority or unitary authority in the North East in each year between 2001 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Population survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is based on the number of people at a given time who were born outside the UK, age 16 or over, and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total. Those in employment are defined following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.5/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows estimates of the total number of persons employed who were born outside the UK, for each local authority in the North East. Estimates are obtained for the 12 month periods ending in February, for 2001 to 2004, from the annual LFS. For time series comparisons, the APS estimates from 2005 to 2007 are provided covering the 12 month periods ending in March. The most recently released estimate is also included, which covers the 12 month period ending in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186W.5/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1190W.5/2"><i> </i>There are no estimates of emissions of bioaerosols from open windrow composting sites for any period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/3">In 2004 DEFRA published an independent study, &quot;Review of the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management&quot;, which concluded that on the evidence from studies so far, the treatment of municipal solid waste has at most a minor effect on health particularly when compared with other health risks associated with ordinary day-to-day living. In relation to composting, the study acknowledges that this an area where there has been less work and the science is less certain than for other waste management activities. The report is available on DEFRA's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/pdf/health-report.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/pdf/health-report.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/5">This is the most up to date source of information on open windrow composting sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/6">Good site management is important in minimising risks to the environment and health from composting facilities. In 2005, the Composting Association published the Composting Industry Code of Practice, which brings together legislative requirements and good management practice to support the professional operation of composting facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/7">The Environment Agency has taken a position that there will be a presumption against permitting (and to object to any application) of any new composting process (or modification to an existing process) where the boundary of the facility is within 250 m of a workplace or the boundary of a dwelling, unless the application is accompanied by a site-specific risk assessment, based on clear, independent scientific evidence which show that the bio-aerosol levels are and can be maintained at appropriate levels at the dwelling or workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.5/8">In addition, Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 10 and companion guide provides guidance on waste planning. Environment Agency's position indicates that any application with 250 m would need a detailed risk assessment showing how bioaerosol emissions would be managed and reduced at sensitive receptors. Clearly open windrow composting would not allow sufficient management of emissions so would not be acceptable close to a dwelling or workplace.</p>

Consistent with that vision, we have set a long term primary target to increase the proportion of the workforce with high level skills from 31 per cent. now to over 40 per cent. by 2020. The target to increase participation in Higher Education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18-30 with growth of at least a percentage point every two years to the academic year 2010-11 will support this and is measured by the higher education initial participation rate (HEIPR).</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.6/2">We have known for a long time that student applications fell for 2006/07&mdash;the first year of variable fees. We also know that they recovered strongly for 2007/08, to resume an upward trend. The fall in applications in 2006/07 has, unsurprisingly, caused the HEIPR for that year to fall to 40 per cent. We would expect to see an increase in the HEIPR for 2007/08 reflecting the 6 per cent. rise in student applicants from England for 2007/08 university entry compared to 2006/07.</p>

	<p pid="a.1212W.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all learners, and that learning serves the needs of the whole community, including older people both within and outside the work force. Our strategy for World Class Skills and our reforms of wider adult learning are designed to ensure that everyone, whatever their age or background, has the opportunity to improve their skills, prospects and quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1212W.2/2">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 provide protection from discrimination on the grounds of age in the area of employment and vocational training. They mean that further education and training providers are not allowed to set age limits for access to training unless they can show objective justification why there is a real need to apply such limits. The Government have decided that all courses at further and higher education institutions are covered by the age regulations, whether they are specifically vocational or more general in nature. This ensures that there is a unified and consistent approach to age-related practices and policies in relation to all such provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1212W.2/3">I must stress that the legislation does not bar providers from offering fee discounts. Many colleges and other providers have longstanding, formal, informal and discretionary arrangements based on age when deciding eligibility for fee concessions. These are entirely at the discretion and cost of individual providers.</p>

It is aimed at, amongst others, providers of further and adult education. The guidance makes it clear that age related practices, such as age related fee concessions, may be objectively justified where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. It is for providers to produce evidence of such objective justification if called upon to do so, or to take their own legal advice if necessary. Guidance on objective justification is also available on page 30 of the ACAS guidance on the Age Regulations.&quot;</p>

At the donor conference convened by United Nations and ASEAN on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-25">25 May</phrase>, the Burmese Government confirmed that all &quot;genuine&quot; international aid workers would be permitted necessary access to the affected region.

	<p pid="a.1220W.2/1">As part of its &pound;37 million annual grant from the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, Victim Support provides emotional and practical support for over 1.4 million victims of crime a year, including support for child victims of sexual offences aged 13 and over. For child victims aged 12 and under, Victim Support refers them to specialist support organisations. Clinically-accredited counselling can be commissioned by Victim Support as part of the support service it provides to child victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.2/2">Over the last four years, specialist support organisations for victims of crime have been granted a total of &pound;6.5 million from the Victims Fund. The primary focus of the fund has been on support services for victims of sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.2/3">In addition, the Cross Government Action Plan on Sexual Violence and Abuse included increasing access to support and health services as one of its key objectives and specifically committed to increasing access to services for victims of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
