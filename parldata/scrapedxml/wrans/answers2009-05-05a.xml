Both donations arose from payments made by Catz club to attend Labour party events. A proportion of the payments met the costs of the services provided at the event, and a proportion was a donation to the party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/2">On the basis of information available, the Electoral Commission concluded that the figure used by the party for the cost of services provided in each instance was reasonable, and that there was no breach of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.2W.0/2">For the purposes of implementing EU legislation the UK is divided up into 43 agglomeration zones (areas with a contiguous population of over 250,000 as specified by the air quality directives) and non-agglomeration zones. There are 28 agglomeration zones and 15 non-agglomeration zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/3">The UK has not reported any breaches of EU limit values for lead or carbon monoxide since they were introduced. A breach of the sulphur dioxide limits was modelled and reported to the European Commission in 2005 and 2006, in the eastern zone close to a brick works in Stewartby. The European Commission requested information on action being taken to address the breaches, and, on the basis of the UK response, there has been no further correspondence. Breaches have not been reported subsequently and the brickworks has now closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/4">Like most other member states, the UK has reported a number of breaches of the limits for particulates (PM10) since they came into force in 2005. There has been correspondence between the Commission and many other member states on these breaches. Most recently the Commission wrote to the UK Government and a number of other member states in January in relation to breaches since 2006 in the absence of a Time Extension Notification seeking additional time to meet the limit value. The UK has since submitted a time extension notification for the relevant zones/agglomerations as provided for under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Details of breaches reported since 2005 are set out in the PM10 Time Extension Notification application which can be accessed using the following link:</p>

Following this meeting, officials in DEFRA, the Greater London Authority and Transport for London have met to discuss potential measures and these discussions are continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.3/2">The meeting with the Mayor was prior to his announcement on the suspension of the third phase of the London low emission zone (LEZ). While the Mayor has indicated his intentions to suspend the LEZ Phase 3 from October 2010, a final decision will be subject to consultation which will take place between now and then. Should the Mayor decide to suspend Phase 3 the Government expect him to put in place other measures that would contribute to achieving the limit values to the same, if not greater, extent.</p>

In addition, specific regulatory requirements are placed on companies by the Security and Emergency Measures Direction (SEMD) 1998, and on Licensees by SEMD 2006. These directions among other things, require companies to carry out security work on their vital installations, and protect their other installations and facilities according to Guidance issued by the Government to companies.

	<p pid="a.8W.5/1">Wild boar cannot normally be fed meat unless it is fed for research purposes and is done in accordance with an authorisation. DEFRA has issued a general authorisation for use of animal by-products for research purposes. The Secretary of State can also issue individual authorisations and can suspend or revoke authorisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.5/2">Although the feeding of animal by-products to animals is a potential route of transmission of various diseases and is something that is not sanctioned in farming or domestic feeding practice, this isolated, short-term trial involving wild boar took place at a time when foot and mouth disease (FMD) and other exotic diseases were not present in GB. As such, DEFRA is confident that this particular activity did not increase the risk of introducing FMD or other exotic disease. No additional measures, beyond regular surveillance of the feral wild boar by research scientists are considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.5/3">The Food and Environment Research Agency does not currently feed any meat to any wild boar populations. In January 2009, as part of the agency's research on managing wild boar populations, meat was used at a single research site.</p>

	<p pid="a.19W.9/1">The report of the Joint United Nations (UN)-Government of Sudan (GoS) assessment of the impact of the expulsion of 13 international NGOs and dissolution of three national NGOs was released on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-24">24 March 2009</phrase>. It estimated that 650,000 people risked being left without full access to medical care; 692,000 without non-food items (NFIs) and shelter; over 850,000 without access to water and sanitation; and 1.1 million with disrupted food supplies. The report is available online at:</p>
	<p pid="a.19W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://ochaonline.un.org/">http://ochaonline.un.org/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.19W.9/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-07">7 April 2009</phrase>, the UN presented figures to donors based on worst case scenarios if gaps were not filled. These were up to 30 per cent. higher: 1.5-2 million without any access to medical care; 1 million without access to water and sanitation; 1.1 million with disrupted food assistance during the hungry season; and 1.2 million without adequate shelter and NFIs during the rainy season. The risks of increased morbidity, mortality, malnutrition and large population movements were also reported as significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.19W.9/4">The Department for International Development (DFID) will continue working with the UN and other donors to monitor GoS' commitment to fill the gaps left by the expulsions and closures, and to ensure that the international community has early warning of any significant further deterioration in the humanitarian situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.21W.0/1">European regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air imposes obligations on airlines with respect to the services they provide, including an obligation to carry passengers' medical equipment free of charge. However, there are no specific obligations to carry or provide oxygen in the cabin.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.0/2">To help the air transport industry to comply with its obligations under the regulation, the Department for Transport has published an updated version of its Code of Practice &quot;Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility&quot;. The code was developed with input from the Civil Aviation Authority, Health and Safety Executive, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Devolved Administrations and aviation industry representatives. The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of small gaseous oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.0/3">This is a matter which is best addressed at a European level. The Department has raised the issue of carriage of medical oxygen with the European Commission at a recent meeting of national enforcement bodies for regulation 1107/2006. The Commission is due to review the regulation in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.6/1">The Volunteer estate, which currently consists of over 2,000 sites, is a key element of the reserve forces, not only providing unit locations and training facilities but also retaining the important military footprint across the UK and the associated ability to connect with the nation. The review confirmed the importance of the Volunteer estate but noted that much of it was old, expensive, underused and located to serve the population centres of the nineteenth century as opposed to those of the twenty-first century. To ensure that the reserves have an estate that is modern, provides value for money and is correctly located to match changes in the demographics and national infrastructure, the Review recommended that the Ministry of Defence conduct a detailed requirements based study. We will be forming a team to conduct this detailed work which will need to consider all of the estate. No decisions have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.42W.9/1">The contract was originally agreed in 2000. Improvements in technology since 2000 have meant the levels of service needed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) can now be delivered at lower unit cost. The negotiations referred to ensure that these lower costs are available to the FCO. The newer technologies available provide faster, more reliable services, allowing FCO staff to work more efficiently.</p>

BERR has a remit to work within Whitehall as the 'voice for business' on all policy areas where business might have an interest. The Unit therefore works closely with DECC and other Whitehall Departments to ensure that business views are fully taken into account in the development of energy and climate change policies. The Unit represents BERR interests on cross-departmental groups, led by DECC, tasked with delivering the Government's energy and climate change objectives. The Climate Change Projects Office is also located within the Unit and promotes UK private sector involvement and opportunities in the international carbon market.</p>

	<p pid="a.62W.2/1">The Housing Green Paper 'Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable', published in July 2007, announced the Government's target to deliver 200,000 new homes on surplus public sector land by 2016. Government are on track to meet the target. The Surplus Public Sector Land programme, overseen by Communities and Local Government and managed by the Homes and Communities Agency, has been set up to identify where and when this land becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.2/2">Information on what surplus public sector land is available for development is available through two main sources:</p>
	<p pid="a.62W.2/3" class="indent">1. The Register of Surplus Public Sector Land, managed by the Homes and Communities Agency, provides a quarterly publication of sites that are owned by central government departments and their agencies. Currently over 700 sites, covering about 5,000 hectares of land, were listed in the most recent quarterly report published in March 2009. This report is available on the Homes and Communities Agency website at:</p>

The National Land Use Database of Previously Developed Land (NLUD-PDL), completed annually by individual local authorities, records previously developed land that may be available for redevelopment within their area. In 2007, NLUD-PDL recorded an estimated 62,130 hectares of land, of which just over a quarter was owned by local authorities and other public bodies. The 2007 NLUD report can be found at:</p>

On one hand, for those balancing family and child care commitments with working full or part-time, Thursday may not be a convenient day for voting. However, other groups, including religious groups, might have concerns about voting on a Saturday or Sunday.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.12/2">This consultation has now closed and the Government are currently working on a detailed analysis of the responses. We will publish this analysis and set out the findings of the consultation in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.68W.2/2">Recent information published by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Electoral Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-01">1 May</phrase> allows us, for the first time, to examine the extent and nature of allegations of electoral malpractice. It is consistent with earlier findings that the scale and volume of allegations of fraud have been decreasing. Of the 60 voting and registration alleged offences recorded at the 2008 elections, no further action was taken in the significant majority of these cases. This must be seen in the context of the 16 million votes which were cast at the May 2008 elections&mdash;but fraud is still unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.2/1">Since the publication of the Social Exclusion Unit's report &quot;Reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners&quot; in 2002 we have had significant success in reducing the reoffending by offenders released from custody. Between 2000 and 2006 there was a 22.9 per cent. fall in the frequency rate from 189.4 to 146.1 offences per 100 offenders. Additionally the rate of serious re-offending decreased by 11.1 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.2/2">The Government's social exclusion agenda is now led by the Social Exclusion Task Force (SETF), which has a strategic role in delivering better working across Departments on social exclusion issues. This includes the Socially Excluded Adults Public Service Agreement (PSA), which aims to increase the proportion of socially excluded adults in employment and accommodation. The Ministry of Justice is working closely with the SETF and other delivery departments to take forward this PSA and to tackle other factors linked to reducing reoffending. With this aim in mind a Reducing Reoffending Inter Ministerial Group (IMG) chaired by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Justice (Mr. Hanson) and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Mr. Simon), and including Ministers from 13 Government Departments, is responsible for ensuring the alignment of departmental targets and PSAs to support crime reduction and the reduction of reoffending, and ensure delivery of agreed cross government plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.2/3">Work is also in hand to collect data associated with the costs of reoffending. The Ministry of Justice is currently developing a segmentation approach better to understand different offender groups, including their behaviour and criminal careers. This will include an assessment of which offenders are likely to cost society the most through their reoffending, and therefore where there are likely to be higher benefits to the public through reducing further reoffending. Additionally, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is undertaking a Specification, Benchmarking and Costing Programme, which aims to create a robust framework of costed service specifications thereby exposing choices for the business about what services should be delivered, to which offenders, at what level of quality. Both of these work-streams will help us to understand how to best target resources and intervene more effectively in the future to minimise the cost of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.73W.2/1">No research on the effectiveness of tagging in Essex, or Castle Point in particular, has been carried out or is planned. The current research programme within the Ministry of Justice includes further research on the effectiveness of a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing re-offending including a feasibility study into reoffending by prisoners released on home detention curfew but not on electronic monitoring in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/2">Current evidence suggests that electronic monitoring has a neutral effect on re-offending. However, international research does suggest that it can be effective in helping to ensure compliance with other, more rehabilitative, community penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/3">Electronic monitoring provides the courts with a credible alternative to custody. Curfews introduce regularity into what are often chaotic lifestyles, and enhance supervision and can disrupt the pattern of offending behaviour. A Joint Criminal Justice Inspectorates Report on the effectiveness of electronically monitored curfews was published in October 2008, and its recommendations are being considered by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.6/1">Prisons are asked to send mobile phones and SIM cards they find to a central unit for analysis. The numbers analysed are set out in the following table for each of the last three years. There are no figures available for the years prior to 2006, because this information was not collated centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.6/2">The figures include items discovered within the prison perimeter and on entry to establishments. However, we believe that these figures may understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones found indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.6/3">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons are being provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report, Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of &quot;BOSS&quot; chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.6/4">We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment to bring an unauthorised mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

This document is publicly available on our website, <a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>, and I will arrange for a copy of this to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.5/33" class="indent">It is not possible from death certificate data to separate thrombotic, embolic and atherosclerotic conditions affecting the arteries to the brain. Atherosclerosis of arteries in the neck and inside the skull can lead to strokes through thrombosis, embolism or sometimes haemorrhage. The table therefore includes a single category of deaths with mention of one or more ICD codes in the range that includes thrombotic, embolic and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular diseases. Pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis have been combined, because when one is part of the sequence leading to death, the other nearly always is as well, whether it is mentioned on the certificate or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.5/34" class="indent">Arteriosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including those supplying the brain, the heart and all other vital organs. Whether the term used is arteriosclerosis, coronary or ischaemic heart disease, the medical condition is virtually the same - lack of oxygenated blood (ischaemia) to the heart muscle because of atherosclerosis (narrowing and stiffening) of the coronary arteries. This clinical category is represented by the ICD-10 code range 120-125. The whole range has been used to count deaths with any mention of atherosclerotic/ischaemic/coronary heart disease in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.5/35" class="indent">Type I and Type II diabetes are distinct clinical entities, which are easily identified and tabulated from death certificates using ICD codes. However, the type of diabetes is not always accurately recorded on the death certificate. Therefore, ICD codes have been used to tabulate death certificate mentions of diabetes specified as Type I or Type II, and also those where the type has not been specified.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.5/36" class="indent">When interpreting the data in these tables, it is important to be aware that many deaths will have more than one of the requested conditions mentioned. Thrombosis of the coronary arteries in the heart is one of the steps in a heart attack; thrombosis of cerebral arteries may cause a stroke. In both these cases, atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries will usually have led to the thrombosis. Therefore, many deaths will be represented in more than one of the causes listed.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated May 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many hospital deaths were caused by malnutrition among those in each age group over 65 years in each region in the last 10 years. (272547)</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/4" class="indent">Malnutrition may be recorded as the underlying cause of death, but this is a rare occurrence. The 'effects of hunger', as the effects of malnutrition may be reported on a death certificate, is never recorded as the underlying cause of death, because it is defined by the International Classification of Diseases as a 'secondary cause' only. Consequently, deaths with any mention of either of these causes on the death certificate are reported together.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/5" class="indent">The attached tables provide the numbers of deaths in hospital where (a) malnutrition was the underlying cause of death (Table 1), and (b) malnutrition or 'effects of hunger' was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate (Table 2), for persons in each age group over 65 years, resident in each government office region in England, for the years 1998 to 2007 (the latest year available). Table 2 will include deaths where malnutrition was a complication of the underlying cause (for example cancer of the stomach) in addition to deaths where it was reported as the underlying cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/6" class="indent">The term 'hospital' includes NHS, non-NHS and military hospitals. It is not possible to determine from these figures how or where the malnutrition or 'effects of hunger' occurred.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of the population are directly employed in Defence and related industries. (271248)</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.2/5" class="indent">Statistics on Ministry of Defence (MOD) personnel are published by Defence Analytical Services and Advice (DASA). These indicate that there were a total of around 274,000 service and civilian personnel as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> who were UK residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.92W.2/6" class="indent">DASA also publishes estimates of UK employment directly dependent on MOD expenditure and defence exports (other than its service and civilian personnel). This includes employment in the manufacture of weapons, shipbuilding etc. It is estimated that 160,000 full-time jobs were supported on this basis, on average, during the 2006- 07 financial year, the latest period for which estimates are available. A headcount equivalent of this figure is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.93W.2/4" class="indent">The available information for non-UK nationals aged 16 and over is provided in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The distinction between public and private sector is based on respondents' views about the organisation for which they work. The public sector estimates provided do not correspond to official Public Sector Employment estimates. Those are derived directly from employers and are based on National Accounts definitions, but do not include a nationality breakdown.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.2/6" class="indent">Citizenship is defined as the nationality reported by the respondents at the time of the survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.2/7" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. This is assessed in a footnote to the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.2/8" class="indent">The figures have been derived from the LFS microdata which are weighted using the official population estimates published in autumn 2007. Consequently the 2008 estimate is not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release, which are weighted using more up-to-date population estimates.</p>

At the same time changes were made to the National Health Service (Compensation for Premature Retirement) Regulations 2002 and the NHS Pension Scheme Regulations 1995. These were also negotiated in partnership with the NHS trade unions. Under these arrangements the standard redundancy terms are one months pay per year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 24 months pay. Members aged over the minimum pension age may choose to use their redundancy payment to pay for their retirement pension to be paid on redundancy without reduction.

	<p pid="a.112W.3/1">Progress is being made to develop the levers that would fit into the current structure of the contracts. The options will be tested prior to final decisions being taken later in the year for implementation in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.112W.3/2">The local national health service, rather than the Department, is best placed to make final decisions about what constitutes a clinical justification of mixed sex accommodation for an individual patient. To assist with such local determination, the Department will shortly be issuing definitional guidance relating to emergency admissions, day treatment, critical care environments, children and young people, as well as services used by transsexual people and gender variant children.</p>

			<tr pid="a.112W.6/132"> <td colspan="5"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <sup>(1)</sup> Primary diagnosis codes used:<br/> 160 Subarachnoid haemorrhage<br/> 161 Intracerebral haemorrhage<br/> 162 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage<br/> 163 Cerebral infarction<br/> 164 Stroke not specified as haemorrhage or infarction<br/> 2. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in<br/> activity over time.<br/> 4. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br/> 5. Discharges: A discharge episode is the last episode during a hospital stay (a spell), where the patient is discharged from the hospital (this includes transfer to another hospital).<br/> 6. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 7. Deaths: HES data cannot be used to determine the cause of death of a patient while in hospital. Deaths recorded on the HES database may be analysed by the main diagnosis for which the patient was being treated during their stay in hospital, which may not necessarily be the underlying cause of death. For example, a patient admitted for a hernia operation (with a primary diagnosis of hernia) may die from an unrelated a heart attack. The Office for National Statistics collects information on the cause of death, wherever it occurs, based on the death certificate and should be the source of data for analyses on cause of death.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> A death in hospital is coded as discharge method = 4 (died).<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics {HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

People on low incomes who work for 16-hours or more a week have access to working tax credit. Furthermore, benefits such as housing benefit and council tax benefit are in-work, as well as out-of-work benefits, and are specifically designed to ensure that people have sufficient encouragement to find and to remain in work, particularly when their income from that employment is low.</p>

This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.</p>

In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 3. The median duration (in days) is calculated by ranking all the vacancies in order of ascending duration and taking the middle value. Half the vacancies will have a duration greater than the median, and half will have a duration less than the median.

	<p pid="a.119W.5/1">HSE has not identified a need to convene any special summits or conferences on the impact of the economic downturn. Workers and others should still expect to be properly protected against the very real risks presented by work activities. It is particularly important during the downturn and the eventual recovery that hard won standards of health and safety be maintained; standards for which the UK should rightly be proud. HSE will not back away from pursuing enforcement action where necessary against those who seek to avoid or abuse their legal responsibilities. HSE is not unsympathetic however to the effects of the downturn and is keeping the situation under review. It is in regular contact with key stakeholders elsewhere in Government, in trade unions, in key business sectors and in academia. The current priority themes of leadership, competence and worker involvement underpinned by a commonsense and proportionate approach to risk management are exactly those necessary for business survival and recovery.</p>

	<p pid="a.123W.5/1">The licensing of nuclear installations is undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) under the powers provided by the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (NIA65). In accordance with the requirements of section 3(1 A) of NIA65, HSE consulted the Environment Agency about the application from the site licensee, AWE plc, for a replacement nuclear site licence for Burghfield. The new site licence was required to enable AWE plc to bring additional land into the licensed enclave to accommodate the construction of replacement facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.123W.5/2">HSE also has a discretionary power under section 3(3) of the NI Act to direct a licence applicant to serve notice on certain public bodies local to the site in question. HSE concluded that public body notification was not required in respect of this application because it will not alter the nature of the activities undertaken in the licensed area, nor impact on the competence and capability of the licensee. Furthermore such bodies would be briefed on the relicensing via the AWE plc Local Liaison Committee (LLC) and that the development would be subject to the usual planning processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.3/1">Where a new build property has been developed with grant for one of the HomeBuy schemes, a developer has to get consent to sell the property outside the affordable housing sector. For RSLs this requires an application to the TSA for a section 9 consent to dispose. This constitutes a relevant event and triggers grant recycling. For non-RSL investment partners (including private sector developers) where properties are retained by the developer on completion, the rentcharge requires that they seek consent from the HCA before selling. If such consent were given, under the rentcharge, grant would be repaid with a link to value, the calculation for which is set out in the rentcharge. Generally, where grant is paid to private sector developers, at build completion, ownership and management is transferred to an RSL, in which case the requirements outlined above in relation to RSLs would apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.3/2">For developers who have signed up to sell homes as part of the HomeBuy Direct, schemes can be withdrawn from the scheme with the consent of the HCA. As HomeBuy Direct is currently configured, there is no grant to repay in these circumstances because grant is not paid until the property is sold.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.3/7">The CML and FSA release slightly different figures. The CML data are for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 98 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, cover possessions on second-charge loans by regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but do not cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.8/1">As part of the transfer of responsibilities from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to local authorities, the Department asked for proposals for sub-regional groupings by October 2008. Local authorities developed those further and submitted proposals in February 2009 to a national panel, involving the Local Government Association, Association of Directors of Childrens Services, Association of Colleges, Association of Learning Providers, Government Office, LSC and DCSF. A total of 43 proposals have now been considered by the national panel and demonstrate how well local authorities are responding to the plans to devolve commissioning for 16-19 provision to them. The sub-regional groupings are intended to plan the commissioning of provision with individual local authorities responsible for the funding. A list of the sub-regional groupings is set out as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.8/2">The conclusions of the national panel are being considered by Ministers at the moment, although there are a number of themes such as the need to strengthen the involvement of providers in the process. A letter will be issued to each sub-regional grouping in May which will indicate the areas they should continue to develop and what further evidence the Secretary of State will be seeking to ensure their competence to take on this critical role by April 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.149W.2/1">The continued use of top slice of the revenue support grant (RSG) for local authorities, as a means of funding the entry training of educational psychologists (EPs), was one of the options considered by a group of interested parties, including members drawn from the Local Government Association (LGA), EP professional interests and training providers. The LGA, however, decided that it no longer wished to use RSG top slice for that purpose. The effect of this recommendation was that the funds were redistributed to local authorities through the formula grant system administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/2">As formula grant is an un-hypothecated block grant it is not possible to identify amounts within it provided for a particular purpose. The decision as to how much of its budget an individual local authority might wish to earmark to a particular activity, such as support for the training costs of trainee EPs, is a matter for each local authority and not something on which this Department collects information.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/3">The Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) is working with interested parties to develop a long-term and sustainable, employer-led funding and entry training scheme for EPs, while administering the current training arrangements. To this end, the CWDC will continue to seek the views and engagement of all key stakeholders through its Educational Psychology National Forum, and to carefully examine options for future funding, while working with local authorities to secure their support for the current subscription scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/4">The CWDC has commissioned a work force development model to help future planning. This will be used to help decide the number of training places needed nationally and regionally for the 2010/11 intake of students.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/5">Further investigation into the role of EPs in the children's work force of the future is also being commissioned to inform planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.2/1">The EYFS Framework was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March 2007</phrase> and became a statutory requirement from September 2008. The cost of developing, designing and printing the original Early Years Foundation Stage statutory guidance pack for providers was &pound;610,000. The cost of the information and communications activity surrounding the launch of the EYFS was &pound;245,000 which included communications to raise awareness, launch events, leaflets to parents, surveys exercises and media activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/2">The Department funded Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) training and development in schools through the School's Standard Fund. The level of funding provided was &pound;5 million in 2007-08 and &pound;7.9 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/3">EYFS training and development in the private, voluntary and independent sector is funded through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). We topped up this funding during 2007-08 with an additional &pound;7 million exclusively for the level 3 certificate in EYFS. At the same time we enabled greater flexibility of the Transformation Fund, which is designed to raise the level of professional qualifications in the early years workforce, to enable further EYFS training for the private, voluntary and independent sector. Because of the way we fund local authorities through these broad grants it is not possible to provide a breakdown of how much was spent specifically on EYFS training per se.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/4">The Department funded QCA a total of &pound;485,000 in 2007-08 and &pound;888,000 in 2008-09 to provide guidance and materials, such as the EYFSP handbook and video exemplifications to support practitioners to monitor each child's achievements against the learning goals in the EYFS profile. This funding also includes the range of activities and support that QCA provides to local authorities, including accredited training and to make sure practitioner judgements are moderated and that the data is secure. We also funded QCA a total of &pound;290,000 in 2008-09 to process and manage applications for exemptions from the EYFS learning and development requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.155W.5/1">There is no process for a parent or pupil to appeal a head teacher's decision on a fixed period exclusion (suspension), aside from a review by the governing body of certain fixed period exclusions. Claims alleging disability discrimination in respect of fixed period exclusions may be made to the First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs and Disability). Information on such claims is not collected by my Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.155W.5/2">Information on the number of appeals against permanent exclusion (expulsion) is collected centrally, but this is not broken down by the reason for exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.155W.5/3">Departmental guidance on exclusions clearly sets out the circumstances and procedures that should be followed and the Government's guidance to independent appeals panels emphasises that exclusions should not be overturned without good reason. In 2006/07, 970 appeals were heard by panels, with only 100 pupils reinstated. These figures must be seen in the context of the total number of 8,680 permanent exclusions for that year. It means that just 1.2 per cent. of permanently excluded pupils were reinstated.</p>

	<p pid="a.157W.2/1">Ministers and officials have received a number of representations about the problems training providers have experienced in finding work placements for apprentices to enable them to complete their apprenticeship framework. The construction industry is one sector where problems have been most acute and we have worked with employers, trade unions and sectoral bodies through the construction taskforce to identify measures to help providers, employers and apprentices. Most notably we have, together with ConstructionSkills established a matching service to help those apprentices in the construction sector at risk of redundancy to find alternative employment and to complete their apprenticeship. We are currently working with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to explore how this approach might be extended to other sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.2/2">We are also taking steps to encourage employers to continue to support training and apprenticeships through the &pound;175 billion a year Government spend on procuring goods and services. Government have made a commitment to routinely consider skills issues and promote training opportunities through their procurements. In construction, Departments and Agencies have made a specific commitment to consider the case for including a requirement that a proportion of the project workforce is apprentices when letting new construction contracts. We are looking to build on this approach in other major areas of spend, including IT.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-17">17 April</phrase>, the Department published new guidance, jointly developed with the Office of Government Commerce, to support Departments and agencies in implementing these commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.2/4">The &pound;140 million package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in January for an additional 35,000 apprenticeship training places will help fund new provision in both the public and private sectors, and will extend the opportunities available to people facing redundancy. We have also developed some flexibilities to help apprentices who have been made redundant. Redundant apprentices can now continue their training with a provider for up to six months while they and their provider look for an alternative employer. The National Apprenticeship Service has provided revised guidance about access to EMA and hardship funds which is already available. If a redundant apprentice is close to completing their framework and has evidence of the relevant employer experience, we expect providers, Sector Skills Councils and awarding bodies to be considerate to their individual circumstances in order to support them in completing their course of study.</p>

	<p pid="a.158W.8/2">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Children Schools and Families currently fund apprenticeships in a number of energy related occupations in the gas, electricity and nuclear industries in England. In 2007-08 900 young people started an apprenticeship in the energy sector. We are taking a wide range of steps to encourage more employers to offer high quality places in all sectors of the economy. We also believe apprenticeships can play a key role in our response to the current economic downturn. Earlier in the year my right hon. friend the Prime Minister announced a &pound;140 million package to provide an extra 35,000 apprenticeship places over the coming year in both the public and private sectors to help strengthen the country's competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.8/3">In January the new online apprenticeship vacancy matching service for employers and potential apprentices went live. The first chief executive of the new National Apprenticeship Service took up post in February and the National Apprenticeship Service was fully functional from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> with a remit to expand apprenticeships and provide a single point of contact for employers and apprentices. To raise awareness and encourage more employers to take on or offer more apprenticeships a national advertising campaign fronted by Sir Alan Sugar ran in February and March.</p>
	<p pid="a.158W.8/4">Our New Opportunities White Paper published in January announced the Government's commitment to extend group training associations; ensure all apprentices have clear progression routes; and commits to work towards an entitlement to an apprenticeship for all young people leaving care. Looking to the future, we have set ambitious targets for the growth of the Apprenticeships programme. Apprenticeships provisions are being taken forward as part of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, including provisions to ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all suitably qualified young people by 2013.</p>

The Research Councils have told us that they have revised their plans for value-for-money efficiencies for CSR07 which has resulted in the collective target for 2010/11 increasing from &pound;243 million to &pound;349 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.5/1">The number of learners was previously provided alongside starts and completions. This can present a misleading picture because the figures cannot be immediately related to each other in the same year. This is particularly true where the number of starts changes significantly because there is a time lag before completions increase, as seen in Train to Gain over the last few years. Therefore the Statistical First Release (SFR), DS/SFR1, published in December 2008, focuses on the most instructive and transparent measures of starts and completion rates. Starts provide insight on growth in the programme and completion rates demonstrate the quality of delivery in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.5/2">The December SFR was the first step in addressing the findings of the review of &quot;Post-16 Learner Statistical First Releases&quot;. It is planned that the SFR will develop over the coming year by integrating a range of sources into one main quarterly release and adopting more robust and sustainable approaches to the presentation of data.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.5/3">This was the first SFR to be produced by the 'Data Service', a new arms length organisation of the LSC, being setup to focus on improving and evolving data services for the FE sector. With its statistical resource now fully operational, the onward development of the SFRs is expected to gather pace along with improved availability of other data. As part of this process statisticians will be reviewing the content and are considering providing a quarterly series of starts for these programmes in future SFRs.</p>
