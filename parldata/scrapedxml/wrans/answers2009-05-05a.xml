Both donations arose from payments made by Catz club to attend Labour party events. A proportion of the payments met the costs of the services provided at the event, and a proportion was a donation to the party.</p>

	<p pid="a.2W.0/1">Under EU legislation, the UK is required to monitor the air for levels of particulate matter (PM10), and to report to the European Commission on an annual basis. The UK also reports modelled data, in accordance with the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/2">For the purposes of implementing EU legislation the UK is divided up into 43 agglomeration zones (areas with a contiguous population of over 250,000 as specified by the air quality directives) and non-agglomeration zones. There are 28 agglomeration zones and 15 non-agglomeration zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/3">The UK has not reported any breaches of EU limit values for lead or carbon monoxide since they were introduced. A breach of the sulphur dioxide limits was modelled and reported to the European Commission in 2005 and 2006, in the eastern zone close to a brick works in Stewartby. The European Commission requested information on action being taken to address the breaches, and, on the basis of the UK response, there has been no further correspondence. Breaches have not been reported subsequently and the brickworks has now closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2W.0/4">Like most other member states, the UK has reported a number of breaches of the limits for particulates (PM10) since they came into force in 2005. There has been correspondence between the Commission and many other member states on these breaches. Most recently the Commission wrote to the UK Government and a number of other member states in January in relation to breaches since 2006 in the absence of a Time Extension Notification seeking additional time to meet the limit value. The UK has since submitted a time extension notification for the relevant zones/agglomerations as provided for under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Details of breaches reported since 2005 are set out in the PM10 Time Extension Notification application which can be accessed using the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.8W.5/1">Wild boar cannot normally be fed meat unless it is fed for research purposes and is done in accordance with an authorisation. DEFRA has issued a general authorisation for use of animal by-products for research purposes. The Secretary of State can also issue individual authorisations and can suspend or revoke authorisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.5/2">Although the feeding of animal by-products to animals is a potential route of transmission of various diseases and is something that is not sanctioned in farming or domestic feeding practice, this isolated, short-term trial involving wild boar took place at a time when foot and mouth disease (FMD) and other exotic diseases were not present in GB. As such, DEFRA is confident that this particular activity did not increase the risk of introducing FMD or other exotic disease. No additional measures, beyond regular surveillance of the feral wild boar by research scientists are considered necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.8W.5/3">The Food and Environment Research Agency does not currently feed any meat to any wild boar populations. In January 2009, as part of the agency's research on managing wild boar populations, meat was used at a single research site.</p>

Staff, who usually travel in standard class would be permitted to upgrade to first class, if no standard seats were available, at their manager's discretion.

	<p pid="a.21W.0/1">European regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air imposes obligations on airlines with respect to the services they provide, including an obligation to carry passengers' medical equipment free of charge. However, there are no specific obligations to carry or provide oxygen in the cabin.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.0/2">To help the air transport industry to comply with its obligations under the regulation, the Department for Transport has published an updated version of its Code of Practice &quot;Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility&quot;. The code was developed with input from the Civil Aviation Authority, Health and Safety Executive, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, the Devolved Administrations and aviation industry representatives. The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of small gaseous oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>
	<p pid="a.21W.0/3">This is a matter which is best addressed at a European level. The Department has raised the issue of carriage of medical oxygen with the European Commission at a recent meeting of national enforcement bodies for regulation 1107/2006. The Commission is due to review the regulation in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.31W.6/1">Data collected by schools in the Torbay area via the School Census in January 2008 showed that 35.5 per cent. of children normally travelled to school by car; this included 2.9 per cent. of children who travelled in a car with children from another family.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.6/2">The Government wants as many children as possible to walk, cycle or use public transport to travel to school. In 2003, we launched the &quot;Travelling to School&quot; project setting out how we want all schools in England to develop a school travel plan in order to reduce car use for journey to school and allow many more children to take regular exercise. By 2010 more than &pound;140 million will have been committed to support the project through local authority school travel advisers and capital grants to help schools implement their travel plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.31W.6/3">92 per cent. of schools in Torbay already have an active school travel plan and the Council is on target for every school to have a plan by March 2010. In addition Torbay Council have in 2008-09 been awarded a total of &pound;6,500 in Walking to School Initiative grants, together with funding in both 2008-09 and 2009-10 for cycle training for 1000 children in total.</p>

To ensure that the reserves have an estate that is modern, provides value for money and is correctly located to match changes in the demographics and national infrastructure, the Review recommended that the Ministry of Defence conduct a detailed requirements based study. We will be forming a team to conduct this detailed work which will need to consider all of the estate. No decisions have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.5/2">We will continue to urge the Iranian Government to take its international human rights obligations seriously including the right to freedom of religion and belief as described in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&mdash;to which Iran is a state party.</p>

	<p pid="a.154W.2/1">The EYFS Framework was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March 2007</phrase> and became a statutory requirement from September 2008. The cost of developing, designing and printing the original Early Years Foundation Stage statutory guidance pack for providers was &pound;610,000. The cost of the information and communications activity surrounding the launch of the EYFS was &pound;245,000 which included communications to raise awareness, launch events, leaflets to parents, surveys exercises and media activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/2">The Department funded Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) training and development in schools through the School's Standard Fund. The level of funding provided was &pound;5 million in 2007-08 and &pound;7.9 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/3">EYFS training and development in the private, voluntary and independent sector is funded through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). We topped up this funding during 2007-08 with an additional &pound;7 million exclusively for the level 3 certificate in EYFS. At the same time we enabled greater flexibility of the Transformation Fund, which is designed to raise the level of professional qualifications in the early years workforce, to enable further EYFS training for the private, voluntary and independent sector. Because of the way we fund local authorities through these broad grants it is not possible to provide a breakdown of how much was spent specifically on EYFS training per se.</p>
	<p pid="a.154W.2/4">The Department funded QCA a total of &pound;485,000 in 2007-08 and &pound;888,000 in 2008-09 to provide guidance and materials, such as the EYFSP handbook and video exemplifications to support practitioners to monitor each child's achievements against the learning goals in the EYFS profile. This funding also includes the range of activities and support that QCA provides to local authorities, including accredited training and to make sure practitioner judgements are moderated and that the data is secure. We also funded QCA a total of &pound;290,000 in 2008-09 to process and manage applications for exemptions from the EYFS learning and development requirements.</p>
