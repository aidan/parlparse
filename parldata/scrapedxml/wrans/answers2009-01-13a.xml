	<p pid="a.545W.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) remains engaged on drugs and crime work, even though the policy lead passed to Home Office as from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. In London, we give policy advice to operational agencies such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and UK Border Agency (UKBA) and task our global network to help deliver the Government's objectives. Our Posts overseas continue to provide political reporting and lobbying support where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.2/3">Our focus is now at strategic level, where the FCO can best add value (foreign policy expertise, building relationships with partner countries, creating effective multipliers through the EU and other multi-lateral bodies). This involves close co-operation with Home Office, SOCA, UKBA, Metropolitan Police Service, Crown Prosecution Service and HM Revenue and Customs to define the threat from drugs and crime to the UK and decide how/where best to tackle it overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.2/4">Through the FCO's Drugs and Crime programme we are helping to build capacity amongst local law enforcement agencies and judiciaries, with the provision of training and equipment. We work closely with other partners including the EU and US, to maximise joint effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.545W.2/5">We are tackling the problem of the trade in opium from Afghanistan through a multi-pronged strategy, which aims to reduce opium production there over time by offering farmers alternative livelihoods, building better governance, promoting the rule of law, rooting out corruption, interdicting the trade, eradicating opium poppy where possible, and breaking the link between the trade and the insurgency. This work is funded by the Afghan counter-narcotics programme.</p>

The PM is acutely aware of the sensitivities and frustrations of this issue, as he expressed during this meeting. I would emphasise that the Government does not condone in any way Libya's past actions and the victims of IRA atrocities have our whole hearted sympathy. We have tested the Libyan position on IRA compensation on a number of occasions and the US raised it on our behalf in August this year. Each time the Libyans have reiterated that they consider the matter closed. As the PM stated on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December</phrase>, we will not therefore seek to negotiate a bilateral settlement on this issue with Libya. However, we will monitor the position of Libya in relation to this issue. The Government have already openly responded to queries on compensation for victims of IRA terrorism and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.550W.2/3">The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a specialised agency of the United Nations with responsibility for information and communication technologies. The ITU Constitution is one of the basic texts of the organisation and this describes its function in relation to interference. The Constitution defines the role of the ITU in the prevention of harmful interference between radio stations of different countries. This is achieved through a process of management of radio frequencies, and orbital positions and characteristics of satellites. In rare cases where interference does occur, the ITU coordinates efforts to eliminate harmful interference between radio stations of different countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.2/4">The Radio Regulations determines the level of protection from harmful interference which one country may claim from another through a process of allocating frequency bands to radio communication services. The ITU maintains a system of registration of frequency use and the rights to protection of a given service are determined by a combination of compliance with the allocation table, registration with the ITU, and the sharing arrangements between services allocated in the same band.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.2/5">Due to the nature of short wave broadcasting and amateur radio, received signals are often weak and susceptible to local interference&mdash;in particular, from the wide range of modern electronic equipment to be found in the typical domestic environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.551W.6/1">Suppliers agreed at the Fuel Poverty Summit organised by Ofgem in April, to provide greater visibility of their offers. Following this Ofgem have worked with the suppliers to ensure that information about their social tariffs and programmes and a contact phone number for consumers to check their eligibility, is available on all the suppliers' websites.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.6/2">Energy suppliers have committed to collectively spend &pound;100 million this year, rising to &pound;125 million next year and &pound;150 million by 2011 on social assistance. In order to meet this commitment to Government suppliers need to inform their customers about the assistance available to vulnerable groups through their social tariff scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.551W.6/3">Expenditure on suppliers' social assistance is monitored by Ofgem and early indications from suppliers to them is that since this time last year the numbers of customer accounts on social tariffs have at least doubled and will exceed the 600,000 customer accounts originally suppliers estimated that would benefit this winter which is a good indication of the level of awareness of the assistance suppliers offer.</p>

The Government have encouraged the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) to incentivise the large gas distribution networks to provide connections to households in deprived communities.

The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) Veterans Welfare Service works closely with the visiting officer to make immediate contact with the next of kin and to ensure information on entitlement is made available promptly. Where there is a spouse or partner, a welfare officer from the SPVA will visit him/her with the visiting officer within 15 days to provide help and advice in completing claims, where appropriate, for an armed forces pension or a claim under the armed forces compensation scheme, as well as to offer general advice on state benefits and welfare matters. Where there is no spouse or partner, the SPVA writes to the next of kin or any other individual known to be dependant on the deceased, through the families visiting officer within a week of the death, providing them with a guidance booklet on what to do after death which includes advice on state benefits. However the services of SPVA Welfare are not only restricted to immediate dependants, such as a widow, as they will also visit other family members, e.g., parents, if requested and this is normally arranged through the visiting officer.</p>

Across 2008-09 as a whole, however, the Defence Equipment and Support organisation estimates a pressure of some &pound;130 million from foreign exchange movements.

We also have specific operations designed to deter those personnel from all three services who may be tempted to illegally import items and also to identify those who transgress. This includes a combined information campaign and a physical search of all equipment including personal baggage, comfy boxes etc. returning to peacetime locations. All security measures are subject to continuous review, security surveys and audits.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.8/3">The Council will be a powerful union of some of our key players giving support to parents and guidance to children as they come more and more accustomed to the virtual world&mdash;it will also give families, teachers and most importantly children and young people the ability to input experiences and concerns. The UK is a world leader on internet safety for children and I look forward to others adopting this partnership approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/4">Reporting directly to the Prime Minister, the Council will help to improve the regulation and education around internet use. This unprecedented coalition of experts and organisations will ensure that parents and young people have a voice in the development of a Child Internet Safety Strategy, to be delivered in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/5">The strategy will:</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/6" class="indent">establish a comprehensive public information and awareness and child internet safety campaign across Government and industry including a 'one-stop shop' on child internet safety;</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/7" class="indent">provide specific measures to support vulnerable children and young people, such as taking down illegal internet sites that promote harmful behaviour;</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/8" class="indent">promote responsible advertising to children online; and</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.8/9" class="indent">establish voluntary codes of practice for user-generated content sites, making such sites commit to take down inappropriate content within a given time.</p>

	<p pid="a.564W.2/2">The Department has regular discussions with Ofcom, mobile telephone operators and other parties on a range of telecommunications issues including on mobile portability.</p>
	<p pid="a.564W.2/3">The Department has made no assessments of the recent Competition Appeals Tribunal ruling on this issue or of the impact of this on UK mobile consumers. These are matters for Ofcom which, following the ruling, has initiated an internal policy review to identify what, if any, changes should be made to ensure that number portability arrangements meet the needs of UK consumers, in terms of facilitating consumer choice and effective competition. The review is intended to undertake as thorough a stock-take of porting in the UK as possible, and will continue into 2009. Ofcom is committed to ensuring that consumers can switch in a competitive communications market with ease. The ability for consumers to be able to keep their telephone numbers if they so choose, and to do this quickly, easily and with confidence is a key part of this goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.5/2">Pension credit disregards savings up to &pound;6000 (&pound;10,000 for those in a care home). The vast majority of pensioners (around 80 per cent.) who are eligible for pension credit have savings of &pound;6,000 or less and do not have tariff income applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/3">Pension credit rules assume a notional rate of income at a rate of &pound;1 for every &pound;500 (or part of &pound;500) savings held above the &pound;6,000 threshold. This is half the rate assumed for working age benefits and is significantly more generous than those of the previous minimum income guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/4">The formula is not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing capital. It provides a simple method of calculating the weekly contribution that people with capital in excess of &pound;6,000 (or &pound;10,000 if in a care home) are expected to make from those resources to help meet their normal living expenses.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/5">Pension credit, through the savings credit, is designed to specifically reward pensioners with low or modest second pensions or savings. Deemed income from capital is also qualifying income for the savings credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.6/2">Using the evidence of what has worked in areas where the under-18 conception rate has fallen fastest, we have issued guidance to local authorities and PCTs on the key components of effective local strategies&mdash;which we are urging all local authorities to adopt.

	<p pid="a.579W.6/5" class="indent">The availability of a well publicised young people-centred contraceptive and sexual health advice service, with a strong remit to undertake health promotion work, as well as delivering reactive services;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/6" class="indent">A high priority given to PSHE in schools, with support from the local authority to develop comprehensive programmes of sex and relationships education (SRE) in all schools;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/7" class="indent">A strong focus on targeted interventions with young people at greatest risk of teenage pregnancy, in particular with looked-after children;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/8" class="indent">The availability (and consistent take-up) of SRE training for professionals in partner organisations (such as Connexions personal advisers, youth workers and social workers) working with the most vulnerable young people; and</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/9" class="indent">A well resourced youth service, providing things to do and places to go for young people, with a clear focus on addressing key social issues affecting young people, such as sexual health and substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/10">At a national level, our focus is on:</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/11" class="indent">Strengthened performance management and intensive support to the most challenged areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/12" class="indent">Maximising the use of the additional funding for improved provision and use of effective contraception; and</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/13" class="indent">Strengthening communications to young people, parents and delivery partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.6/14">Between 1998 (the baseline year for the strategy) and 2006 (the latest year for which annual data is available), the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 12.9 per cent. to its lowest level for over 20 years. Progress in the North East region has been slightly better than for England as a whole, with an under-18 conception rate reduction of 13.6 per cent. between 1998 and 2006. Progress in the five local authorities that make up the Tees Valley area has been mixed.</p>

Reviews of NVZs in England are conducted at the national scale and the last review was undertaken in 2006-07.

	<p pid="a.605W.2/1">Neither DEFRA nor Ofwat, the independent economic regulator of the water industry, collects information on the increases in water bills for groups of customers of a particular funding or charitable status. Where a company makes a change to the way it charges for water or sewerage services, Ofwat challenges the company's proposals to make sure charges are not unduly preferential to one customer group over another. Groups of customers are defined by the costs they are likely to impose and are independent of the financial or charitable status of individual non-household customers. Ofwat's checks also ensure that the company gains no additional revenue from the new method of charging.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/2">Part of Ofwat's duty is to approve companies' charges schemes. These schemes outline how water and sewerage companies will charge their customers. It is for the company to decide on its methods of charging. When a company introduces new tariffs, Ofwat check that these are consistent with price limits and company licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.2/3">Each year Ofwat checks water company charges principal statements to make sure the weighted average increase in all of the company's charges does not exceed the company's price limits, for customers using less than 50 mega-litres per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.606W.8/1">Seals are currently protected in England by the Conservation of Seals Act (1970). Under this Act, it is an offence to take or kill common and grey seals out of season. The Act also allows for the Secretary of State, if it appears necessary for the proper conservation of seals, to designate an area within which the killing, injuring or taking of seals is prohibited.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.8/2">Seals also receive protection under European law through Council Directive 92/43/EEC, known as the 'Habitats Directive'. This directive requires EC member states to introduce a range of measures for the protection of habitats and species listed in its annexes. Seals feature as an Annex II qualifying species and therefore, within special areas of conservation (SACs) designated for the purpose of conserving seals, competent authorities are required to take appropriate steps to avoid significant disturbance to the species or deterioration of their habitat.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.8/3">Presently, 12 SACs list grey seals as a species interest, and 11 SACs list common seals. Further information on these SACs can be found on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) website.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.8/4">The Marine and Coastal Access Bill will provide us with a range of measures to protect nationally important marine features; one such measure is the introduction of marine conservation zones (MCZs). If seals were listed as a protected feature of an MCZ, they would be protected from deliberate damage, injuring, killing, taking and so on&mdash;including shooting&mdash;within that site, and competent authorities would be required to control activities to ensure any conservation objectives set for the site are not significantly hindered.</p>

Ofwat has also issued guidance for water companies on flood risk assessment and identification of priority investments in preparation for the 2009 price review. The proposals in company business plans are now being scrutinised by Ofwat as part of the price review for 2010 to 2015.</p>

It is proposed that these partnerships are underpinned by a new duty on all partners to co-operate and share information with local authorities and the EA. We would expect these organisations to work together to decide the best arrangements for delivery on an area by area basis, taking account of their current roles and capacities.

This ongoing work includes a new inventory of British woodlands, to be undertaken over the next five years, in order to define how much wood is potentially available and how fast it is growing. In addition, data will be collected on both current timber harvesting and deliveries to the wood processing sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.5/2">It will be important to ensure that the final outputs provide a sound evidence base for both policy formulation and also to help to inform future private sector investment.

Nevertheless, the Forestry Commission is planning to publish details of softwood availability and use, which is the area of most immediate interest to the wood processing industry, in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.3/2">There is no common hierarchy of grievances at local, regional or national level. And hierarchy is difficult to discern when localised grievances such as socio-economic issues are bundled into a single narrative with national issues about government policies and international issues such as foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.3/3">As &quot;The Prevent Strategy: A Guide for Local Partners in England&quot; makes clear on page 70</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;...real or perceived grievances may develop about aspects of Government policy (particularly foreign policy), discrimination or racism, lack of social mobility, perceived mistreatment in the criminal justice system and counter-terrorism measures. Perceptions of distorted media representations of communities or conflicts are also relevant. A shared sense of grievance locally, nationally and internationally may reinforce group identity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.3/5">Many people express grievances. But only a tiny minority choose to use them to justify violence, often prompted by radicalisers who exacerbate and selectively exploit grievances to recruit people to their cause. This is why the Prevent strategy aims to address grievances as one of its core elements. Where grievances have substance government should explain its position clearly, setting out what action might already be undertaking. Where concerns arise from misunderstandings or genuine differences of opinion then clarification and openness are equally important. But where there is distortion or fabrication of the Government's position then we need to say so, firmly.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.0/1">A number of reviews took place over the summer which sought to draw out learning and emerging practice on the delivery of activity to prevent violent extremism, including the joint Audit Commission and HMIC Learning and Development Exercise (LDE). Though each review had a different focus, together they provide a useful package of learning material upon which local partners can draw and which will inform the Government's approach to Prevent.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.0/2">There are a number of common themes which run through all these reviews. Some of these require action from national Government, some from local partners and many from both. We have ensured wide distribution of the LDE report to enable local partners to benefit directly from the important learning it contains in taking forward their local Prevent response. We published &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December</phrase>, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already underway to address these key themes. We will continue to develop our response to the reviews throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.0/3">I will place a copy of &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.630W.2/1">While the terms of commercial leases, including rents, are set by agreement between landlords and tenants, Government are concerned that lease terms should not constrain flexibility in the commercial property market. In 2007, at our request, the property industry introduced a revised stronger code of practice which, among other matters, makes recommendations to landlords about the arrangements for commercial rent reviews. This &quot;Code for Leasing Business Premises in England and Wales 2007&quot;, is voluntary. However, Government are monitoring the use and impact of the code, and will evaluate the outcome to see if it has made a difference to industry practice. Government remain committed to lease reform and has not ruled out legislation as an option.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.2/1">Rough sleeping counts provide an effective tool by which we can monitor and demonstrate progress in reducing rough sleeping levels. They give us an indicator of the relative extent of the problem between areas and over time. In 2007, we consulted on and strengthened the methodology by, for example, introducing verifiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.2/2">While we will keep the local counts as a useful measure, we know that they provide a limited snapshot. They should be the start of the process not the end. In the new rough sleeping strategy &quot;No One Left Out&quot; published in November 2008, we set out plans to launch a new approach to help local authorities monitor progress and track people sleeping rough, ensuring that counts are not just an opportunity to identify levels of need but more importantly to do something about it. It is important that we are clear that the headline figure is the total of the counts undertaken during the year. We will no longer ask local authorities that do not count to provide an annual estimate in their annual housing statistics return.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.6/1">Local authorities are responsible for notifying Ofsted of serious incidents involving children. This includes cases which then become the subject of a serious case review (SCR). When a review is complete the report is then evaluated by Ofsted. DCSF Children and Learners teams in the regional government offices have a support and challenge role in relation to SCRs, in particular with respect to the implementation by Local Safeguarding Children Boards and local agencies of recommendations in individual reports. They also provide briefing to officials in the DCSF, to enable them to keep Ministers informed of overall progress. But Ministers are not involved in the SCR process and do not see draft SCR reports or take any decisions until that process is complete and the executive summary is made public. Ministers have vested in them a range of statutory powers in relation to local authorities, including intervention powers, and it is important that they allow the SCR process to take its course.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.5/4" class="indent">The table attached displays the number of children's homes and the maximum number of registered places available within the geographical boundaries of each of the local authorities in England. I should emphasise that these are the number of homes geographically located in each area i.e. the figures include private and voluntary run homes. These figures were taken from data available at <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase> and only include children's homes which were active at that point in time. No registered places data were available for five out of the 1976 children's homes (0.25%) and these are noted in the table below.</p>

	<p pid="a.644W.10/1">This Government launched a radical programme of reform in response to Lord Laming's Inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;. Through the Children Act 2004 we have put in place a much stronger framework for children's services and particularly for safeguarding children. The Government's detailed response to the recommendations of the Victoria Climbi&eacute; Inquiry Report was set out in &quot;Keeping Children Safe&quot; which was published in 2003, alongside the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.644W.10/2">The actions the Government committed to undertaking in response to Lord Laming's recommendations have been carried out or are in progress; the one exception is the revision of guidance on the Children Act 1989. Volume 1, on Court Orders, has been revised and published, and many of the key messages which &quot;Keeping Children Safe&quot; said were to be incorporated in the revised Children Act 1989 guidance have been incorporated into other guidance documents and standards. We plan to revise further volumes of the 1989 guidance next year, taking into account commitments announced in Care Matters: Time for Change, legislative changes through the Children and Young Persons Act 2008, and proposed revisions to the National Minimum Standards for children's social care.</p>

	<p pid="a.646W.2/1">This Government launched a radical programme of national reform in response to Lord Laming's inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;. Through the Children Act 2004 we have put in place a much stronger framework for children's services and particularly for safeguarding children. The Government's detailed response to the recommendations of the Victoria Climbi&eacute; inquiry report was set out in 'Keeping Children Safe' which was published in 2003, alongside the Green Paper 'Every Child Matters'. In November 2008 Lord Laming was asked to prepare an independent report of progress being made across the country in implementing the safeguarding reforms introduced in response to his original recommendations. His findings will be submitted early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.2/2">The Government have also announced that all Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) responsible for serious case reviews (SCRs) which have been judged inadequate are being asked to convene an independently chaired panel to reconsider the review. This process will be applied to any future SCRs which are assessed to be inadequate. In addition, Ofsted will carry out unannounced annual inspections of children's services across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.2/3">The Government office for the north-east monitors the performance of local authorities in the region and their partners on all outcomes of 'Every Child Matters', including on Staying Safe. Over the coming months there will be a particular focus on LSCBs' performance in relation to managing SCRs and improving the quality of the reviews and reports.</p>

Use of BREEAM assessments, as well as being a mandated requirement for Government new builds, considers the broad environmental concerns of climate change, resource use and impact on wildlife, balancing these against the need for a high quality, safe and healthy environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.648W.5/2">A number of reviews took place over the summer which sought to draw out learning and emerging practice on the delivery of activity to prevent violent extremism, including the joint Audit Commission and HMIC Learning and Development Exercise (LDE).

We have ensured wide distribution of the LDE report to enable local partners to benefit directly from the important learning it contains in taking forward their local Prevent response. We published &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December</phrase>, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already underway to address these key themes.

	<p pid="a.651W.6/1">The education maintenance allowance (EMA) was introduced to incentivise more 16 to 19-year-olds from low income households to participate in post-16 learning. It was subject to comprehensive evaluation during pilots from 1999 through to national roll out from 2004. We have evidence on the impact these pilots had on both participation in full-time education and attainment by age 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.6/2">We do not know whether the impact of EMA has changed since national roll out because there is no comparison group in the United Kingdom where EMA is not available against which we could measure the 'EMA effect'. However, since EMA was rolled out there have been year on year increases in participation in full time education, and this is one of the most important initiatives aimed at increasing participation.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.9/1">Education maintenance allowance (EMA) is designed to help young people from low-income households to stay-on in education. Evaluation of the pilots showed that the impact is highest in those families with incomes below &pound;20,000 and that there is a significant fall in take-up from families in the income ranges of just over &pound;30,000. In designing the national programme, we used this evidence to make best use of the funds available for EMA. Experience in the pilots is that young people who are not eligible for EMA understand that, by setting an upper income threshold, we are focusing resources where they are most needed and will have the most impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.9/2">We continue to heed the views of young people about the scheme. Previously, a learner could receive a weekly payment for attending class even if they had been disruptive, uncooperative and lacking in effort. From September 2008 we have amended the criteria for payment of bonuses and weekly payments to include behaviour, punctuality, completing coursework on time and achievement of agreed learning goals. These changes emphasise the &quot;something for something&quot; approach of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.9/3">Young people who were consulted were strongly in favour of this change. They think it is only fair that people are rewarded for effort and not for disruptive behaviour. Similarly feedback from learning providers shows that including an element of behaviour and effort will encourage learners to work hard and make progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.3/1">The importance of good quality personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education has never been greater. PSHE education has a major contribution to make to young people's personal development and wellbeing. Therefore, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October</phrase> we announced our intention to make PSHE education statutory and launched an independent review to investigate how to achieve this in an effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, head teacher at Morpeth School in Tower Hamlets, has been asked to lead the review and will report to Ministers with recommendations in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.3/2">Alongside making PSHE statutory, our key delivery challenge is to develop the skills and confidence of the workforce that delivers PSHE education in schools. To address this, &pound;2 million of funding is available each year to train teachers and professionals who deliver PSHE education in schools. We will encourage schools to use INSET to improve staff awareness on the duty to promote well-being and the importance of high quality PSHE education in particular. We are also working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to develop a specialist route through initial teacher training.</p>

They are, and will continue to be, a conduit for information to flow from sub-regional groupings (SRGs) to the Department. During the transition to the new system GOs are playing an important role in supporting local authorities and working with other regional bodies to prepare. In particular they have been supporting the development of SRGs in preparation for the transfer of 16 to 19 funding from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities. The Department will be allocating funding via Government offices to SRGs to help build their capacity through this process.</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.6/1">There are five county courts in Essex, located at Basildon, Harlow, Chelmsford, Colchester and Southend. Basildon and Harlow are relatively small and only sit District Judges. Chelmsford is the Care Centre for the whole of Essex and Colchester and Southend are both Trial Centres. We are currently reviewing the listing arrangements, mainly for the Circuit Judges, with a view to ensuring that the courthouses and judiciary are being utilised in the most effective and efficient way to deliver the best service we can to the court users of Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/2">During 2009, the plan is for civil work at Southend to change from being listed for a single Circuit Judge every day and towards listing for two Circuit Judges sitting together for up to two weeks each month still at Southend. This will facilitate a back to back listing system for multi track cases increasing throughput, disposal rates and, ultimately, reducing waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/3">Chelmsford county court moved into a new building in December 2007 which provides modern improved facilities and additional courtrooms and hearing rooms. Again, during 2009, the plan is to create a similar back to back listing system for both Chelmsford and Colchester multi-track work at Chelmsford with Ipswich civil cases being listed from Ipswich. Some civil work and private family law work will remain at Colchester. All Essex county court public law family work will continue to be listed at Chelmsford where the Family Proceedings Court work for Chelmsford is also heard now. This will enable Circuit Judges to sit back to back on public law and civil work.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/4">In summary, therefore, the objectives in this review of Essex civil listing are:</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/5" class="indent">To reduce waiting times and improve our customer service to all Essex court users.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/6" class="indent">Make best use of court accommodation and judicial resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.6/7" class="indent">List more effectively and with greater certainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.6/1">Following consultation, launched in December 2005 by the green paper &quot;Rebuilding Lives: supporting victims of crime&quot;, working groups were set up to discuss the appropriate levels for the tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.6/2">The tariff scheme was introduced to stop the costs of the scheme rising at a rate that was no longer sustainable for a scheme funded by the taxpayer. A balance therefore has to be struck between competing demands for finite public resources, and what the taxpayer can afford against what is a reasonable amount of compensation for victims of violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.6/3">The criminal injuries compensation scheme of Great Britain is probably the most generous scheme in the world for compensating innocent victims of violent crime. With regards to the maximum cap of &pound;500,000, nearly all state compensation schemes in the European Union have a maximum cap, and it is usually far lower than &pound;500,000.</p>

It was developed following extensive consultation with the advice and credit sectors. It is intended specifically to support only those debtors who encounter unforeseen short-term difficulties from which they are likely to recover in a relatively short period. Other options, such as the reformed Administration Order (AO), which is contained in Chapter 1 of Part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 exist for those with more long-term problems.</p>

The programme was piloted in two public sector prisons and an accreditation submission will be made to Correctional Services Accreditation Panel, (CSAP), in summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.3/5">The Carousel programme was designed to meet the needs of women displaying repetitive self harming behaviour, many of whom are also disruptive or violent. It consists of a rolling group support programme combined with individual counselling, physical exercise and relaxation, educational activity, art therapy and music lessons. The development of alternative coping skills is a key element running through the programme. The programme, funded by the primary care trust, is run at Eastwood Park,</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.3/6">a public sector prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.3/7">Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a programme developed specifically for women with borderline personality disorder and who have shown a high risk of self harm or are high risk offenders. An adapted version of DBT is being run at Holloway as part of the Holloway Skills Training (HoST) programme, and at Low Newton as part of the Dangerous Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) Primrose programme. Both prisons are public sector establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.3/8">A new pilot has been launched at HMP Bronzefield, to help to tackle self-harm among its population. The Self-Harm Reduction programme, (SHaRP), aims to aid the women in developing coping strategies, problem-solving techniques, communication and goal-setting skills to help to control their self-harming behaviour. The programme takes place over 14 group sessions during a period of three weeks; and there are also opportunities for one-to-one sessions twice weekly by appointment. Once the initial three-week programme is completed, there is a six week gap before the women are assessed again by SHaRP staff. The SHaRP programme started in April 2008 for an initial 12 month period, with a view to extend. However it will be fully evaluated at the end of this initial period. In addition the three day SAFE programme, (whose goal is to reduce self harm), has also been running at Bronzefield since 2004 and is currently being evaluated by a forensic psychologist from NOMS.</p>

	<p pid="a.672W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.0/2">A number of reviews took place over the summer which sought to draw out learning and emerging practice on the delivery of activity to prevent violent extremism, including the joint Audit Commission and HMIC Learning and Development Exercise (LDE). Though each review had a different focus, together they provide a useful package of learning material upon which local partners can draw and which will inform the Government's approach to Prevent.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.0/3">There are a number of common themes which run through all these reviews. Some of these require action from national Government, some from local partners and many from both. We have ensured wide distribution of the LDE report to enable local partners to benefit directly from the important learning it contains in taking forward their local Prevent response. We published &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December</phrase>, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already underway to address these key themes. We will continue to develop our response to the reviews throughout the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.0/4">I will place a copy of &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.686W.8/1">Implementation of the price cut has been delayed until February 2009 to allow further time for arrangements to be made and to avoid coinciding with the Christmas period. Stock compensation is a matter for pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers to agree. The Department is in regular contact with pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers and does not expect that the implementation of the 2009 pharmaceutical price regulation scheme will lead to shortages of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.8/2">However, medicine supply problems can and do occur for a number of reasons and often it is not possible to predict them. The Department of Health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry have published joint best practice guidelines in order to help manage shortages as and when they arise. These guidelines give guidance to companies on what to do in the event of a shortage and recommend that companies communicate with the Department as soon as possible about impending shortages that are likely to have an impact on patient care.</p>

	<p pid="a.687W.5/4">The NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement (NHSI) channels Department-derived funds to the innovation hubs, under the terms of an annual service level agreement between the hubs and the National Innovation Centre (as the agent of the NHSI). The amount allocated to each individual hub is on a capitation basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/5" class="italic"> Department for Trade and Industry (now Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills) Public Sector Research Establishment (PSRE)&mdash;&pound;2.7 million</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/6">On behalf of their trust membership, each hub has the opportunity to competitively bid for funding for specific &quot;pump-priming&quot; activities in the region. Examples of &quot;pump-priming&quot; are to build local networks or conduct informative workshops to assist regional innovators, basically to initiate some activity, which would otherwise not occur. PSRE funding is also contingent on the hubs demonstrating that they have a source of matched funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/7" class="italic"> Local regional development agencies (RDAs)&mdash;&pound;1.9 million</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/8">The RDAs have tapped into the specialist NHS knowledge base of the hubs to effectively use them in what may be described as &quot;the Business Link function for Healthcare&quot; and assist the RDAs in achieving their own targets and objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/9" class="italic"> Other income&mdash;circa &pound;2 million</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.5/10">The hubs also received income from other sources, which are generated by their own local activities. Examples of such sources include membership fees, specific consultancy assignments and income revenue from licensing agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.688W.5/1">The Department regularly receives Parliamentary questions and correspondence from hon. Members and other interested parties regarding the health risks of sunbeds including, in some cases, requests for the regulation of the sunbed industry. Such requests are considered in the context of the ongoing review of options for possible regulation of the sunbed industry, including access to sunbeds by young people. The review has been broad-ranging in its scope and, as part of it, officials from the Department and other Government departments, including Communities and Local Government, have discussed issues concerning the use of sunbeds in different types of facilities and settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.5/2">Since the publication of the Cancer Reform Strategy, the Department has also worked with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and other stakeholders (including some representatives of the sunbed industry) on the HSE's review of its guidance for users and operators of sunbeds. HSE expect to publish the guidance and a summary of the consultation responses early in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.5/3">In conducting its review of options, the Department has drawn on a range of evidence from this country and abroad. For example, in 2007, the Welsh Assembly Government, supported by the Scottish Executive, National Health Service NI and the English Department of Health have requested that the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment update their advice regarding the safety of ultra violet sunbeds in the United Kingdom. A report is expected in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.5/4">The Department has also taken steps to gather further information on the number and distribution of sunbeds, and on the extent of sunbed use by young people, as mentioned in the Cancer Reform Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.688W.5/5">All of these will inform considerations on options for the possible regulation of the sunbed industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.699W.0/2">A number of reviews took place over the summer which sought to draw out learning and emerging practice on the delivery of activity to prevent violent extremism, including the joint Audit Commission and HMIC Learning and Development Exercise (LDE).

We have ensured wide distribution of the LDE report to enable local partners to benefit directly from the important learning it contains in taking forward their local Prevent response. We published &quot;Delivering Prevent&mdash;Responding to Learning&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December</phrase>, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already underway to address these key themes.

	<p pid="a.700W.5/1">Many different parts of the Home Office work to tackle crimes that affect business, such as fraud, e-crime, retail theft, criminal damage and alcohol-related crime. Some of these issues affect both businesses and general members of the public and so officials in these teams cannot be said to be working exclusively on business crime, although they will be contributing directly to its reduction. A business crime team did work exclusively on some very specific aspects of business crime, mainly shop theft. This work is now to be included in a new volume crime team in the Department. The scope of this new team will be broader than that of the business crime team, and include crimes such as burglary and vehicle crime which also affect businesses. This will enable a fuller and more efficient response to volume crimes committed against business to be developed. The volume crime team will also support a more responsive approach, being able to focus more flexibly on critical volume crime issues, including those affecting business, as and when necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.8/1">Following publication of the National CCTV Strategy in October 2007, good progress has been made in moving towards implementing the 44 recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/2">The National Policing Improvement Agency took over responsibility for the Strategy in the Spring of 2008. A National CCTV Strategy Programme Board has been established and has delivered three of these recommendations. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/3" class="indent">1. Seeking to influence national and international CCTV standards</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/4" class="indent">2. Clarifying the requirements in relation to operator licensing by the Security Industry Association (SIA)</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/5" class="indent">3. Developing protocols allowing the use of Airwave radio in town centre CCTV control rooms and the sharing of intelligence between the police and town centre CCTV monitoring staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/6">There is an intention to progress a further 24 recommendations during the next 12 months with the remaining 17 being progressed through 2010 and 2011. This will continue to develop and improve the effectiveness of the CCTV currently in use in England and Wales. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-19">19 November 2008</phrase> at the House of Lords Constitutional Committee hearing we confirmed the Government's commitment to implementing recommendation 1, that there should be a national body to oversee CCTV. The Programme Board is now preparing proposals including a timetable, for the establishment of this body.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/7">The continued development of CCTV as both a deterrent for criminal activity and protection for the public will add to the confidence and safety of our communities. A recent report by the Campbell Crime and Justice Group</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.8/9">which includes United Kingdom (UK) membership and whose review was part funded by the Home Office, included the observation that CCTV is more effective in reducing crime in the UK than in other countries. The Government support the use of closed circuit television in tackling and reducing crime. CCTV is most effective when used along side other measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.704W.2/2">The police seizure power is in respect of a vehicle being driven by someone who is not insured to drive it, rather than the insurance status of the vehicle itself. 153,822 vehicles were seized under this power in 2007. So far in 2008 returns by police forces indicate that 138,373 vehicles have been seized. This number is likely to rise considerably because not all returns have yet been made and there will be further seizures in the rest of December.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.5/1">The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) has completed Stage 1 Equality Impact Assessments (EIA) of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) and the Association of Chief Police Officers DNA Good Practice Guide to identify any potential adverse effects or any bias contained within DNA sampling guidance or NDNAD processes. Copies of the two Stage 1 assessments have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/2">The work undertaken to date on the Stage 1 EIAs suggests that any bias in proportionality of certain groups reflected on the NDNAD is likely to result from over-representation in the criminal justice system as a whole and is not the result of inherent bias in NDNAD processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/3">The Stage 1 EIAs recommend that an analysis be undertaken of DNA subject profiles submitted to the NDNAD by police forces and police force area populations to identify whether any force areas are taking samples and submitting profiles to the NDNAD disproportionately. A working group has been set up to consider and take forward this recommendation. The NPIA is also working on a Stage 2 EIA review process, looking at potential equality issues in greater depth. The Stage 2 assessments will be available in early 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.0/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) is a police intelligence tool which contributes to the efficiency of crime detection. It contributes to detections, eliminates the innocent from inquiries and focuses the direction of inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.0/2">The use of NDNAD saves police time and builds public confidence that offenders may be detected and brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.0/3">The NDNAD provides the police matches with DNA taken from a person with DNA found at the scene of a crime. Police are now being provided with almost 3,100 matches a month. It is estimated that over the period April 1998 to March 2008, there have been over 272,000 detections in which a DNA match was available. DNA evidence will have contributed to solving many of these crimes, but it is not possible to say whether the DNA match was the key factor in solving the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.0/4">Further information on the effectiveness of the NDNAD is available in the latest National DNA Database Annual Report, that for 2006-07, which is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.0/8">The Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) maintains a database of information on cases referred by employers under the Protection of Vulnerable Adults, Protection of Children Act, and &quot;List 99&quot; barring arrangements, in order to provide advice to Ministers on barring decisions. Any data is held for these purposes. Additional information in respect of these referrals may be sought from the police. When the Authority is fully operational it will also obtain criminal records and other police information from the Criminal Records Bureau. It will also maintain the barred lists in respect of children and vulnerable adults required by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. No assessment of effectiveness has yet been made, but performance indicators are being developed for the ISA as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.3/3">While the decision on whether to agree to a request from an individual to have their DNA profile removed from the NDNAD lies with the chief officer of the police force which took the sample, profiles will normally be retained unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded. At present, the average replication rate on the whole NDNAD is 13.3 per cent. However, this figure may vary between police forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.712W.5/2">The Government's victim protection measures are not dependent on a conviction. We currently fund the Poppy project to provide specialist support to adult victims of these crimes. Victims are provided with unconditional intensive support for four weeks, with longer-term services provided in return for co-operation with a criminal investigation. The TARA project is funded to provide similar support services in Scotland. We also offer victims support with resettlement in their home country or within the United Kingdom where eligible. A victim whose safety is seriously at risk as a result of giving evidence may be placed in a police witness protection programme. Victims can also apply for asylum and humanitarian protection where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.712W.5/3">We have ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against the Trafficking in Human Beings which will come into force in April 2009. This will see the introduction of a 45 day reflection period where victims can consider their future options and one-year temporary resident permits, both of which can be extended in certain circumstances. Each case will have to be considered on its individual merits. The new measures are intended to compliment the asylum and humanitarian procedures and for many victims that may remain the most appropriate avenue of protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.730W.3/1">There are currently 354 full-time equivalent case owners who are responsible for the end to end processing of new asylum applications in regional teams. An additional 173 full-time equivalent presenting officers are involved in asylum appeals. These figures do not include staff in screening units, or other staff connected with elements of asylum processing such as support team staff, managers, senior caseworkers, immigration officers and those working in the non-suspensive appeal process. They also exclude staff working in the Case Resolution Directorate, for which a separate answer has been prepared.</p>
