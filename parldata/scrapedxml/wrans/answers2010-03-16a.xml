	<p pid="a.723W.2/1">The Government made a comprehensive package of over &#163;136 million available to support areas affected by the flooding of summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/2">This included around &#163;19 million provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) through the Bellwin Scheme. Flood-affected local authorities applied for help through the scheme, which provides financial assistance to local authorities dealing with emergencies. Exceptionally, the terms of the scheme were made more generous because of the circumstances of the 2007 floods.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/3">Through the Bellwin scheme &#163;2.8 million was provided to Gloucestershire county council and &#163;350,000 to Tewkesbury borough council. In addition &#163;950,000 million was provided to the Gloucestershire police authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.723W.2/5" class="indent">Around &#163;41 million from the Department for Transport for repairs to the local highway.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/6" class="indent">&#163;30.6 million from CLG, through the Restoration Fund, that we have been able to release through a successful European Union Solidarity Fund bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/7" class="indent">&#163;18.4 million from CLG for Flood Recovery Grant to support the recovery work of local authorities, and particularly their work with those in greatest and most immediate need. The latest &#163;1 million released on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-31">31 January</phrase> was allocated to the nine local authorities with the highest number of households still displaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/8" class="indent">&#163;13.5 million from the Department for Children, School and Families for schools and children's services affected by the floods. A total of 858 schools were damaged in the June floods and those in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/9" class="indent">Over &#163;11 million from Regional Development Agencies for businesses affected in their regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/10" class="indent">Over &#163;1.2 million from CLG for local authorities giving council tax discounts, so families do not face council tax bill for homes they could not live in.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/11" class="indent">&#163;1 million which could be drawn on as contingency reserve by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) for use by Jobcentre Plus to support additional demand for Social Fund Community Care Grants. DWP paid Community Care Grants and Crisis Loans totalling &#163;810,891 to people on qualifying benefits to meet the cost of replacing essential household items.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/12" class="indent">&#163;1 million from the Department for Culture Media and Sport to support rural tourism in England through promoting rural destinations and visitor attractions. It will also be used to fund a targeted marketing campaign for the regions of England and businesses such as B and Bs, caravan parks and attractions.</p>
	<p pid="a.723W.2/13">The Environment Agency has not provided funding to either Tewkesbury borough council or Gloucestershire county council for repairs relating to the 2007 flooding.</p>

These grants are part of the Rural Development Programme for England 2007-13. Under the scheme rules it is not permissible to reimburse costs of land acquisition, but the grants do cover a proportion of the planting costs and the agricultural income foregone.

The English Woodland Grant Scheme, administered by the Forestry Commission and which supports most new woodland creation, allows for trees to be planted at a range of densities depending on the purpose of the woodland. These include densities as low as 100 trees per hectare for 'special' broadleaves such as poplar, ranging through 1,600 trees per hectare for native woodlands and up to 2,250 trees per hectare for 'standard' woodlands.</p>

Subject to the will of Parliament, from September 2010 one-to-one tuition will be guaranteed for all children who enter key stage 2 behind national expectations and are not on course to make two levels of progress over the course of the key stage. The funding for 2010-11 is sufficient to cover this guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/3">The Every Child Counts and Every Child a Reader programmes in key stage 1 and the Every Child a Writer programme at key stage 2 comprise of both one-to-one tuition and small group work. Taken together, these programmes will have &#163;52.7 million funding in 2009-10, and &#163;94.6 million funding in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/4">Schools received a personalisation budget of &#163;1.6 billion for the three year period of this CSR, and this funding can be used to provide further small group support.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/5">No decisions on funding for the one-to-one tuition programme or the Every Child programmes have been taken for 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.747W.2/1">Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended) requires all local authorities to exercise their functions with due regard to their likely effect on crime and disorder. The prevention of crime and the enhancement of community safety, including that of small retailers and traders, are therefore matters that a local planning authority should consider when exercising its functions under the Town and Country Planning legislation. All police forces have specialist crime prevention design advisors who can provide architects, developers and planners with advice on using design to help minimise risk of crime for the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/2">In October of last year I wrote to the chairs of all Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) highlighting the importance of working closely with businesses when developing their annual strategic assessments to make communities safer. These are a requirement for all CSPs and provide an opportunity to identify a better understanding of crime and the solutions which are effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/3">To encourage them to develop their working relationship with local businesses, I drew their attention to the guidance produced by the then Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and Home Office:</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/business/partnershipsknow.pdf">http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/business/partnershipsknow.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/5">This is designed to give businesses and their local partnership practical advice on reducing crime including how to work better together.</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/6">I also took this opportunity to draw their attention to the Home Office's 'Securing your Business' online self assessment tool:</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://secureyourbusiness.homeoffice.gov.uk/">http://secureyourbusiness.homeoffice.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/8">which allows business users to assess what simple steps they might take to reduce the risk of crime, including store design and security systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.747W.2/9">We are currently distributing the Small Retailers Capital Grants Fund which is designed to help fight crime and is being allocated to around 1,000 small retailers in 50 priority areas across England and Wales. The grants are being used for a variety of purposes including: purchasing security equipment for individual retailers including CCTV, infrared security cameras, security shutters and rollers, safes, alarms, anti-fraud equipment such as UV markers to detect counterfeit notes and anti-graffiti paint.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.6/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) is carried out in respondents' own homes. It is recognised that respondents may not wish to disclose being victim of domestic abuse in a face-to-face interview, especially if the abuser is present at the time of interview. For that reason, the BCS includes a self-completion module on domestic abuse in which respondents may answer questions in private. It is likely that there remains a degree of under-reporting of the level of such abuse but trends will be unaffected as this methodology has been applied consistently over time. The Home Office also commissions ad-hoc social research projects to explore the nature of domestic violence and also to inform the development and evaluation of policy and practice as and when is required.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.2/23">FCO Services acquired Trading Fund Status in April 2008. To be a successful and efficient trading organisation, a different set of skills and underlying processes were required. Temporary skills and resource were therefore brought into the organisation by Capita through a government procurement framework, in order to help set up of new processes and then transfer those skills in house. For example, FCO Services needed to develop its own capability to support critical services around the world in the event of a business continuity incident. As these skill sets were new and not available in-house, a temporary contract was provided through Capita to build up this capability and enable the skill sets and processes to be adapted and transferred in- house. Contracts were also, for example, awarded through Capita to provide specialist sales and marketing resources. FCO Services had no specialist sales people prior to trading fund, but the need to drive forward their wider market sales in order to enable financial benefits to the FCO (e.g. price stabilisation and dividends) meant FCO Services needed the skills these resources provided.</p>

Our aim is to share best practice, co-ordinate UK effort bilaterally and multilaterally, ensure we avoid duplication of work and encourage others to take a comprehensive approach to countering the terrorist threat. The response of the international community to the failed Detroit bomb on Christmas Day illustrates the strength and breadth of the coalition against terrorism with January's Yemen meeting convened by my right hon.

In reality however, they cannot hold positions in the judiciary, police and security forces, limiting the role they are permitted to play in public life.

	<p pid="a.787W.5/1">We have discussed the situation at Camp Ashraf with the Iraqi Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Human Rights Minister, the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Iraqi Government's Ashraf Committee. I met the Iraqi Foreign Minister in Baghdad in December 2009 and underlined the need for the Iraqi authorities to deal with the residents of Camp Ashraf in a way that meets international humanitarian standards. In addition we discuss the issue with the UN, US, and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.787W.5/2">The Iraqi authorities have told the residents that they can no longer stay at Camp Ashraf but has given assurances that no residents will be forcibly transferred to a country where they have reason to fear persecution, or where substantial grounds exist to believe they would be tortured. The Iraqi Human Rights Minister confirmed to our ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-27">27 January 2010</phrase> that the Government of Iraq would deal with the residents of the camp with respect for their human rights in co-operation with the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We believe it is in the interests of the residents to respect and accept the decision made by the Government of Iraq, and to cooperate peacefully with the Iraqi authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.9/6" class="indent">The ONS Environmental Accounts measure greenhouse gas emissions on a UK resident basis, in order to be comparable with National Accounts economic data. Therefore, they include emissions generated by UK residents in the UK and emissions from UK residents' transport and travel activities abroad. They exclude emissions generated by non-residents' transport and travel in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.9/7" class="indent">As such, these data are on a different basis from estimates published by the Department for Energy and Climate Change under the UK's Kyoto Protocol obligations. The Kyoto Protocol basis covers emissions from UK territory only and excludes emissions from international aviation and shipping.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.9/8" class="indent">The most recent publication was on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-12">12 June 2009</phrase> and statistics on carbon dioxide emissions for the period 1990-2007 are available on the National Statistics website at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.0/1">An independent assessment is commissioned at the end of each three year phase of the Supplier Obligation (now termed the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target), building on the cost-benefit assessment undertaken and published at the launch of each scheme. Independent analysis of the three year supplier obligation scheme ending March 2008 showed it to have been extremely cost effective in delivery-that for every &#163;1 added onto GB household bills to pay for the obligation, benefits equate to an average saving of &#163;9 per household bill over the lifetime of the measures. Equally, the present supplier obligation, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, is believed to be highly cost-effective, with expected annual benefits (net of costs) of around &#163;649 million for the lifetime of the measures, with around &#163;228 benefits per tonne of carbon dioxide saved in the traded sector and &#163;153 benefits per tonne of CO2 saved in the non-traded sector.</p>

Some of the key achievements are set out as follows, along with information on the number of households assisted by the Warm Front scheme in Manchester, Gorton constituency. It would be disproportionately costly to provide statistical information on all the impact of all the policies to the level of detail requested, but statistical information covering energy and climate change is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.2/5">The Climate Change Act in 2008 set a target of at least 80 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050.

	<p pid="a.798W.2/8">In March 2010 the Government's household energy management strategy-Warm Homes, Greener Homes-set out plans for meeting the target of a reduction of 29 per cent. in (non-traded) carbon emissions in the household sector. The strategy will make it easier for people to take action, removing the deterrent of upfront costs by, for example, paving the way for 'pay as you save' energy efficiency loans.</p>

	<p pid="a.804W.8/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.8/3" class="italic">  Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus measures performance on the processing of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) claims through the Average Actual Clearance Time (AACT) target. The current target for 2009-10 is 11.5 days. This time is calculated across an average of all the claims cleared in any given month looking at the date the customer first contacted Jobcentre Plus or the customers first day of unemployment, whichever is the later. The end date is the date a formal decision is made on the claim and a notification is issued to the customer on entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.8/5" class="indent">In addition to collecting AACT data our benefit processing system also gathers useful management information on the volumes of claims processed within the time bands you have requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.8/6" class="indent">The following table outlines the number of JSA claims processed in December 2009 and January 2010 in both number and percentage terms. The final JSA AACT in month performance for December was 9.0 days and for January was 9.1 days. Current Year to date performance for the 2009-10 performance year is 9.8 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking for what reason the time series data produced by the Office for National Statistics on the number of 18 to 24 year olds claiming jobseeker's allowance before April 1997 is unavailable; what data are available on the number of young people who claimed unemployment benefits before that date; and by what mechanisms data on numbers of unemployment benefit claimants before and after April 1997 may be compared. (322105)</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.2/4" class="indent">In October 1996 Unemployment Benefit and unemployment-related Income Support were merged into a single Jobseeker's Allowance. This introduced discontinuities into the Claimant Count series. Adjustments for discontinuities to the series were estimated by sex and by region, however, these adjustments were not further broken down to cover age and duration breakdowns. Consequently age and duration series prior to April 1997 are not consistent with series after that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.2/5" class="indent">Two of the main factors influencing the decision to not make adjustments for age and duration were the high proportion of claims for which there was no age and duration information available, around 10% of all claims in the early 1990's and the unavailability of similar breakdowns of Northern Ireland data prior to January 1996, due to the use of separate administrative systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.2/6" class="indent">Information on the number of 18 to 24 year olds claiming unemployment benefits is available prior to 1997, stretching back to 1985. However, this information only covers geographic areas within Great Britain, is subject to discontinuities mentioned above, does not include clerical claims and is not available on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.2/7" class="indent">As a result of the adjustments mentioned above, seasonally adjusted Claimant Count series, by sex and by region, prior to April 1997 can be considered comparable with those after that date. However, detailed breakdowns, including those for age groups should only be compared in the context of the discontinuities arising from changes in administrative and benefits systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.2/8" class="indent">National and local area estimates for many labour market statistics, including employment, unemployment and claimant count are available on the NOMIS website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.2/1">There has been no assessment made of the effect of the ending of prescribed rating on the work of the Valuation Office Agency. The impact on businesses occupying properties subject to prescribed rating, like the port authorities, was that their rateable value was ascertained by the same rules of assessment that apply to all other non-domestic properties instead of by a prescribed formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.2/2">The ending of prescribed rating did not affect decisions on whether or not property occupied by other businesses within ports should be assessed separately for non-domestic rates. The principles concerning separate rateability where there is &quot;exclusive occupation&quot; and &quot;paramount control&quot; are long established. The leading case on the subject is a House of Lords decision from as far back as 1936-Westminster Council <i> v</i><i> .</i> Southern Railway Company and W.H. Smith and Son.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.2/3">The review of ports by the Valuation Office Agency was done to ensure that all individual business properties within and outside ports are rated fairly and that the burden of contributions to funding local government is shared equitably amongst businesses around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.2/4">The Government have listened to the concerns of businesses with significant and unexpected backdated bills, including some businesses within ports. It has legislated to enable such bills to be repaid over an unprecedented eight years rather than in a single instalment, helping affected businesses to manage the impact on their cash flows during the downturn by reducing the amount they are required to pay now by 87.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.2/5">As at October 8 2009, local authorities have reported that ratepayers occupying 221 properties within ports had fully discharged their backdated liability and ratepayers occupying a further 200 business properties within ports had been granted a schedule of payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.2/1">The Department's internal website is the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) intranet. Since 2005 the intranet has been completely redesigned and rebuilt twice. Only the most recent design in 2009 required design work to be commissioned. The total cost for this work is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.2/11">The MOJ intranet was created in 2007 to meet the needs of the new Ministry of Justice. The new Ministry brought together a number of disparate bodies and the intranet was a key element in building the cohesion of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/12">The intranet is the main channel of communication for Ministry of Justice staff across the Department providing up-to-date information on corporate issues. It also provides a wide range of information and resources which make a major contribution to the efficient running of the Department and gives staff quick and easy access to many of the tools they need to do their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.2/13">The intranet was redesigned and rebuilt in 2009. The new intranet provides quick and easier access to information therefore contributing to increased efficiency in the work of the Department. A more modern look and feel helps to bring the experience of using the intranet into line with the expectations of staff who use other online channels both at work and at home. The intranet provides a central focus for all staff, is able to be accessed across the organisation, and helps join up the Ministry and its staff.</p>

Many of the cases scheduled for hearing can, therefore, be settled or withdrawn prior to that hearing taking place. A number of cases will also have been postponed at the request of parties or, occasionally, on the direction of an employment judge. In order to maximise the use of hearing rooms cases are listed (under the direction of a Judge) with the expectation that a proportion will withdraw.</p>

However, the LSC is responsive to increased demand for services at local level within that budget. Last year, the LSC increased the number of cases funded of initial civil advice and assistance in areas like debt and housing to over one million in response to the economic downturn-a record amount. The LSC also allocated cases in areas where clients had previously found services hard to access. The LSC will continue to maintain this flexible approach where there is evidence of both need and demand for additional services.</p>

	<p pid="a.832W.5/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable people in society have access to quality, publicly-funded legal advice for family and social welfare issues. This is why we increased expenditure on Legal Help, which covers initial advice and assistance, from &#163;176 million in 2008-09 to &#163;200 million for 2009-10. We have also increased the number of acts of assistance provided from 595,000 in 2004-05 to over a million last year. During 2010-11, funding for advice and assistance will be maintained to ensure that people can continue to access the help they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.832W.5/2">The new civil contracts will begin on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>. One of the main changes made to advice provision under the new contract will be the requirement to provide services in housing, debt and welfare benefits holistically, under one contract. This will provide a more integrated service and meet clients' needs more effectively. Practitioners who do not currently provide all three services have the option of forming consortia to bid for this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.832W.5/3">The tender process for social welfare law and family services opened on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-26">26 February</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.832W.5/4">If access problems arise during the life of the new contract, the LSC will take appropriate action-within budget-to encourage additional services.</p>

	<p pid="a.834W.0/10">Prisons which have been designed and built to accommodate prisoners up to a particular security category may hold prisoners of a lower category to enable the effective management of the estate, particularly where the establishment is fulfilling a number of functions. The predominant function of each establishment has been used in producing the figures above which may be subject to changes in delivery. The programmes which are offered cover four broad areas set against levels of offender risk and need, which address substance misuse, general offending behaviour, sexual and violent offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.0/11">In addition to accredited programmes there are a number of non accredited programmes which are approved locally to meet particular needs and other activities such as training, education, work, support and resettlement are offered to prisoners to help reduce the risk of re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.834W.0/14">Offending behaviour programmes accommodate a broad range of offenders. Where appropriate, prisons must make reasonable adjustments to ensure programmes are accessible to all those who could potentially benefit. If there are concerns for example about mental or physical health, intellectual ability, language, literacy, dyslexia, or disability then an assessment should be undertaken or specialist advice obtained to see if the particular deficits can be worked with within the programme. Participation on a particular programme will depend on the assessment and scale of the issues in an individual case. There may be more than one factor that precludes an individual from participating in a programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.834W.0/15">Further work may be possible to prepare an individual, however there will be some offenders who are unable to participate due to the intensive nature and cognitive focus of the programmes. If a programme is not suitable then one to one work may be considered. If an individual is still unsuitable then other interventions or activities should be considered to meet their needs. Offending behaviour programmes are only element of National Offender Management Service work to address the risks and needs of offenders and reduce their risk of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.5/1">Suspended sentence orders were introduced in April 2005 to provide the courts with a tougher and more flexible suspended sentence as an alternative to immediate custody, where appropriate. It provides for the court both to suspend the custodial sentence and also to impose community requirements such as curfew, community payback and drug rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.835W.5/2">The Government do not issue guidance to magistrates or judges on sentencing. The issuing of guidance is a matter for the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Breach of a suspended sentence order is governed by schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Essentially, where an offender breaches a suspended sentence by failing to comply with a community requirement or by committing a further offence the presumption is that the suspended sentence will be activated, unless the court finds it would be unjust to do so. If it activates the suspended sentence the court can set a shorter term for the offender to serve if it wishes. If the court finds that it would be unjust to activate the suspended sentence it can keep the sentence suspended but amend the order to make the community requirements more onerous, or to extend the supervision or operational periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.6/1">The overall cost of finance for business is ultimately determined by the market, but is made of a number of factors, including the cost of funding for the banks, and the cost of risk and capital. BIS data shows the overall cost for SMEs was stable during the later part of 2009, and in general less than two years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.6/2">Banks maintain that they have the capacity to meet the demand from viable businesses in the second quarter of 2010 and beyond, and the Government expects them to do so. BIS data shows that majority of applications from businesses for financial support continue to be approved.</p>

Inquiries from eight businesses are being considered subject to further information to be supplied by the applicant. The remaining 47 inquiries have been rejected or withdrawn. I am not providing a breakdown by parliamentary constituency or local authority as this could make it possible to identify the individual companies that have received support.</p>
