	<p pid="a.777W.3/1">The Government take the issue of synthetic drugs, including new psychoactive substances (so called 'legal highs') very seriously. The manufacture and trafficking in controlled drugs of all classes need to be tackled robustly in order to reduce the harm drugs cause to communities and the organised criminality associated with their supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>, we introduced to this House legislative proposals, in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 with provisions for temporary banning powers on new 'legal highs'. This will give the police and other law enforcement agencies the power to act, enabling them to seize these drugs and prosecute those who are selling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/3">Those caught supplying or trafficking a temporary ban drug will be committing a serious offence and subject to a maximum of 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. Where an individual is found in possession of a temporary ban drug for personal use, police will have powers to seize and destroy it.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/4">Evidence indicates that these synthetic drugs and new psychoactive substances are manufactured outside the UK and that is why we need to concentrate the full force of the law at our borders to stop these drugs from getting into the UK. The UK Border Agency are undertaking effective enforcement action against those criminal gangs who traffic these drugs across our borders, by seizing and destroying shipments of illegal drugs and those 'legal highs' that are subject to an import ban under the Open General Import Licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>, the Home Office launched a three-month pilot to explore improvements to the current forensic early warning system for identifying new and emerging drugs. As part of this pilot, we are introducing new forensic technology at the borders to support UK Border Agency with the identification of any new drug being imported into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/6">Investigations into allegations of illegal synthetic drug manufacture within the UK is a matter for the police, who must prioritise resources towards tackling crime, including drug-related crime, with a focus on those offences which cause the most harm. Where drug factories pose a threat within a community, these will become a focus of police activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/7">No formal assessment has been made of the effects of spending reductions for safer neighbourhood teams in relation to drug enforcement. We have sustained the investment in neighbourhood policing funding for the next two financial years to ensure police crime commissioners (PCCs) inherit strong neighbourhood policing infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.3/8">The exception to this is in London, where the Metropolitan police authority will have full autonomy over this funding from 2011-12, in recognition of the role the Mayor of London and the Deputy Mayor already play in policing. There is no need for visible and available policing to diminish because of the spending settlement, provided that forces focus on driving out wasteful spending and increasing efficiency in the back office that they can make.</p>

Legal representatives will not divulge such an arrangement unless they are required to as, first, they have an obligation of confidentiality to their clients;, secondly, knowledge of such will give negotiating advantage to their opponents; and, thirdly, Employment Tribunals are generally a no costs jurisdiction, where awards of costs are not made unless the claim or defence has been &quot;frivolous, vexatious or otherwise unreasonable&quot;. In the circumstances, it would not be possible to keep any sort of accurate record of the incidence of such agreements in these cases, or to make an assessment of their impact upon the outcomes of claims.</p>

	<p pid="a.784W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-15">15 November</phrase> the Secretary of State for Justice announced the publication of a consultation on a package of proposals for the reform of legal aid. The consultation proposes that legal aid ceases to be available for clinical negligence matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/2">Most personal injury cases were removed from the scope of the civil legal aid scheme by the Access to Justice Act 1999. Legal aid funding is still available for claims, including personal injury claims, against public authorities alleging serious wrong-doing, abuse of position of power or significant breach of human rights. We have proposed replacing the existing &quot;serious wrong-doing&quot; ground for funding, and replacing it with &quot;negligent acts or omissions falling very far below the required standard of care&quot; as a ground for funding these claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/3">Funding is currently available for any claim, including a personal injury claim, which has a significant wider public interest. The current consultation proposes to abolish the rule which brings back into the scope of civil legal aid any case which has a significant wider public interest. While the Government recognises that public interest is an important factor, which should continue to be reflected in the Funding Code merits criteria for granting civil legal aid, we do not consider that it should be either a solely determinative factor in deciding whether legal aid should be granted, or a basis for bringing back into scope otherwise excluded cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/4">Funding is available for claims, including personal injury claims, arising from allegations of abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, or sexual assault.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/5">We have proposed that these cases remain within the scope of civil legal aid. Funding is available for housing cases, as defined by the civil legal aid Funding Code, including for housing personal injury claims. We have proposed that housing personal injury claims are removed from the scope of civil legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/6">Legal aid is also available for advice on applications to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. We have proposed that this advice ceases to be in scope for legal aid because the application is a straight-forward one and assistance is available from the authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.2/7">The consultation paper: &quot;Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales&quot; is available at the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>

Costs of the MOD's white fleet are not included as they are not recorded on a monthly basis; however, we estimate that white fleet contract and fuel costs averaged just under &#163;4 million a month between April and September 2010.

	<p pid="a.804W.2/1">Following informal contacts and meetings with a number of academic departments in 2009 and discussions with a range of stakeholders, including the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) identified an option to conduct an independent health needs audit in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.804W.2/2">The MOD statement of requirement detailed the need for external assistance to provide an assessment of the health needs of British nuclear test veterans and in particular to look at:</p>

	<p pid="a.810W.3/1">The Government are radically reforming the welfare to work system to provide an integrated programme of personalised help for people who are out of work. The support package includes enhancement of the provision offered by Jobcentre Plus, an improved skills offer through the Get Britain Working measures and tailored support via the Work programme. This flexible system will offer the right support at the right time to all people on benefits, including refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.3/2">For the majority of refugees the flexible, personalised services that Jobcentre Plus will offer, alongside the Get Britain Working measures, will meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.3/3">For those with significant disadvantages, early entry to the Work programme may be appropriate. Advisers will have the discretion to refer more vulnerable customers to the Work programme where it is clear that they would benefit from the type of assistance provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.3/4">The term refugee covers a broad spectrum of individuals with a wide range of differing needs. I therefore do not believe it would be appropriate to refer all refugees to the Work programme more quickly than other people receiving benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.3/5">We have asked bidders for the Work programme contracts, without being prescriptive, to develop innovative models of support. These must be designed to be flexible and specifically tailored to meet the needs of individual customers and the local area. As part of the evaluation of process, the Department will consider bidders' ability to meet the diverse needs of different customers and customer groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.3/6">I am unable to provide the statistical information requested in relation to the position of refugees under previous programmes such as New Deal and Flexible New Deal. This information was not systematically collected at the time and cannot be obtained retrospectively.</p>

All amounts are in 2008-09 prices. Information covers Great Britain only.<br/> 3. Shares of benefit expenditure by income band according to the Family Resources Survey have been applied to administrative data to derive a split by income band. Administrative data totals are available to the nearest million pounds, while information based on survey data is presented rounded to the nearest &#163;50 million.<br/> 4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series. Note, however, that unlike most incomes used in the 'Households Below Average Income' publication, incomes here are gross and unequivalised.<br/> 5. The Family Resources Survey is known to undercount receipt of certain benefits. This methodology assumes that this undercount is spread proportionally across income bands. For example, if 30% of expenditure is in a certain income band, this assumes 30% of any undercount is also in that income band. This assumption may not be justified here given the relationship between overall income and reporting of benefit income.<br/> 6. Unequivalised gross incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling in order to assign all incomes to bands.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.814W.2/54">The relatively small proportion of benefit expenditure directed at the low income bands specified is mainly due to three reasons; firstly, there is a low proportion of the population overall with gross unequivalised annual incomes less than &#163;10,000; secondly, a major factor causing very low incomes is non take-up of benefits and tax credits; and thirdly, evidence suggests that the Family Resources Survey has an undercount in terms of recording benefit receipt compared to administrative totals.</p>

	<p pid="a.816W.2/4">Of claims received between October 2008 and August 2009 in Carmarthenshire, that were found fit for work at initial WCA, 430 have appealed the WCA decision and had their appeal heard by July 2010. Of these appeals 160 or 38% found in favour of the appellant. For Pembrokeshire, there have been 140 appeals, of which 20 or 15% found in favour of the appellant.</p>

Our offices in Burundi and our ambassador based in Kigali have also encouraged the Government of Burundi to take the steps that we believe are essential in enabling Burundi to complete its post-conflict recovery.

	<p pid="a.818W.6/1">Ministers received no briefing at unclassified level following the outcome of the 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt.</p>
	<p pid="a.818W.6/2">During parliamentary elections in Egypt in November and December, domestic observers, civil society organisations and election participants raised serious concerns about arrangements in the run-up to and during the elections. These included refusal of access for international monitors, lack of access in many instances for independent national monitors and candidate representatives to key parts of the voting and counting process and reports of attempts to limit media comment on the elections. In a number of cases, reported voting irregularities and the harassment and arrest of opposition candidates and their supporters amounted to serious interference in the electoral process. This called into question the credibility of some of the results. The majority of the opposition parties and candidates refused to participate in the second round of elections, citing these issues. We strongly encouraged the Egyptian authorities to address those concerns. After the elections the UK and EU highlighted in public and in private irregularities in the electoral process including the absence of independent monitors and limits to press freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.818W.6/3">The Government worked to support free and fair parliamentary elections in 2010. We called on the Egyptian Government to amend legislation to ensure full compatibility with Egypt's international obligations in this regard and to permit international observers to visit Egypt during the election periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.818W.6/4">The EU also supported a coalition of Egyptian civil society organisations to monitor the presidential and parliamentary elections. These non-governmental organisations are also working to raise Egyptian voter awareness towards their political rights, train observers to be able effectively to monitor the elections, and to improve media coverage of the electoral campaigns along internationally recognised professional and ethical standards. Our embassy is also supporting a number of smaller projects with Egyptian civil society to assist their capacity building for the electoral process.</p>

In response to the unrest in Egypt, the FCO advises against all but essential travel to Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Luxor. In addition, the FCO organised two government-funded charter flights for British nationals wanting to leave Cairo, on 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-05">5 February 2011</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.826W.12/1">In Sudan one in 10 children die before the age of five, net enrolment in primary education is around 54% and Southern Sudan alone has over one million children out of school. In Uganda, children and young people have lost opportunities for education as a result of two decades of conflict, and now risk being unable to access the services they need because of a very high rate of population growth. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) one in five children die before their fifth birthday and more than four million children are out of school. The Central African Republic (CAR) has been affected by civil war for a number of years.

The conclusions of the Bilateral Aid Review (BAR), Multilateral Aid Reviews (MAR) as well as the Humanitarian and Emergency Response Review (HERR) will determine our response to the challenges faced by children and young people in these countries. Conclusion of the BAR and MAR will be announced in the coming weeks, while the HERR will report by the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="a.833W.2/1">The Localism Bill, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-13">13 December 2010</phrase>, contains a wide range of measures to devolve more powers to councils and neighbourhoods and give local communities greater control over local decisions like housing and planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.833W.2/2">The Department is reducing burdens and barriers that make it difficult for local authorities and individuals taking action locally which help to build the Big Society. We have reduced burdens and increased flexibility for local authorities through dismantling the local performance framework and inspection regime, giving greater control over use of their funding and through measures announced in our response to the Sustainable Communities Act. Increasing transparency across Whitehall and local authorities enables citizens to hold service providers to account or open up services to new providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.833W.2/3">The Department is removing its capital clawback rights from accountable bodies that are either a public body or a body subject to an asset lock from four historic grant programmes (Single Regeneration Budget, Urban Programme, City Challenge and Inner Area Grants). By removing capital clawback rights we are freeing councils and voluntary and community sector organisations to use assets originally funded through these programmes in ways that best meet the needs of their communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.0/1">The new affordable rent product will allow social landlords to charge rents at up to 80% of local market rents. When setting rents, it is expected that providers will, where possible, utilise the flexibility to charge rents at 80% of local market rents in order to maximise delivery of new homes, but landlords should take into account a number of factors, including the proposed reforms of the welfare system.</p>

	<p pid="a.846W.8/1">The Irish sea is bounded by England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and these regions all have their own arrangements for monitoring and reporting on pollution in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/2">A number of UK statutory bodies have co-operated since 2007 to ensure that the monitoring of pollution in UK marine waters in the Irish sea is appropriately funded and carried out. The bodies involved are:</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/3" class="indent">in England and Wales: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Transport, Department of Energy and Climate Change, Welsh Assembly Government, Environment Agency and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency;</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/4" class="indent">in Scotland: Scottish Executive, Marine Scotland (formerly Fisheries Research Services), Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, and;</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/5" class="indent">in Northern Ireland: Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/6">Small amounts of monitoring may also be done by the Loughs Agency which is a cross border body partly supported by Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/7">A number of non-statutory bodies also measure pollution levels in the Irish sea, including marine institutes, universities, industries and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/8">The monitoring carried out by these bodies is brought together and co-ordinated through the UK Marine Monitoring and Assessment Strategy (UKMMAS), which has the goal of ensuring the cost-effective provision of the information needed for policy and management decisions to deliver the UK marine vision of clean, healthy, productive and biologically diverse seas. UKMMAS has recently published Charting Progress 2, an assessment of the state of UK seas, which also includes assessments of the status of the Irish sea available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/9" class="indent"><a href="http://chartingprogress.defra.gov.uk">http://chartingprogress.defra.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/10">The UK Government co-operate with the Irish Government in the framework of the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the North East Atlantic through participation in its Joint Assessment and Monitoring Programme. Regular joint assessments of the status of the various regions of the North East Atlantic are made. OSPAR has recently published its Quality Status Report 2010, which includes assessments of the state of pollution across the North-East Atlantic, including in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/11">The monitoring of pollution in the Irish sea is funded by a number of government bodies in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Funds are generally allocated on a national basis and support monitoring across all the seas within each administration's jurisdiction. It is not therefore possible to distinguish the specific amount of money allocated to monitoring pollution levels in the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/12">Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are monitored in the Irish sea under the Clean Seas Environmental Monitoring Programme. Levels are assessed in sediments and biota (shellfish and fish liver).</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/13">PCB results were incorporated in the Clean and Safe Seas chapter of Charting Progress 2 which was delivered in 2010. Results were also included in the Quality Status Report 2010 prepared by the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the marine environment of the North East Atlantic.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.8/14">These reports concluded, that despite these substances having been banned, exceedances of the environmental quality standards for PCBs at some sites are still being observed within the Irish sea.</p>

	<p pid="a.857W.2/1">FITs rewards generators in proportion to the amount of electricity generated so there is a strong economic incentive to use efficient equipment and to site the installation optimally.</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.2/2">A requirement of feed-in tariffs (FITs) is that installations under 50 kW, including solar photovoltaics, must use installers and products accredited under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), or equivalent, to be eligible for FITs. MCS gives assurances about likely quality, durability and performance of installations. Solar photovoltaic installations of more than 50 kW are accredited by Ofgem under a process similar to the renewables obligation.</p>

	<p pid="a.863W.3/2">I am advised that on the basis of the information available prior to the consultation, the FSA estimated that full cost recovery for meat controls would cost the Welsh meat industry approximately &#163;2.2 million. In the draft impact assessment, the FSA has assumed that slaughterhouses will absorb approximately one-third of the cost associated with full recovery charging and farmers the remaining two-thirds. On this basis the FSA estimates that slaughterhouses, including low throughput establishments, will absorb approximately &#163;0.73 million of the cost, and pass on &#163;1.47 million to the livestock industry in Wales. The FSA will refine the impact assessment in light of information received in responses to the consultation.</p>

The White Paper &quot;Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot; proposes that the latter will become foundation trusts by 2013-14.

	<p pid="a.866W.11/1">The Government have decided to use the Bill to remove the private patient cap, which is both arbitrary and unfair in its effects: giving extensive freedoms to some trusts and imposing tight constraints on others, based solely on the historical accident of how much private income they earned in 2002-03. The Government are not persuaded that there is a case for imposing a new limit in the Bill on the amount of private income a foundation trust can earn as a proportion of its overall income. The Bill would not change a foundation trust's principal purpose of providing goods and services for the purposes of the national health service in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.2/3">BIS' facilities management service partners are contractually required to demonstrate active support to staff to improve their adult basic skills. This must include an initial assessment of staff and where found not to meet the criteria the service partner must make available suitable arrangements for appropriate training to assist them in attaining at least the basic level as part of their individual training plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/4">The Government's skills strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-16">16 November</phrase>, set out how BIS will also work with public sector bodies to encourage and support them to use public procurement as a lever to raise employers' engagement with skills and apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.2/9" class="indent">The Insolvency Service Executive Agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills adheres to current guidance by following Office of Government Commerce (OGC) recommendations, liaising with Buying Solutions specialists. It utilises OGC framework agreements where possible and advertises contracts via the Official Journal of the European Union where the whole-life value of the goods and services mandates this route.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/10" class="indent">The Insolvency Service is now embedding the Cabinet Office's 'Principles of Good Employment Practice' into its processes. In undertaking procurement activities, our trained procurement staff are mindful of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and are members of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply (CIPS).</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/11" class="indent">The Insolvency Service recently contacted all our suppliers of goods and services to encourage them to sign up to the Skills Pledge.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.2/13" class="indent">The majority of activity procured by the Skill Funding Agency (the Agency) is for education and vocational training rather than the provision of goods and services. All procurement of this activity will in future be undertaken through the Agency's Approved College and Training Organisation Register (ACTOR). Through this process the Agency ensures that providers that hold Agency contracts are committed to developing the skills of their staff. This includes monitoring those organisations that have Investors in People or the Training Quality Standard (TQS). Through the procurement process the Agency ensures that organisations use skilled staff for the delivery of education and training and commit to the continuous professional development of their staff. Furthermore, all trainers, verifiers and guidance suppliers are required to have formal qualifications, in order to practise.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/14" class="indent">In terms of the procurement of goods and service provision the Agency uses collaborative procurement where possible. These are purchased through pan-government frameworks, where the evaluation criteria (and all references to skills requirements, provision of apprenticeship places, and contract terms and conditions) are actually set by other public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.2/15" class="indent">Where the Agency does issue bespoke tenders, the goods and services tendering documentation has been updated to encourage its suppliers to support developing the skills of their staff, and where relevant, the use of Apprenticeships. The need to embed skills and Apprenticeships is considered separately for each procurement and, where relevant, the wording and evaluation criteria are strengthened.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.2/21" class="indent">Companies House's contracts are awarded in accordance with all relevant procurement legislation but, because of the nature of our business requirements, there are very few services for which we contract where promoting apprenticeships are applicable.</p>

Where the IPO issue bespoke tender requirements, our documentation will reflect the guidance by promoting skills and apprenticeships where relevant to the requirement. We have also specifically addressed this as part of our overall procurement strategy, along with other corporate social responsibility obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.877W.3/4" class="indent">1. Higher managerial and professional occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/5" class="indent">2. Lower managerial and professional occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/6" class="indent">3. Intermediate occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/7" class="indent">4. Small employers and own account workers</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/8" class="indent">5. Lower supervisory and technical occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/9" class="indent">6. Semi-routine occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/10" class="indent">7. Routine occupations</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/11">The performance indicator is the proportion of students from NS-SEC classes 4 to 7 out of those from NS-SEC 1-7.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/12">The low participation neighbourhood indicator has been produced using POLAR2 (Participation of Local AReas). This method is based on the HE participation rates of people who were aged 18 between 2000 and 2004 and entered a HE course in a UK higher education institution or GB further education college, aged 18 or 19, between academic years 2000/01 and 2005/06. It draws on data provided by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the Learning and Skills Council, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, the other UK funding bodies and HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.3/13">The POLAR2 classification is formed by ranking 2001 Census Area Statistics wards by their young participation rates for the combined 2000 to 2004 cohorts. This gives five young participation quintile groups of areas ordered from '1' (those wards with the lowest participation) to '5' (those wards with the highest participation), each representing 20% of UK young cohort. Students have been allocated to the neighbourhoods on the basis of their postcode. Those students whose postcode falls within wards with the lowest participation (quintile 1) are denoted as being from a low participation neighbourhood.</p>

	<p pid="a.882W.5/1">Co-operatives UK are currently seeking the views of all Post Office Ltd's major stakeholders on Post Office mutualisation. They will be providing a report to Ministers in the spring with options for how a mutualised Post Office might work. The National Federation of SubPostmasters has been actively involved in their research, however, I have had no substantive discussions with them on this topic since Co-operatives UK began their work.</p>

	<p pid="a.883W.5/1">The cost of establishing a Post Office bank would have three main components. First, the need for Government to capitalise Post Office Ltd (POL) to allow it to obtain a banking license and lend off of its own balance sheet. Second, exiting existing contractual arrangements relating to the provision of financial services through the post office network. Third, operational costs associated with setting up and running a new financial services unit within POL. The overall cost would depend on the remit and scope of operations of a Post Office bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.883W.8/1">The Government have looked carefully at the option of creating a state-backed Post Office bank. One of the main components of the cost of establishing a Post Office bank would be the need for Government to capitalise Post Office Ltd (POL) to allow it to obtain a banking license and lend off its own balance sheet.
