In accordance with their authorisation requirement, Sonae is required to report incidents likely to have an effect on the community. The three prosecutions in 2004 concerned a failure to monitor emissions, failure to comply with an enforcement notice, and failure to comply with an information notice.

However, this was a separate premises from the site of the outbreak (although adjacent to it) and was placed under appropriate restrictions only while it was used to cull the birds. The meat processing plant which was also adjacent to the infected premises was never placed under restrictions. Once culling was completed, it was re-licensed to operate only after being thoroughly cleansed and disinfected and inspected by the SVS and Meat Hygiene Service so that it could not pose any disease risk to either poultry or humans.</p>

	<p pid="a.1525W.5/1">We have already introduced two sets of regulations to encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise, recycle and recover packaging and reduce packaging waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/2">The Packaging Regulations have helped to reduce the amount of packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging and packaging waste being generated in the first place. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and recommend ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/3">My Department continues to engage with retailers and the food industry to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste generated by the industry itself and by consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/4">In particular, DEFRA's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), published in April 2006, challenges the food manufacturing sector to reduce its own waste by 15-20 per cent. by 2010. 13 major grocery retailers (representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector) have also signed up to the &quot;Courtauld Commitment&quot;, agreeing to work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in order to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/5" class="indent">(i) design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/6" class="indent">(ii) deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/7" class="indent">(iii) identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/8">Each retailer signed up to the Commitment has been developing its own programme of work with WRAP to reduce packaging and packaging waste. A number of retailers have now announced their own specific performance targets on waste and other environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/9">In addition, several food and drink brandsand manufacturers, including some confectionary manufacturers, have now signed up to the Courtauld Commitment. WRAP will shortly be announcing further details.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/10">WRAP also provides technical and financial support to retailers and suppliers through an innovation fund. This is helping to identify ways of reducing the weight of primary packaging and the cost of production and transportation, mainly through research and development and innovative packaging design.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.5/11">Importantly, DEFRA, working with WRAP and the devolved administrations, has recently secured the agreement of UK retailers to reduce the overall environmental impact of their carrier bags by 25 per cent. by the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1526W.2/1">DEFRA is currently carrying out a review of rabies import policy to ensure that UK controls on all rabies-susceptible mammals are proportionate and sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526W.2/2">The review is nearing completion. The evidence received so far from government vets, officials and veterinary risk assessments indicates that our current controls may no longer be proportionate to the risk of rabies entering the UK. Therefore, we may need to consider modernising processes and regulation in this area. Our controls must also be consistent with current thinking on better regulation. I have requested further views before reaching conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1527W.9/1">In its Communication to the Council and Parliament of February 2004, which set out the components of the Galileo programme, the European Commission evaluated the costs of the current development and deployment stage as &euro;3.2 billion.

	<p pid="a.1533W.5/1">Supporting a free, fair and inclusive election process is a core commitment of the Government of National Unity and the International Community under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and it is important that both sides deliver on their commitments. The first step is for the National Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) to formulate the Election Law and for this to be passed by the National Assembly. The Election Law will establish the National Electoral Commission which will be responsible for the running of the elections. DFID and other donors have provided support to the NCRC to assist in preparation of the Election Law. Once the Election Law is passed a full programme of election support will be provided jointly with other donors. This will include training for the National Assembly in Election Law to ensure effective scrutiny of the Election Bill, and support for a monitoring and observation process to ensure effective oversightof the preparations for elections, and the electionthemselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533W.5/2">DFID has already provided support for the consultations around the elections process, nationally and in the South. We have also sponsored a visit for four members of the NCRC to observe the Scottish Elections on <phrase class="date" code="">3 May</phrase>. This will provide an opportunity for Sudanese officials to witness a &quot;mixed&quot; electoral system in operation, a model which may be applicable for Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533W.5/3">DFID is also working with the embassy on a joint programme to boost the capacity of political parties, and to provide training for journalists on the reporting of elections. Together, we have initiated a working group with members from the international community in Khartoum, which meets regularly to ensure that we are approaching this task together.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534W.2/1">DFID pledged $545 million in Oslo for the period 2005-07. Actual disbursement has been much higher; DFID disbursed over $500 million during 2005-06, and our financial commitment for 2007 is $205 million. We are seeking greater clarity on the exact status of other donors' pledges. From figures available we believe that most donors have also honoured or exceeded their Oslo pledges. At the recent Sudan Consortium held in Khartoum and Juba on 19-<phrase class="date" code="">21 May</phrase>, the international community re-iterated its commitment to helping Sudan implement the comprehensive peace agreement. DFID will continue to track closely levels of development assistance to Sudan through effective dialogue with other donors both in-country and at headquarters level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534W.2/2">Unfortunately the ongoing conflict in Darfur has meant that the bulk of donor resources are being used for humanitarian assistance, rather than reconstruction. We have made it clear to the Government of National Unity that a resolution to the conflict in Darfur is essential if international donor assistance is to be directed towards long-term development in Sudan.</p>

Naturally, this will affect the rate at which the Fund is able to commit and spend money in all the areas it supports. The Department has made no assessment of the likely impact on any particular area, as future programmes are for the Big Lottery Fund to design. However, the Government's intention is that no existing lottery project will be affected, and we have also agreed with the Big Lottery Fund that resources for the voluntary sector will be protected. On the basis of the Department's current income projections, the Fund should still receive approximately &pound;2 billion in fresh Lottery income during the four financial years in which the proposed transfers to the OLDF will be made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1542W.5/2">We have not made predictions about the likely level of change in participation; however the Government have set a very stretching PSA target to increase by3 per cent. by 2008 the number of people from priority groups who participate in sport. PSA targets beyond 2008 have not yet been set.</p>

These courses focus on the attitudes of young adults, many of whom will soon become drivers. The PSNI ran 19 &quot;Roadsafe Roadshows&quot; during the current school year, attended by almost 11,000 young people, depicting how a night out could end in tragedy.

	<p pid="a.1560W.5/1">BSkyB has made substantive representations on its shareholding in ITV to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and to Ofcom in the context of the respective investigations these bodies have carried out into that matter. The reports submitted by the OFT and Ofcom to the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">Friday 27 April</phrase> contain summaries of the representations they received, including those received from BSkyB. Section 107(3)(b) and 107(3)(ba) of the Enterprise Act 2002 require the Secretary of State to publish the reports submitted by the OFT and Ofcom. Section 107(9)(a) of the Enterprise Act 2002 requires that these reports shall be published no later than the publication of the Secretary of State's decision on whether to make a reference to the Competition Commission. In accordance with section 118 of the Enterprise Act 2002, suitable excisions will be made to the reports of the OFT and Ofcom prior to their publication. The excisions will be primarily in respect of the consideration specified in section 244(3)(a) of the Enterprise Act 2002 which concerns the exclusion of commercial information whose disclosure might significantly harm the legitimate business interests of the undertaking to which it relates.</p>

	<p pid="a.1561W.0/16">In both Bury St. Edmunds constituency and Suffolk county council area the stock of VAT registered businesses has increased each year since 1997, as registrations have exceeded de-registrations throughout this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561W.0/17">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997.

	<p pid="a.1572W.8/1">We are currently reviewing funding arrangements from 2008-09 for schools and post-16 providers including school sixth forms. Our proposals are contained in two funding consultation documents: the 'School, Early years and 14-16 funding consultation' which deals with funding up to the age of 16, and 'Delivering World Class Skills in a Demand Led System' which covers all post-16 learning funded through the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The post-16 consultation ended at the end of March and the pre-16 consultation closes at the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572W.8/2">Under the funding methodology proposed for sixth forms, which would also apply to provision delivered in colleges, the estimated per pupil cost of a young person studying a typical programme of five GCSEs or three A levels is &pound;4,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572W.8/3">Work is under way to develop comparable per pupil cost figures for diplomas but is not yet finalised. This will need to take account of the diploma specifications for the first five diploma lines which should be available this September.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572W.8/4">The Department has carried out modelling work based on five local authorities to illustrate what additional per pupil funding schools might need for Diplomas at Key Stage 4. Based on that work the Average Weighted Pupil Unit (AWPU) for a pupil taking up a diploma would be 1.3 times the AWPU of a child not taking up diploma provision.</p>

The Chancellor's budget announcement statement concerning the removal of VAT constraints for current academies and those planned for the future enables the scope of these buildings' use to be extended and future buildings can now be designed with community use in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574W.6/2">These changes will further strengthen the effectiveness and value for money of the academies programme as it continues to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574W.6/3">The Department will continue an open dialogue with colleagues at HM Treasury about VAT policy and other matters. However, we must be mindful that European Union VAT agreements, signed by successive Governments, mean that while the UK can retain existing zero rates, such as that for charitable buildings, it cannot extend these or introduce any new VAT reliefs.</p>

The company has also challenged an unspecified number of complaints.</p>

In accordance with their authorisation requirement, Sonae is required to report incidents likely to have an effect on the community. The three prosecutions in 2004 concerned a failure to monitor emissions, failure to comply with an enforcement notice, and failure to comply with an information notice. In total, these resulted in &pound;13,000 worth of fines.</p>

	<p pid="a.1592W.3/1">The Government are committed to improving the life chances of disabled people, including disabled children, so that they have opportunities and choices that enable them to participate in fully in society. We also want to ensure that every parent of a disabled child or young person has access to, and is aware of, the financial support available to contribute towards extra cost benefits, principal among these being Disability Living Allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/2">The Office for Disability Issues (ODI) will be working across Government to drive forward the development and implementation of policy to improve the lives of disabled people, including disabled children. It has a project looking specifically at strategic and inclusive ways of improving information provision to disabled people, with an emphasis on recommending and developing ways to involve the users of information in designing and tailoring it to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/3">The Disability and Carer's Service (DCS) is an agency that continues to focus on delivering improved services to disabled people and carers in Great Britain. This includes improving the information provided to customers and their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/4">DCS has established the Family Carers Group. This is a forum which allows DCS to engage and involve voluntary and community organisations in representing the needs of children, and young people who are customers of Disability Living Allowance, as well as their families and carers, in the transformation of DCS services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/5">DCS actively promotes services to children through a number of outreach events specifically aimed at children to raise awareness about the benefits to which disabled children may be entitled. These included 'Kidz up North' on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-30">30 November 2006</phrase> and 'Kidz South' on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>. Both of these were events aimed at families of children with disabilities and on each occasion DCS provided an exhibition stand with staff to answer questions and provide literature on benefits available to disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595W.5/1">Diagnosis of coeliac disease can be difficult for general practitioners as the symptoms are common to many other conditions. Improvements in diagnosis have therefore concentrated on raising awareness of this condition among health professionals and the general public. The PRODIGY website <a href="http://www.prodigy.nhs.uk">www.prodigy.nhs.uk</a> contains specific information useful for health professionals and people who have been newly diagnosed with the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595W.5/2">There is no specific treatment for those living with coeliac disease. However, symptoms can be kept under control with a strict gluten-free diet. Most people with coeliac disease receive advice from their general practitioner (GP) on self-management of their condition, and specifically on the exclusion of foods containing gluten from their diet. A wide range of gluten-free foods are available on national health service prescription and these may be prescribed where a GP considers it necessary to ensure effective self-management of the condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1602W.5/1">The most recent information available on folate intakes is from the 2000-01 National Diet and Nutrition Survey of adults aged 19-64 years. In this survey households in receipt of income-related state benefits can be used as a broad indicator of socio-economic group. The survey shows that mean folate intakefrom food sources in women of child bearing age(19-49 years) living in households in which someone was in receipt of benefits was 214 micrograms/day. When the contribution of folic acid supplements was included mean intake in this group increased to 221 micrograms/day. This level of intake is below the recommendation for women who could become pregnant to take a 400 micrograms/folic acid supplement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1606W.5/1">These computerised cognitive behavioural therapies (cCBT) packages were reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), in Technology Appraisal 097 in February 2006. NICE recommended the use of Beating the Blues in the management of mild to moderate depression and FearFighter as an option for delivering cognitive behavioural therapy in managing panic and phobia.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.5/2">NICE decided that there was insufficient evidence for it to recommend the use of COPE and Overcoming Depression as clinically or cost-effective options for managing depression, except as part of ongoing or new clinical trials that are designed to generate robust, relevant data on the clinical effectiveness of these specific cCBT packages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.5/3">OCFighter (previously known as BTSteps) was not recommended for delivering cognitive behavioural therapy in managing obsessive compulsive disorder. Where people are currently using OCFighter, whether as routine therapy or as part of a clinical trial, they should be allowed to choose to continue this therapy until the patient, general practitioner and/or specialist, consider it appropriate to stop. NICE will consider reviewing this guidance in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.5/4">We have worked with suppliers and the National Health Service Purchasing and Supplies Agency in negotiating a framework agreement and tariff to ensure that the NHS can provide Beating the Blues and FearFighter in a cost effective and value for money way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1606W.5/5">Information on the number of referrals made for cCBT is not collected centrally. However, as part of the implementation guidance which we launched on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March</phrase>, a demand estimate tool has been developed which helps commissioners to establish the likely demand for cCBT in their local areas. This calculates the number of people who are likely to have mental heath conditions which will respond to cCBT, like depression or phobias and also estimates the number who might want to use this technology.</p>

	<p pid="a.1607W.2/1">Since the publication of the &quot;National Service Framework for Mental Health&quot; in 1999, mental health services in England have seen significant improvements, particularly in access to specialist community-based services that aim to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and the length of in-patient stays. However, in-patient services remain a key element of mental health service provision and a national acute in-patient mental health programme, which is hosted by the Care Services Improvement Partnership and supported by its regional infrastructure, is helping local services in implementing the Department's policy implementation guidance on published in 2002. The Department has also announced that over 2006-07 and 2007-08,&pound;130 million of extra capital investment would be targeted to upgrade the mental health estate, particularly in improving psychiatric intensive care units and places of safety for assessment under the Mental Health Act 1983 and enhancing the sexual safety of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1607W.2/2">In recognition of the important role they play in promoting and facilitating social inclusion, the Department published a good practice guidance on commissioning of day services in 2006. The aim of this guidance is to improve access to mainstream opportunities for people with mental health problems in closer partnership with other agencies and organisations including the voluntary and community sector. The national social inclusion programme, also hosted by the Care Services Improvement Partnership and supported by its regional infrastructure, is helping local services in implementing this guidance in line with their assessment of local need.</p>

	<p pid="a.1609W.6/1">Women who experience mental health problems during or after pregnancy can access the full range of mental health services available in primary and secondary care. The Department has issued guidance, &quot;Mainstreaming gender and women's mental health: implementation guidance&quot; (DH, 2003), that highlights the need for effective perinatal psychiatric care, specifically the need to develop local care pathways, maternity and psychiatry protocols, access to perinatal psychiatric assessment and adequate mother and baby unit provision based on assessment of local need. Care services improvement partnership's national programme on gender equality and women's mental health is helping local services to implement the recommendations of this guidance. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) also made recommendations in its recent guidance, &quot;Antenatal and postnatal mental health&quot; (NICE, 2007) to improve services for women who experience mental health problems during or after pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1609W.6/2">The Department has not funded any such research. However, the Medical Research Council (MRC), which is one of the main agencies through which the United Kingdom Government supports medical and clinical research, has recently funded a study entitled &quot;Comparison of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in depressed and healthy pregnant women&quot;. The study was led by Dr. Veronica Keane at the Institute of Psychiatry and received MRC funding of &pound;157,700. It was completedin 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1609W.6/3">The study found results suggesting that depressed women had higher cortisol stress hormones, particularly a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy (corticotropin releasing-hormone) and that this was associated with earlier delivery of babies in the depressed women. The applicants intend to submit follow up studies to the MRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1609W.6/4">The Government do not routinely and systematically compare the research it funds in different disease areas with equivalent research in other countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1610W.2/1">The definition of burden of disease used for the previous reply is one of a number of possible definitions. It includes one element, diabetes prevalence, which is not age related, and thereforedoes include persons aged 75 and over. The otherthree measures are premature mortality rates for major killer diseases. They reflect the current public service agreement targets to reduce cancer and circulatory disease death rates in people aged under 75 by 2010. It is in the under 75 age group where the earliest signsof progress are likely to be seen, although thehealth interventions to reduce mortality in this age group will also have a beneficial effect on people aged 75 and over.</p>

	<p pid="a.1616W.2/1">10 days has no particular significance in relation to the answering of parliamentary questions. As any period of 10 days will include at least one weekend and may also include other days on which the House of Commons may not be sitting and questions cannot be answered, it is a meaningless yardstick against which to measure performance in answering questions. In 2006-07, questions tabled shortly before the Christmas, February and Easter recesses did not fall for answer until after the 10-day point.</p>

	<p pid="a.1626W.2/1">The figure of &pound;130 is an estimate of the rate of the pension credit guarantee informed by the Treasury's latest projections for average earnings growth, which are consistent with the assumptions for trend output growth published in chapter B of the 2007 FSBR. The precise rate will be set in the usual way in due course by the annual uprating order, which is subject to affirmative resolution with debates in both Houses. The White Paper, &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; (May 2006) set out the Government's intention to uprate the pension credit guarantee in line with earnings over the long-term and factored this in to the overall projected costs of state pension reform.

	<p pid="a.1631W.0/1">The aggregates levy ensures that the external costs associated with exploitation of aggregate are reflected in the price of aggregate. The price increase reduces demand for and encourages efficient use of freshly quarried aggregate materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1631W.0/2">The levy is also structured to promote use of alternatives to virgin aggregates from more sustainable sources, such as recycled demolition waste and slate waste, by granting these materials exemption from the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1631W.0/3">The levy is part of a package of environmental measures (including the landfill tax and climate change levy) designed to encourage more efficient processes, environmental awareness and sustainable development. Research shows the levy, as part of this package, is helping meet the Government's policy aims. For example, Great Britain has seen a reduction in sales of virgin aggregate by around 18 million tonnes between 2001 and 2005 and an increases in the use of recycled aggregate in England of around 5.5 million tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1637W.2/1">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Working Group on Bribery regularly publicises aspects of its work, for example by press statements on the Group's country monitoring reports. Such press statements are discussed and agreed in plenary by all members of the group. However, the group operates under an understanding that the country being monitored has the right to comment on the text, but foregoes its right to block the final text.</p>
	<p pid="a.1637W.2/2">As the hon. Member is aware, recent meetings of this group in January and March have discussed, among other subjects, the circumstances surrounding the discontinuance of the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into allegations about BAE Systems' activities in Saudi Arabia. At the end of both the January and March meetings, the group agreed a press statement on the UK under the established procedure described above. In the run-up to and during these meetings, British officials discussed with the OECD Secretariat and partner OECD governments various relevant aspects including possible options for press communications, and how those might be organised. This included proposals for a formal press briefing at the end of the March meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1637W.2/3">Since the March meeting of the Working Group, there have been no formal press communications proposed. British officials have therefore made no further representations concerning the group's media activities.</p>

The confidential nature of that procedure prevents us from commenting on any details of the cases, and on the position taken by the UK. We do, however, emphasise strongly our deep concern over persistent violations of human rights in both Uzbekistan and Iran, and our corresponding belief that the UN should address these situations. For that reason, the UK co-sponsored the resolution passed by the UN General Assembly last autumn on the human rights situation in Iran; and the attempted resolution on the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, which unfortunately failed to pass a vote in the General Assembly's Third Committee, also last autumn. The independent UN Special Rapporteurs on Human Rights questions have frequently commented on issues in Iran and Uzbekistan in the course of their work; that work continues.</p>
