The Head of Policy is the Director's deputy, and leads the policy team day to day. The team as a whole comprises four people, and as a small team, responsibilities are carried out flexibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.10/5">The policy team advises the IPSA Board on a range of policies and issues. It has taken the lead in the development and maintenance of the MPs' Expenses Scheme, and associated reviews and consultation, including the current review of MPs' staffing needs. The team will lead the policy work on MPs' pay and, when IPSA receives the powers, MPs' pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.365W.10/6">The Director also has a role as a member of the IPSA executive's senior leadership team, providing direction and support to the organisation as a whole. The Director chairs IPSA's contingency panel, which meets weekly, to consider any contingency applications from MPs. The Head of Policy will chair the panel meetings in the Director's absence.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.2/5">Through the MPs' Expenses Scheme, IPSA has put in place a set of rules, underpinned by the principle of independent regulation, which we believe will contribute to the restoration of public confidence in the manner in which MPs' expenses and costs are reimbursed.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.2/6">We undertook a poll of the public as part of the annual review of the MPs' Expenses Scheme in November 2010 and a majority of respondents believed that IPSA would ensure that MPs were only paid legitimate expenses. We will carry out further surveys as part of our regular review of the expenses scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.2/7">A recent survey commissioned by the National Audit Office found that 55% of the general public felt that the situation with regard to MPs' expenses had improved in the last year.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.2/1">The Government are committed to working with our international partners to improve the conservation of high seas biodiversity. The UK played a key role in the establishment in 2010 of six High Seas Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the North East Atlantic under the OSPAR Convention, building on the work that established the world's first High Seas MPA under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.2/2">The UK fully supports the United Nations General Assembly resolutions 61/105 and 64/72, particularly as they relate to the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems from the impact of bottom fishing on the high seas. The UK has worked within the EU to review the actions that have been taken to date and what still needs to be done to ensure the long term protection of these ecosystems and deep-sea species.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.2/3">Progress has been made, for example, in establishing an access regime for vessels engaged in deep-sea fishing, in the North East Atlantic and on the protection of the high seas where no regional fisheries management organisation exists. However, more work is needed in a number of areas, for example to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.2/4">Through the International Whaling Commission, the UK will continue to strongly support the moratorium on commercial whaling, introduced in 1985/86 and will continue to work with other countries to achieve greater conservation and protection of cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.2/5">However, the Government recognise that threats to high seas biodiversity are increasing and further work is required. In the Government's Natural Environment White-Paper we have set out a commitment to work towards delivering a new global mechanism to regulate the conservation of marine biodiversity in the high seas. We consider that such an agreement, working within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should set up a clear means of designating High Seas Marine Protected Areas, building on the work undertaken in Regional Seas Agreements, such as OSPAR.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.2/6">We have already made progress on this issue. Working in co-operation with other nations we secured agreement for the United Nations General Assembly to consider, at their meeting in September 2011, a recommendation to consider the need for a new multilateral agreement which would cover MPAs, and environmental impact assessments for deep sea activities. The UK, working with our EU partners and other nation states, is committed to press for a global response to the management of high seas biodiversity and sees this recommendation as a key step in the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.5/1">It is a condition of payment under the single payment scheme that farmers have to meet a range of environmental standards known as cross compliance. These include a requirement for farmers to adhere to specific regulations in the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) (No 2) Regulations 2006. These regulations are designed to protect uncultivated land and semi-natural areas from being damaged by agricultural work. They also guard against possible negative environmental effects from the restructuring of rural land holdings. The regulations apply to projects that are greater than two hectares, but this threshold can be disapplied where it is thought that a project of less than 2 ha may have a significant impact on the environment (for example, this may be due to the particularly high environmental quality of the land or the cumulative impact of the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.5/2">Cross compliance also requires farmers to avoid over grazing or unsuitable supplementary feeding on natural or semi-natural vegetation.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.5/3">There is a broader obligation in the EU rules governing cross compliance that member states need to monitor the proportion of agricultural land that is &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; and maintain levels of &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; above a minimum ratio, set on a historic basis. However the EU definition of &#8216;permanent pasture&#8217; does not distinguish between natural/semi-natural grassland of high environmental value and enriched and reseeded grassland of low environmental value so provides little protection to the former. The Task Force on Farming Regulation recognised this failing in the current system. The UK will consider this issue as part of the forthcoming negotiations to reform the CAP.</p>

	<p pid="a.378W.3/1">Common Ragwort is one of five injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959. The Act does not make it illegal to have weeds growing on land, but provides that the Secretary of State can serve an enforcement notice for the occupier to take action to prevent the spread of weeds to neighbouring land. If an occupier of land unreasonably fails to comply with an enforcement notice, he or she may be guilty of an offence, and, on conviction, liable to a fine.</p>

Their strategic approach, supported by HMRC's new anti-avoidance strategy, was set out in the Budget document 'Tackling Tax Avoidance'. The Government's commitment to tackling avoidance has been underlined by their reinvestment of &#163;917 million in HMRC which will enable it to better tackle tax avoidance and evasion.</p>

This allows the UK to reduce the interest rate on our bilateral loan to Ireland, while ensuring all the benefit goes to Ireland and not to higher interest rates paid to euro area governments. The amount by which the interest rate will be reduced is under consideration. The Government will still be more than covering the cost of their borrowing.

	<p pid="a.399W.7/3">This Government are committed to eradicating child poverty in the UK by 2020. We published our first child poverty strategy, &#8220;A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives&#8221;, covering the period to 2014, in April this year. It sets out a new approach to tackling poverty and securing, social justice aimed at transforming lives and tackling the causes of poverty. At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, tackling worklessness and benefit dependency and increasing children's life chances, with tailored support to overcome barriers and a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.7/4">Our strategy establishes a UK-wide framework for tackling child poverty. It confirms our intention to support local authorities and their partners in meeting their duties under the Child Poverty Act 2010 to assess child poverty needs in their areas and publish strategies to reduce its level and mitigate its effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.399W.7/5">We are working with local authorities to develop new ways of pooling budgets and commissioning and delivering services through initiatives such as Community Budgets (Birmingham is a Community Budget area), Social Return on Investment and Payment by Results. We are drawing on our strong local networks to embed an evidence-based focus on what works best in sustainably eradicating child poverty, including sharing evidence from across the suite of child poverty pilots (which included a child poverty innovation pilot in North Warwickshire, a teenage parents in supported housing pilot in Worcestershire) and to ensure local experiences are properly reflected in the development of our national policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.402W.2/1">The principal VAT directive, which governs the application of VAT in the European Union requires member states to apply a VAT exemption to certain activities in the public interest, including supplies of sporting services by non-profit making organisations. Subscription fees charged by non-profit-making golf clubs are therefore exempt from VAT. The exemption does not extend to subscription fees received by proprietary (profit-making) clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.402W.2/2">HMRC consider that, under UK law, green fees paid by non-members to both non-profit-making and proprietary clubs are taxable. In a recent decision, the First Tier Tribunal found that green fees paid by non-members to non-profit making golf clubs were exempt. HMRC has been given leave to appeal this decision to the Upper Tier Tribunal and businesses should continue to treat these green fees as taxable pending a decision of the Upper Tier Tribunal.</p>
