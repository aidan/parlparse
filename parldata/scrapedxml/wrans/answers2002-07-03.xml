	<p pid=".314W.7/2">Over the last 10 years English Heritage has grant-aided 295 properties in London. Of these 166 were administered under the Historic Buildings and Monuments Act 1953. These grants are conditional on the provision of public access. The level of access depends on the circumstances of the case and the size of the grant. Opening arrangements for the properties which receive grants are available on English Heritage's website at <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk">www.english-heritage.org.uk</a> and in &quot;Hudson's Historic Houses and Gardens&quot; directory.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.7/3">Grants to the remaining 129 properties were administered under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Local Government Act 1985 for exterior work and essential structural repairs. These grants were to Grade II listed buildings or buildings in conservation areas. There is no automatic access requirement, although some of these properties are open to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.7/4">Since 1994 the Heritage lottery fund has made 238 awards to historic buildings in London. Public access is an important consideration in awarding grants. The Heritage lottery fund recognises the central role of access in achieving its overall aim to use heritage funding to improve people's quality of life. The organisation is committed to developing the widest possible constituency for heritage, and to promoting access, equality of opportunity and inclusion in all activities.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.3/1">The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year rate (the hybrid) estimate, is now &pound;9,800 million. Since the 2001 estimate and leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&pound;11 million), there has been a real cost increase of &pound;25 million. This increase derives principally from additional costs associated with dockyard projects and with missiles and related equipment, offset by a reduced acquisition cost for the four submarines. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-30">30 September 2001</phrase> represented over 98 per cent. of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &pound;14,376 million.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.3/2">The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &pound;3.7 billion at current prices.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.3/3">The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.3/4">Three in-service Vanguard class submarines are successfully maintained for continuous at-sea deterrence, with the fourth, HMS Vanguard, now undergoing a planned major overhaul.</p>

A revised and final draft contract was passed to our partners earlier this month. We very much hope that all partner nations will confirm within the next few weeks that they are content for the contract to be signed. Germany will need also to sign the Meteor Memorandum of Understanding, which has already been signed by the other five partner nations.</p>

Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase>, the Harrier GR7 is being upgraded to GR9 standard as this best meets our capability requirements. The Ministry of Defence has not conducted a formal evaluation of the capabilities offered by the Harrier II plus programme, but understands that the main capability difference between the Harrier GR9 and the Harrier II plus is in the latter's nose- mounted radar.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.0/2">While it would, in theory, be possible to mount a radar in the nose of the GR9, we currently have no requirement to do so. Therefore, no detailed work has been undertaken by the MOD into the practicality and cost-effectiveness of such a modification.</p>
	<p pid=".324W.0/3">Such a programme would be at least as complex, lengthy and costly as the Sea Harrier Blue Vixen/ AMRAAM update in the mid-90s. Given the likely considerable cost, time scale and technical risk involved, and the planned entry into service of the Future Joint Combat Aircraft in 2012, the benefits of integrating a radar on to the GR9 Harrier would be of limited duration and utility. Such a programme would also delay the integration of the smart weapons on to the Harrier GR9 required to enable it to continue to conduct its primary role of the delivery of offensive air power from land and sea.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.5/1">In accordance with the wishes of Buckingham Palace and the direction of the Government it was agreed that there would be no undue expenditure from public funds. The sum of &pound;1.5 million was allocated from the budget of the Royal Naval Base Commander, Portsmouth, towards core project costs and any additional costs will lie where they fell. It will be some months before an accurate assessment of this expenditure could be made, but it will consist primarily of additional travel and subsistence costs.</p>

Personnel eligible for treatment under the scheme are ATRA trainers or trainees who are referred by their unit general practitioner for investigation, opinion and/or treatment for a condition which is preventing them from continuing with their employment/training. Personnel are referred only when waiting lists at the local Ministry of Defence hospital unit or NHS hospital are deemed excessive. The vast majority of these are Army personnel; a small number of RN and RAF personnel might have been included who were posted to ATRA units, either as trainers or trainees, but these cannot be readily identified. Records held do not allow for numbers treated per month to be easily identified, as an individual may well be treated over a period and therefore feature in more than one month's figures.

	<p pid=".341W.2/1">The Treasury in all cases purchases on a best value for money basis. Until recently the cost and quality of recycled paper did not provide this compared to virgin paper from sustainable sources and therefore only limited amounts were purchased.</p>

	<p pid=".345W.2/1">Under the Postal Services Act (2000), the Postal Services Commission (known as Postcomm) was created, as an independent regulatory authority for the licensing of postal services. Postcomm administers a licensed area, broadly equivalent to the former Post Office statutory monopoly for letters weighing less than 350g and costing less than &pound;1. In March 2001, Postcomm granted Consignia a licence to provide services in the licensed area.</p>
	<p pid=".345W.2/2">Under the Act, it is for Postcomm to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators, subject to its primary responsibility to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at a uniform tariff. Under its statutory powers Postcomm may introduce competition by issuing licenses or by recommending &quot;further exemptions&quot; or reductions to the licensed area.</p>
	<p pid=".345W.2/3">In April 2001, Postcomm initially established an interim licensing policy pending a wideranging consultation exercise on how to introduce competition into the market. Postcomm has issued 10 other licences for niche services under this policy. Following the conclusion of its consultation Postcomm announced its decision on competition on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-29">29 May 2002</phrase>. The effect of that decision is to extend Postcomm's licensing policy to open the postal market to competition in three stages over four years. The first stage to open one third of the market will take effect from January 2003 with increased opportunities for competition in the licensed area and progression to full market opening by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".345W.5/1">The Government are committed to the maintenance of a nationwide network of post offices and placed a formal requirement on the Post Office in November 2000 to maintain the network and to prevent any avoidable closures of rural post offices. We are in regular contact with Post Office Limited about a range of issues relating to the future of the network.</p>
	<p pid=".345W.5/2">The Government have invested &pound;480 million in a modernisation programme to computerise the whole of the post office network. We have made available a &pound;2 million fund to support volunteer and community initiatives to maintain or re-open post office facilities in rural areas where traditional services would otherwise close. Figures for end May 2002 showed that 64 applications&mdash;to a value of &pound;500,000&mdash;had been assessed and approved and to that date payments of &pound;231,000 had also been made.</p>
	<p pid=".345W.5/3">In addition, we have received advice from the Postal Services Commission on transitional financial assistance for the rural network and proposals are being developed in the context of that advice.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/1">As with all UK civil nuclear sites, well developed and regularly tested arrangements for responding to an emergency at Bradwell Power Station are in place as part of the licensing requirements imposed by HSE's nuclear installations inspectorate. Detailed emergency plans are prepared for an area within the 2.4 km detailed emergency planning zone for Bradwell. Mersea Island is outside the detailed emergency planning zone for Bradwell; the boundary of this zone is defined in relation to the most significant release of radiation from an accident which can be seen through reasonably foreseeable scenarios and is derived from the safety case established for the site. Beyond this, plans must be capable of being extended to deal with larger, less likely events. This principle of extendibility is an important part of civil nuclear emergency response arrangements. Use is made of the general plans prepared by the police, local authority and other agencies for a wide range of events. These do not provide for the detailed estimation of evacuation times which would need to take into account the circumstances at the time: ie time of day, prevailing weather conditions and the state of the tide.</p>

The final stage in the implementation of the Directive is <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>. The controls will then apply to all petrol stations in the UK with an annual throughput greater than 100m <sup>3</sup> . In 1998 it was estimated that this derogation would exempt approximately 136 sites in the UK. However, the total number of petrol stations in the UK since 1998 has decreased, from 13,758 to 13,043 in 2000. As petrol station closures often have a disproportionate impact on the smaller sites, it is likely that the number of petrol stations covered by the derogation has decreased since the data were gathered.</p>
	<p pid=".350W.5/3">The directive also contains an option for member states to exempt larger sites, those with an annual throughput of less than 500m <sup>3</sup> , if located in an area where vapour emissions are unlikely to contribute significantly to environmental or health problems. My Department and the devolved Administrations are currently looking at applying the derogation in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".358W.2/1">Negotiation of the contracts is a matter for London Underground. However, in general, it is common for the terms of a contract to change as a result of negotiation. Office of Government Commerce guidance states that the principle governing risk transfer is not to transfer all possible risks, but rather to allocate risk to whomever from the public or private sector is able to manage it at least cost. London Transport has sought to act in line with this guidance in the course of its negotiations with bidders for the London Underground PPPs.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.2/2">I understand the contracts provide that, in certain circumstances where a private sector infrastructure company persistently breaches the contract and no alternative contractor can be found, London Underground can take control of the infrastructure company at a price that allows for 95 per cent. of approved third-party bank and bond debt to be repaid. None of the finance provided by the shareholders would be repaid. London Transport considers these contract provisions to be in line with its aim of optimising value for money overall, balancing the cost of raising finance against the need to provide the private sector with a strong incentive to meet contractual obligations to improve performance. London Underground's obligations under the PPP contracts will initially be backed by a guarantee from London Regional Transport. It is the Government's intention to transfer London Underground to Transport for London in line with the provisions of the GLA Act 1999, and London Regional Transport's guarantee will be transferred to Transport for London at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.2/3">The Secretary of State also intends to issue a letter of comfort in relation to the London Underground PPPs. This is intended to clarify his role in relation to the Greater London Authority and Transport for London, including his intentions towards providing funding in respect of London Underground. This letter of comfort was reported to Parliament using the Minute procedure on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-20">20 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".358W.2/4">Whether these arrangements constitute state aid is a matter for the European Commission in the context of the Government's notification to the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-12">12 April</phrase>.</p>

This will involve the characterisation of both noisemakers and noise sufferers so that a hard-hitting publicity campaign can communicate both how to deal with noise nuisance, and how to avoid creating it.</p>

	<p pid=".370W.5/1">We recognise that EU fleets are too large and that what is needed is a permanent reduction in tonnage. We therefore believe that where further cuts are needed, the priority must be to decommission vessels rather than to tie them up temporarily. If we return to present levels of fishing effort once stocks have recovered, we will simply recreate current problems of overfishing.</p>
	<p pid=".370W.5/2">We have not yet however had the opportunity to question the Commission about the detail of their calculations. Nonetheless, they have made clear that they do not seek to impose cuts in fleet capacity on Member States. Their figures which detail fleet cuts by Member States are to be taken as purely illustrative. It will be for Member States to decide what measures to introduce in response to the decisions taken by the Council on reducing fishing effort. The scale of decommissioning will also depend on the decisions taken by fishermen in the light of the impact of these measures. Fisheries Departments in the UK have however already been running decommissioning schemes this year and we would want these taken account of in any necessary reductions which are ultimately agreed.</p>

This is why I have been pressing the Commission to take action on this issue, particularly now that observations we have commissioned have demonstrated a dolphin by-catch problem in the pair trawl fishery for bass off south-west England. I was pleased to see recently that the Commission proposals for the reform of the CFP refer to the introduction by the end of 2002 of measures to reduce cetacean by-catch. We shall be looking for positive action on this in the course of the reform negotiations: we also intend to continue funding trials of adaptations to fishing gear that could reduce dolphin and porpoise by-catch.</p>

	<p pid=".372W.8/2">Government guidance on local authority waste targets and how they should plan to achieve them is set out in 'Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies', published by DETR in March 2001. However, it is for local authorities to decide on the nature and timing of any waste disposal contracts. I would expect such contracts to be designed to provide sufficient flexibility to be able to take account of, and respond to, changed circumstances during the lifetime of the contracts, including any future statutory performance standards or new opportunities for increasing recycling and composting. The Government have issued no specific guidance on future targets in the context of the current review of its waste strategy or the revision of the Packaging Directive.</p>

	<p pid=".376W.5/1">The relevant legislation is not new and it is some seven years since the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Time was allowed for organisations to meet the requirements of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/2">Since December 1996 it has been unlawful for service providers to treat disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability. And from <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-01">1 October 1999</phrase> service providers have been required to make reasonable adjustments to account for disabled people's needs such as providing extra help or changing the way they provide their services.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/3">From 2004 organisations such as village halls will have to make &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; to ensure access for disabled people. In any proceedings under the Act, the costs and practicability of any adjustments would be considered in relation to a service provider's ability to pay. The extent to which the adjustment actually improves access to the service and the importance of the service to disabled people would also be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/4">A large number of village halls in England already have access and facilities for disabled people although there are older halls that fall short of the requirements of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/5">There are a number of funds which can assist where appropriate, in addition to the community's own resources, fund raising and any assistance from the parish or town council. Local authorities that can help will include district, county and unitary authorities, depending on the arrangements in a particular locality. The Countryside Agency's Village Hall Loan Fund, administered by Action with Communities in Rural England can provide loans towards improvements for village halls. Loans are available over a period of up to five or eight years but may be longer in special cases where the need for an extended period is substantiated.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/6">The Countryside Agency also can offer assistance to village halls through the community service grants scheme delivered through the Vital Villages programme. It can help fund an alteration/extension of a village hall or other community building where this provides a new or extended service to the community.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.5/7">Other sources of public funding include regional development agencies, the Community Fund and the Sports Council. Many organisations achieve the necessary improvements through a mixture of funds including fund raising, commercial or personal sponsorship, parish council and local authority funding and contributions from other public funds as a result of expanding the activities available if improvements expand the suitability and use of the facilities, for instance for sport, or education or training for young people.</p>

Our target under Kyoto is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&ndash;12.

	<p pid=".382W.2/3">DEFRA are currently in the process of approving a project to develop a test using non-structural proteins to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals, and are examining its feasibility for use on a herd basis to detect exposed animals. Following on from this, a study will be undertaken to examine what would be an appropriate sampling regime to detect infection in vaccinated herds exposed to infection. However, at present, the test is not internationally recognised as a validated test.</p>

However, for convenience the data, without the footnotes, and supplemented by the respective level of energy consumption, are reproduced herein.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.8/2">The Government are keen to encourage the use of renewable energy on its estate and a significant step forward was made with the agreement, in May 2001, of the following renewable energy target across Government:</p>
	<p pid=".382W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;All Departments will ensure that, by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, at least 5 per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources that are exempt from the climate change levy, or from self-generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. This will rise to at least 10 per cent. supply from such sources by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>, but will be reviewed after <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> to take account of market conditions following the introduction of renewables obligation.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.8/4" class="indent">The review of 2003 will include consideration of increasing or bringing forward the target.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382W.8/5">Progress by individual Departments is partly dependent upon the expiry date for their current energy contracts. However, all central Government Departments in England report that they are in the process of considering how they will go about purchasing renewable energy or are considering self-generation options.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.0/2">My right hon. Friend has visited 33 schools in England since becoming Secretary of State last year. These schools are as listed. She also visited many schools in her previous ministerial posts between 1997 and 2001. Two of the schools she has visited as Secretary of State were designated by Ofsted as requiring special measures because they were failing to provide pupils with an acceptable standard of education. Just under 300 schools in England&mdash;less than 1.3 per cent. of the total&mdash;are currently designated by Ofsted as requiring special measures. A further 2.4 per cent. of schools are designated by Ofsted as having serious weaknesses.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.3/1">We are encouraging all schools to extend the services they offer for the benefit of pupils, their families and the wider community. The Education Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish a clear legal framework for schools wanting to provide extended services. We intend to publish guidance later this year to help schools and their partners develop this approach. We also intend to support a number of pathfinder projects to demonstrate a range of patterns in different settings. We will evaluate these projects and disseminate good practice.</p>

The Education (Teachers) Qualifications and Health Standards Regulations 1999 (as amended) allow schools to appoint overseas trained teachers without QTS in three circumstances: as trainees on an employment based route; as a temporary teacher in a school or a number of schools for up to four years without QTS; as 'instructors'&mdash;persons offering particular skills who may be appointed when no qualified teacher with such skills is available.</p>

Much has been achieved&mdash;the figures in the second annual threat assessment and strategy documents speak for themselves&mdash;but we are under no illusions that there is much more to be done. Fighting organised crime will be a long and hard struggle. This year, as it was last year, the priority areas for concerted multi-agency effort are extortion, drugs, oils-related fraud, tobacco and alcohol duty evasion and money laundering. In addition, we have added two new strategic priority areas: the trade in counterfeit goods, as this has an on-going potential to affect investment in Northern Ireland; and armed robbery, which is on the increase here, while declining elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".391W.9/2">No one should doubt that we have the resources and determination to pursue it to the utmost. The publication of the threat assessment and strategy for dealing with organised crime in Northern Ireland, shows that the agencies involved have made an impressive start.</p>

There are prescribed criteria and processes for returning children under this convention. The Hague Convention is in force between the UK and 54 other countries world wide.

	<p pid=".399W.2/1">The Hague Convention is the international instrument covering cases of child abduction. Cases of child abduction involving countries which are party to the Hague Convention are dealt with by the Lord Chancellor's Department in England and Wales. The Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Courts Service deal with their own cases. The FCO can become involved in Hague Convention cases where diplomatic intervention may be of assistance to families.</p>
	<p pid=".399W.2/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the lead Department for cases in countries which are not Party to the Hague Convention. In non-Hague Convention cases, there is no prescribed formula to facilitate the return of an abducted child. Therefore, parents must initiate proceedings in the local courts (and often also in the UK courts) for the return of their child. Consular staff, both in London and at our embassies and high commissions overseas, are able to assist parents in this procedure by, for example, helping them find a local lawyer, arranging welfare visits and attending court hearings as the legal process progresses.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.6/2">Employers have a direct input into the programme through the National Employment Panel. This group (formerly known as the New Deal Task Force) was formed in 1997 to ensure that employers, and other key customers, have a strong and permanent voice within the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.6/3">This co-operative approach has contributed to the success of the New Deal. Nearly 95,000 employers have signed up, half of whom have never participated in an employment programme before.

	<p pid=".431W.2/1">The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is strictly regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is widely regarded as the most rigorous piece of legislation of its type in the world. It offers a high level of protection to animals while recognising the need to use animals in research. It also requires the latest ideas and technology to be taken into account when deciding whether the use of animals is justified.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/2">The licensing system is demand led and the 1986 Act provides no mechanism by which to set absolute limits on the number of animals used. The Act requires that project proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that licences are only granted where the benefits outweigh the costs and where there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed, or refine the procedures to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/3">The number of animal procedures carried out reflects the state of science and industry in the United Kingdom and developments in science rather than being an indicator of the effectiveness of the 1986 Act. The Home Office will, however, continue to implement its overall strategy to minimise the numbers of animals used by the rigorous application of the 3Rs.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/4">It is not possible to predict accurately the amount of scientific research and regulatory testing using animals which is likely to take place in future. However, there are indications that in most areas use of conventional animals will continue to decline, but that new molecular biology techniques are opening up new areas of genetic research which will lead to an increase in the use of genetically modified (GM) animals. In addition, new regulatory requirements, for example, the proposed European Union Chemicals Strategy, have the potential to increase the use of animals for human health and safety purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/5">There is no information readily available to indicate the reduction in scientific procedures using animals achieved through sharing of information. The Government believe, however, that sharing of scientific research data is self-evidently in the interests of refining ad avoiding duplication of procedures, and remains committed to promoting such sharing by any practical means. To this end, in August 2000, we announced an inter-departmental concordat on data sharing. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat is currently under review.</p>
	<p pid=".431W.2/6">A programme of work involving the use of animals would not be licensed under the 1986 Act if it were known that it would entail unnecessary duplication of earlier work. Apart from some cases where there is need for deliberate replication of earlier work, in order to validate the original findings, we have no evidence that duplication of animal use takes place.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.2/1">Under the Courts and Tribunals Modernisation Programme the court service is developing new ways of delivering services to users. This includes a strategic consideration of the existing network of courts. Current proposals involve holding part-time hearings at 37 new venues and closure of only one county court, Shoreditch. Detailed plans are still being developed, and will depend on the funding available following the Government's spending review. They will also be subject to public consultation.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.8/1">The Lord Chancellor wrote to all youth panel chairs in May 1997, encouraging them to scrutinise all request for adjournment by questioning and probing the reasons advanced in support. In response to the call from Government to speed up case management in our courts the Magistrates' Association produced a training course on effective case management entitled &quot;Can We Get On Please&quot;. The Youth Court Bench Book issued in September last year to all youth justices includes a section on case management, an adjournment guide and check list. Sample surveys of cases in the youth court suggest that the proportion of defendants who had the case against them adjourned fell from 78 per cent. in 1997 to 74 per cent. in 2001.</p>

To provide the required levels of privacy and dignity for patients, wards are split into single sex bays, or single rooms, or otherwise configured to provide adequate segregation of gender. It is the responsibility of each National Health Service trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.2/5">The three objectives are:</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/6" class="indent">To ensure that appropriate organisational arrangements are in place to secure good standards of privacy and dignity for hospital patients;</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/7" class="indent">To achieve the Patient's Charter standard for segregated washing and toilet facilities across the NHS; and</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/8" class="indent">Provide safe facilities for patients in hospitals who are mentally ill which safeguard their privacy and dignity.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/9">Trusts are required to re-assess and report their position annually. This information has been collected through health authorities. Separate validation programmes are undertaken to ensure that information provided is robust and reliable.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/10">This is a very challenging target and we are working with the NHS to provide professional and technical support to ensure progress towards meeting this target continues.</p>

At this time we will publish a prospectus setting out how NHS trusts can apply for foundation status and the criteria that will be used to assess applications. Decisions on the first NHS Foundation Trusts will be made in the autumn, although their establishment will be subject to legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".443W.3/1">All local councils with social services responsibilities have received a share of this grant to improve services for those discharged from hospital. In 2001&ndash;2 and 2002&ndash;3 we have targeted extra resources on those councils with particularly severe problems in providing the range of services needed, and they have had more challenging targets for reducing delayed discharge. This approach has delivered over 1,000 hospital beds no longer occupied by people awaiting discharge by March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.3/2">For the future we intend to legislate to make councils responsible for meeting the costs to the national health service of delayed discharges where councils' intervention could prevent the delay, drawing on the experience of similar approaches in Scandinavia. Local councils that meet their responsibilities in reducing delayed discharges will not be disadvantaged. They will have the money to pay for patients in the NHS if they are delayed inappropriately or in the community if they are discharged appropriately.</p>

The latter recognises the steps the Government took in response to the first. As an initial response to the new report, I am asking the national support team for the integration of community equipment services to review its action plan in the light of the Commission's recommendations and to produce commissioning guidelines for community equipment services by the autumn. Since the first report was issued the process of modernising hearing aid services has progressed to the point that about a third of the country will be benefiting from a modernised service, including the provision of digital hearing aids, by the end of this financial year. Work is also underway to spread good practice across the country's wheelchair services.</p>
	<p pid=".450W.6/2">The report affords a welcome opportunity to: remind health and social services of the importance of orthotic, prosthetic, community equipment, wheelchair and audiology services; encourage commissioners of these services to act upon the recommendations; and highlight the importance of using appropriately the additional funding the Government made available for community equipment services.</p>

Good progress is also being made to provide (by means of conversion of an existing facility) a new 24-bedded unit for young people with severe mental health problems requiring treatment in conditions of security. This is part of new arrangements for the national commissioning of adolescent forensic mental health services, including also central revenue support for the two existing national health service units and the assessment of further requirements for secure places. Mental health provision for young offenders will also be considered under the relevant strand of the planned children's national service framework on which work has recently started.</p>

This was necessary to ensure the safe delivery of services in the light of internal and external priorities, such as junior doctors' hours, increasing sub-specialisation and clinical governance. For this reason the decision was taken, after public consultation, to treat all surgical and trauma emergencies at St. Peter's hospital and maintain an emergency unit at Ashford hospital.
