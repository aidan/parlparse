	<p pid="a.382W.6/1">The process of the CPS creating an electronic record for those awaiting a charge is dependent on how the police have sought a pre-charge decision (PCD) from the CPS. The four factors that influence the process are:</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/2" class="indent">ix1. Where the Exchange Links interface currently rolling out across the country, linking police and CPS case systems, is live in the area, and the police case systems can provide the electronic information to the CPS at the pre-charge stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/3" class="indent">This is the quickest process for creating the electronic record as the police case systems can send the pre-charge decision information via the Exchange Link. This message is then automatically registered on the CPS COMPASS case management system (CMS) as a pre-charge decision case.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/4" class="indent">2. Where it is a face to face consultation with a duty prosecutor (at a charging centre).</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/5" class="indent">The pre-charge decision case record will be created on CMS either by the duty prosecutor at the time of the consultation, or subsequently registered by administration staff from the paper record.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/6" class="indent">3. Where it is over the telephone with CPS Direct (out of office hours).</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/7" class="indent">Administration staff will create the case record on CMS when an email has been received from CPS Direct with the outcome of their pre-charge decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/8" class="indent">4. Where only the paper file is received from the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/9" class="indent">Administration staff will create the record on CMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/10">The timescales for creating the electronic case records have not been centrally mandated; however, the optimum business model process, currently being rolled out across the CPS, aims to ensure all case registrations are within 24 hours of receipt of the information, regardless of the process of receipt in the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.6/11">For those who have been charged and are awaiting a trial or a hearing, the aim is for all electronic records on CMS to be updated within 24 hours of each hearing, to ensure timely information is available to enable the CPS to meet its commitments under the Victims' Code. To achieve this aim, the target set for all areas during 2007-08 was for 60 per cent. of cases to be updated within 24 hours; this target was met. For 2008-09 the target is 75 per cent; the early indications are that this target will be met. These updates are input by administration staff from information on the paper file.</p>

In the light of recent increases in food commodity prices, we are reviewing our policies to ensure that they continue to deliver food security for all consumers.</p>

The base year is 1990 for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and 1995 for the fluorinated gases. In 2005 and 2006, UK emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) were below this level.

It is being implemented in stages over the next 10 years, and will replace much of the previous patchwork of chemicals control legislation with a single framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.2/3">DEFRA, BERR, the UK REACH Competent Authority (the Health and Safety Executive), and the devolved administrations have been working closely since last year to raise awareness of REACH across industry, to encourage compliance and to make sure business can get the most benefit from REACH. This has been through a combination of four national conferences and over 25 regional follow-up events for industry organised by the Competent Authority, the creation of a dedicated REACH website within the Health and Safety Executive's website, and a national Helpdesk to provide advice and technical information for businesses (contactable by telephone on 0845 408 9575, or e-mail at ukreachca@hse.gsi.gov.uk). In addition, the Government have placed notices in specialised trade press, various online website links and e-newsletters, and an article in the February edition of the Employers' Bulletin sent out by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to over 1 million UK businesses. These activities will continue as REACH begins to be implemented in the coming months. Industry also has a role to play in REACH awareness-raising through the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.2/4">Enforcement of REACH is the responsibility of each EU member state, and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June</phrase> the Government launched a public consultation on the proposed UK arrangements. The documents are available on DEFRA's website. The enforcement arrangements must be in place by <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.389W.2/1">Environmental Stewardship, the agri-environment scheme funded through the Rural Development Programme for England, has flood management as a secondary objective, in support of its five primary objectives for wildlife, landscape, resource protection, the historic environment and access. The scheme does not fund flood management measures but can support complementary measures, such as the creation of water meadows and ditch restoration. During the application approval process, Natural England is advised by the Environment Agency as to whether there are any flood management benefits to the application, but the critical deciding factor will be whether the proposal meets the primary objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.2/2">The Environment Agency's catchment flood management plans identify areas where changes in land management may have a beneficial impact on flood risk and Natural England can use this information to help target higher level stewardship (HLS) funding. In deciding which HLS schemes to fund, Natural England has to take into account the full range of scheme objectives, and proposals which only deliver flood management benefits are less likely to be funded than those which deliver multiple objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.389W.2/3">In cases where flood risk is an issue but HLS is not available the Environment Agency may use the flood management budget to take appropriate action. Any such scheme would need to be prioritised along with all other competing flood management projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.393W.3/2">The Environment Agency has developed catchment abstraction management strategies (CAMS). Each strategy reflects the amount of water available in the natural environment for sustainable abstraction and looks at whether there is a sustainable balance between it and the amount of water that is licensed for abstraction. Strategies are available from the Environment Agency's website.</p>

Any reduction in per capita consumption will contribute towards achieving a sustainable balance of supply and demand, and the Environment Agency has expressed support for the Government's ambition for water efficiency.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.0/1">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. As part of the Agency's management role it has both national and regional water resource strategies which set out the pressures over the next 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.0/2">Water companies have statutory duties to maintain adequate supplies of water. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> it became a statutory requirement for water companies to prepare and maintain previously voluntary water resources management plans. These are 25 year plans which complement the Agency strategies and seek to reconcile supply with anticipated demand using the twin-track approach of considering the need for new resources, such as reservoirs, in parallel with the full range of options for reducing demand. New resources should be developed only where the scope for managing demand is clearly insufficient or unjustified in terms of cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.0/3">The planning authorities are statutory consultees on the water company water resources management plans, which means that the water companies can be provided with information on proposed large scale developments in their supply areas. The water companies are also statutory consultees on Regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks, in the East of England and elsewhere, and should work with plan making bodies in drawing up these plans, so that the necessary coordination can occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.0/4">Water companies are currently holding the first public consultations on their draft water resource management plans, providing any interested parties will the opportunity to make representations on the content of the plans. Each water company, in the East of England and elsewhere, has to publish a statement in response to the representation, and if the response is not considered to be adequate the Secretary of State can direct them to make further changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.0/5">The Environment Agency now has Catchment abstraction management strategies (CAMS) in place throughout England and Wales, including the East of England, which provide transparency in the allocation of water resources. CAMS provide a consistent and structured approach to local water resources management, recognising the reasonable needs of all abstractors and the needs of the environment. CAMS enable the consideration of how much water can be abstracted from watercourses without damaging the environment. They will provide more local detail on the availability of water in Hertfordshire and the East of England more generally, and will allow a detailed assessment of where action may be needed to deal with problems of over abstraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.0/6">In October 2007, the Chancellor announced a new Public Service Agreement on climate change. Sustainable abstraction, as measured through the water availability status in catchments, is the chosen indicator of the extent to which we are adapting to climate change. The achievement and maintenance of sustainable abstraction requires that policy is adaptable to changing climatic conditions. This indicator captures efforts to reduce demand and use water efficiently, and long-term planning to ensure resilience of water supply. It reflects the totality of abstraction impacts from local to national level.</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.2/1">Based on climate change scenarios derived from Hadley Centre's Regional Climate Model which suggests that the frequency of 'short' droughts, lasting one or two seasons, would increase significantly by the 2050s and be common place by the 2080s, it is expected that there will be an increase in the frequency of short droughts in Hertfordshire by 2021. These projections are based on modelling studies that contain inherent uncertainties, meaning that the actual frequency of droughts that will be experienced in future may be more or less than these estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/2">All water companies, including those supplying Hertfordshire, will need to identify measures to increase resilience of water supply against increased frequency of drought in their Water Resources Management Plans, which are currently subject to consultation. These measures should include demand and supply side options to maintain a supply-demand balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/3">Water companies have statutory drought plans which set out how a company will meet essential demands for water in times of drought. Drought plans are prepared every three years and are subject to public consultation.</p>

The Secretary of State also announced that the Department of Transport and the Highways Agency would undertake additional detailed work examining managed motorway schemes for those areas identified in the feasibility study as being a high priority, including stretches of the M1, M6 and M62. This includes examining whether hard shoulder running could provide a better value for money solution for schemes which were previously planned as widenings, and this will include the production of cost estimates for these hard shoulder running schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.403W.9/2">As part of this process, the cost estimates for the widening schemes following the Nichols review are subject to further work and validation. This work is under way and due to be complete by the end of the year. The results of this work will inform decisions on the composition of the roads programme and the tinning of schemes within it.</p>

	<p pid="a.407W.8/2">In electing to lead the procurement, the Department identified that Thameslink is a highly complex programme with a clear requirement for the rolling stock specification and delivery to be aligned with the infrastructure works and planned train service operations.

	<p pid="a.408W.2/1">The Department for Transport appraises proposed transport schemes using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA). Journey time impacts across all modes of transport are included in every NATA appraisal, and form an important element of the benefits of transport interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/2">For the purpose of valuing changes in the duration of journeys NATA distinguishes between working, commuting and leisure trips. This reflects a large body of evidence on the values of time spent travelling. The values used in appraisal are provided by the WebTAG resource available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.webtag.org.uk/webdocuments/3_Expert/5_Economy_Objective/3">http://www.webtag.org.uk/webdocuments/3_Expert/5_Economy _Objective/3</a>.5.6.htm</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/4">Most journey time savings typically accrue to people who are travelling in their own time, and are valued at either &pound;5.04 per hour or &pound;4.46 in 2002 prices, depending on whether time is saved from a journey to work or another destination. This is irrespective of the mode used.</p>
	<p pid="a.408W.2/5">Transport schemes also reduce times taken for work-related journeys. These benefits are valued according to the average labour costs of individuals who travel by different modes of transport. The average value of working time across all working persons is &pound;26.73 in 2002 prices. Further details of the values of working time applied in transport appraisals are set out in table 1 in the transport analysis guidance unit linked to above. A copy of the table is as follows. These do differ by mode: evidence indicates that business travellers are selective in the modes used during work, with the most productive business trips using taxi, with rail and underground also being of high value.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.6/1">The Government are determined that we maximise the untapped economic dividend for the UK from increasing female entrepreneurship rates. The US has 20 per cent. more businesses per head than the UK. A significant proportion of this gap is explained by much lower rates of women's entrepreneurial activity in the UK. This goes to the heart of the UK's productivity and competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.6/2">Discussions and market research are already under way with the aim of launching a Women's Enterprise Media Campaign &quot;Spark an Idea&quot; in September 2008. The campaign will be co-ordinated by Enterprise Insight, who are funded by my Department and which brings together an enterprise coalition of 25 national organisations from education, the voluntary sector, business and government. The campaign will specifically look to develop the awareness and potential of women who are under-represented in enterprise currently.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.6/3">The campaign is an integral part of a strong package of measures on women's enterprise announced recently in the Government's Enterprise Strategy. Those measures include provision for: &pound;12.5 million of Government capital through a women's investment fund; women's business centre pilots; enhanced mentoring support; a new national enterprise centre of expertise; and activity aimed at opening up procurement opportunities to women-owned businesses. More information on the strategy is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.2/1">BERR welcomes the release of Lord Stern's Key Elements of a Global Deal paper. We hope it will stimulate debate, and more importantly, action. The report's findings will continue to feed into the Government's thinking on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/2">BERR is working to promote technology and investment cooperation both in the UK and overseas through a range of initiatives such as the Environmental Transformation Fund (ETF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). It also works with the Technology Strategy Board, the Energy Technologies Institute, the Carbon Trust and the Research Councils to ensure a cohesive approach to innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/3">Between 2002 and 2008 the UK spent over &pound;500 million on research and development in low carbon technologies, with funding continuing under the ETF. The creation of the Energy Technologies Institute in late 2007, a partnership between the public and private sectors, will coordinate up to &pound;1 billion worth of RD and D funding into low carbon energy technology over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/4">The Government recognise the global potential of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and is working in a number of ways to support its development. This includes a competition to develop the UK's first commercial-scale demonstration of CCS and supporting smaller scale R and D and demonstration of CCS technology, developing EU and domestic regulatory regimes for the safe and reliable storage of CO2 as well as amending international treaties to enable CCS technology. We are also working through the EU, G8, IEA and bilaterally to encourage the development and deployment of CCS internationally. Working towards a global consensus on the urgency of the need to demonstrate and deploy CCS has been a particular priority and we are working with EU partners to realise the Commission's ambition for up to 12 commercial scale CCS projects by 2015. We also strongly support the IEA's call to the G8 for 20 demonstration projects to be launched by 2010, and on leading the campaign to have this referred to in the final text at both the Energy Ministers and the Leaders Summit.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.5/1">In 2007, total UK coal production was approximately 17 million tonnes, predominantly of coal-fired electricity generation quality, the bulk of which was used within the UK. UK coal exports were under 0.6 million tonnes; this is understood to have included shipments to Ireland and Norway.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.5/2">The 27 European Union states import annually in the order of 120 million tonnes of coal from third countries for generation use.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.5/3">Total UK coal imports in 2007 were approximately 43 million tonnes, of which 22 million tonnes was from Russia and 12 million tonnes from South Africa. With regard to trade with other coal producing EU member states, 852,000 tonnes were imported from Poland, 46,000 tonnes from Spain and 41,000 tonnes from Germany.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.5/4">The impact of coal state aids under Council Regulation 1407/2002 on the coal market was considered as part of the report COM(2007)253 which, with its annex SEC(2007) 602, was published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May 2007</phrase>. This concluded that distortion of the coal market within the EU as a result of such aids seems to be limited by the fact that most subsidized coal covered by the Regulation is consumed in national markets, and that this suggests that there is little direct competition between coal produced in different member states. A possible exception is Germany, which has replaced parts of its indigenous production with imports from Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>

	<p pid="a.413W.2/1">We continue to keep the availability of credit to business under review in all sectors, including construction, and have regular dialogue with the banks. Lending to the UK construction sector has increased throughout the first quarter of 2008. However, we have concerns about the potential impact of the credit crunch on property markets and the consequences for construction activity. House builders, in particular, are experiencing a slow-down in activity, with lower site visits and forward reservations.</p>

	<p pid="a.414W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Darling) announced in the Budget that the Government would work with energy suppliers to increase their spend on social programmes designed to help those vulnerable to fuel poverty. The Government reached individual agreements with each of the six largest suppliers in April to increase their collective spend to at least &pound;150 million a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/2">The impact of this additional funding on the fuel poverty numbers will depend on how it is directed. If it is purely used to offset bills and equally distributed among the poorest households, then it could help to remove up to 100,000 of these from fuel poverty. Other scenarios may bring different benefits&mdash;for example, energy efficiency measures may benefit fewer but will be permanent. Energy suppliers will be free to determine how they target the additional spend within certain parameters currently being developed by Ofgem.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/3">In addition, the Chancellor announced a one-off additional supplement to the winter fuel payment of &pound;50 for the over-60s and &pound;100 for the over-80s. This will benefit around eight million pensioner households.</p>
	<p pid="a.414W.5/4">The Government also announced action to investigate and tackle the high differential between the cost of energy to customers using prepayment meters and those paying by direct debit. Around 11 per cent. of the fuel poor pay for their gas via prepayment meters and around 20 per cent. of the fuel poor use prepayment meters for their electricity. Ofgem is currently investigating and is due to report in September. Subsequent action will depend on the outcome of Ofgem's investigation.</p>

	<p pid="a.415W.2/1">The Government are working with the Energy Saving Trust to promote the Low Carbon Buildings Programme household funding stream. To date, we have used both their advice network and market segmentation models to target those that are most likely to install microgeneration technologies and apply for grants. Further details are available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk">www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.415W.2/3">BERR is currently working with the Building Research Establishment (BRE), the Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 2 programme manager, to deliver a national awareness raising campaign at a series of regional events. They have been promoting the scheme through combination of articles, advertorials and advertising in media serving all target sectors. 50,000 promotional flyers have been produced and distributed to journals and potential applicants. We expect around 700 people from eligible organisations and local authorities to participate in the events.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.2/4">We also continue to investigate and pursue other avenues for promotion of the scheme. For example, working with colleagues from other Government Departments, BERR officials speak regularly at events and conferences to promote the programme. Promotional activities have also been undertaken by the framework suppliers of phase II of the LCBP.</p>
	<p pid="a.415W.2/5">We have also published an energy measures report for local authorities compiling information they can use to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the levels of microgeneration in their communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.417W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/2">The UK Government take a proactive role in working with our international partners, such as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and foreign governments and the shipping industry to develop international legislation and guidance for shipping transiting trade routes. At both Government and operational levels this includes collaborating with other navies and coastguards through a series of combined operations and strategic alliances to ensure that the vital sea lanes and choke points are safe to navigate. Also, the Government monitor and assess the risk of terrorism to sea lanes and, as appropriate, sets the security level for UK and Red Ensign Group registered ships operating in these areas and advises industry accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/3">The Government also issue guidance to industry in measures to counter piracy and armed robbery and safe distances of transit in piracy hotspots.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/4">Recently, the UK co-sponsored the UNSC resolution addressing the problem of piracy off Somalia. Under the terms of resolution 1816 (2008), which was adopted unanimously, the Security Council decided that states co-operating with the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) would be allowed, for a period of six months, to enter the country's territorial waters and use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea, in a manner consistent with relevant provisions of international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/5">Furthermore, the Government are committed to ratifying into UK law the 2005 protocols to the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation, by way of the proposed Transport Security Bill. Notably, this Bill will provide powers to board ships that are suspected of being involved in acts of piracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/6">The UK plays an active role in the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee and Subcommittee on the Safety of Navigation to prevent accidents at sea. In this forum we seek consensus on ships' routeing measures to reduce the risk of groundings or collisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/7">Where UK waters are concerned, moreover, the Government have a strategic approach to protecting the UK's seas and coasts which involves all of the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/8" class="indent">we have put in place a network of shore-based stations around the UK coastline to monitor vessel traffic, using automatic identification system technology;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/9" class="indent">we ensure that powerful tug boats (commonly referred to as &quot;emergency towing vessels&quot;) are available, so that they can assist ships which lose motive power;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/10" class="indent">we have established arrangements whereby a ship requiring assistance, and whose condition needs to be stabilised, can be brought to a place of refuge;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/11" class="indent">we have a highly effective structure for command and control of an incident, in which the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention (SOSREP) plays a major role;</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/12" class="indent">we have a fully developed national contingency plan, consistent with the international convention on oil pollution preparedness, response and co-operation 1990 (the &quot;OPRC Convention&quot;); and</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/13" class="indent">we participate actively in international assistance and co-operation arrangements of a bipartite, multipartite or regional nature, again consistent with the OPRC convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.422W.2/1">We began our policy of embedding personnel within the Iraqi army and its chain of command at the beginning of April this year. Prior to this, while we were not embedding, we had established a very close and effective training relationship with first 10th Division and then, following its establishment, with 14th Division. A considerable number of UK forces remain focused on this vital work of monitoring, mentoring and training the Iraqi security forces, with many of the balance providing direct support to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.2/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April 2008</phrase>, 94 UK personnel were embedded with 14th Division and 73 collocated with the Basra Operations Command. In addition to this number, UK forces also provide direct and substantial assistance to the Iraqi army both in the planning and conduct of their operations. We have also established a six-strong liaison team at Basra Palace.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.2/3">There are currently no British soldiers embedded with the Iraqi army's 10<sup>(th)</sup> Division.</p>
	<p pid="a.422W.2/4">We have continued in our efforts to help develop the Iraqi navy and some 116 UK personnel, based at Umm Qasr Port, have been involved in this task.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.0/21">The tables show initial attendances only. The figures were compiled using the Operational Emergency Department Attendance Register (OpEDAR), which records all patients who have attended or been admitted through the A and E department of either a UK Role 2(E) or UK Role 3 operational hospital. OpEDAR is designed to capture diagnosis at the initial assessment, rather than track a patient through their care. It is possible for diagnosis to change over the course of treatment or for a patient to have multiple conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.6/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) uses military aircraft if they are necessary to deliver humanitarian aid where civil aircraft are not suitable or are insufficient and if military aircraft can be spared from defence purposes. For example, DFID used military aircraft in addition to civil aircraft and other delivery channels in response to the Pakistan earthquake in 2005. DFID and the Ministry of Defence have an agreement for the use of military assets in humanitarian aid, including aircraft, when required and available. Wherever possible DFID will use civil aircraft, to take advantage of their generally greater carrying capacity and availability and in accordance with internationally agreed practice and guidelines (the &quot;Oslo Guidelines&quot;) on the use of military assets in disaster relief. All DFID's relief flights into Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis have been civil.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.8/1">The UK has made no direct representations to Japan. Home Office Minister, the noble Lord West of Spithead, will raise sexual exploitation of children during the Group of Eight leading industrialised nations (G8) Justice and Home Affairs ministerial meeting from 11 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-13">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/2">Our embassy in Bangkok organised and funded a training course earlier this year on requirements and best practice used in covert internet investigations into sexual exploitation of children online. Twelve police officers from Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore took part. The training was conducted by two British police officers from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). This training enhanced the trainees' ability to interact covertly online and conduct investigations for the purpose of gathering evidence admissible in a court of law. It also encouraged the building of informal and working contacts among police officers from the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/3">Our embassy in Bangkok has also recently concluded a three-year project working with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the Thai Government to improve access to birth registration and citizenship among ethnic minority &quot;hill tribes&quot; in remote areas of Thailand. Lack of birth registration and citizenship has been identified by UNESCO as the primary causal factor behind the trafficking of &quot;hill tribe&quot; girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/4">We have raised the issue of child sex abuse and paedophilia at the highest level in government with the Government of Cambodia, who have introduced new legislation on trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. I discussed these issues in detail with non-governmental organisations in Phnom Penh on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-07">7 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/5">Our embassy in Phnom Penh has worked over a number of years in close collaboration with the Government of Cambodia and the UK's CEOP. This has included organising cooperation and officers from the Cambodian National Police to build capacity and raise awareness of this global problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/6">We are working in partnership with international organisations, such as the UN Children's Fund and the World Health Organisation, to tackle the causes of child sex exploitation. Our work in Cambodia has been recognised as a model of excellence for the region with some of the mechanisms for tackling child sex abuse established in Cambodia being mirrored elsewhere, including in Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.8/7">Our embassy in Hanoi works closely with the Vietnamese Government to tackle child sexual exploitation in Vietnam. In February 2007 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) funded a delegation led by the Vietnamese Police Commissioner to visit child protection organisations in the UK. As a direct result of that visit, Vietnam established a specialised unit for child sex offences in their General Department of Police. In March 2007, the FCO organised a roundtable between Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security and the UK's CEOP to develop a joint action plan for capacity building measures in Vietnam. Under that plan, the FCO funded a training seminar run by CEOP in Hanoi in December 2007, an attachment by two Vietnamese officers to CEOP offices in London in February 2008 and in-situ training in Lao Cai and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces in February and March 2008.</p>

However, experience from other countries tells us that, while logging activities can contribute significant revenue, their contribution to poverty reduction tend to be marginal unless local communities are closely involved in decision making about the use of forests and the distribution of benefits from forest exploitation. This is why the UK Government have been sponsoring the Roundtable process to develop alternative models for forest management and financing in the DRC. These will be presented to Congolese and international partners during a conference in Kinshasa on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="">24 June</phrase>. One of the proposals to be presented is the introduction of community-based forestry management in the DRC which puts local communities at the centre of the decision making process for forest use.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.9/1">In 2007 the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government, donor partners and a large part of DRC and international civil society adopted the Priority Agenda for the DRC's forests. The UK Government agree with all the parties to the Priority Agenda that forest land-use planning involving local people is essential for avoiding future conflicts in forest areas. We also agree that the moratorium should not be lifted until a national plan for granting new concessions has been developed involving the DRC government, NGOs, private companies and local people. The recent establishment of a national committee to agree a standard methodology for forest land-use zoning is an encouraging sign that the rights of forest-dependent people are being taken seriously. This methodology should be agreed by all relevant parties and applied successfully before new logging titles can be issued.</p>

	<p pid="a.441W.2/1">The UK Government do not believe that a moratorium on all logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is either desirable or enforceable. The DRC is a desperately poor country emerging from civil war and it needs to be able to exploit its natural resources in a .sustainable way to drive reconstruction and the provision of basic services. Sustainable logging practices from countries like Mexico and Guatemala show that governments and communities can derive substantial benefits from logging activities. A blanket moratorium would also prevent the emergence of small-scale logging businesses which are an essential element of community-based forest management.</p>

	<p pid="a.441W.8/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) does not have a bilateral programme in Egypt. However, the British embassy in Cairo is monitoring the economic situation in the country. Recent assessment shows that escalating inflation and food price rises have raised tensions and increased the threat of social instability. However, in response the Egyptian Government has been implementing policies aimed at reducing the impact of food price rises on the poor, for example by committing to extend the number of people eligible for subsidised bread ration cards by 17 million. DFID is also in regular contact with the World Food Programme (WFP) who launched a global appeal earlier in 2008 for countries most at risk from rising food prices. There was no specific appeal for Egypt, where the WFP operates capacity building programmes and school feeding programmes but has not initiated any emergency operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.5/2">The UK has supported a number of initiatives in the UN that seek to address violence against women (and girls), including resolutions and the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women. We also welcomed the launch in February by the UN Secretary-General of a new campaign to intensify action to end violence against women and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.5/3">The Department for International Development also tackles violence against women and girls through our development assistance programmes as part of our wider work to promote gender equality and women's rights, as set out in the Gender Equality Action Plan launched last year. We support work on this issue in over 20 developing countries, including in the areas of legislative reform, improved provision of services for victims, work with media on awareness raising and changing attitudes, and training of police and military. This includes initiatives in conflict and post-conflict situations implemented by civil society and UN partners. For example, we are currently supporting a programme implemented by the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) aimed at promoting women's engagement in peace-building and preventing sexual violence in conflict which is working in Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Timor Leste and Uganda.</p>

	<p pid="a.443W.5/1">Since 2003, DFID has committed over &pound;149 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, &pound;17 million of which has been allocated for this year. We have channelled our assistance to a variety of international organisations working to provide assistance to the most vulnerable people displaced inside Iraq and in the region. Support provided through these organisations includes food, water, shelter and medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.5/2">We are also working to promote a coordinated international effort in response to humanitarian situation, with the Government of Iraq (GoI) in the lead. The GoI has recognised it holds primary responsibility for the welfare of its people and is working to address the humanitarian situation inside the country. To that end, the GoI last week allocated $40 million to the World Food Programme, to assist in the provision of food for internally displaced people. The UK is also encouraging the GoI to take a lead in providing financial support to Iraqi refugees in the wider region, and we are seeing some progress being made. The GoI has allocated $25 million to Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to support Iraqis who are currently living there, and very recently announced $195 million to support voluntary returnees from the region back to Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.5/3">However, while international aid is vital in supporting the most vulnerable Iraqis&mdash;both within Iraq and in the wider region&mdash;the longer term solution to the humanitarian problem hinges on sustainable improvements in the security situation. Currently refugees that have been interviewed in the region have said they do not wish to return to Iraq because they believe it is unsafe to do so. The UNHCR, who lead on refugee issues, has also made it clear that the situation in Iraq does not currently warrant mass refugee return. Therefore, security must be the Iraqi Government's top priority, to allow displaced people to feel safe enough to return home.</p>

Since 1996-97, the UK has provided nearly &pound;295 million in assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.0/23">The UK aligns its support to the PA to the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan and does not subdivide its support between Gaza and the West Bank. UNRWA generally allocates around 30 per cent. of its budget to Gaza, 16 per cent. to the West Bank and the remaining to help other Palestinian refugees in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/24">Movement and access restrictions undermine the effectiveness of humanitarian operations and impose additional costs on humanitarian agencies. The UK continues to call on Israel to ease those restrictions in order to alleviate the humanitarian situation and allow the Palestinian economy to grow. Despite the obstacles, assistance is reaching those who need it. Our funding to UNRWA supports the delivery of medical and social services, education and some food aid to social hardship cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.451W.9/1">77.3 per cent. of young people were in education and training at the end of 2006, equating to 1,547,000 16 to 18-year-olds&mdash;the highest number ever. The Government have taken a number of steps to increase this still further and put us on the pathway to raising the participation age in 2013:</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/2" class="indent">the September Guarantee, an offer of a suitable place in learning for every year 11 school leaver, was delivered nationally for the first time last year&mdash;and this year we will be extending that offer to 17-year-olds;</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/3" class="indent">a range of financial support is available to young people to help them continue in education or training, this includes Education Maintenance Allowance, Learner Support Funds, Residential bursaries, Care to Learn and Dance and Drama Awards;</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/4" class="indent">Activity Agreement Pilots in eight areas are testing different packages of financial support for young people completing agreed activities to help identify the most effective model for engaging 16 to 17-year-olds not in education, employment or training (NEET) and Learning Agreement Pilots in eight areas are testing how young people in jobs without training can be motivated to participate in learning;</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/5" class="indent">the NEET strategy (November 2007) introduced a number of measures to increase participation including a duty on providers to notify Connexions when a young person drops out of learning, and encouraging providers to offer more flexible and responsive provision throughout the academic year; and</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/6" class="indent">the post-16 progression measure will help all schools focus on ensuring their pupils make a good transition to post 16 learning&mdash;the data will be published in the School Profile in summer 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.451W.9/7">The 14-19 reforms will go still further. We are introducing a new more engaging curriculum through Diplomas from this September and, in 2013, all young people will have an entitlement to study one of the 14 Diplomas that will be available. For young people who want a more work based route, we are expanding the apprenticeship programme so that every young person who wants one can have one, and the foundation learning tier will give young people not yet ready for level 2 and level 3 qualifications the essential building blocks for future learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.458W.5/1">The Government Response to the Education and Skills Select Committee report on Special Educational Needs (October 2006) said that inclusion is about the quality of a child's experience and providing access to a high quality education which enables them to make progress in their learning and participate fully in the activities of their school and community. We see a vital and continuing role for special schools as part of an inclusive education system, meeting children's needs directly and working in much closer partnership with mainstream schools to build expertise throughout the system. We signalled our commitment to this by bringing special schools within the Department's specialist schools programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/2">Some 26 special schools had already been designated as SEN specialist schools by October 2006, with funding and a specific brief to provide outreach to mainstream schools. As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-01">1 June 2008</phrase>, there were 87 special schools designated as SEN specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/3">Our guidance entitled Planning and Developing Special Educational Provision: A Guide for Local Authorities and other proposers (published in March 2007) encourages local authorities to plan and commission a flexible range of provision to meet children's needs. This guidance reaffirms special schools' important role in meeting children's needs directly and in providing outreach to other schools. The guidance also reminds maintained mainstream schools that they must make provision for children on their roll who have SEN and make reasonable adjustments for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.458W.5/4">Ofsted's survey Inclusion&mdash;does it matter where pupils are taught? (2006) said that children with SEN can do well in all types of school&mdash;access to high quality, specialist teachers and a commitment by leaders to create opportunities to include all pupils are keys to success. We are asking Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools to review progress on SEN in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.5/1">The Government take the issue of binge drinking very seriously. In 'Safe. Sensible. Social. The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy', the Government set out their plans to tackle binge drinking, particularly focusing on the 18 to 24 age group. The Government are committed to challenging the binge drinking culture through a sustained national campaign to reduce the acceptability of public drunkenness and to increase the awareness of the health harms associated with excessive drinking. The 'Know Your Limits' campaign started in June 2008, and aims to raise the public's knowledge of units of alcohol to ensure that everyone has the information they need to estimate more accurately how much they drink. The Government will also build on the 'Know Your Limits' campaign to raise awareness of the risks of harmful drinking, and will target information and advice towards people who drink at harmful levels, and their families and friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.5/2">The Government will also continue to take tough enforcement action against those individuals who exhibit unacceptable behaviour while intoxicated. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 brought in a range of additional measures to tackle alcohol related crime and disorder, including directions to leave which enable the police to ban a person from a locality for a maximum of 48 hours. The Government have also funded four alcohol arrest referral pilots which target alcohol related offenders with the aim of providing interventions to drive home messages about alcohol and risks and to promote behaviour change. The pilots will be extended to a number of other areas by the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.475W.2/1">Juxtaposed controls were introduced in France and Belgium to further strengthen and enhance the protection of the UK borders.

They are fully reciprocal.</p>
	<p pid="a.475W.2/2">This reciprocal arrangement provides the French authorities with the facilities to operate their frontier control from the United Kingdom, while the UK Border Agency operates the UK frontier control from France and Belgium.

	<p pid="a.487W.6/1">Table 1 shows the numbers of small claims in the county courts of England and Wales in 2007, broken down according to whether the claimant was represented and whether the defendant was represented in each case. The data were sourced from the main administrative system in the county courts (CaseMan) which holds the details of legal representatives, but not whether these were barristers (counsel) or solicitors. Representation details can be added, amended or deleted from CaseMan at any stage during a case's progression through the court. The figures shown reflect the latest recorded data on representation in small claims hearings that took place during 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/2">Based on these figures it can be calculated that 32,163 (60 per cent.) of the 53,226 small claims hearings in 2007 involved at least one party which had legal representation. Claimants were not legally represented in 28,362 (53 per cent.) of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/3">HM Courts Service (HMCS) records its centrally received user complaints in one of 10 categories. These relate to the stage of the court process which prompted the complaint, rather than to the type of case being heard. It is therefore not possible to identify complaints that explicitly relate to small claims cases. However, Table 2 shows a breakdown by category of all complaints received centrally by HMCS in the last three financial years. These figures cover all areas of HM Courts Service business, encompassing over 1 million small claims among a total of over 4 million cases per year across civil, criminal and family justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/4">During 2007, county court bailiffs recovered an average of 89.5 pence in the pound from correctly directed warrants of execution (i.e. where the creditor supplied the correct address) across all cases in the county courts of England and Wales in 2007. Data are not currently available for small claims alone, or on the recovery of monies other than through the actions of county court bailiffs.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/5">During 2007, there were an average of 28 weeks between the date of issue and the date of hearing for small claims (whether for specified or unspecified amounts) disposed of at hearing in England and Wales. The equivalent figure for 2000 was 29 weeks, although there were changes in the data collection method during the intervening period meaning that the comparison should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/6">There were 1.194 million claims issued in the county courts of England and Wales for specified amounts of &pound;5,000 or less during 2007. Of these, 382,000 (32 per cent. of the total) were issued at named local county courts, rather than via the Money Claims On-Line (MCOL) service or the County Court Bulk Centre (CCBC). There were 92,000 defences entered in response to these locally-issued claims, with 11,000 of these defences incorporating a counterclaim.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/7">In addition, there were 107,000 claims issued via MCOL or the CCBC which were transferred into local county courts after either a defence or a counterclaim was received. Most of these claims will relate to specified amounts of &pound;5,000 or less, and therefore the total number of defences issued for all claims of this type (regardless of the issuing route) is around 200,000. However, please note that a single claim can name more than one defendant, and can therefore lead to more than one defence being entered.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/8">During 2007, there were 49,000 small claims hearings in claims involving specified amounts of &pound;5,000. These claims may have originally been issued in 2007 or in earlier years. Information is not available on whether these hearings took place in open court or in chambers.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.6/9">Please note that all figures given for the year 2007 should be considered provisional. Final figures for this year will be published in the Ministry of Justice report &quot;Judicial and Court Statistics&quot; which is planned for release later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.2/1">The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 sets out the duties on the responsible person to carry out a fire risk assessment and put in place suitable and sufficient fire precautions. The extent to which a responsible person is considered to be complying adequately with the requirements of the legislation and managing the risk on their premises is a matter of judgment, based on the professional experience and expertise of the individual fire safety audit officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.2/2">In the event of non-compliance, there are a range of measures that can be taken to improve fire safety on all premises covered by this legislation. The two main measures available to enforcing authorities (primarily fire and rescue authorities) are enforcement notices, which require changes to be made over a specified period of time; and prohibition notices, which effectively shut premises down until improvements are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.2/3">In the event that a responsible person does not act to improve fire safety in response to an enforcement or prohibition notice from the Fire and Rescue Authority, or, in any event, if failure to comply with the requirements of the Order places persons at risk of death or serious injury in case of fire, they are liable to prosecution in the courts. The level of penalty to be applied as a consequence of prosecution is a matter for the courts, subject to a maximum of an unlimited fine and/or two years' imprisonment in the Crown court, or a fine of &pound;5,000 in a magistrates court.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.5/2">Since 2005, the principal mechanism for multi-agency cooperation in preparing for emergencies has been the local resilience forum, based mainly on each police area rather than districts<sup>(1)</sup>, and bringing together the emergency services and other category one and two responders as defined in the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.5/3">All local resilience forums are required under the Act to carry out assessments of the risks of emergencies in their areas. Many<sup>(2)</sup> local resilience forums have a collectively agreed multi-agency flood response plan; and nearly all of the main category one responders within them either contribute to these plans or take account of flooding incidents in their own emergency response plans. Most of the plans that exist had already been reviewed in the period following the summer flooding; and multi-agency plans are being further reviewed following the issue of new guidance from Government in February this year. The Government specifically wrote to all LRF chairs in February and again in May 2008 asking LRFs to let us know how the new guidance was being embedded at a local level. The replies we have had in to date give a clear indication that many LRFs have been very active since the floods last year. In particular, it seems evident that significant effort has gone into identifying the lessons of 2007 and improving local risk assessments, plans and their general state of preparedness (mostly through better activation procedures and clarity over roles and responsibilities).</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.5/4" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> For example the North Yorkshire LRF area comprises seven district councils (Selby, Harrogate, Rydale, Scarborough, Hambleton, Richmondshire and Craven) and the City of York. All seven district councils have some form of multi-agency flood response plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.5/5" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> According to the initial results of the 2008 national capability survey. A more comprehensive analysis is due to be undertaken shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.507W.0/1">The Government are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all learners, and that learning serves the needs of the whole community, including older people both within and outside the work force. Our strategy for World Class Skills and our reforms of wider adult learning are designed to ensure that everyone, whatever their age or background, has the opportunity to improve their skills, prospects and quality of life. We will continue to work closely with our ministerial colleagues to respond to the consultation on the Equality Bill&mdash;&quot;A Framework for Fairness&quot;&mdash;to ensure that everyone, in every community, can lead healthy and fulfilling lives by participating fully in work, education and society as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.0/2">Protection from discrimination on the grounds of age was introduced in the area of employment and vocational training through the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. The Regulations mean that further education and training providers are not allowed to set age limits for access to training unless they can show objective justification why there is a real need to apply such limits. The Government have decided that all courses at Further Education and Higher Education institutions are covered by the age regulations, whether they are specifically vocational or more general in nature. This ensures that there is a unified and consistent approach to age-related practices and policies in relation to all such provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.0/3">I must stress that the Regulations do not bar providers from offering age-related fee discounts. Many colleges and other providers have longstanding, formal, informal and discretionary arrangements based on age when deciding eligibility for fee concessions. These are entirely at the discretion and cost of individual providers. I refer the hon. Member to the written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 35WS by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">my hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.507W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Guidance on the vocational training aspects of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations is available on the DTI website. It is aimed at, amongst others, providers of further and adult education. The guidance makes it clear that age related practices, such as age related fee concessions, may be objectively justified where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. It is for providers to produce evidence of such objective justification if called upon to do so, or to take their own legal advice if necessary. Guidance on objective justification is also available on page 30 of the ACAS guidance on the Age Regulations.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.0/1">Our January 2008 grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England provided sufficient funding for recruitment by 2011 of 60,000 new students. This increase builds on our consistent track record of growing student numbers to record levels. But we are not simply concerned with recruiting younger students. Our development of new models for the funding and design of higher education (HE) courses will also enable us to grow the number of mature students entering HE part-time.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.0/2">As part of this strategy for growth, we have asked the Funding Council over the next six years to support 20 new HE centres with around 10,000 student places, under our new University Challenge initiative. This will allow more students to gain access to HE locally. We are also committed to a steep increase in the number of people studying for foundation degrees. Our ambition to provide 100,000 foundation degree enrolments by 2010 will support young people and adults in employment to develop higher level work-related skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.0/3">We believe that there will be demand for the new places we are creating. Improvements to the student support package for full-time students in England announced last July will further encourage more young people to go to university. For young people, we know that the best way to increase participation in HE is to raise level 2 achievement in schools at age 16 with an increase in young people attaining five GCSEs at grades A* to C to 62 per cent. from 37 per cent. in 1997. New study options for young people at age 14, the Aimhigher Programme and HE institutions' own outreach activity working directly with schools all help to raise aspirations and achievement across the board.</p>

	<p pid="a.510W.5/2">The Government are committed both to increasing the number of people studying science, technology, engineering and maths at all levels, and to working with the science and engineering industries to improve skill levels in those industries. My Department works closely with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), and funds STEMNET&mdash;the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network&mdash;to raise awareness of these subjects and engagement among young people. This includes support for the science and engineering ambassadors scheme which has already enabled over 18,000 specialists to work directly with schools and colleges, offering mentoring, career guidance and positive role models. We recently announced that STEMNET would work towards having 27,000 ambassadors in place by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-28">28 May</phrase> the Secretary of State announced the first Train to Gain sector compact. This is a partnership between Semta (the Sector Skills Council for science, engineering and manufacturing technologies), the Learning and Skills Council and my Department to drive up employer demand for skills in the science and engineering industries over the next three years. &pound;65 million has been earmarked from the Train to Gain budget for this compact.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/4">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is providing &pound;75 million additional funding from 2007/08 over three years for high cost strategic science subjects at undergraduate level, including chemistry, physics and chemical engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/5">HEFCE are also funding the National Engineering Programme (NEP), of which the London Engineering project is the first phase. After creating a successful working model with the London pilot project, the programme will extend to six other cities in England. Managed by the Royal Academy of Engineering, the programme aims to change the face of UK higher education in engineering, by widening participation and strengthening engineering as a strategic subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.510W.5/6">Together with DCSF we have put in place a structure&mdash;a High Level STEM strategy group&mdash;reporting both to DCSF and DIUS Ministers. This will ensure, across all phases of education, a joined-up approach to initiatives designed to support improvements in the teaching of science as well as those aimed at encouraging young people to take science subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.2/2">Lifelong Learning UK (LLUK) has developed a qualifications framework and guidance for the sector workforce, but course design is the responsibility of the awarding institution or sometimes the delivery centre. Importantly, providers of teacher training for the FE sector are independent organisations with the freedom and ability to develop courses which they feel meet sector business needs, including teacher training courses contextualised for BSL.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.2/3">LLUK requirements do not prevent ITT course providers from meeting the needs of BSL teacher trainees. There are many examples of contextualised ITT courses for particular groups of trainees, such as performing arts or lip reading.</p>

	<p pid="a.512W.8/1">The Government have taken a wide range of action to support employers in securing the skills their businesses need to thrive both now and in the future. Our White Paper 'World Class Skills' was published last summer. It set out how we will shape the skills system around the needs of customers&mdash;employers and learners&mdash;to meet the challenge of competing in the global economy. Since then we have pressed ahead with making the skills system more demand led. This includes improving and expanding Train to Gain to help employers identify and address their skills needs. Since national roll-out began from April 2006, Train to Gain has engaged nearly 90,000 employers, enabled over 450,000 employees to begin learning programmes, and over 210,000 to gain new qualifications. We are working with Sector Skills Councils to develop sector compacts, earmarking Train to Gain funds specifically to support the skills those sectors need. Funding for the Apprenticeship programme is being increased, and the programme reformed, so that more employers and employees benefit from high-quality work-based training. National Skills Academies have now been approved in nine sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/2">On higher skills, our recent consultation paper 'Higher Education at Work' has launched a national debate on what more needs to be done to meet the need for more&mdash;and more employable&mdash;graduates, and raise the skills of those already in the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/3">A key aim in taking all these actions is that employers and the skills system get better at responding to future strategic challenges and opportunities&mdash;such as a low carbon economy, renewable energy, and the Olympics&mdash;focussing on the medium and long term as well as on immediate skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/4">Over the next three years we will be investing &pound;2.3 billion on the modernisation and renewal of the Further Education estate, supporting investment in specialist new facilities in colleges and training providers, to build the capacity needed to meet our skills priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.512W.8/5">We are also taking action to make sure the employment and skills system is much better joined up. In April the new UK Commission for Employment and Skills started work. We are publishing today new proposals for more integrated employment and skills services that are more responsive to the needs of individuals and employers, with plans to ensure that delivery systems work more closely together, driven by those who know best how to shape services to meet local needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.0/1">Since it was rolled out nationally from April 2006, Train to Gain has grown quickly. It has now engaged over 92,000 employers, supported nearly 455,000 employees to begin learning programmes, and delivered 186,720 full level 2 and 23,480 Skills for Life achievements. Recent evaluations of the service show that both employer and employee satisfaction with their experience of Train to Gain is high.</p>
	<p pid="a.514W.0/2">Since January 2008 both volunteers and the self-employed have been able to access high quality vocational skills training through Train to Gain. In a demand-led service like Train to Gain, the distribution of learners between different sectors, types of employees, volunteers, and the self-employed is driven by employer demand for and take up of the service. Recently completed evaluations show that a wide spread of industry sectors are accessing the service. We will continue to monitor that distribution through ongoing evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="a.514W.0/16">We have not to date funded 'second' level 2 or 3 qualifications within Train to Gain. As we agree new 'compacts' to ensure that the Train to Gain offer meets the particular needs of each key sector in the economy, we will identify those qualifications that are priorities for each sector, and offer some increased flexibility on funding for those qualifications.</p>

The 2001 Census indicates that there are some 6 million people providing unpaid care in the United Kingdom. However, this figure does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals being cared for, as there is not a one to one ratio of carers to care-recipients.</p>

In 2007-08 the administration funding is not included under the central health budgets line of the Report. The 2008-09 NHS Purchasing and Supplies Authority figure does include the administration funding.  3. In 2008-09 the general and social care council funding, in the report, is shown as being funded from the social services budget rather than from central health budgets, so no funding is shown against central health budgets for that year.  4. In 2008-09 the majority of the National Treatment Agency's funding, in the report, is being shown as coming from the drug misuse budget with only a small element shown against 2008-09 central health budgets.<br/> 5.

	<p pid="a.524W.5/32">It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it has been caused by the vaccine&mdash;because the reports are based on suspicions, no causal link may be established. While some reported suspected adverse reactions may represent true reactions to a vaccine, others may represent illnesses unrelated to vaccination that occur naturally in the population of vaccine recipients or concomitant medicines, and their timing in relation to vaccination may be purely coincidental.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/33">Given that approximately eight million people who are elderly or at high risk of severe cardiac and respiratory illness are likely to be vaccinated with influenza vaccine over the winter season each year, it is inevitable that some patients may die or be hospitalised shortly after vaccination. These events may be reported via the YCS even if the temporal association with vaccination was coincidental.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/34">The seasonal flu vaccine is safe in the vast majority of those who are vaccinated. The balance of benefits to risks of the influenza vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-12">12 May 2008</phrase> is to ensure everyone can have their say via the following methods:</p>

	<p pid="a.528W.3/6" class="indent">a series of public events where the key issues will be discussed in detail. These include a stakeholder event in every Government region and a number of citizen events. The stakeholder events will include user and patient groups that represent patients with long-term conditions including both adults and young carers;</p>
	<p pid="a.528W.3/7" class="indent">at the end of the six month engagement period there will be a final event bringing stakeholders and citizens together to provide a further opportunity for discussion; and additional research will also be undertaken to ensure groups of people whose views may not be readily heard via the routes outlined above, have the opportunity to give their views.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.3/1">In the pre-Budget report 2006, HM Treasury announced that the Government would be undertaking an internal review of care for the over-85s, looking in particular at Derek Wanless's report for the King's Fund, Securing Good Care for Older People. The outcome of that review, which was extended to cover the over-65s, is feeding into the development of the Green Paper on reform of the care and support system.</p>
