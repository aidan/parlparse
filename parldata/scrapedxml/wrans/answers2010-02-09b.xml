	<p pid="b.809W.3/1">The MOD is committed to giving seriously injured personnel every opportunity to maintain their military careers. All sick and injured personnel receive first-class medical care and rehabilitation to give them the best chance of doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/2">The Defence Medical Services already manage 15 regional rehabilitation units in the UK and Germany and 51 primary care rehabilitation facilities, in addition to our premier Defence medical rehabilitation centre at Headley Court. These units provide rapid access to assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders in order to return personnel to fitness in the most expeditious way. In addition to this, in August 2009 the MOD launched the Army recovery centre pathfinder at Erskine Home, Edinburgh. The concept behind the Army recovery capability (ARC) is to meet the need for injured and sick soldiers between or after the excellent clinical care they currently receive and it is intended that the ARC will help these soldiers to return to duty or to make a smooth transition to civilian life.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/3">Those who are able to remain in the Services will continue to receive medical treatment from the Defence Medical Services as required. Suitable adaptations will be made to both working and service-provided living accommodation if necessary. Ongoing welfare support is also available from the individual's chain of command, through the single service welfare services, and from service charities. There is a range of roles open to individuals who are no longer capable of fulfilling their original employment. These can include office-based roles, training, and various supporting roles in units. We attach particular importance to the role of the rear party i.e. those that do not deploy with their unit but provide, for example, welfare support for the families. Those who are medically discharged are entitled to the full resettlement package. For the seriously injured the focus will be on identifying what opportunities are open to them and then on facilitating retraining and the acquisition of new skills to enable them to take up gainful employment. Single service resettlement staffs and the Career Transition Partnership provide advice on selecting training and other services that best support individual resettlement plans, be it MOD contract funded courses, Government agencies such as Remploy or charitable organisations like Portland College or Skill Force, or accessing civilian work attachments through commercial companies like Soldier On.</p>
	<p pid="b.809W.3/4">We shall be announcing further relevant initiatives shortly.</p>

The research that supports hazard assessment and the development of medical countermeasures will by necessity involve the use of animals.

	<p pid="b.814W.2/3">These research studies involving explosives have followed up on identified problems with prolonged pre-hospital. resuscitation following blast injury. The studies have included evaluation of the whole body trauma caused by various blast explosive injury in order to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of improved post-traumatic methodology. This research has led to significant advances in post-traumatic techniques such as reducing blood loss from major trauma and has saved many lives in the theatres of Iraq and Afghanistan. The advances made due to this research can be utilised both in theatre and civilian scenarios particularly if there are mass casualties and evacuation to hospital is delayed. This is one of the reasons why Dstl research involving the use of animals is published in the open literature where possible.</p>

We take action on individual cases where persecution or discrimination has occurred and lobby for changes in discriminatory practices and laws.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.0/2">The UK deplores the Iranian authorities' treatment of religious minorities. The Iranian Constitution gives nominal protection to members of the Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian faiths by recognising them as minority religions. The number of Christians and Christian converts in Iran who have been arrested or detained has increased significantly over recent years and, under Iran's strict interpretation of Islam, anyone converting to another religion could face the death penalty or at least life imprisonment. Other religious minorities, such as the Baha'is, do not receive even this slender protection under law and are subjected to gross human rights violations. Seven members of the Baha'i leadership in Iran are currently standing trial.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.0/3">In Saudi Arabia, Islam is the official religion and all citizens are required to be Muslims. Renouncing religious belief in Islam is an offence punishable by death. Religious minorities continue to suffer discrimination and are under-represented in the senior government bureaucracy, municipal councils and public companies. Shia leaders have also alleged harassment and civil discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.0/4">Under the terms of its constitution the Maldives is an Islamic country. Under Maldivian law non-Muslims are forbidden from practising their religion publicly. President Mohamed Nasheed has made public his commitment to ensuring that the Maldives fulfils its international obligations on human rights. Since he was elected in October 2008, there has been welcome progress in areas such as media freedom and freedom of expression. But there are still some areas where progress can be made, particularly in regards to religious freedom. We continue to encourage his government to make further progress on this as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.832W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-25">25 March 2009</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs highlighted in a written ministerial statement, the increasing pressure on conflict resources, partly because of exchange rate fluctuations but also because of projected increases in assessed (obligatory) international peacekeeping mission and court contributions. This resulted in less funding being available for discretionary conflict activity (conflict prevention, stabilisation and discretionary peacekeeping e.g. UK secondees to international missions such as EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo). The 2007 CSR Settlement agreed that the Conflict Prevention Pool would be the first port of call if assessed peacekeeping costs rose above forecast.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.3/4">To offset the impact on discretionary conflict activity, DFID, FCO and MOD provided additional resources (&#163;71 million) from their departmental budgets, of which the FCO set aside &#163;15million.</p>

	<p pid="b.834W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office awards non-consolidated, variable performance related payments to recognise particularly strong performance and to reward those who make the biggest contribution. Last year 948 staff, representing 18 per cent. of the workforce, performed strongly enough to be awarded both an in-year non-consolidated, variable performance related payment as well as an annual one. All these staff come from lower management and administrative grades, because the senior civil service cannot earn in-year awards. The largest combined payment was &#163;3,975. Annual non-consolidated, variable performance payments are solely linked to performance appraisals and have been agreed as part of a collective bargaining, negotiated pay settlement. In-year payments are devolved to Directorates to allow them to recognise achievement by their own staff. Nominations are moderated within the Directorate for balance and fairness to all staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.836W.11/2">We assess that while Joseph Kony remains at large, the LRA has no will to re-enter negotiations with any government, nor do they have any credible interlocutors. The LRA's main objective is survival, and they continue to perpetrate brutal acts of violence and intimidation in order to expropriate supplies and funds from civilians across South Sudan, the Central African Republic and North Eastern DRC. The LRA has also been known to target aid distribution efforts in the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.841W.9/1">The Transport Act 2000, as amended by the Local Transport Act 2008, has provided a new policy framework benefiting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It was accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from the Department for transport investment in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, within which transport authority Blaydon falls, has more than doubled over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.9/2">Investment in Tyne and Wear's Joint Local Transport Plan, to which Gateshead Council is a partner authority, has delivered a number of improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the local transport network. Between 2005 and 2008, bus patronage per head of population increased by 8 per cent, and the number of people killed or seriously injured on the local highway network decreased by 22 per cent. in the period 2001-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.9/3">In 2005, the Tyne and Wear Integrated Transport Authority, Nexus, submitted a successful bid to the Department for 'Kickstart' revenue funding of the 639 Gateshead Orbital bus service, operated by Go North-East. The &#163;336,256 award facilitated the doubling of the daytime and early-evening frequency of the service from hourly to half-hourly. The improved service, featuring fully accessible vehicles, has significantly improved links between the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and areas of western Gateshead, including Blaydon.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.9/4">The &#163;17 million Centrelink scheme was completed in 2005, providing enhanced public transport links between Gateshead town centre and the MetroCentre. The project included the construction of an &#163;8.4 million busway and the reorganisation of the public transport interchange in Gateshead town centre to facilitate interchange between bus and Metro services. The project has had the complementary effect of removing large numbers of buses from shopping streets, thereby reducing congestion and improving the environment for pedestrians and shoppers.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.9/5">In July 2007, Gateshead council completed a &#163;1 million upgrade to the A184 Felling bypass. The project included the widening of the road to a three-lane carriageway to provide space for a dedicated bus priority lane. The scheme has provided bus passengers with greater journey time reliability and forms part of Tyne and Wear's 'Superoute' network of Quality Bus Corridors, which generated patronage growth of 14 per cent. between 2002 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.841W.9/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-03">3 February 2010</phrase> the Department announced that it would provide around &#163;580 million to the Tyne and Wear Metro for ongoing operating support and major infrastructure renewals to 2021.</p>

	<p pid="b.847W.0/1">The Transport Act 2000, as amended by the Local Transport Act 2008, has provided a new policy framework benefiting all local transport authorities. The framework gives greater certainty of funding, while encouraging more strategic transport planning with local consultation, and increasing local flexibility and discretion over resources. It was accompanied by a significant increase in capital funding: support from the Department for transport investment in the Metropolitan borough of Wakefield, within which transport authority Hemsworth falls, has doubled over the last decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.0/2">Investment in West Yorkshire's Joint Local Transport plan, to which Wakefield council is a partner authority, has delivered a number of improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the local transport network. Between 2006 and 2008, the percentage of local authority roads requiring structural maintenance decreased by 58 per cent. and the number of people killed or seriously injured on the local highway network decreased by 30 per cent. in the period 2001-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.0/3">In December 2003, the West Yorkshire Integrated Transport Authority, Metro, submitted a successful &#163;18.7 million bid to the Department for funding of the 'Mybus' project, which provides dedicated school transport to 133 schools throughout West Yorkshire, including Hemsworth Arts and Community college. Mybus has delivered a number of benefits, including reduced congestion, air pollution and accidents around schools, improved pupil behaviour on journeys to and from school, and enhanced educational performance and attendance. More than 10,000 pupils currently use the service, 64 per cent. of which previously travelled to school by car.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.0/4">The Wakefield 'Free City Bus' service was introduced by Metro and Wakefield council in April 2007, providing residents and visitors with a frequent and fully accessible service between the city's rail and bus interchanges and main shopping areas. Patronage of the service has far exceeded expectations, particularly for journeys to and from the Ings Road and Westgate Retail Parks, which were previously inaccessible by public transport. The introduction of the Free City Bus has resulted in a 5 per cent. increase in the number of people living within 30 minutes travel time of Wakefield city centre by public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.0/5">The &#163;24.2 million Hemsworth to A1 Link Road was completed in November 2009. The project was commissioned to promote the economic regeneration of the former coal and steel communities in the area by significantly improving their access to the strategic road network. The new section of road, between Hemsworth and the A638 at Upton, includes a link to the proposed South Kirkby Business Park.</p>

	<p pid="b.855W.8/1">The Government's policy is that hospitals (including those with accident and emergency and minor injury units) and other medical facilities are not normally signed from motorways and other trunk roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.855W.8/2">For operational reasons there are a number of junctions on the all-purpose trunk road where hospitals (including those without accident and emergency facilities) have been signed. These signs have been approved by exception in situations where road users have to take a different route than expected or where there may be two hospitals in close proximity that could confuse the road user, particularly if one has an accident and emergency department and the other does not.</p>
	<p pid="b.855W.8/3">Providing signs on the motorway and primary route network to accident and emergency or urgent care centres would require a considerable number of extra signs and could result in some road users missing existing safety-critical signs.</p>

Where information is available it has been set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.2/2">The Vehicle Operator Services Agency spend on fuel for patrol vehicles from October 2008 to September 2009 was &#163;161,467 and spend on maintenance of patrol vehicles from October 2008 to September 2009 was &#163;164,343.</p>

Vehicles are provided on a lease basis which includes the lease and maintenance costs which cannot be separated. The lease cost for patrol vehicles was &#163;2,305,000 in 2006-07, &#163;2,337,000 in 2007-08 and &#163;3,118,000 in 2008-09. For 2008-09 approximately one-third of the lease cost was for maintenance. The increase in costs is largely as a result of the growth in the number of traffic officer patrols as the service was rolled out across the motorway network in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.2/2">DECC was created in November 2008 from parts of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Department for Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). Both Departments had in place their own policies and procedures for electronic records management, including email deletion, which my Department has largely adopted while we develop our own policies and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/3" class="italic"> Deletion of emails</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/4">The policy for DECC staff who moved from BIS, and staff new to the Department, is for emails to be automatically deleted after 12 months. The policy for staff who moved from DEFRA is for emails to be kept with no automatic deletion, however at the point of joining DECC, the emails were subject to the DEFRA deletion policy of three years. I anticipate that from April 2010 the Department will be adopting a single policy for all, which will include emails being automatically deleted after 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/5" class="italic"> Electronic records management</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/6">The Department is implementing electronic records management based on a software product recommended by The National Archives. My officials continue to work with The National Archives to help us be consistent with their guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.872W.8/2">However, an element of the Department's pay bill is allocated to the non-consolidated variable pay awards which is used to encourage and reward high performance. These are paid to members of staff who have performed exceptionally well by, for example, exceeding targets or meeting challenging objectives. These non-consolidated variable pay awards are made in line with the Department's annual pay award which are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets. As such, they do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.872W.8/3">The Department also operates a scheme for staff below the senior civil service under which individuals or teams may receive small non-consolidated awards in recognition of an outstanding contribution over a limited period.

To date, 27 interim empty dwelling management orders have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service since the legislation came into effect in April 2006. Local authorities do not need any further approval to make final empty dwelling management orders. However, local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>

	<p pid="b.879W.5/1">The Government are committed to reducing fire deaths. The installation of properly maintained smoke alarms in every household has been the centrepiece of our efforts to reduce fire deaths as they provide the vital early warning of fire and help people to escape. Smoke alarms can help save lives regardless of age or mobility.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.5/2">Our view is that sprinklers can be an effective risk mitigation measure, particularly where their provision is targeted at buildings where the occupants are most at risk from fire. However, they are not a panacea and it is important they are considered as part of a package of measures, both active (e.g. smoke alarms) and passive (fire resistant construction materials and compartmentation) and effective building management.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.5/3">The latest edition of Approved Document B, which gives guidance on compliance with the fire safety aspects of Building Regulations, came into effect in April 2007. The extensive review that preceded the development of this new guidance considered a four year research project looking at the issue of residential and domestic sprinklers from both an effectiveness and cost benefit perspective. The review, which included public consultation, concluded that it would not be cost effective to provide sprinklers in all new homes. We do not intend revisiting Part B of the Building Regulations again until 2013 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="b.879W.5/4">A major barrier to the wider use of sprinklers in the domestic market is that they are expensive. The Government are therefore trialling a lower-cost sprinkler system in new build and existing housing in four fire and rescue authority areas to resolve any technical issues and test cost assumptions. If these pilots are successful, we will have demonstrated that a lower-cost system could have a crucial role to play in helping to protect the most vulnerable from fire, including for people with limited mobility.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.2/1">Figures are given in the following table. The Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) is a new way of recognising achievement through the award of credit for units and qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The QCF was approved by Ministers in November 2008, following two years of test and trial led by the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA). Figures for 2009-10 are based on actual expenditure up to November 2009, the latest date for which figures are available, plus forecast expenditure for the remainder of the financial year. No figures are yet available for 2010-11 or 2011-12 for BIS, the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) or Ofqual. In the case of the Learning and Skills Improvement Service (LSIS), BIS will be making &#163;46.85 million available in 2010-11 for all of LSIS' needs, and it will be for LSIS itself to determine how much-a very small proportion of that total-it spends on QCF. No figure has yet been determined for LSIS' budget in 2011-12. Expenditure by QCDA on QCF in 2010-11 and 2011-12 will be zero.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.0/2">Sure Start children's centres are becoming a universal service for all young children and their families. At the end of December 2009, there were 3,381 designated children's centres and we are on track to reach our target 3,500 centres by March 2010. All children born in England will therefore soon have access to early childhood services through their local children's centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.0/3">The Department does not collect information nationally on how much data are reported from the NHS to children's centres. But health services are part of the children's centre core offer, with health visitors in children's centres playing a key role delivering the 'Healthy Child Programme' (the evidenced-based child public health programme offered to all families from pregnancy to five years of age) and making the vital first link to the wide range of services on offer including antenatal and postnatal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.0/4">Information sharing is crucial and we plan to publish a leaflet shortly focusing on health, children's centres and information sharing. Its target audience will include health visitors and midwives because of their unique early interaction with all new parents and it will set out minimum standards we expect centres and health professionals to adhere to, in terms of sharing and retaining birth data. This leaflet is designed to be read alongside the cross-Government guidance on information sharing which is the overall authority in this area. The guidance can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.908W.5/1">The purpose of the national DNA database (NDNAD) is to match DNA profiles taken from individuals with those taken from crime scenes. It holds only the information necessary for this function, and does not contain criminal records or information on whether those on it are in prison.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.5/2">However, there are good reasons for believing that a significant majority of the prison population has a profile on the NDNAD. Police forces have had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA database in 1995. For the first few years this power was exercised in relation to more serious offenders, but from 2000 onwards additional funding was made available under the DNA expansion programme to make it standard practice to take samples from all offenders. In April 2004, the law was changed to allow DNA samples to be taken from all those arrested for recordable offences. Following this, taking a DNA sample in the custody suite has become routine procedure. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.5/3">Legal powers have existed since 1996 to take DNA samples from those in prison. The Crime and Security Bill currently before Parliament allows samples to be taken from those convicted of sexual and violent offences before 1995 even if they are no longer in prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.908W.8/2">The national DNA database (NDNAD) is designed to match DNA taken from crime scenes with that taken from individuals. It does not hold information on whether those with records on it have convictions, as this is not necessary for this purpose. Data on convictions is held on the Police National Computer (PNC).</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.2/1">In 2009, the Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) helpline gave advice and support in 1,682 separate instances of possible forced marriage (this figure counts multiple calls on one case as one &quot;instance&quot;) and the unit itself dealt with 375 cases of forced marriage. The FMU is committed to working closely with the third sector to provide victims with the full range of support and assistance and has increased funding to third sector organisation over recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.2/2">It is not possible to provide statistics for the number of people affected by forced marriage who received assistance from third sector organisations funded by the unit in financial year 2009-10. This is because the projects are ongoing and the outcomes of the projects are not necessarily quantifiable in these terms. Funds were provided, for instance, for projects designed to increase awareness of forced marriage and appropriate responses to it among various professional, peer and community groups. It is not possible to accurately assess the number of individuals engaged by these projects that have themselves already been directly affected by forced marriage. Going forward, the FMU are working with Governmental and non-governmental partners to build the best statistical picture possible.</p>

			<tr pid="b.921W.2/8"> <td colspan="2"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. Waiting times are usually only calculated for first attendances of patients referred by general practitioners and dentists. It is unclear whether the data collected have any relevance to subsequent attenders. Analysis of the data has revealed high (up to 100 per cent.) percentages of zero day waits for some providers suggesting poor data recording. For this reason '0' days waits have been excluded from the analysis.<br/> 2. First attendance: whether a patient is making a first attendance or a follow-up attendance and whether the consultation was face-to-face or via telephone/telemedicine consultation. The first attendance includes the first out-patient appointment and the first tele-consultation appointment.<br/> 3. Hospital provider: a provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (for example, national health service trust or primary care trust (PCT)). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TCs). Normally, if data are tabulated by healthcare provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, these data are quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of data flows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using these data as the counts may be lower than true figures.<br/>  4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.922W.2/1">Until 2008-09 the Government's pooled treatment budget was allocated against a basket of indicators of social and economic deprivation known to reflect drug use as the best available proxy of treatment need. As a result of differences in performance between drug partnerships in getting people into treatment this funding formula was resulting in unjustifiable variations in the amount of the central contribution for each person's treatment.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.2/4" class="indent">25 per cent. of the allocation is based on the indicators underpinning the previous formula to reflect the differential cost of responding to different levels of complex need such as homelessness, mental health, family breakdown and unemployment;</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/5" class="indent">75 per cent. is based on activity in the treatment system with areas being allocated a set amount per person treated effectively; and</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/6" class="indent">the final element is an area adjustment figure to reflect the varying costs of delivering services in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/7">To promote an orderly alteration to service planning, the change is being introduced over three years with the annual maximum reduction set of 5 per cent. in 2008-09, 15 per cent. in 2009-10 and 30 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/8">The illustrative amount for 2010-11 was &#163;925,000 (published January 2008). However the actual allocation is dependent on the numbers in treatment relative to the total number in treatment across all areas. Milton Keynes allocation for 2010-11, will be notified shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.2/1">As a precautionary measure, the Department continues to raise awareness and recommends vitamin D supplementation for those at risk of vitamin D deficiency, which may develop into rickets. Those at risk include all pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children up to the age of five years. Although sporadic incidence of rickets are reported at present, the concern is more about the high proportion of people at risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.2/2">The recommendations are also available to health professionals, through mainstream communications including Healthy Start. The importance of Healthy Start vitamin supplements for women and children is reinforced by the Department, and work with the national health service and devolved administrations is ongoing to improve their uptake. For beneficiaries of the Healthy Start scheme, free vitamins for pregnant women and children (both containing vitamin D) are available free from the NHS without prescription.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.5/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the borough of Sandwell.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/3">For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/4">Figures for November 2009 show that in Sandwell Primary Care Trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/5">93 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/6">98 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/7">In September 2009, at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, 99 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/8">Between September 2002 and September 2008 the number of consultants at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust has increased from 199 to 236. Between September 2002 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 2,072 to 2,127.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/9">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within Sandwell PCT has increased from 57.3 to 61.9.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/10">93.4 per cent. of urgent general GP referrals to Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/11">Sandwell PCT opened its GP-led health centre on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase> in West Bromwich. The Malling Health Centre offers longer opening hours, meaning that any member of the public will be able to see a GP or nurse between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/12">There is one private finance initiative (PFI) scheme in the area that serves this constituency. Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust's &#163;26 million Ambulatory Care Centre PFI scheme opened in November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/13">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Sandwell will have also benefitted from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/14">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/15">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/16">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/17">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/18">The National Carer's Strategy-(&quot;Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities&quot;)-launched in 2008,</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/19">The first National Dementia Strategy was published in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/20">&quot;Valuing People Now&quot;-a three year strategy for people with learning disabilities published in January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/21">&quot;New Horizons: A Shared Vision for Mental Health&quot;-launched in December 2009-to maintain improvements in mental health services combined with a new cross-Government approach to promoting public mental health.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/22">Since 1998, there are now 2.4 million fewer smokers in England as a result of the Government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy which has a measurable impact on reducing smoking prevalence.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/23">Child obesity levels are reducing due to the efforts of families across England, supported by the Government's obesity strategy. In 2008, 13.9 per cent. of children (aged two to 10) in England were classified as obese, compared with 17.3 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.5/24">Overall, life expectancy at birth for men has increased from 74.5 years (1995-1997 data) to 77.7 years (2006-08 data) while for women, life expectancy at birth has increased from 79.6 years (1995-97 data) to 81.9 years (2006-08 data).</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice's work spans criminal, civil and family justice, democracy, rights and the constitution.

	<p pid="b.943W.2/2">The range of the Department's policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to it is not normally collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, some of the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.2/3" class="indent">Although data on sentencing for the period is not available for the constituency of North-East Milton Keynes, it is available for the Thames Valley. This shows the total number of offenders sentenced annually was 38,701 in 1997 and 38,306 in 2008, the latest period for which such information is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.2/4" class="indent">The number of offences brought to justice for the Thames Valley area increased from 29,877 for the 12 months ending <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> (the earliest period since which such data has been compiled) to 48,465 (provisional figures) for the 12 months ending <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.2/5" class="indent">With regard to prosecutions, data is not available for the constituency of North-East Milton Keynes. However, the total number of defendants proceeded against at magistrates courts in the Thames Valley was 53,716 in 1997 compared to 47,425 in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.2/6" class="indent">The latest data, which covers reoffending in the period <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-01">1 July 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June 2009</phrase>, showed that the three month reoffending rate for offenders on the probation case load in Milton Keynes was 9.48 per cent. After controlling for changes in the characteristics of offenders on the probation case load, there was an increase in reoffending of 2.99 per cent. compared to the 2007-08 baseline. Data is not available prior to 2007 on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.2/7" class="indent">The number of persons commencing court order supervision by the probation service in the Thames Valley was 3,716 in 1997and 5,256 in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.2/10" class="indent">Local communities are being better engaged in criminal justice-by giving them a say in the types of Community Payback projects offenders carry out and allowing them to see justice being done, for example through the use of high visibility jackets. Offenders have now worked more than 14 million hours, with an estimated value to the taxpayer of over &#163;80 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.958W.2/2">'New Industry, New Jobs' is the Government's active industrial strategy, covering cross-economy issues such as skills and innovation as well as sectoral and geographic interventions. It therefore encompasses a broad range of financial instruments.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/3">The Strategic Investment Fund was set at Budget 2009 specifically to underpin 'New Industry, New Jobs'. The SIF aims to support advanced industrial projects of strategic importance. The original fund of &#163;750 million was increased by &#163;200 million in the pre-Budget report in December 2010, and we expect to spend around &#163;200 million by the end of this financial year. The whole fund is to be spent by March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.958W.2/4">Much of this money is being distributed through UK wide mechanisms such as the UK Innovation Investment Fund and the Technology Strategy Board. As a UK-wide fund, many of the projects supported by the SIF are themselves UK-wide in geographical scope, as are the expected economic benefits. In addition to UK-wide schemes, there are two specific projects located in Wales. These are a &#163;10 million contribution to a high performance computing centre in South Wales and a SIF contribution to the &#163;340 million announced for repayable launch investment to Airbus, which is benefiting the facility at Broughton in North Wales.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-02-09b.316474.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-02-09b.960W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" speakername="Patrick McFadden" colnum="960W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/text/100209w0039.htm#100209124001959">
	<p pid="b.960W.3/1">The Government have put in place a wide-ranging programme of reform since 1997. Over the decade to 2007 the economic performance of all parts of the UK improved considerably. The policies of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (and its predecessors) have focused on building a competitive economy, delivering prosperity and sustainable economic growth. The regional development agency Advantage West Midlands (AWM) was established by the Government in 1998 to lead economic development work in the west midlands. The implementation of BIS policy in Sandwell has been taken forward primarily by AWM and the Government office for the west midlands, working with Sandwell metropolitan borough council and other local partners. The Government and their regional and local partners have responded vigorously to the global recession, providing assistance to companies and individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/2">Consistent datasets going back to 1997 are not available for all key issues; the following statistics therefore start from the earliest date for which comparable data are available:</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/3" class="indent">(i) The level of skills in Sandwell has improved significantly with the proportion of the working age population qualified to at least NVQ2 level having increased from 31.8 per cent. to 45.0 per cent. between 1999 and 2008. Over the same period the proportion of the working age population qualified to at least NVQ3 increased from 19.8 per cent. to 25.3 per cent. and the proportion qualified to at least NVQ4 increased from 10.2 per cent. to 13.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/4" class="indent">(ii) The number of businesses registered for VAT increased from 5,385 at the start of 2001 to 6,495 at the beginning of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/5" class="indent">(iii) Business Link West Midlands (BLWM) is the main provider of business support in the region. It helped 135 businesses to start in Sandwell during 2007-08, 202 in 2008-09 and has assisted a further 170 businesses to start-up in the 10 months to the end of January 2010. BLWM also provided intensive assistance to 546 businesses in the borough in 2007-08, 825 in 2008-09 and 632 in the first 10 months of the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/6" class="indent">(iv) AWM has offered Grants for Business Investment (GBI) funding to 42 firms in Sandwell since 2004. The grants were worth a total of &#163;5.9 million and have created 483 new jobs and safeguarded a further 554.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/7" class="indent">(v) Between September and December 2009 19 companies in the automotive supply chain based in Sandwell received &#163;338,740 support under the &#163;4.5 million Automotive Recovery Programme (ARP). The programme was funded by AWM and the European Regional Development Fund and managed by the Manufacturing Advisory Service-West Midlands (MAS-WM). Following a robust capability review it funded specialist strategic consultancy to provide struggling component part makers with help with business consolidation, refinancing, new product introduction and restructuring. Six of the companies have already returned results showing that the assistance provided has led to business worth over &#163;20 million being safeguarded or obtained, leading to the creation of safeguarding of 58 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.960W.3/8" class="indent">(vi) In December, Stoford Ltd. signed an agreement with BT for 75,000 sq ft of office space at its new &#163;55 million All Saints office development in West Bromwich. The building will support BT's Transform Sandwell partnership with Sandwell metropolitan borough council creating up to 450 new jobs. Advantage West Midlands has committed &#163;11 million to the All Saints project.</p>

Socio-economic classification (SEC) was introduced into higher education student data in the 2002-03 academic year and, therefore, figures for earlier years (which show the former social classification) are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.961W.2/3">Figures are provided for full-time undergraduate entrants aged under 21, and 21 and over, as data on socio-economic class is gathered on a different basis for these two distinct age groups. Socio-economic class is derived from information on occupation. For entrants aged under 21 this is based on the occupation of their parent, and for those aged 21 and over it is based on their own occupation.</p>
	<p pid="b.961W.2/4">Figures for the 2008-09 academic year have been excluded from this answer as they are not directly comparable with those for 2002-03 to 2007-08 due to a change in the way parental or student occupation information was gathered. As a result of the change, it is not possible to determine whether the 2008-09 socio-economic class relates to the student or their parent.</p>
