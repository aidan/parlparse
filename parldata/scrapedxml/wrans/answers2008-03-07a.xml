	<p pid="a.2840W.6/1">This information is not held centrally in the form requested. In general the Government allocate funding to police force areas as a whole rather than to specific locations or functions. The actual deployment of police officers at ports and their costs is an operational matter for individual Chief Officers. In the case of London, the Counter Terrorism Command is responsible for the policing of the border within the Metropolitan police force area (especially Heathrow and London City airports).</p>
	<p pid="a.2840W.6/2">Airport operators reimburse police authorities for the costs of uniformed police officers at airports designated under section 25 of the Aviation Security Act, such as Heathrow. At other ports, such as London City airport, police officers are funded wholly or partly by the police authority, or by other means, including voluntary contributions by airport operators. These amounts are determined locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.2840W.6/3">Additional funding for Special Branch officers at ports is provided by the Home Office through Dedicated Security Post (DSP) grants which go towards the police costs of specific security functions. The grants paid to police forces towards the costs of funding their Special Branch officers at ports in financial years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 were &pound;70.6 million &pound;71.4 million and &pound;72.6 million respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.2841W.5/1">Data on arrests collected by the Ministry of Justice provides information on persons arrested for recorded crime (notifiable offences), aggregated by main offence group, i.e. violence against the person, sexual offences, robbery, burglary, etc. More detailed data about specific offences such as shoplifting do not form part of this collection. In the light of that, the data are not available in the requested format.</p>
	<p pid="a.2841W.5/2">Since 2003, drug testing of offenders for specified class A drugs (heroin, cocaine/crack cocaine) in some police custody suites has operated as part of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP). Under DIP, offenders who are arrested/charged with a trigger offence (including 'theft' offences, which also includes shoplifting offences) in DIP intensive areas (those areas with high levels of drug-related crime) are required to undergo a drug test.</p>
	<p pid="a.2841W.5/3">The proportion of individuals who tested positive for heroin and/or crack cocaine following arrest/charge for 'theft' offences (including shoplifting) as part of the DIP programme in the last three years for which we have data are shown as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.2841W.5/6"> <td></td> <td><i> Percentage</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.2841W.5/7"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>50</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.2841W.5/9"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>38</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.2841W.5/12">It should be noted that the reduction in the positive test rate reflects the introduction of the power to test on arrest rather than just at the charge stage. Data is not available for all illicit drugs as DIP only tests for specified CLASS A drugs (heroin, cocaine/crack cocaine) and that only some custody suites have drug testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2841W.5/13">Where individuals test positive for heroin and/or cocaine/crack cocaine, they are required to undergo an assessment of their drug use and treatment needs with a drug worker. Failure to attend can result in a criminal charge. Since 2003, more than 115,000 drug misusers have entered treatment through DIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.2841W.5/14">Figures from a voluntary survey of police arrestees (the Arrestee Survey, Home Office Statistical Bulletin 12/07 (2007)), show that 54 per cent. of those reporting regular (weekly) use of heroin or crack cocaine (HC) reported shoplifting in the four weeks prior to arrest. Among those arrested for shoplifting, 37 per cent. self-reported weekly use of HC.</p>

	<p pid="a.2846W.9/3">Detailed information is held in all Ship/Unit Administrative Offices in the form of booklets and tri fold leaflets. In addition, all personnel have access to the Joint Service Publication 765 'The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for Injury, Illness and Death Due to Service' either via the MoD Intranet or from their Administrative Offices. Staff at all Service Medical facilities (including the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Selly Oak and the Medical Rehabilitation Unit at Headley Court) are aware of the scheme and able to advise patients of the process for making a claim. Finally, details of the scheme and how to make a claim are held by Ship/Unit welfare staff and ex-service charities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2849W.6/1">Based on actual food and storage and distribution costs, and forecast personnel numbers for March 2008, the average cost per capita, per diem, of food, and the storage and distribution of food, for troops and civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.2849W.6/9">The ratio between fresh food and operational ration pack elements of the cost varies between the operational needs in each environment. Equally, the storage and distribution requirements for each operational theatre vary, and hence the proportion of overall cost attributable to each is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.2849W.6/10">In Afghanistan, there are additional storage and distribution costs in meeting the demands of that operational environment, for example military charter flights and convoys to support the forward operating bases, and these cannot be broken down.</p>
	<p pid="a.2849W.6/11">Catering costs in both theatres would include: capital costs of kitchens and dining rooms; maintenance of catering infrastructure; civilian contracts in support of catering. This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.2855W.5/1">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommended that a reduction in the average population salt intake would proportionally lower population average blood pressure levels and confer significant public health benefits by contributing to a decrease in the burden of cardiovascular disease.

	<p pid="a.2855W.5/2">The Department and the Food Standards Agency have been working in partnership to deliver the SACN recommendation and reduce the average population salt intakes to six grams, as set out in the Department's &quot;Food and Health Action Plan&quot; and the agency's &quot;Strategic Plan&quot; up to 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.2860W.8/1">The Government consider that decision making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary/alternative treatments, are a matter for local national health service service providers and practitioners. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the treatment, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>
	<p pid="a.2860W.8/2">A working group, chaired by Professor Mike Pittilo of Robert Gordon University, has completed its work looking at proposals for regulation of herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture which were made in a report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology in 2000. Their report will be submitted to Ministers shortly, and a decision will then be taken about whether, and if so, how soon, legislation should be brought forward.</p>

Accordingly, alcohol is provided only as an exception and only with the specific written authority of a small number of designated senior civil servants.</p>

	<p pid="a.2868W.2/5" class="indent">We deal with over 69,000 calls every weekday to our contact centres. We are currently answering 95.8% of calls to our new claims service. Similarly for customers seeking to access our job broking services we are achieving 94.4% of calls answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.2868W.2/6" class="indent">Following the introduction of the telephone service for Social Fund Crisis Loans we have experienced an increase of between 41-114% in call volumes (depending on the site) month on month compared to two years ago for applications to the Social Fund Crisis Loans service and as a result some offices have struggled to cope. To improve this service we are currently deploying an additional 700 staff based in our contact centres. This has enabled us to answer over 90% of calls and take nearly 40,000 applications per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.2868W.2/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is continually looking for ways of improving its services and we are discussing with our telephone service providers what changes could be made to improve queue management. We are making a significant investment in the most up to date telephony infrastructure to upgrade both telephony and the available management information, to enable the effective handling of peaks and troughs of the calls we receive. The new management information system will also provide us with improved data to help monitor and develop our telephony service.</p>

	<p pid="a.2876W.6/1">All cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which makes it an offence to intentionally kill or injure cetaceans. The Government strengthened the protection given to cetaceans through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which introduced a new offence of recklessly disturbing cetaceans. The first successful conviction under the Act was in December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.2876W.6/2">All cetaceans are also listed under Annex IVa of the Council Directive (92/43/EEC) on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (the Habitats Directive), as species in need of strict protection. This directive is transposed into UK law by the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 1994, protecting cetaceans from deliberate killing and capture.</p>
	<p pid="a.2876W.6/3">The UK is also a Party to ASCOBANS&mdash;the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North seas&mdash;which aims to restore and/or maintain biological or management stocks of small cetaceans at the level they would reach when there is the lowest possible anthropogenic influence and proposes to reach these aims through co-ordinating and implementing conservation measures for small cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid="a.2876W.6/4">We realise that the by-catch of cetaceans in some fisheries can be a problem. In an attempt to reduce fisheries by-catch DEFRA and the devolved administrations' fisheries departments published the UK Small Cetacean By-catch Response Strategy in March 2003. An update on the progress of implementing the strategy can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.2876W.6/6">As part of this strategy, the UK Government spent around &pound;1.6 million from 2000-05 on research into cetacean by-catch caused by fishing effort and measures to mitigate against by-catch.</p>

The pilot will collect information on a range of indicators including fishing method, catches, discards, marketing and fuel consumption. This, and other information, will help inform the implementation of Fisheries 2027, a long-term vision for sustainable fisheries. DEFRA officials have spoken with a number of fishermen from the above areas who have expressed an interest in participating in the pilot and, in due course, they will be holding meetings in the three pilot areas to discuss details of the scheme. I have not offered compensation but costs of equipping participating vessels will be met by DEFRA. I will consider extending the pilot to recreational fishing following a review of the first six months of the scheme which I aim to have operational by the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.2877W.5/1">The Energy Using Products Framework Directive (EuP) by itself, does not have any direct impact on industry. Rather it establishes a Framework for the European Commission and member states to develop implementing measures setting eco-design requirements for specific products or product groups. It is only when these implementing measures have been agreed and enter into force that they require manufacturers to take action. Discussions on specific implementing measures are still ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2877W.5/2">Similarly, as discussions between the Commission, member states and stakeholders relating to the proposed implementing measure for hot water heaters and boilers are still ongoing it is not yet possible to say what the exact requirements, if any, will be for controls nor what form this implementing measure will take.</p>

It is difficult to determine if the vessels were pelagic fishing at the time of observation as not all vessels were inspected. The German pair team accessed the UK 12 nautical mile limit in the North sea off the Northumberland coast, the French pair teams were all operating in the English channel.

	<p pid="a.2889W.3/1">I meet regularly with EU counterparts on a range of issues, including the EU Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), as do my Ministerial and policy colleagues. Currently the UK is working with EU partners, including the Commission, to review how the EU ETS can best deliver the necessary reductions in emissions beyond 2012. The UK view is that the review should be ambitious, delivering real emissions reductions (ie 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. as part of an international negotiation) by 2020, as agreed at the spring Council 2007, greater harmonisation and long-term certainty, and maximise its potential to stimulate investment in low-carbon technology. The Commission's proposal for a revised EU ETS from 2013 was discussed by EU Environment Ministers at the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March</phrase> and will also be discussed by EU leaders at the spring European Council on 13-<phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2889W.3/2">The Government agree with Sir Nicholas Stern that a global price for carbon is essential if we are to achieve a low carbon economy. The EU ETS and other mandatory emissions trading schemes being developed around the world are crucial stepping stones towards this. It is a major pillar of both UK and EU climate change policy and is the primary market based mechanism in the fight against climate change. It is fundamental to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by keeping emissions within agreed limits while allowing emission reductions to be made at least cost through trading of allowances.</p>

	<p pid="a.2892W.2/2">The September 2006 Cordoba agreements set out new arrangements for the border designed to improve pedestrian and traffic flows between Gibraltar and Spain. These arrangements, which saw the introduction of red and green customs channels in both directions, came into force in December 2006 and have considerably improved border fluidity. Data gathered by the Gibraltar authorities for traffic travelling from Gibraltar to Spain shows a marked improvement when figures are compared to similar periods before December 2006. Queues with measurable delays only build up in peak traffic periods, usually at the end of the working day and Saturdays. The Gibraltar authorities do not gather data on delay times entering Gibraltar from Spain.</p>

But our policy of redistributing grant will widen participation and mean that more of the ten million women of working age who do not have a first higher-level qualification, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be able to benefit from participating in higher education. I have had no discussions with the Minister for Women specifically on this issue which does not discriminate against women, but offers more opportunities for both men and women without a first higher education qualification.</p>

	<p pid="a.2902W.5/1">Our policy is a progressive redistribution of &pound;100 million in institutional funding by 2010 away from students who already have a first HE qualification and want to study another one at an equivalent or lower level towards first time entrants will enable more of the 20 million people of working age who do not have a first HE qualification to participate in higher education and all the benefits it brings. But it will also bring economic benefits to employers by expanding the supply of more highly qualified, more productive workers. Lord Leitch's report, comparative data from the OECD, and the fact that the lifetime earnings premium associated with having a first degree remains among the highest in the world, all suggest that employers in this country in the private, public and not-for-profit sectors are themselves, under the current system, paying for the fact that we are not producing enough graduates for our economic well-being.</p>

	<p pid="a.2902W.8/1">The outcome of the comprehensive spending review will enable us to support an additional 60,000 new places in full-time equivalent terms for new students either entering HE for the first time or progressing to higher level degrees to ones they already hold. Despite doubts about the viability of growth and individual courses when we introduced our policies in 1997, there has already been an increase in the number of students in the system of over 300,000 and we remain confident that any sceptics will once again be proved wrong. That assessment is also consistent with Lord Leitch's report and comparative data from the OECD. An extra 5 million people will need to obtain a first higher education qualification by 2020 if we are to be even on the edge of the premier league for world-class skills, with 40 per cent. of the workforce with higher level qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="a.2903W.5/1">Yes. In finalising our proposals, we have decided not to rush into making special arrangements, other than those subjects we have already identified as requiring support in the public interest&mdash;such as medicine, initial teacher training teaching, science, technology, engineering and maths subjects, area-based studies, and modern foreign languages. But we are asking the Funding Council each year to look at subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance, and in cases where there is evidence of a fall in demand advise us on the best way forward. The first review will be in December 2008 and could provide an opportunity to look at these subjects. There will also be opportunities for those with a first HE qualification who want to retrain in these subjects, through foundation degrees, and employer co-funded provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.2906W.6/1">The UK has a dynamic and flexible labour market with the highest employment rate in the G7 and 2.8 million new jobs have been created in the UK since 1997. Despite this success there are too many people still missing out on work and the benefits that it brings. This Government are determined to ensure that no individual is left behind. Independent projections suggest that there will be five million fewer low-skilled people in work in 2020, and five million more higher-skilled people in work. This will require significant upskilling of the British population from today's levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.2906W.6/2">The announcement of new training places reaffirms the Government's commitment to upskilling British people to provide them with the skills required in a more competitive labour market, to get them off benefits and into jobs and to help them to advance from low skilled to higher skilled jobs. We will continue to help those who need to improve their skills&mdash;the overwhelming majority of whom, but not all are British.</p>
