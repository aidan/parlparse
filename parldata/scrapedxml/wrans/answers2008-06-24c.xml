This free advice suggests some common sense, precautionary measures that farmers can take to help reduce the risk of bovine TB transmission between cattle and between cattle and badgers. We have also produced a CD-Rom for use by vets when giving guidance to farmers about protecting their livestock from the risk of TB.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.0/2">This is in addition to a range of other cattle-based measures introduced in the last couple of years to tackle bovine TB such as the introduction of zero tolerance of overdue tests; pre-movement tests for cattle moving from high risk herds; and extension of the use of the gamma interferon test.

	<p pid="c.162W.3/2">Results from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial show that badgers are the main wildlife reservoir and contribute to bovine TB (bTB) in cattle.</p>
	<p pid="c.162W.3/3">The risk to cattle of infection from wild species other than badgers has been assessed through research carried out by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL).

	<p pid="c.162W.3/4">Quantitative risk assessments commissioned by DEFRA demonstrate that the risk of cattle infection from deer is only likely to be significant if the prevalence of TB infection in deer is high.</p>

The potential risks to public health from exposure to wild animals infected with M. bovis are minimal, therefore no wildlife-specific public health protection measures are necessary. However, advice is available on the HPA website and from local animal health offices if people have concerns.</p>

	<p pid="c.166W.0/1">Capital works promoted by operating authorities have been prioritised according to the priority scoring system (PSS) which makes use of three main criteria: economics (based on benefit cost ratio); people (number of residential properties protected, risk and vulnerability); and environment (based on the area of habitat created or protected and heritage sites). The risk element of the people score recognised the differences between very fast onset of flooding (common in coastal areas) and slower rising flooding with longer warning times.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.0/2">New outcome measures for flood and coastal erosion risk management have been developed to provide greater clarity on what policies and funding for flood and coastal erosion risk management are intended to achieve. There are currently nine outcome measures, seven of which apply to both flood and coastal erosion risk, and two to flood risk only.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.0/3">We are working with the Environment Agency to develop an effective prioritisation approach using the outcome measures and expect a revised system to be introduced for 2009-10. There was no differentiation between coastal and inland areas in setting the targets for the flood management outcome measures, but the funding allocations announced in March did include an underlying minimum allocation for coastal local authorities of &pound;110 million over three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.176W.2/55" class="indent">The Mobility Index figures used by SCE are based on the Dobson-Henthorn formula which calculates mobility percentages based on the overall impact to the school roll by children either arriving or leaving each school at a non-standard time, i.e. prior to the normal school leaving age. This can on first sight cause some confusion, e.g. if a School roll is 100 and 50 children leave and are replaced by a different 50 children then the Index would show a percentage score of 100.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.13/3">The Group will now consider further the potential barriers to this proposed digital migration, including the need to increase the coverage of DAB.

Excluding nuclear as an option would mean the UK would also be reliant on a less diverse mix of technologies to insure us against the future developments that could undermine security of supply, for example higher fossil fuel prices.</p>

Additionally, in the same period, the seven-day warning letter sent by the Agency to inform clients that their debt is being transferred to the debt collection agencies has resulted in an additional &pound;6 million being collected by the Agency bringing the total collected in this period to &pound;17.9m.</p>

Some are already licensed and others will be able to work under valid third party agreements which mean that they will not themselves require a licence.</p>

The concordat sets out the cross-sector commitment to personalising public services and aims to support all councils to transform their adult social care systems by moving away from intervention at the point of crisis towards early intervention and prevention, focused on promoting independence and improved wellbeing. We are extracting and disseminating early lessons learnt from the Partnerships for Older People Projects programme and related initiatives to support the transformation programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.15/7">It is for councils to determine the allocation of their resources in their area depending on local needs and priorities. This Government have made unprecedented investments in care and support since 1997, including a 45 per cent. real terms increase in local government funding by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.15/8">We have already made &pound;25 million available to councils to help them support carers in a crisis situation. The review of the Prime Minister's Carers Strategy will be published this month and the helpline will be operational later in the year. We are also establishing a training programme for carers. The first face-to-face training will be in place by August and the distance learning version by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.15/9">The Government are committed to supporting young disabled people. This is outlined as one of our commitments in the Independent Living Strategy. We will support young disabled people and ensure they experience a seamless transition into adulthood, including those with complex health needs, in all aspects of their life, including between children's and adults' services, as well as housing, transport, employment, education and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.15/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">14 December 2007</phrase>, the Government announced a &pound;45 million fund to ensure that disabled children in England can take better quality short breaks and to give their families time off.</p>
	<p pid="c.200W.15/11">Disabled young people in England are also to receive &pound;8.4 million in extra support. Low income families with disabled young people aged 16 and 17 will be able to access a grant through the Family Fund.</p>

	<p pid="c.235W.9/1">The process for becoming an approved supplier on the Cultural Diversity Framework and the Approved Supplier List are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/2">The Cultural Diversity Framework was set up in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2006. The framework was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) using the restricted procedure, in trade journals and on Central Office of Information's (COI) buyer profile.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/3">Suppliers wishing to be on the framework were directed to the pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ). Suppliers were required to complete the PQQ, which was available for 30 days after publishing. The PQQs were then scored and evaluated against the published award criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/4">Successful suppliers were invited to the next stage where they were provided with a fictitious brief. Suppliers were given 40 days in which to complete the brief and were asked to pitch at their own premises as part of a site visit. This was also scored and evaluated against published award criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/5">Those successful at this stage were assessed as to whether they had shown capability to deliver services under each of the published lots and labels, and were given the opportunity to sit on the framework.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/6">The Approved Supplier List was advertised on the Supply2Gov website, in trade journals and COI's buyer profile. Potential suppliers were required to complete a PQQ, which was available for 30 days after publishing. The PQQs were then scored and evaluated against the published award criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/7">Successful suppliers were asked to present case study examples at their premises, which were scored and evaluated against the published award criteria. The framework renewal team's recommendations were agreed and signed off by the COI director of news and PR.</p>
	<p pid="c.235W.9/8">Although no stakeholders were directly involved with the process of selecting suppliers for the Cultural Diversity Framework and Approved Supplier List, the COI undertakes regular formal and informal discussions with a wide variety of those stakeholders during its normal business activities, including the issue of how the framework should be structured and the types of supplier that are needed.</p>

We anticipate that the planned 300 additional places at Rochester will be available by October this year with around 50 further places expected at a future date.

	<p pid="c.248W.6/1">The intention behind the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) measures which were introduced from August 2007 was to refocus funding on priority groups of vulnerable learners. We expect ESOL funding in 2007/08 to remain broadly similar to previous years at around &pound;300 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.248W.6/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) plans to undertake analysis of ESOL data captured through their individual learner record (ILR). This analysis will draw out patterns of delivery in 2007/08 compared to 2006/07, however, this can only be undertaken once full year data is available in October 2008. Any earlier analysis on partial data would require increased assumptions and caveats making the results less robust.</p>
	<p pid="c.248W.6/3">In addition, I also commissioned an independent impact assessment report. The final report is expected later this month, however, initial feedback suggests a very mixed picture across England with some areas reporting successful engagement with the new ESOL funding measures and others less so.</p>
	<p pid="c.248W.6/4">As a result of the consultation process, we expect to introduce further changes from September 2009. The consultation has shown broad support for the proposal that ESOL funding should be more specifically targeted to foster community cohesion and integration in our communities. We are developing proposals that will give greater flexibility, more consideration of local needs, and importantly, more of a focus on helping build cohesion in our communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.262W.0/13">These figures are target emission rates. Developers will use a variety of different solutions to achieve compliance with them and occupiers will consume more or less than this dependent on their real life behaviour. The target emission rates in Part L of the building regulations are different for gas heated and electrically heated homes due to the use of a 'fuel factor'.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.0/14">This factor recognises the higher carbon burden of grid electricity in comparison with gas and therefore the compliance difficulties which would be faced by homes which could not be built to use gas heating, for example homes that are not on the gas grid.</p>

PRG is claimed by local authorities and payable in two instalments; the first in the financial year after the end of the three year agreement, the second in the following year. For the vast majority of authorities payments are made between January and March of the relevant year. The agreements themselves are in the public domain and these explain the amount of reward payable and the basis upon which the reward grant is to be paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.265W.8/2">The first local area agreements incorporating a 'reward element' started in April 2005 and will run for three years. The first instalment of PRG in relation to these agreements will not therefore be payable until later in the current financial year.</p>

Crown bodies now have to apply for planning permission like any other developer subject to special arrangements for urgent development. Guidance on development by Crown bodies is given in DCLG Circular 02/2006 'Crown Application of the Planning Acts'.</p>

	<p pid="c.269W.5/1">The feasibility study carried out by GfK Nop Ltd., on undertaking a national survey of attitudes, produced a technical report to inform methodological development. As such, it was not designed to collect responses for data analysis. A summary of the feasibility study report findings is shown as follows.

	<p pid="c.269W.5/3" class="indent">This paper summarises the key points from the Feasibility Study and its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/4" class="italic"> Key findings</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/5" class="indent">There was a good response from respondents. Once eligibility was established, respondents were keen to take part and the number of refusals to participate was generally very low.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/6" class="indent">Male face-to-face interviewers reported difficulties obtaining interviews with some female respondents; they were not unwilling to participate but sought the consent and/or presence of male relatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/7" class="indent">Interviewers felt that respondents were concerned about confidentiality and anonymity, despite the reassurances given throughout the interview. This was felt by interviewers to affect the truthfulness of answers to some questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/8" class="indent">The presence of other people during the interview, which was common in face-to-face interviews, was also felt to present risks to validity.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/9" class="indent">It appeared to be harder for telephone interviewers to authenticate the legitimacy of the research and gain respondents' trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/10" class="indent">Respondents expressed concern about the questions which asked for demographic information about other members in the household.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/11" class="indent">The average interview lengths of the face-to-face and telephone interviews were 43 minutes and 35 minutes respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/12" class="indent">There was a relatively high number of incompleted telephone interviews; questionnaire length was one factor thought to contribute to this. This was not a problem with face-to-face interviews.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/13" class="indent">There were problems with some questions on sensitive issues, including a relatively high number of 'don't knows' to some.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/14" class="indent">In the face-to-face interviews, audio-CASI (audio-recorded questions which the respondent completes themselves and nobody else hears the responses) was used for some questions. This method, which is used in surveys to ask about sensitive topics, was generally successful although there were some issues with the foreign language versions of the questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/15" class="indent">The language and concepts in the questionnaire more generally was thought to be over-complex in places.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/16" class="italic"> Key recommendations</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/17" class="indent">The study demonstrated that a large-scale nationally representative survey of community attitudes is feasible, provided that certain measures are taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/18" class="indent">A face-to-face methodology is recommended because of:</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/19" class="indent">Length of interview;</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/20" class="indent">Greater ability to reassure respondents about confidentiality;</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/21" class="indent">Lower incidences of terminated interviews; and</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/22" class="indent">Ability to use Audio-CASI for sensitive questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/23" class="indent">The length of the interview (for face-to-face) should be no longer than 35 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.269W.5/24" class="indent">Extensive development is required on questions on sensitive issues.</p>

Those are reproduced in table 1. These figures cannot be aggregated to give the number of children who had gone missing at least once over the five year period. This is because the same child may have gone missing from their agreed placement in more than one year and will be counted in each of those years. Aggregating the data would therefore lead to double counting.</p>

	<p pid="c.272W.0/27">When a child is reported as &quot;missing&quot; from care; it is essential that the authority works with the police and provides all necessary information so that the child can be located. One of the requirements set out in statutory guidance 'Children Missing from Home and Care&mdash;a Guide to Good Practise', issued in 2002, is that each local authority must designate a senior manager to be responsible for monitoring incidents of children missing from care to identify any trends and to investigate any further action necessary to respond to children's needs ensuring that they are properly safeguarded.</p>

	<p pid="c.275W.0/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/4" class="indent">The first part of your question refers to the number and proportion of day care settings in the relevant authorities that are Sure Start centres. There are 6,913 settings in the 15% least deprived authorities, of which 481 (7.0%) are Sure Start centres. There are 3,420 settings in the 15% most deprived authorities, of which 503 (14.7%) are Sure Start centres. These data are also presented in Table A below.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/5" class="indent">These figures should be treated with care. The total figures for day care settings are from Ofsted's childcare database. However, we do not identify whether childcare providers are Sure Start centres on our database. The total numbers of Sure Start centres in each local authority are taken from the Sure Start database, which is maintained by each local authority and as such the quality of the data is variable. Therefore, inaccuracies may occur from a direct comparison between our register and the database (for instance, a provider on our register that has not yet been added to the Sure Start database by the local authority).</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/6" class="indent">The second part of your question refers to the 8.4%, or 102, of day care providers deemed inadequate in the 15% most deprived local authorities. 11 of these settings (10.8% of 102) are Sure Start centres. These data are also presented in Table A below.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/7" class="indent">Again, I am afraid that these data come with some caveats. To produce the figures we have cross-referenced the postcodes of Sure Start centres as recorded by local matching, however, is unlikely to be fully accurate for a number of reasons:</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/8" class="indent">postcodes are not unique to a single setting but cover a small area, so a Sure Start centre may have the same post code as another childcare setting which is not a Sure Start centre;</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/9" class="indent">linked sites that do not operate in the post coded area of the children's centre have not been identified; and</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/10" class="indent">as above, the Sure Start database is maintained by each local authority and as such the quality of the data is variable.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/11" class="indent">Please also note that, as requested, we are providing figures relating to the quality of day care providers inspected during 2007-08.

The Government values the role the Commissioner plays in bringing the views and interests of children to the forefront and values his independence as this enables him to fulfil his functions appropriately. The Children's Commissioner for England regularly meets with Ministers across Whitehall to bring his work to their attention and discuss his findings. No formal assessment is made of the Commissioner's achievements by Ministers as this would be improper considering the Commissioner's independence.</p>

	<p pid="c.278W.2/1">The National Curriculum tests for key stage 2 took place on 12-<phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May</phrase>. The National Assessment Agency (NAA) administers those tests on behalf of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Delivery of the national curriculum tests is always challenging in view of the scale and timing of the task and it is unfortunate that this year's exercise has encountered difficulties. As usual during the test delivery period, we are in regular contact with the NAA and I take a close interest in the progress of test delivery, I have asked David Gee, Managing Director of the NAA, to write to my hon. Friend. A copy of his letter has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from David Gee<i> , </i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/3" class="indent">The National Assessment Agency is responsible for overseeing the safe delivery of the National Curriculum Tests. The tests at KS2 and KS3 are sat by over 1.1 million pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/4" class="indent">To remove the risk of error in the marking of pupils work it is important that an accurate record of pupil attendance for each test is recorded. For many years this has been a paper process which given the scale of the tests brings with it inevitable errors that require correcting, For the 2008 test cycle a new contractor ETS was appointed and one of the many improvements they offered was to move the recording of pupil attendance online.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/5" class="indent">Schools were provided with a copy of the most recent pupil records as collected from school census data and were required to annotate against each pupil which tests were actually sat. Some pupils move schools during the year and so there was the additional facility to edit the records.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/6" class="indent">A new website provided by ETS delivered this service On the first day of the KS2 test week the website unfortunately suffered technological problems for three hours. While key stage 2 schools had a period of 10 days to submit their entries an estimated 745 schools out of approximately 16,000 were impacted by the website being not available during this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/7" class="indent">Help line service for schools is provided by ETS throughout the test period. During the time of system outage the ETS helpline did experience a high number of calls as schools reported this issue. The volume of calls caused callers to be held in a queue and ETS have acknowledged and apologised for this frustration. Staffing of the helpline has been increased in response to this issue to give greater capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.278W.2/8" class="indent">As in previous years the NAA will be conducting a review in to the delivery performance of the tests including consulting with schools, markers and other stakeholders to ensure good practice and necessary improvements are captured and acted upon</p>

Through the Nursery Milk scheme, the Great Britain Health Departments reimburse providers of early years education and daycare for 1/3 pint milk given daily to children under five attending for two hours or more. This may be given as infant formula for babies under one. We do not monitor the proportion of claims relating to infant formula, but estimate that they represent a small proportion of all claims.</p>

We do not separately identify the amount of funding made available for early years. Local authorities are best placed to determine the most effective use of resources at local level and have discretion over the rate at which they fund settings for delivery of early years provision.</p>

A longer and more flexible offer will give parents greater choice in balancing work and family life. This large injection of additional funding emphasises the Government's commitment to ensure that every child gets the best possible start in life. We will invest &pound;80 million in this year, &pound;170 million in 2009-10 and &pound;340 million in 2010-11 to extend the entitlement. Funding levels for the next CSR period (2011-14) are yet to be decided.</p>

	<p pid="c.292W.5/1">DFID is supporting action on HIV and AIDS through its country programmes in Burma, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. In Burma, DFID is contributing funds through a &pound;20 million contribution to a $100 million joint donor health fund, which includes support to activities in line with the national strategic plan for HIV prevention, treatment and care. In Cambodia, DFID has provided &pound;15.6 million over five years to support the Government of Cambodia's response to HIV and AIDS, and &pound;7.1 million for support to condom social marketing, which is aimed at improving condom use among high risk groups. In China, DFID is providing &pound;30 million over four and a half years to help the Government of China's national HIV and AIDS programme. This is part of a &pound;92 million programme that is also supported by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. In Indonesia, DFID has contributed &pound;25 million over three years through the Indonesia Partnership Fund, which supports a National Action Framework on HIV and AIDS.

Figures use the average annual real gross domestic product (GDP) between 2000 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.294W.3/2">DFID's work in Central Asia to date has focused on the two poorest and most fragile countries&mdash;Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic. In both countries, DFID supports the Government's economic growth plans, focusing on the need to ensure that they bring benefits to the poor and vulnerable, particularly in rural areas. For example, in Tajikistan, our work with rural communities in the remote Zarafshan Valley has provided access to microfinance for its 270,000 population. This is already leading to the development of successful small businesses. We actively support the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's work in the region through their Early Transition Countries Initiative (ETCI). A recent independent evaluation of the ETC Multi Donor Fund (we have contributed &pound;7.5 million over four years so far) confirmed that this was leading to a substantial increase in EBRD operations in most of the region.</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has committed &pound;38.5 million to the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF), representing 11 per cent. of total funds. The UK is the third largest contributor. The effectiveness of DFID's contribution has been reviewed annually. The last review concluded that UK support is meeting the objectives of responding efficiently and effectively to the needs of the affected population. Although the challenge of post tsunami reconstruction is large and complex, the MDF has made a significant impact. The MDF is managed by a Secretariat based in the World Bank, and applies high standards of financial management and sound anti-corruption measures. This has enabled the rebuilding of vital social and economic infrastructure. Results so far include the building or repair of over 3,000 houses, with a further 8,000 under construction or repair; 2,200 km of roads; 1,100 bridges; and transportation of 98,000 metric tonnes of reconstruction materials.</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.6/1">Over the last few months, staff visited all DFID-funded emergency activities in Tajikistan. This included meetings with beneficiaries who had received and used items from our air-lifts, as well as items distributed through funding to NGOs. Over 300,000 of the most vulnerable people were targeted specifically by NGO distributions. As a result, they were able to buy staple food and cooking oil, as well as use fuel and blankets to stay warm. Other benefits, particularly in more urban areas, included reopening hospitals which had been empty without electricity and drugs, and providing safe drinking water to those who had been without for several weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.296W.6/2">Some emergency activities are still ongoing. Once they are complete, we will undertake a full impact assessment of our support. We have also urged the United Nations to undertake an evaluation of the impact of its International Appeal. Both assessments will help the international community and the Government of Tajikistan improve their planning and response in the event of a similar situation this winter.</p>

	<p pid="c.298W.2/1">In May 2008, the Yemen Ministry of Education reported to the Joint Annual Review of the Government's Basic Education Development Strategy. This is the most recent report the Department for International Development (DFID) has received, and includes data on gender equality in enrolment for the first nine years of education (basic education). According to the report, total girls' enrolment in basic education was 1.8 million in 2006-07, compared to 2.5 million for boys. This represents a gender gap in enrolment of 29 per cent. However, many girls drop out of school early, with only 18 per cent. remaining until the last year of basic education.</p>
	<p pid="c.298W.2/2">DFID is contributing &pound;15 million over six years (2004-09) to a multi-donor basic education programme. This programme aims to increase enrolments for both boys and girls, and to improve the quality of basic education. It also includes targeted measures to improve girls' admission and retention.</p>
