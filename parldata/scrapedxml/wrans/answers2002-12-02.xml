	<p pid=".469W.12/1">The two new carriers (CVF) will have the capability to deploy offensive air power in support of the full spectrum of future operations.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.12/2">The numbers and types of aircraft aboard CVF will depend upon the operational circumstances at the time. However, the CVF will have the capacity to operate a wide range of aircraft, including maritime airborne surveillance and control (MASC) platforms and helicopters in a variety of roles (for example, attack, surveillance, anti-submarine warfare and support.) As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>, the short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F35 joint strike fighter (JSF) has been selected to meet the joint combat aircraft (JCA) role, operating either from the carriers or from land. Although CVF will, at the outset, operate the STOVL F35, it highly desirable that they could be modified to fly a further generation of aircraft, even beyond the F35, whether or not these too are STOVL. That is why we have decided they will be built to an innovative, adaptable plan.</p>

Mr. Jeans was not the nominated Next of Kin and is therefore not entitled to support from public funds. Exceptional authority was, however, granted by the Secretary of State for the funding from the public purse of Mr. Jeans' last trip to Croatia in July 2000, to enable him to hear the conclusion of the trial of those accused of assaulting his son. This was on the basis that it constituted his final trip to Croatia and that no precedent would be set. The latest hearing concerns an appeal by a Croatian state attorney against the later release of two of those who were accused of assaulting Private Jeans. While the Ministry of Defence recognises Mr. Jeans' desire to attend this latest hearing, I am afraid that no further financial assistance can be provided to him in this case.</p>

No extra funds will be made available to these areas, because MOD will recover the additional costs of the operation from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Because the defence budget will be reimbursed, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has had no discussions about use of the Contingency Fund. It is too early to say how much the military assistance will cost, but in preparing for the strike MOD incurred costs of about 8 million, mainly on purchasing major items of equipment such as protective clothing, breathing apparatus and hydraulic cutting equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence's Performance Report 2001&ndash;02, paragraph 81, identified a number of shortages in trained personnel. The overall shortage at the end of that year, of 4.3 per cent. in the trained strength against the requirement, had been reduced to 2.9 per cent. by <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> this year. This has been the result of excellent recruiting performance, a firm control over the requirement and slow but positive progress to reduce outflow. Our efforts in these three areas will of course continue, together with the more flexible use of manpower resources including selective extensions of service, use of full-time reservists and the implementation of the TOPMAST project to reform manpower management. Turning to the specific shortfalls mentioned in the report, although recruiting of Lynx and Sea Harrier pilots is satisfactory, shortages are caused by outflow, and this is being addressed by implementation of the recommendations of the Aircrew Retention Review. For submarine branch personnel, a number of measures are in hand to improve both recruiting and retention. Recruiting for Royal Marines Other Ranks is healthy and retention has recently improved, but we are continuing work on retaining experienced junior ranks.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.9/1">There are no training programmes aimed specifically at suicide awareness or prevention within the services, but throughout their careers Officers and NCOs receive specialist training including programmes on welfare and management of personnel. Naval General Training has a number of instructional elements addressing deliberate self-harm and suicide, and related subjects such as coping with occupational stress; and the Royal Navy has produced guidance to personnel on the management of cases of deliberate self-harm. The Army also publishes a pamphlet on suicide awareness and prevention in a simple but useful format that is issued to all Commanders and NCOs. In addition all Army recruits are issued with a handbook which informs them of the welfare support available to them. During initial training all RAF recruits receive briefing on welfare issues including stress management.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.9/2">Available statistics indicate that the incidence of suicide within the services is broadly compatible with that in the population at large. However, all three services regard even a low rate to be too high and take the issue of suicide and its prevention very seriously. Measures are in place, both within and independently of the chain of command, to enable vulnerable individuals to seek help.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.9/3">Each service has its own particular systems for providing welfare support but a common theme in relation to the responsibility for prevention of suicide is the direct involvement of the Chain of Command, from Commanding Officers downwards. The services aim to provide a range of support options for those who may be vulnerable to suicide, and to ensure free and unfettered access at all times. This covers a wide range of issues including money, alcohol/drugs, marriage or domestic problems and work pressures. Since 1995 the support has included free confidential telephone lines manned by trained personnel who are able to offer counselling over the phone.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.9/4">Commanding Officers are assisted by specific individuals and agencies with skills and training that can help. These include Medical Officers, Chaplains, Unit Welfare Officers, the Naval Personal and Families Service, the Army Welfare Service and external organisations and charities contracted for the provision of specific services. Among these are the WRVS, RELATE (marriage guidance counsellors), the Samaritans and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association&mdash;Forces Help (SSAFA-FH).</p>

	<p pid=".489W.3/1">The report from Sheffield Hallam University was commissioned by the Department to provide an independent, comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the comparative energy, environmental and socio-economic costs and benefits of biodiesel production in the UK. The terms of reference for the study were agreed with the Government-Industry Forum on the Non-Food Uses of Crops and with industry. A draft of the report was published for consultation in June this year and, in finalising the report, the authors have looked carefully at the points made and have taken account of new evidence put forward. We expect the report to be peer reviewed in December and published in January 2003. The Department has had no influence over the content of the report. For bioenergy, this Department plans and manages independent research through its Science Directorate to inform the development of policy. All research reports are published and clarity of presentation is the only factor considered.</p>

The Government are also providing &pound;70 million of funding through a package of measures which will develop markets for biomass, including energy crops, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. Short rotation coppice and miscanthus can be planted on set-aside land and receive payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme. The European Commission has published initial proposals for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to take effect from 2004. Under these proposals, no crops would be grown on set-aside land. A new carbon credit of 45 per hectare is proposed for energy crops, to be paid to producers entering into a contract with a processor. The proposal includes a maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares eligible for this additional payment.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.3/1">None. It would not be consistent with our policy on agricultural production subsidies to put in place such payments for organic farmers. However, because of the environmental benefits organic farming delivers, we provide conversion aid to farmers under the Organic Farming Scheme and we intend next year, subject to approval from the European Commission, to extend the coverage of the scheme to organic farmers post-conversion. We also provide free advice to prospective organic farmers through the Organic Conversion Information Service and support an organic R&amp;D Programme.</p>

Since then we have conducted a number of follow-up reviews of sites where posters were allegedly not displayed. Priority is given to checking those ports and airports which handle the greatest number of international passengers.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.0/1">The study of soil organisms in relation to aspects of soil fertility forms a significant part of the Department's R&amp;D budget. The Department is spending approximately &pound;1.2 million on Soil R&amp;D in 2002&ndash;03. This includes work on soil fertility, quality, erosion and sustainable management. Examples include SP0130 which is investigating the long-term impacts of sewage sludge additions on soil properties; SP0519 which considers critical levels of soil organic matter for soil stability and function, and SP0524 an audit of all UK soil research. We fund monitoring of soil quality including the Representative Soil Sampling Scheme (current project SR0123) and the National Soil Inventory (current project SP0521). A recently completed project (OF0164) compared the soil fertility in soils farmed organically and conventionally. The project found evidence of increased levels of earthworms and beneficial nematodes in organic compared to conventional soils, but concluded that the differences in soil microbiology were subtle rather than dramatic. There is to be a review of our soil R&amp;D in spring 2003. Future R&amp;D is likely to consider soil function, soil biology and improved monitoring.</p>

However other factors, such as slope, crop, cultivation, soil type and rainfall intensity, are often of equal or greater importance.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.0/1">Figures for discarded shopping trolleys are not collected centrally. Legislation is already in place regarding abandoned shopping trolleys. Under section 99 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities can collect abandoned shopping (and luggage) trolleys, store them and charge owners for their return. Adopting a deposit system, installing obstacles that prevent trolleys being taken off the site, or publicising a trolley collection service, will help control this problem and prevent retailers being charged for trolley collections. Given these measures, we have no plans to levy an environmental charge.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.3/1">Freight Facilities Grant (FFG), Water or rail freight facility grants are available to encourage these modes rather than road transport</p>
	<p pid=".498W.3/2">On the water side, in April of this year we published a consultation document, 'Financial Assistance for Moving Freight from Road to Inland Waterway and Maritime Transport', which set out our ideas for the development of the water FFG scheme. There was broad industry agreement with our views. We will very shortly publish our final proposals. Copies of this document will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".498W.3/3">We expect to introduce our widened water scheme by the end of 2003. As far as rail is concerned the Strategic Rail Authority, Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government who have responsibility for rail FFGs, are developing new grant schemes that will improve the targeting of support to encourage more companies to move freight by rail.</p>

The latest figures are for 1997 (provisional) and estimate over 11,000 Xhigh growth&quot; firms. Provisional 1998 and final 1997 figures will be available by the end of the year. The Government made a commitment in the Competitiveness White Paper published in December 1998 to provide a new high-quality advice service designed to support 10,000 pre and start-up businesses a year in England (by the end of March 2002), who were identified as having high growth potential. The programme was managed and funded nationally by the Small Business Service but delivered locally via allocations to the 45 Business Links in England. &pound;20 million of funding was committed between October 1999&mdash;March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/3">By the end of March 2002 around 8,500 pre- and start-up businesses had received support. Support was provided across a variety of business sectors to people who are traditionally considered to face barriers in starting and growing a business including women, ethnic minorities and young entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.5/4">Financial support is continuing to Business Link Operators for the delivery of advisory services to pre- and early start businesses identified as having high growth potential. &pound;10 million was included in the Business Link core budget allocation for 2002&ndash;2003.</p>

Some member states thought other approaches could also achieve the overall objective of market transparency and access to networks&mdash;arguing that member states should be allowed to retain measures having an equivalent effect to legal unbundling. The UK, supported by most other member states, disagreed and made it clear that legal unbundling was an essential part of the final package. The overwhelming evidence was that legal unbundling was essential to the development of a liberalised market with little evidence that alternative approaches would work as effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/6">The final agreement provide for legal unbundling of transmission system operators by mid 2004 and legal unbundling of distribution system operators by mid 2007. A Commission report published in 2006 will review the progress made towards liberalisation. It will also provide member states with the opportunity to request a derogation from the legal unbundling requirement for distribution if they can show that equivalent measures are just as effective. However, any such derogation will have to be decided by co-decision.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/7">A Regulation on cross-border exchanges in electricity was also agreed as part of the compromise.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/8">Revised criteria on support to projects under the Trans European Networks (TENS) energy programme were agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/9">Discussion of the EU's Intelligent Energy for Europe proposal, which provides for a new four-year programme of support for renewable energy and energy efficiency, centred on the budget. Agreement was reached on a figure of 190 meuro, a compromise between the 255 meuro sought by the European Parliament and the 150&ndash;160 meuro preferred by several member states.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/10">Most member states supported the stated objectives of the Commission's Cogeneration proposal, which seeks to promote the cogeneration of heat and power in order to reduce energy demand as a means to both reduce dependency on external supplies of energy and contribute to the achievement of carbon savings, but thought the 50 MW upper limit on support restrictive, illogical and counterproductive, and that the proposal involved bureaucratic and costly compliance burdens. The proposal will be taken forward by the Greek presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/11">Member states agreed on presidency conclusions on the follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/12">The Commission made a presentation on its package of nuclear proposals, comprising directives on nuclear safety and waste management together with a proposal for an agreement between Euratom and Russia covering trade in nuclear materials. The Commission justified this largely on the grounds of EU enlargement and the need to reassure public opinion on safety and waste management. Although discussion had not been envisaged, several member states expressed doubts about the treaty base for the proposals, stressing the political sensitivity. One noted that the Euratom Treaty did not provide the Community with competence on nuclear safety, and challenged the proposals as unrealistic.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/13">The Council noted Commission progress reports on the EU-Russia energy dialogue (with adoption of conclusions), the Energy Charter Treaty and the Northern Dimension.</p>
	<p pid=".511W.8/14">Greece gave a presentation on its presidency priorities. It will concentrate on four main areas: security of energy sources (energy TENS and the EU's proposed oil and gas stocking directives); sustainable development (cogeneration directive and follow-up to Johannesburg); co-operation with third countries (EU-Russia, Energy Charter Treaty, Euro-Med and North Eastern Europe); and continuation of work on the nuclear package.</p>

	<p pid=".518W.2/1">The Government are fully committed to supporting a rural network. As recommended by the Performance and Innovation Unit (in their report in June 2000: XCounter Revolution, Modernising the Post Office Network) we have asked the company to maintain the rural network and to prevent avoidable closures, in the first instance to 2006. This has been underpinned by the appointment of Rural Transfer Advisers by POL and a &pound;2 million fund to support community post office initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/2">As recommended by PIU the Postal Services Commission has advised us on options for supporting the rural network from 2003. Following detailed consideration of this advice and discussion with the company the Government are now committed to making a substantial financial contribution to the rural network.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/3">&pound;450 million will be made available (from 2003 to 2006) to help the rural post office network through the transition of benefit payment to ACT. The package will be funded from Royal Mail Holdings accumulated surpluses, as part of a package to put Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. on a commercial footing.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/4">This funding is designed to help Britain's rural post offices through the changes in the network's business over the next few years. It provides direct support to rural post offices, maintaining front line services in local communities. It will also give Post Office Ltd. the financial freedom to pilot new and innovative ways of providing post office services in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/5">The funding will be administered by Post Office Ltd. under contract to the Government. In return for this investment Post Office Ltd. will be required to maintain the rural network and prevent all avoidable closures, working through their Code of Practice for doing so in the first instance to 2006; and to provide reasonable access for all citizens to Xover the counter&quot; services in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/6">These services include:</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/7" class="indent">Access to payment of the state pensions, tax credits and benefits</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/8" class="indent">Access to cash through banking services.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/9" class="indent">Dispatch points for letters and parcels;</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/10" class="indent">Postage stamp sales;</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/11" class="indent">Renewal of licences (eg television);</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/12" class="indent">Bill payments to utilities; Government information and services specified in service contracts between POL and individual Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/13">A total of &pound;150 million will be invested in each of the next three years, all of it ring-fenced for the support of the rural network.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/14">There will be three elements to the funding:</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/15" class="indent">&pound;66 million a year to maintain sub-postmasters income levels (by maintaining the AOP (assigned Office Payment) for rural sub-postmasters);</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/16" class="indent">&pound;79 million in the first year, and &pound;74 million in years two and three, to fund the front line services that allow post offices to operate, including IT systems, cash delivery and direct marketing material;</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/17" class="indent">A &pound;25 million flexible fund (&pound;5 million in the first year, rising to &pound;10 million in the second and third years), to develop innovative, modern methods of delivering of services.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/18">The flexible fund will enable Post Office Ltd. to:</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/19" class="indent">Promote and finance innovative ways of delivering services, including compensation for the closure of offices replaced by pilots for these new ways of delivering services;</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/20" class="indent">Make additional payments to sub-postmasters on a case by case basis to modernise and improve the individual business.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/21">Our expectation is that POL will work closely with the National Federation of Sub-postmasters and other stakeholders to make best use of this fund.</p>
	<p pid=".518W.2/22">We remain in dialogue with the European Commission on matters relating to Post Office Ltd., and we expect to submit a formal notification to the Commission this week. Subject to state aid clearance, funding will be in place in April 2003.</p>

They show that there has been progress in terms of macroeconomic stability, literacy and numeracy, the competitive framework, and the science base. However, weaknesses remain in terms of intermediate skills and innovation performance. This is why the Government has implemented a series of measures to improve performance in both areas, including the R and D tax credit for large firms, extra resources for DTI innovation schemes, the Employer Training Pilots to boost skill development and the review of adult learning.</p>

	<p pid=".528W.13/1">At the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 18&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase> I took part in discussions, with fellow EU Ministers, about the current state of the international coffee market. At this meeting I reiterated, with reference to Ethiopia as a case in point, some of the challenges facing a number of commodity dependent countries. I highlighted the need to assist these countries by promoting economic diversification as well as by delivering on CAP reform.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.13/2">We recognise the damaging impact that trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries agriculture sectors. At the Doha Ministerial meeting last year it was agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve Xsubstantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support&quot;. The UK fully supports these negotiations and is pressing for ambitious reform of the CAP to help the EU to participate effectively in the WTO negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".528W.13/3">While there is some preferential trade access to the EU for developing countries, more needs to be done to reduce the tariffs that the EU currently applies to a range of agricultural and non-agricultural products that offer potential alternative export trade opportunities for these countries. In order to tackle these barriers, the Doha meeting agreed that we should reduce barriers to trade in all products and particularly tariff peaks, high tariffs and tariff escalation. To ensure these negotiations result in liberalisation that benefits the world's poor, we are working to make these commitments become a reality.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.5/1">The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was announced by the Prime Minister at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. At that initial stage, BP, Shell, Rio Tinto, BhP Billiton and Anglo-American committed to developing a framework for transparency in the extractive industries.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.5/2">Since then, we have drawn up a set of principles underpinning the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which we will use to bring more companies and governments on board. A growing number of non-UK based oil and mining companies, industry bodies and UK asset fund managers have expressed interest in joining the multi-stakeholder coalition to devise mechanisms to make transparency a reality.</p>

	<p pid=".530W.2/1">Through the Development Awareness Fund, DFID has provided &pound;120,000 to the Fairtrade Foundation (FTF) over three years (2001&ndash;03) in support of its efforts to target new consumers through its annual Fairtrade Fortnight campaigns. The Fortnight is designed to highlight the positive developmental impacts of fair trade and the range of fair trade products on offer.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.2/2">DFID is also funding a project that addresses a recognised bottleneck within fair trade&mdash;namely the limited number of products for which international fair trade standards exist. This project (at a total cost of &pound;300,000) aims to develop five new product standards, secure the registration of 20 new producer groups and help bring an additional 20 new fair trade products to supermarket shelves over the next two years. The target is to increase the retail value of fair trade sales in the UK to over &pound;100 million by 2004, and by so doing, extend the benefits of fair trade to a greater number of producers in developing countries. By expanding the scale of fair trade activities, the project also aims to secure a sustainable future for the FTF, so that its core operational costs (including the cost of subsequent product development) are fully funded from the income it receives from licensees.</p>
	<p pid=".530W.2/3">DFID's support to the FT movement is part of a broader programme to encourage wider adoption of ethical trading codes and standards by major transnational corporations, and continuing efforts to reform the international trading system.</p>

	<p pid=".531W.2/1">I have made clear on many occasions to our own Government, to the USA and other developed countries, the need for donors to work towards the 0.7 per cent. target of official development assistance as a proportion of GNI. The Government itself has committed, in the Comprehensive Spending Review, to reaching a ratio of 0.4 per cent. by financial year 2006&ndash;07. I welcome the establishment by the USA of the Millennium Challenge Account, which will increase US development assistance by 50 per cent. in cash terms by 2006. I hope that the USA will continue to expand its development assistance programmes towards the levels of ODA/GNI achieved by most other developed countries. US Assistance has the potential to make a very significant contribution towards the reduction of poverty in the world.</p>

We will continue to use and strengthen the distribution systems already in place, which are working well in very difficult conditions. One of the major problems in dealing with the Zimbabwe crises is that the World Food Programme appeal for Southern Africa is only 56 per cent. funded and there is not enough food to distribute.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.5/1">Good quality accommodation, attractions and service are all vital pre-requisites for a flourishing, sustainable tourism industry. The existing accommodation quality assurance schemes are good but have insufficient impact on the consumer, and so we intend shortly to commission a review of quality to address that. We are already pursuing our Fitness for Purpose initiative to tackle quality issues at less satisfactory premises, to provide assurance to customers that sub-standard accommodation will not be tolerated. We are also working with other Departments on establishing a Sector Skills Council for the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector, and in increasing the number of New Deal clients who find work in the hospitality industry. This will help build a more positive image of the sector and attract and retain good quality staff.</p>

	<p pid=".546W.2/1">When considering proposals for new housing development in existing residential areas, the Planning Service of the Department of the Environment pays particular attention to their potential impact on the neighbourhood to ensure that appreciable harm is not caused by such development to the amenities enjoyed by existing residents and to the existing character and environmental quality of the area.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/2">Since the introduction of the Quality Initiative in 1996 to promote better quality and more sustainable housing development, a comprehensive range of policy and guidance documents has been put in place to raise the quality of new residential development generally, with particular attention being paid to ensuring that the drive to promote more housing in existing urban areas does not lead to any significantdiminution of the quality of life in established residential areas.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/3">As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Regional Development Strategy (RDS) published in September 2001 provides the overarching strategic framework for the formulation of development plans and planning policy in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/4">In support of urban renaissance and more sustainable forms of development, the RDS sets an ambitious regional target of 60 per cent. for the share of urban housing to be provided within urban limits, and seeks to encourage an increase in the density of urban housing appropriate in scale and design to the cities and towns of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/5">However, the RDS stresses that the aim of achieving an overall increase in town densities must not be interpreted as a broad mandate to try and force overdeveloped and unsympathetic housing schemes into established residential areas. In such areas the overriding objective has to be to avoid any significant erosion of the environmental quality, amenity and privacy enjoyed by existing residents.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/6">In established residential areas, the RDS encourages harmonious housing schemes of various densities in accordance with a local community focused approach sensitive in design terms to the people living in the existing neighbourhood, taking account of the Strategy's Local Development Guidelines and Planning Policy Statement 7 Quality Residential Environments.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/7">Planning Policy Statement 7 (PPS 7), Quality Residential Environment published in June 2001, clearly states that in established residential areas, proposals for housing development will not be permitted where they would result in unacceptable damage to the local character, environmental quality or residential amenity of these areas. All proposals for residential development are expected to take full account of the surrounding context, particularly those proposals for infill housing, backland development or redevelopment schemes in established residential areas. PPS 7 points out that in such areas great care is needed to ensure that the individual orcumulative effects of such development proposals do not significantly erode character and amenity, for example by inappropriate design or overdevelopment. The Department will need to be satisfied in considering such proposals that the design and layout will not create conflict with adjacent housing areas and that there is no unacceptable adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms ofoverlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/8">The Department's Supplementary Planning Guidance, 'Creating Places&mdash;achieving quality in residential developments' (May 2000) and Development Control Advice Note 8 'Housing in Existing Urban Areas' (June 2002), provides detailed design advice and guidelines intended to amplify and clarify policy guidance wherenecessary. Both documents emphasise the importance of a design-led approach to create imaginative, safe and attractive housing. In existing urban areas this embraces the philosophy of working with context, 'fitting' development in with the prevailing character and appearance of the neighbourhood and ensuring that infill, backland and redevelopment proposals are successfully integrated with existing housing without appreciable harm to the character and amenity their residents currently enjoy.</p>
	<p pid=".546W.2/9">The above documents provide clear and robust policies and guidance for developers in formulating development proposals for housing in established residential areas and clearly set out the criteria under which such proposals will be assessed by the Planning Service. The Planning Service will seek whatever additional information is necessary to properly assess and determine such planning applications, the overall objective being that high quality and sustainable housing can be provided in existing residential areas without detriment to the residents of those areas.</p>

This includes the offences of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour intended or likely to stir up racial hatred.

	<p pid=".550W.2/1">The Government's policy to educate the children of some destitute asylum seekers within accommodation centres provides an opportunity to deliver a specialised and rich curriculum tailored to the needs of the children within a safe environment.

	<p pid=".551W.0/1">Breakfast clubs are available in many schools as part of study support or child care provision. They can provide learning opportunities for pupils, promote healthy eating, and help working parents by offering a safe and stimulating environment for their children. In XInvestment for Reform&quot; we said that by 2006 all schools should be providing breakfast clubs or other forms of study support.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.0/2">My Department assists breakfast clubs primarily through the Standards Fund grant for study support: &pound;75 million in 2002&ndash;03. Schools can fund them too from programmes such as the Pupil Learning Credits pilot, child care, or Education Action Zones. Other Government Departments, the New Opportunities Fund, voluntary organisations and commercial sponsors also support them. Education Extra, a national charity for out-of-school-hours learning grant-aided by DfES, runs a Breakfast Club Award Scheme sponsored by Kellogg's and helps with clubs' setting-up costs.</p>

Tools such as the Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education's Index for Inclusion, which was sent to all schools in April 2000, can be used to identify barriers to learning and participation.

	<p pid=".553W.2/2">By law, children in England should not leave full-time education in school until the last Friday in June in the school year in which a child reaches 16. Figures are not available centrally on those that do leave early, for whatever reason. Some indication can be obtained by comparing pupil numbers from the same cohort at ages 14 and 15 in successive Annual Schools Censuses. The difference between the numbers of pupils aged 14 in 2001 and aged 15 in 2002 registered at all schools in England as shown by the Department's Annual Schools' Census was 9,600&mdash;a fall of 1.6 per cent. However, this comparison will be affected by the net impact of population migration, differences in the numbers of pupils educated other than at school and those on remand or in Young Offenders institutions; it will also exclude pupils leaving school after the Census date (in January) but before the regulations entitle them to do so (in June).</p>

	<p pid=".556W.8/2">Using Labour Force Survey data from the four quarters autumn 2000 to summer 2001, we have estimated that, on average, graduates whose highest qualification is a first degree earn around &pound;1,075,000 over a working life. This figure relates to Great Britain, and is based on gross earnings from main job. The equivalent figure for graduates and non-graduates, collectively, is around &pound;675,000.

Specific actions include a statutory entitlement to ESD in the revised National Curriculum in England and the introduction of Citizenship as a new National Curriculum subject from September 2002. We are ensuring that we build on this progress through our joint sponsorship with DEFRA of the Sustainable Development Education Panel and through specific school initiatives such as Growing Schools, which promotes the outdoor classroom.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/5">Furthermore, the Learning and Skills Council have funded 11 pilots to identify and share good practice on education for sustainable development in the Further Education sector, and have plans for a further 12 pilots. While in higher education, we are supporting the Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability (HEPS) project through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), which aims to develop a sustainability reporting system for the higher education sector.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase> the Secretary of State announced that the total funding for FE is set to rise by &pound;1.2 billion between 2002&ndash;03 and 2005&ndash;06, a real terms increase of 19 per cent. From next year, colleges which have demonstrated their effectiveness will have three year funding deals allowing them to plan on a longer-term basis, with increases linked to performance. We will also consolidate the funds provided for the Teaching Pay Initiative into core funding. The substantial real terms increases in core funding, over and above the costs of additional students and inflation, and the three year funding agreements should enable colleges to deliver the improvements in pay that staff deserve.</p>
	<p pid=".567W.2/4">The Government is also making an additional &pound;1.4 billion available in the period 2003&ndash;06 to help improve the supply of affordable housing. As part of this, the Starter Homes Initiative (SHI) aims to help key workers to buy homes in areas where the high cost of housing is undermining recruitment and retention. While FE teachers are not identified as a priority for the SHI, they may be eligible for loans or cash grants in some areas because of local flexibilities in delivering the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".567W.5/1">Through the Connexions Service, all young people aged 13 to 19 in England will have access to a Personal Adviser (PA). One of the key roles of the Connexions PA is to provide independent information, advice and guidance on learning and career options. Support may be delivered in class or small group settings, or through one-to-one interviews, depending on the young person's needs. The Connexions Service is now operating in 44 Partnership areas and there will be complete coverage (in all 47 areas, i.e. in all 150 English local education authorities) by 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive, Leigh Lewis. I have asked him to reply to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from L. Lewis to Mr. Oliver Heald, dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning Jobcentre Plus performance. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/4" class="indent">You raised a number of detailed questions about Jobcentre Plus performance against our Performance and Resources Agreement (PRA), which I will cover in this reply. You also asked a number of questions about the criteria applied to how job entry points were allocated to specific client groups. I understand the Secretary of State will be responding separately to these as they relate to the underlying policy.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/5" class="indent">Before turning to your specific questions it may be helpful if I explain that the Jobcentre Plus Performance and Resource Agreement is a formal annual agreement between the Secretary of State and Chief Executive of the Agency. It sets out clearly the aim, purpose and objectives of the Agency and the targets to be met in this operational year. There are five high level targets and details of these were laid before the House on 19th March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/6" class="indent">I am pleased to say that Jobcentre Plus has made a good start. To the end of October we were 10.6% ahead of our job entry points target profile. This equates to helping 786,116 people into work in our first seven months. You asked for a breakdown of job entries by priority client group:</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/7" class="indent">Priority Client Group 1: 87,078</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/8" class="indent">Priority Client Group 2: 207,727</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/9" class="indent">Priority Client Group 3: 177,219</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/10" class="indent">Priority Client Group 4: 222,670</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/11" class="indent">Priority Client Group 5: 91,422</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/12" class="indent">At the mid year stage we were 5.3 and 1.7 percentage points respectively above our Customer Service and Employer Outcome targets. However, the latest interim figures for the Business Delivery target are showing that we are around two percentage points below the target of 93.4%. This is an area where we are making special efforts to improve performance.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/13" class="indent">You have specifically asked for the latest outturn figures, by Jobcentre Plus District, for Job Entry points and latest national outturn figures for Customer Service, Employer Outcomes and Business Delivery. This information is set out in the tables which will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/14" class="indent">You also asked whether the the report on the pilot of the Jobcentre Plus Job Entry Target structure will be placed in the House Library. We have undertaken a series of studies examining the piloting, and the national implementation, of job entry points. A comprehensive summary report combining findings from the three research studies has been commissioned. This report will be published in March 2003 and a copy will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.5/15" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.2/1">We are committed to tackling the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices that keep officers off the streets. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary established a taskforce, under the chairmanship of Sir David O'Dowd, to identify ways in which forces can free up the time of front line officers. The taskforce's report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-17">17 September</phrase> this year and contained 52 recommendations to increase the presence of police in communities. We have now set up a steering group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office, to take forward these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.2/2">Two recommendations of the taskforce have already been introduced in the Criminal Justice and Sentencing Bill to allow police officers to grant 'street bail':</p>
	<p pid=".576W.2/3" class="indent">Police officers will be provided with the option to offer an arrested person immediate bail at the scene rather than immediately having to take the person to a police station.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.2/4" class="indent">The requirement to list all property taken into custody is to be removed so that the custody officer would secure all possessions in a scalable property bag and only make a few supporting comments.</p>
	<p pid=".576W.2/5">We are also consulting with the judiciary on a provision to be included in the Bill, which will allow officers to obtain search warrants by video, by telephone and by fax. We are reviewing each and every Code of Practice issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to cut unnecessary bureaucracy. A new code A is to commence in April 2003, and new codes B-E are likely to commence by May 2003.</p>

Decisions on whether to invest in static or mobile CCTV and precise deployment within specific areas are matters for determination by the relevant local crime reduction partners.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.5/2">The Criminal Justice and Sentencing Bill will introduce several changes to the rules of evidence to encourage witnesses and make their experience easier:</p>
	<p pid=".578W.5/3" class="indent">in future, witnesses will be able to have in court their original statement that they made to police and refer to it to refresh their memories while giving evidence;</p>

	<p pid=".578W.5/5" class="indent">the defence will have to prove to the judge that evidence of a witness's previous misconduct, or other bad character evidence, is clearly relevant to the case before they bring it up.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.5/6">The Bill tightens up magistrates' granting of bail, partly to prevent re-offending, but also to protect victims and witnesses from intimidation in the run-up to a trial. When considering whether to grant bail, magistrates will have to take into account whether an offender has broken bail conditions before. At the same time, if there is a threat that the offender will intimidate a victim or witness, we are encouraging the prosecution to use this as grounds to challenge bail. We are also extending the prosecution's power to appeal against bail from more serious offences (with a top sentence of five years' custody or more), to any imprisonable offence.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.5/7">Guidance has been issued to the police on tackling witness intimidation in the community. All forces have been issued with a training video and a series of prompts which should enable them to identify potential intimidated witnesses and how they should respond to reports of crime without themselves placing witnesses at risk. Home Office Circular Number 12/2001, issued in May last year, advised the police to take immediate positive action to prosecute offenders in cases of intimidation and harassment of witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.5/8">From <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>, the courts will be able to order an immediate stop to anti-social behaviour. This should reduce the scope for witness intimidation. The new Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) guidance, published on <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase>, stresses the importance of offering protection and support to witnesses (as well as victims) of anti-social behaviour.</p>

	<p pid=".579W.8/1">Our broad approach to preventing youth crime is to focus on those factors which research and experience, both from within the United Kingdom and abroad, tell us are most likely to increase the risk of criminality, as well as targeted preventative work with the most at risk young people in high crime areas. The risk factors are to do with the family, environment and school, and include behavioural factors such as early drugs and alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid=".579W.8/2">In October this year we hosted an international seminar on youth crime, bringing together leading academics, practitioners and policy makers, to identify experience and evidence from across the world to inform our approach to youth crime. We shall take forward the outcomes of the seminar in the context of the Green Paper on children at risk announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>, and they will inform other parts of our programme, such as our drive against antisocial behaviour.</p>

The figures show that since the start of the Initiative, street crime has fallen by 16 per cent., during the period April to September in the 10 police forces which accounted for over 80 per cent., of the robbery problem. For robbery, the more serious offence, the number of offences in September 2002 was 25 per cent. lower than March for the 10 forces as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.2/17"><sup>(26)</sup> On <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>, the Metropolitan police transferred parts of its area to three surrounding forces; Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. This boundary change would have affected the number of offences recorded and detected by the Metropolitan police. The figure given here incorporates the effects of the boundary change.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/18">The counting rules for detections introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> provide more precise and rigorous criteria for recording a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. The most significant of these criteria is that there must be significant evidence to charge the suspect with a crime (whether or not a charge is actually imposed) so that, if given in court, it would be likely to result in a conviction. Detections obtained by the interview of a convicted prisoner are no longer included, and any detections where no further police action is taken generally have to be approved by a senior police officer or the Crown Prosecution Service. An offence is said to be cleared up/or detected in the following circumstances:</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/19" class="indent">(a) a person has been charged or summonsed for the offence.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/20" class="indent">(b) a person has been cautioned.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/21" class="indent">(c) the court has taken the offence into consideration (TIC).</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/22" class="indent">(d) where no further action is taken, the case is not proceeded with e.g. because the offender is under the age of criminal responsibility, the offender has died, because the victim or an essential witness is permanently unable to give evidence, or no useful purpose would be served by proceeding with the charge.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/23">Some offences have much higher detection rates than others because there is a high likelihood of the victim being able to identify the offender, e.g. assault, and the majority of sexual offences. This would have an affect on the overall detection rate, therefore, it would be a better measure to look at specific offence detection rates rather than the overall rate.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.2/24">The Home Office counting rules for recorded crime were again revised as from April 2002 in order to incorporate the new National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which aims to introduce a greater degree of consistency to the ways in which crime is recorded in different police forces and to take a more victim orientated approach to crime recording. The effect will be to increase significantly the number of crimes in the recorded crime count which in turn may affect detection rates. Some police forces introduced the new Standard in advance of national implementation, but figures given above for the Metropolitan police will not be affected as the force adopted the principles of the Standard in April 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.8/1">The promotion of community sentences to the public and the wider work of the National Probation Service are part of the national strategy to increase confidence in the criminal justice system. As part of the Government's 2002 Spending Review the Home Office shares a Public Service Agreement (PSA) target with the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Attorney-General's Office to improve the level of public confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.8/2">Since, April 2001 the National Probation Service has been developing its communications in particular with sentencers in order to build up confidence in and awareness of, probation work, including new developments in community sentencers that help reduce reoffending. Activities include a video on the Probation Service 'What Works' programme, and plans for publications to disseminate information, and for probation participation at events organised for magistrates and judges.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.8/3">This work is co-ordinated and funded by the National Probation Directorate, but much of the communication at local level occurs between local probation areas and local benches and Crown courts.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.8/4">An action plan, bringing together the media strategy, internal communications and communications with sentencers, will be published in spring 2003. Future work will be informed by recently commissioned public perception research, due for publication in December, which the National Probation Service intends to repeat annually.</p>

	<p pid=".588W.2/1">The Home Office in partnership with the Cabinet Office has conducted a fundamental review of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which examined the basic requirements of The Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act and the codes that underlie police procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/2">Based on the findings and recommendations of this report, the following changes are proposed in the Criminal Justice Bill:</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/3" class="indent">We will give police officers the option to offer an arrested person street bail. At an officer's discretion, s/he would be able to release an arrested person on immediate bail at the scene of the crime on the condition that they must attend a specified police station at a specified time in the future. This allows them to prioritise their work load to attend to more serious crime and to put the necessary arrangements in place before they interview the person (eg where an appropriate adult will need to be in attendance with a juvenile).</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/4" class="indent">The time-consuming requirement to list a detained person's property will be amended so that the custody officer would secure all possessions in a sealable property bag and only make a few supporting comments about the contents if necessary. This and any subsequent access would be done in the presence of the detained person. This has the potential to save resources without compromising protections.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/5" class="indent">We propose to extend the circumstances in which a review of detention could be done by telephone. It would no longer be obligatory for the reviewing officer to conduct them in person and would ultimately enable officers to overcome the time restrictions that hinder the process.</p>
	<p pid=".588W.2/6">In addition, section 38 of the Police Reform Act 2002, which is due to be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>, will enable chief officers of police to designate suitably skilled and trained support staff to exercise certain police powers as detention officers, investigating officers and escort officers. Enabling civilians to exercise certain police powers will help to free-up police officers for patrol and increase police visibility. This is consistent with a number of recommendations arising from the Policing Bureaucracy Taskforce which was commissioned to give a Police Service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices which keep police officers off the streets.</p>

It relates only to nursing staff or other staff with nursing experience working in prison health care that are employed by the Prison Service. Information about the numbers of prisoners in each establishment in England and Wales is available in the Home Office quarterly publication XPrison Population Brief&quot;, a copy of which is on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/prisons1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/prisons1 .html</a>.

We have also funded an expansion of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme.

	<p pid=".606W.3/32">The Prison Service, with the support of the Youth Justice Board, is currently developing a suicide and self-harm prevention strategy. This is being taken forward progressively through a three year programme, which commenced in April 2001. Efforts are being targeted where the risks are highest within a broad preventative approach. The prisoners most at risk&mdash;in local prisons, on remand, in the early weeks and months of custody&mdash;will be better identified and cared for by better trained and supported staff. We aim to encourage a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. Six pilot prisons will act as the test bed for the full range of new safer custody policies and standards, and will be independently evaluated to determine which elements should subsequently be rolled out to the wider prison estate.</p>

	<p pid=".610W.5/1">The Government takes the view that community health council (CHC) staff have valuable skills which are important to the smooth running of the national health service. We are working closely with the trade unions to ensure every action is being taken to support CHC staff to find suitable alternative employment. This includes the setting up of a clearing house system, training and careers interview facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.5/2">We are also currently working with the trade unions and other interested parties to develop a human resources (HR) framework which will provide support to CHC staff and managers. The HR framework will cover a variety of areas including employment options and the role of the clearing house system that will be established to help CHC staff find employment in the NHS family and the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH).</p>
	<p pid=".610W.5/3">The CPPIH has agreed to advertise all their vacancies through the clearing houses as well as in the national and local press. CHC staff applying for a post with the CPPIH who meet the specific job criteria would be guaranteed an interview.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.5/4">The Government currently has no plans to make CHC staff redundant until all employment options have been fully considered. It is therefore not possible to give a redundancy cost at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".610W.5/5">Redundancy terms for CHC staff, as strategic health authority (StHA) employees, are covered in Section 45 of the General Whitley Council Handbook or in accordance with the contract of employment for senior and general managers. A copy of the General Whitley Council Handbook is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".612W.8/2">We estimate that there are between 2,100 and 2,400 individuals who are dangerous as a result of a severe personality disorder (DSPD). The majority of these individuals will be in prison or a secure hospital. We estimate that at any one time 1,400 will be in prison and a further 400 will be detained on court orders under the legal category of psychopathic disorder in secure psychiatric hospitals. We also estimate that a further 300 to 600 men may be living in the community at any one time, of whom most will have been recently detained in prison or hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".612W.8/3">There is no information currently available to make an assessment of likely trends in the number of people who are dangerous as a result of severe personality disorder in prison or the general population. However, the number of restricted patients detained in secure hospitals for a psychopathic disorder has remained around 400 for over 10 years.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.3/15" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/16">1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/17">the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare on behalf of other health bodies;</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/18">and asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/19">For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/20">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/21">3. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the expenditure on primary, secondary and total healthcare by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.3/22">4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2001&ndash;02 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. This has been removed to provide comparability in the answer as far as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.7/1">The rules governing the BID ballot are set out in the Local Government Bill. A successful ballot will have to meet two tests. Firstly, a simple majority of those voting in the BID ballot must vote in favour. Secondly, those voting in favour must represent a majority by rateable value of the hereditaments (rateable properties) of those voting. This Xdual-key&quot; mechanism means that a scheme cannot be forced through by large firms against the wishes of small firms, or vice versa. We do not intend to introduce a third test, namely that for a vote to succeed a set percentage of those entitled to vote must vote in favour. We believe that the Xdual-key&quot; provides sufficient protection for small businesses, including those with a low turnover.</p>

First, we analysed data from the statistical returns compiled by local authorities as part of the Housing Investment Programme and, where available, local housing market studies undertaken by the Centre for Urban and Regional Studies (Birmingham University). Second, we looked at the scale of the low demand problem across housing markets, rather than individual local authorities.

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister by order, to amend, repeal, revoke or disapply the application of any order, to amend, repeal, revoke or disapply the application of any enactment that restricts a best value authority's ability to charge for the provision of a discretionary service or carrying out trading in its functions. By virtue of provisions contained in the XInterpretation Act 1978,&quot; it is unnecessary for the order itself to make express provision as to its revocation. Having made an order under clause 97 for the purpose of revoking an enactment which restricts charging or trading, we would not expect to make a further order revoking that initial order.</p>

As a result the implementation team receives and responds to huge volume of correspondence by letter, email, telephone and other media covering a wide-range of implementation issues. This approach to implementation has proved effective in bringing key-stakeholders into the programme development process but due to the volume of correspondence dealt with and the diverse issues that it covers it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the overall figures in the format requested.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is establishing the Valuation Tribunal Service (VTS) to provide central direction to Valuation Tribunals (VTs), to help spread best practice, strengthen corporate identity and capacity and improve customer service. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is still working on the details but currently estimates that the set-up costs will be no more than a few hundred thousand pounds, and a similar annual amount for additional running costs. This expenditure will be met from the existing baseline for Valuation Tribunals through savings already achieved through rationalisation of staff and offices plus further savings which will result from the dissolution of the non statutory Valuation Tribunal Management Board and its fora.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.6/2">VTs currently employ around 165 staff and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans for that to change except for the recruitment of a small number of HQ staff. Future staffing requirements will be a matter for the VTS to determine. It will want to take into account its workload and the impact of the Non Domestic Rates revaluation in 2005, the Council Tax revaluation in 2007 and other matters relating to the efficient management of the service.</p>
