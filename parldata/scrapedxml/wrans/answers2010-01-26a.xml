	<p pid="a.713W.3/1">Major sporting events can be a magnet for the global sex and trafficking industry, this is wholly unacceptable. I am determined that traffickers will not exploit London 2012. My officials have been working with the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Service on this issue and collectively we are developing a comprehensive plan of action which will build on the considerable expertise the UK has in tackling human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.3/2">Tackling this issue is one of my top priorities. Next month when I attend the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic winter games in Vancouver I will be meeting with key representatives from the agencies responsible for tackling human trafficking and NGO support groups. Ahead of my visit to Vancouver I plan to visit Gatwick airport to view the UK multi-agency response to see how the police, UK Border Force, local social services and NGOs work in partnership to identify and target potential victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.3/3">I will ensure that the All Party Trafficking of Women and Children group receives an update on lessons learned when I return from Vancouver next month.</p>

They advised that the space requirement for children of different ages is as follows: under two years-3.7 sq metres; two years-2.8 sq metres; three to seven years-2.3 sq metres, and in addition certain other facilities need to be provided, such as toilets, a nappy changing area, kitchen, laundry and staff room.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.7/5">Whereas it is possible to disaggregate pre-charge decision data in rape and domestic violence cases, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of pre-charge decision data for violent crime as a discrete offence category from within CMS. These data could only be obtained by analysis of case files at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.7/6">Under Statutory Charging arrangements the police refer cases to the CPS for investigative advice or a charging decision. In cases where a file is submitted to the CPS for advice or where there is insufficient evidence to bring a charge at the first referral, the prosecutor will advise the police officer on the further evidence to be gathered. Once this further evidence has been gathered the officer will return the case to the CPS in order for a charging decision to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.7/7">CMS data reports the average number of calendar days that has elapsed since the first decision was sought from the police, to the date in which the last decision made was to charge or proceed to some other outcome. The CMS last decision made reports include all cases where a decision to charge was made on the same day as the request from the police, either by CPS Direct (an out of hours telephone service); by way of face to face advice; or by local telephone advice. They also include all those cases where the police were required to submit further evidence prior to a decision to charge being made; and those more complex cases where detailed written advice was provided to the police</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.7/8">The system is unable to separately record the timeliness of those cases that were subject to advice and further work before a charge decision was made and recorded as the last decision.</p>

It therefore does not include those who have been discharged, or those whose IPP sentence was subsequently quashed. Although it captures data on access to, and completions of, accredited offending behaviour programmes, it does not record the date or location of programme completions, so answers are not broken down by year or location of completion.</p>

	<p pid="a.738W.2/1">DEFRA expects to spend &#163;780 million on flood and coastal erosion risk management in 2010-11. This includes expenditure by local authorities (supported by Formula Grant) and the Environment Agency (through Grant in Aid). In addition, &#163;20 million of the original &#163;800 million figure for 2010-11 was brought forward into 2009-10 budgets as part of the fiscal stimulation package.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/2">Within the above, the Department has a retained budget for flood and coastal erosion risk management of &#163;35 million for 2010-11.

	<p pid="a.738W.2/3">Based on historical spending by local authorities, DEFRA estimates that its total expenditure on flooding and coastal erosion will be at least &#163;87 million in 2010-11. However, the need for local authorities to spend more on flood and coastal erosion risk management was recognised at the last spending review and additional funding was provided as part of the overall formula grant settlement. As formula grant is not ring-fenced it is for individual authorities to decide how much to spend subject to limits on overall budgets and the need for investment on other priorities.</p>

The aims of this programme are to encourage greater collaboration between public sector buyers to achieve efficiency cost savings and to embed the use of sustainability criteria in the contract award process for the procurement of food by the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.746W.5/1">The UK welcomes the outcome of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna's (ICCAT) annual meeting that took place in November 2009, as it signals an improvement in the management of the blue fin tuna stocks. We are assessing whether the measures agreed at the meeting provide sufficient reassurance that ICCAT can take the necessary steps to implement what was agreed at the meeting, in order to turn around the dramatic decline in the species population. Consequently, we have not yet ruled out the need for a convention on international trade in endangered species (CITES) Appendix I listing, and it certainly remains an option under consideration in the run up to the CITES Conference of Parties meeting in March this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.756W.2/1">Following the severe weather in February 2009, the UK Roads Liaison Group published a report on the lessons learnt on salt usage and supply. The Department for Transport welcomed the UKRLG report and wrote to local authority chief executives impressing on them the importance of effective winter service strategies. The UKRLG also issued revised guidance on winter service.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.2/2">The UKRLG recommendation was that local authorities should keep six days salt capacity and that in addition the Highways Agency should hold a strategic reserve. The Highways Agency entered this winter period with 13 days' capacity and I regard this as the right response following last year's events. For local roads, it is for each local highway authority to consider what measures to take to ensure roads and pavements can be gritted, based on the guidance available to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.2/1">Government's priority is to ensure that everyone who is out of work has the support they need to find a job. As part of this commitment, the Government have made up to &#163;5 billion available since November 2008 to offer substantial new support to jobseekers, and particularly young people, during the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/2">In April 2009, we launched an enhanced offer to all jobseekers at day one of their claim which includes targeted group sessions in jobsearch techniques, access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies and access to additional financial support towards the costs associated with finding work. We have also quadrupled funding to the Rapid Response Service which provides advice and support to people facing redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/3">When they reach six months of unemployment, all jobseekers are now able to access a substantial new package of support including recruitment subsidies, work-focused training places, volunteering opportunities and support to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/4">Government have also introduced substantial new support to help young people during the recession, particularly through the Future Jobs Fund, where Lancashire county council have already been successful in a bid to create up to 503 Future Jobs Fund jobs in the local area which will provide valuable opportunities for people in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/5">The support will be further enhanced from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January</phrase> with the introduction of the Young Person's Guarantee, which guarantees all 18 to 24-year-olds who reach six months of unemployment access to a job, training or work experience. From April 2010, young people will be required to take up one of the places on offer before they complete 10 months on benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/6">Young people will also be given access to a named Jobcentre Plus Personal Adviser at the start of their claim and have more time with an adviser throughout their claim. And we are offering many more young people day one access to the substantial support that is normally available at six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/7">In addition, 18 to 24-year-olds in Morecambe and Lunesdale who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for six months have access to the New Deal for Young People, and customers aged 25 and over who have been unemployed for 18 months have access to the New Deal 25 Plus programme. The new Flexible New Deal, which builds on the success of the existing New Deal programmes and offers more personalised and flexible support, will be introduced in Morecambe and Lunesdale from April 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.762W.2/7">In order to look at whether customers have moved back onto benefit within 12 months of starting work, we need to consider an earlier cohort of customers, to allow time to capture any movement back onto benefit.</p>

Access to Work is a specialist disability programme that helps disabled people overcome work-related obstacles. It is flexible, easy to access and shows high levels of satisfaction from disabled people and their employers. We are doubling the budget for Access to Work to &#163;138 million by 2014 to ensure that everyone who can benefit from the programme is able to access it. We have also developed a range of improvements to the programme, including changes to ensure the programme helps people with mental health conditions more effectively. We will be discussing these changes with stakeholders over the next few months, with the intention of beginning implementation from April 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.768W.6/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) has already signed up to the 10:10 Campaign for cutting carbon emissions by 10 per cent. in 2010; and is committed to working towards this target with its executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). CLG understands the 10:10 Campaign to relate to carbon emissions from energy use, owned vehicles and air travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.6/2">The two main decision criteria in signing up were performance to date and the availability of cost-effective carbon reduction opportunities deliverable over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.6/3">The CLG Group, which includes its executive agencies and selected NDPBs, reduced reported emissions from energy use by over 10 per cent. in 2008-09 compared to the previous year and has already reduced emissions from road travel by 30 per cent. compared to the Sustainable Operations (SOGE) target to reduce by 15 per cent. by 2010-11 against 2005-06 levels. Given these recent successes, it is particularly challenging to reduce emissions by a further 10 per cent. in 2010 across such a diverse estate and range of organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.6/4">CLG's ongoing research and analysis, which informs its wider Carbon Reduction Delivery Plan, indicates that a further 10 per cent. reduction should be possible across its headquarter estate in 2010. These reductions are expected to be delivered by continued estate rationalisation, upgrade of lighting, heat recovery projects and more efficient operation of plant and machinery. Specific research includes assessments of estate strategies, FM and engineering practices and asset replacement opportunities. These will then be prioritised based on payback and availability of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.6/5">In assessing its approach to short term targets such as 10:10, the Department remains mindful of its long term strategy for meeting its Carbon Budget allocations, necessary to deliver the 80 per cent. reduction by 2050, as required by the Climate Change Act.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-01-26a.310992.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-01-26a.774W.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="774W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100126/text/100126w0014.htm#10012678000947">
	<p pid="a.774W.7/1">The Department's policy on historic ships was developed in response to the DCMS public consultation on 'Ships for the Nation' in 2003 and the Select Committee hearing on maritime heritage and historic ships in 2004-05. This led to the creation of the Advisory Committee for national historic ships in July 2006. This committee advises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on policy and priorities for the historic ships sector; coordinates work within the sector to assist those directly engaged in preservation; and promotes public interest in historic ships as a key component of the maritime heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/2">The committee receive revenue funding from the Department. In addition to advising on priorities for the sector, the committee uses its funding to compile and maintain the national register of historic vessels; to provide strategic development grants to assist owners, trusts and societies responsible for vessels included on the national register.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/3">The register for national historic vessels is a database of over 1000 vessels which can be used to identify and prioritise vessels that should be preserved, provide guidance on how best to allocate funding and give an early warning of any vessels that may be 'at risk'. It allows Government to identify the vessels that are of national and regional significance which may need to be prioritised for long term preservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/4">The committee have also created the 'National Ship Preservation Network' which is an online directory of organisations involved in vessel conservation, allowing owners to access up to date information about the skills and services available in their area. In addition to this, the committee have published a range of guidelines on preserving, conserving and deconstructing historic vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/5">In 2007, the committee carried out a consultation entitled &quot;Understanding Historic Vessels&quot;. As a result of this, they published two guidance documents called &quot;Recording Historic Vessels&quot; and &quot;Deconstructing Historic Vessels&quot;. &quot;Recording Historic Vessels&quot; is designed to help vessel owners to create and maintain a record of their vessel so that information about the vessel can be preserved for the future. &quot;Deconstructing Historic Vessels&quot; was designed to help vessel owners carry out any necessary deconstruction work in a way that saves a valuable record of the ship's structure and operational life for future generations. These documents are freely accessible to the public on the Committee's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/pages/advisory-papers.html">http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/pages/advisory-papers.html</a></p>
	<p pid="a.774W.7/7">There is no central register to track the use of the guidelines or the results of any recordings. It is impossible therefore to determine how many historic vessels have been recorded using the guidelines and where the vessels are located. The committee have applied the methodologies to Golden Galleon before deconstruction and to HMS Bronington (currently located in Birkenhead) ahead of a possible deconstruction programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.787W.2/1">Patients are routinely asked for their feedback on the support they receive to self care and its effectiveness through the GP Tracker Survey and the IPSOS MORI self care survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.787W.2/2">The Department worked with Skills for Health and Skills for Care who published the &quot;Common Core Principles to Support Self Care&quot; (May 2008) setting out the skills attitudes and behaviours to support individuals to self care. In addition a web-based training module for clinicians and other professionals is available through the national learning management system-&quot;Supporting Self Care&quot; was developed with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the Department's e-learning for Healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.787W.2/3">Information for patients on self care choices and service options has been made available with the development of &quot;Your health, your way&quot;. This web-based initiative on NHS Choices is supported by a patient information leaflet and information and resources for healthcare professionals. In the recent national Self Care Week (9-<phrase class="date" code="2009-11-15">15 November 2009</phrase>) which aimed to raise awareness of &quot;Your health, your way&quot; and the choices of self care support available, visits to the website doubled.</p>

This is in addition to other choices of support in terms of information about the condition, tools and equipment to help people stay independent, access to support groups, and healthy lifestyle advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.787W.2/5">The Department's self care strategy focuses on supporting people with LTCs through a process of care planning which enables them to take a more active and informed role in decisions about their health and wellbeing. This includes information, choices, shared decision making and ongoing support to self care as part of a care planning discussion with their healthcare professional. A personalised care plan, developed and regularly reviewed with a lead professional from among the team of staff who help manage their care will mean a person will have more control over the care packages they receive. In this way the chances of any unplanned emergencies or deterioration in that person's condition should be minimised. Information about care plans and care planning is included in the &quot;Your health, your way&quot; and self care materials.</p>

	<p pid="a.788W.11/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has in place a proactive safety monitoring strategy for the swine influenza vaccines currently in use in the United Kingdom. As part of this, the MHRA established a dedicated reporting system, an adjunct to the existing Yellow Card scheme, for suspected side effects to the vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.11/2">The strategy involves daily analysis of all suspected side effect reports, a real-time statistical analysis of the data and weekly publication of its ongoing review on the MHRA website:</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.11/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/swineflu">www.mhra.gov.uk/swineflu</a></p>
	<p pid="a.788W.11/4">As well as such data arising from the UK reporting scheme, the MHRA has been fully involved in evaluating similar safety data from across Europe, as well as emerging safety data from ongoing clinical studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.11/5">The MHRA's analysis has so far found that the number and the nature of suspected side effects reported to date accord with expectations. The most frequently reported suspected side effects are injection site reactions (such as pain, swelling, redness), or are well known and common side effects of many vaccines, including the swine flu vaccines (such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle pain, fever, fatigue, headaches, swollen glands). These are generally mild and short lasting.</p>
	<p pid="a.788W.11/6">No unexpected or serious new safety issues have been identified from UK and non-UK safety data received to date. The balance of benefits and risks for swine flu vaccines used in the UK remains positive. As with all medicines and vaccines on the UK market, the MHRA will keep the safety of swine flu vaccines under close review.</p>

Recent estimates of through-life costs required to maintain their material state, suggest that the continued retention of the buildings may not represent best value for money. We are, therefore, looking at options for their future. No decisions will, however, be taken until stakeholders, lodger units and trades unions have been consulted.</p>

All three groups were previously being funded through a variety of separate programme funding arrangements involving considerable staff time and resources. All three groups filled an important niche in civil society not covered by other PPA partners. By supporting these groups through PPAs, we were able to provide assistance more efficiently. There was no benefit to DFID in undertaking a long and costly competitive application process.</p>

	<p pid="a.822W.6/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 1997. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. The available statistical information therefore relates to the London borough of Lambeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/2">In terms of police recorded crime in Lambeth, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 35 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/3" class="indent">Violence against the person: down 14 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/4" class="indent">Sexual offences: down 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/5" class="indent">Robbery: down 46 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/6" class="indent">Burglary: down 39 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles: down 56 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/8" class="indent">Other theft offences: down 38 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/9" class="indent">Criminal damage: down 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/10" class="indent">Drug offences: up 33 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/11">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at borough level is available prior to 1998-99. Lambeth Operational Command Unit had 1,010 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by 174 since 2001. Comparisons with 1997 for Lambeth are not available. There were 170 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> whilst there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/12">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP). The CDRP has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/13">The CDRP paved the way for the Safer Neighbourhoods initiatives where there is now a dedicated police resource in each of the 21 wards in Lambeth which were not in place in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/14">Lambeth's CDRP and wider partnership approach has been recognised as good practice and overall crime levels continue to reduce: there was a reduction in the seven consecutive years up to 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/15">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Lambeth have adopted a borough-wide controlled drinking zone which is now in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.822W.6/16">In 1997, there were 40 CCTV cameras in Lambeth and since then two main schemes have been developed increasing CCTV to 966 cameras. The Town Centre scheme which has 133 cameras and 833 in housing estates and there are additionally Transport for London cameras.</p>

	<p pid="a.831W.8/2">There are some points within the report with which we do not agree, and others, including the proposal for hybrid courts, on which further details are needed. However, our overall assessment is that the report is thorough, detailed and balanced, with a frank analysis of causes and consequences of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.831W.8/3">We will continue to support the work of the Mbeki-led High-level Implementation Panel, which was established to take forward the report's recommendations, and encourage effective co-ordination with existing organisations working for peace in Sudan. We will work with the AU and other international organisations, on those areas within the AUPD report which still need further consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.842W.6/1">Following the commitments made in the Children's Plan in 2007 and the national play strategy in 2008, every top tier local authority in England is now receiving funding through the play capital investment programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/2">Of the 152 top-tier local authorities, 30 are play pathfinder authorities and the remaining 122 local authorities are all playbuilder authorities. On average every play pathfinder authority will receive around &#163;2 million capital funding and &#163;500,000 revenue funding, while playbuilder authorities will receive around &#163;1 million capital and &#163;45,000 revenue funding, over the current spending period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Play pathfinder authorities will use their allocated funding to deliver a minimum of 28 play areas plus a new staffed adventure playground, while playbuilder authorities will deliver a minimum of 22 play areas by 2011. The play areas that are delivered can be either completely new areas or existing areas which are significantly refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/3">Local authorities have joined the programme, and so started receiving their funding, in two phases: Wave 1 started in April 2008 and Wave 2 in April 2009. Torbay and Devon are both Wave 2 playbuilder authorities and as such are required to deliver 11 play areas each in both 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/4">The following tables show the capital and revenue funding allocated to Torbay and Devon during 2009-10, with indicative allocations for 2010-11 which will be confirmed in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/5">Decisions on where the allocated capital funding is spent within local authority boundaries are taken locally, based on grant requirements around improved play spaces being provided where they are most needed and based on a robust consultation process with local children and young people, families and wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.842W.6/6">We are encouraging all Members of Parliament to proactively engage with their local play capital programmes as they roll out, and we are asking local authorities to ensure that their local Members of Parliament and council elected members are appropriately consulted, and briefed, about where the capital funding is spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.844W.5/1">Raising the participation age will bring benefits for young people, the economy and wider society. Continuing in learning post 16 means young people are more likely to achieve higher levels of qualifications, have increased earnings over their lifetime, better health and improved social skills. This in turn contributes to a more highly skilled, productive and internationally competitive workforce, with net benefits estimated at an additional &#163;1.6 billion for each cohort of young people affected by RPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/2">The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families recently announced a record level of investment of &#163;8.2bn in 16-18 learning for 2010-11. It was also announced that the budget for 16-18 learning would increase by 0.9 per cent. in real terms in 2011-12 and 2012-13 in preparation for raising of the participation age. Funding beyond this period is subject to future spending reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/3">To further support preparations for raising the participation age, trials are underway in 11 local areas to develop innovative local practice. Building on existing good practice the Department for Children, Schools and Families has recently published &quot;Raising the Participation Age: supporting local areas to deliver&quot; which sets out the key actions at national and local levels to support raising the participation age. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.5/4" class="indent">Ensuring all children are prepared for success through new pupil and parent guarantees, a new secondary curriculum, one-to-one tuition and dissemination of good practice to tackle disengagement during key stage 3;</p>
