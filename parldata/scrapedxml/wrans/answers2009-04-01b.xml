	<p pid="b.1185W.3/1">The House at present has three full-time apprentices in the Craft Team within the Facilities Department. Currently, one apprentice (hot-water fitter) is working on NVQ level 3 and the two others (Carpenter/joiners) are working on NVQ level 2, having joined the House through the Young Apprenticeship Scheme, sponsored by Mr. Speaker. The scheme has been running for the past five years and offers students from Southwark an opportunity to spend one day per week for one school year in a work area of their choice. The scheme is being further developed so that the students who come to the House&mdash;around 10 per year&mdash;will spend two years here rather than one and will complete the first level of a modern apprenticeship, commencing in July this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193W.8/1">Our high commission in Port Louis which covers Madagascar, has provided frequent political reporting since the current crisis in Madagascar intensified at the end of January 2009. Our officers in Port Louis have visited Antananarivo during this period, to gather information from officials, diplomatic representatives, international organisations such as the EU, US, and UN, business contacts and the non-governmental organisations community in Madagascar and capitals. Staff in our British interest section and honorary consulates in Antananarivo and Tamatave also provide regular updates. We remain very concerned by the situation in Madagascar and urge all sides to seek a resolution which ensures a return to the constitutional and democratic process.</p>

The Government agree with the conclusion of the ICJ that the construction of the barrier along the chosen route, and its associated security regime, is unlawful under international law.

	<p pid="b.1215W.2/2">The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) set up a working group to look at industry's codes for advertising in autumn 2008. Following that, a compliance survey carried out by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) showed that video games advertisements had a 99 per cent. compliance rate with the regulations. The existing guidelines were therefore found to be sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1215W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-26">26 March 2009</phrase> the ASA published a consultation on a review of its own codes for broadcast and non-broadcast advertising. This proposes a restriction to prevent adverts for age-restricted computer and console games appearing around TV programmes likely to appeal to children. Once this consultation is complete and new codes are in place, ELSPA will reassess industry guidelines to ensure they are still fit for purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.8/2">People are referred by their general practitioner to their local audiology clinic when they experience problems with their hearing and it is for local health professionals to determine and agree with an individual as to the type of hearing assistance that may be required. Re-assessment generally takes place after three years unless an individual experiences further hearing loss, in which case they may be re-assessed earlier.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.5/1">In 2007, following Mencap's report on the six deaths of people with learning disabilities, the former Secretary of State for Health commissioned Sir Jonathan Michael to carry out an Independent Inquiry into access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities. The report of that Inquiry&mdash;&quot;Healthcare for All&quot;&mdash;made 10 recommendations for improving access to healthcare for people with learning disabilities. A copy has already been placed in the Library. &quot;Valuing People Now: a new three-year strategy for people with learning disabilities&quot;, which was published in January 2009, set out the Government's response to the Independent Inquiry's report and our acceptance of all 10 recommendations. A copy of the strategy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.5/2">We are saddened at the Ombudsman's report and the cases of all the people who died, particularly when up to two of the deaths could have been prevented. We welcome this report and accept its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.5/3">Access to high quality healthcare is a right, and is essential in enabling people to lead healthy, active and fulfilling lives. The Government are committed to supporting and protecting the human rights of people with learning disabilities. All people with a learning disability are people first, with the right to lead their lives like any others, with the same opportunities and responsibilities and to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.5/4">The action set out in &quot;Valuing People Now&quot;, including a commitment to establishing a confidential inquiry to investigate premature deaths of people with learning disabilities, and the support we are providing at a local and regional level to improve training and awareness amongst health care staff will help people with learning disabilities to get access to the care they need. We have already introduced annual health checks for people with learning disabilities and on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March</phrase>, we launched guidance for primary care staff to support individualised health plans for people with learning disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.5/1">Since 2001-02, real terms investment in adult mental health services has increased by 44 per cent. (or &pound;1.7 billion), putting in place the services and staff needed to transform mental health services. Compared with 1997, we now have 64 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 71 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 21 per cent. more mental health nurses, providing better care for people with mental health problems (all full-time equivalent). More than 740 mental health teams provide specialist community mental health services, such as home treatment, early intervention, or intensive support for people who might otherwise be admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.5/2">General practitioners and consultant psychiatrists decide on the most appropriate treatment for their patients, and they are expected to take National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance fully into account. Doctors can prescribe any medicine or treatment which they consider to be necessary, including NICE-approved psychological therapies for severe mental illness, provided that the local primary care trust (PCT) or national health service trust agrees to supply it on the NHS. However, it is for PCTs to decide spending levels for specific health care treatments and services, including mental health, and to commission these services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.5/3">The Department revised Care Programme Approach (CPA) guidelines in 2008. Under CPA, each mental health service user should have an opportunity to be actively involved in agreeing their treatment plans with their care co-ordinator, wherever possible. This is not dependent on diagnosis, but may be affected by the severity of the condition at any particular time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.0/1">The Department has implemented several measures to help ensure that people with mental health problems and physical illness can access national health service healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.0/2">The NHS &quot;Operating Framework&quot; for 2009-10 includes a specific reference to the importance of physical health checks in primary care settings for people with a severe mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.0/3">The draft standard NHS contracts for mental health services in 2010-11 onwards, which the Department published in 2008, give providers responsibility for arranging physical health checks for long term in-patients, call for annual improvement targets to be set locally, and suggest progress in improving physical health care as a subject for local reporting from provider to commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.0/4">Guidance notes accompanying the standard contracts stress the importance of individualised needs assessments which address service users' physical health, and recommends local arrangements with primary care services to ensure health checks and inclusion in screening and health promotion activity for mental health service users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.0/5">The care programme approach (CPA) for people with complex mental health needs was revised last year. Under CPA, each mental health service user should have an opportunity to be actively involved in agreeing their treatment plans with their care coordinator, wherever possible. CPA describes a holistic approach covering quality of life, health checks, the physical effects of mental illness and psychiatric treatment and the effect of physical symptoms on mental well-being, smoking and obesity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1225W.0/1">The United Kingdom has no policy of compulsory medication. The schedule for the UK routine childhood immunisation programme recommends two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Consent for MMR vaccination of young children is given by a person with parental responsibility. Parents have the choice to refuse the vaccinations offered by the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1225W.0/2">MMR vaccine is the safest way to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella. The Department encourages parents to exercise their responsibility to participate in important public health programmes such as MMR vaccination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1225W.0/3">The Department does not recommend single measles, mumps or rubella vaccines. The use of single vaccines leaves children at risk of catching measles, mumps or rubella in the time periods between doses of the vaccines, and a full course requires six injections rather than the two required for MMR vaccine. The single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines currently available privately in the UK are not licensed for use in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.3/1">Disabled facilities grant is a mandatory entitlement administered by local housing authorities under the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996. The implications of the disabled facilities grant legal framework is that following an assessment of need the local authority is required to provide a disabled facilities grant subject to a means test and grant maximum. Suspending disabled facilities grants is not an acceptable means of budget management.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.3/2">The Government have more than doubled the government funds available for the programme from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;146 million in 2008 with an increase of &pound;10 million in each of the next two years making the budget &pound;166 million by 2010. For 2008-09 Waltham Forest received &pound;630,000 in disabled facilities grant and an additional &pound;47,000 was allocated to Waltham Forest last month. Local authorities are expected to prioritise these services and contribute towards the costs of disabled facilities grants as they have always done so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237W.0/1">Government does not hold a record of rape crisis centres (members of Rape Crisis England and Wales, or its predecessor bodies) in existence over this period of time. As with other membership organisations, membership of Rape Crisis England and Wales, and its predecessors, has changed over time. There are also organisations which use the phrase 'rape crisis' in their organisational name, but which are not members of Rape Crisis England and Wales. This means it is difficult to be exact in identifying rape crisis centres separately from those sexual violence voluntary sector organisations which have received central Government funding. These factors make it difficult to provide exact totals of funds provided to rape crisis centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.0/2">Taking the above into account, the total of grants awarded from the Victims' Fund, Home Office funding for independent sexual violence advisors (ISVAs) and the special fund to rape crisis centres, for <i> (a) </i>2008-09 and <i> (b)</i> each year prior to this where records are available are set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.1247W.5/1">Negotiations to agree the final legal text of the EU REACH Regulation (no. 1907/2006) covered a three-year period, from October 2003 to December 2006. DEFRA led for the UK during the negotiations, working alongside other Government Departments and taking account of industry and NGO views. The aim throughout was to secure a robust and workable regulation that balanced the interests of industry with a high level of protection for human health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.5/2">Between July and December 2005 the UK held the presidency of the European Union, and during this time developed the text which secured political agreement as the Council's Common Position following the first reading in the European Parliament. A significant initiative put forward jointly by the UK, known as 'One Substance, One Registration' (OSOR) was incorporated into the Common Position. This was assessed at the time as potentially providing savings in registration costs for UK industry of up to &euro;128 million over the 10-year registration period, compared with the original Commission estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247W.5/3">During the second reading negotiations in the second half of 2006, the UK strongly supported initiatives to require substitution plans for hazardous chemicals subject to authorisation, and measures to further reduce animal testing and encourage development and use of non-animal alternative methods.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.0/2">I am replying because risk assessment on Ministry of Defence (MOD) sites is a matter for the MOD. The Environment Agency has not made any assessment of the vulnerability of specific MOD sites to flooding. However, MOD uses data published by the Environment Agency to assess the general level of flood risk to its sites, but does not collate this centrally. We are augmenting this data by developing the means to assess the significance of impacts that a changing climate or an extreme climate event, including flooding, could have on MOD sites. Results of these assessments will then influence site planning and development, location and design of buildings, and will inform site plans to enable risks to be managed effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251W.0/2">We are currently in discussions with supermarkets through the Courtauld Commitment, which is a voluntary agreement between the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and major UK grocery organisations.

	<p pid="b.1251W.3/1">The Government are focused on reducing the amount of food being wasted by producers, retailers and consumers; and by encouraging better management through environmentally friendly treatment of food waste where prevention is not possible, to minimise the amount that reaches landfill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.3/2">The Government are helping reduce the amount of food being wasted through their ongoing work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to cut significantly the amount of food wasted in the supply chain and in the home. This requires a twin-track approach&mdash;working closely with retailers and manufacturers, and also directly with households. The two main programmes contributing to this work are the 'Courtauld Commitment' and the 'Love Food Hate Waste' campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.3/3">Not all food waste can be prevented, and the Government have been actively promoting and providing support for greater uptake of anaerobic digestion (AD), a proven renewable energy technology, as a sustainable option for unavoidable food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. AD offers a considerable climate change benefit through avoided landfill methane emissions, with the energy generated also offsetting fossil fuel power generation, and counting towards our renewable energy targets. There are currently 37 local authorities that have separate food waste collections. These collections are expected to become more widespread in the future.</p>

There have been no changes to the credit ratings of the regulated water companies, with the exception of Yorkshire Water where it was downgraded by one credit rating agency, Standard and Poors, from A- to BBB. Standard and Poors clearly cite company specific issues relating to delays in the implementation of a new capital structure as the reason for the downgrade.

British citizenship and British overseas territories citizenship derive from a personal or ancestral connection with the United Kingdom or one of the remaining British overseas territories. The other statuses derive, in the main, from similar connections with a former British colony, or a foreign territory which was formerly under British jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.8/3">Only British citizens and certain British subjects have the right of abode in the United Kingdom. The others are subject to UK immigration control, although British overseas territories citizens who derive that status from a Gibraltar connection enjoy certain rights of free movement and establishment under the EC Treaty. As regards entry to the United Kingdom, other types of British national are not treated any differently to those of any other nationality when it comes to settlement. They have to qualify under the immigration rules in the same way as any other applicant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261W.3/1">Under the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) funding arrangements 2008-09 to 2010-11 OSCT are providing additional funding to establish over 300 new police posts across the country dedicated to the Prevent agenda. In 2008-09 we have costed around &pound;12 million across 24 priority forces, and regional Counter Terrorism Units and Counter Terrorism Intelligence Units, the distribution of which was based on an assessment of population vulnerability and evaluated intelligence cross matched to the Department of Communities and Local Government's Preventing Violent Extremism areas. This includes provision for police officer and police staff training. Figures on recruitment costs are not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264W.3/2">Similarly, the specific objectives of each secondment and training course are not held centrally but the principal objective is to use British Army assets in peacetime to discourage hostility abroad, build and maintain trust between states, facilitate inter-operability between British and overseas armed forces, develop and sustain alliances, provide partner nations with the skills to undertake peace support and counter-terrorism operations, and assist in the development of democratically accountable armed forces; thereby helping to make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and resolution.</p>

Equality and diversity training is undertaken at the Joint Equality and Diversity Training Centre and widely across all three Services. Other measures include: confidential advice and support helplines; trained equal and diversity advisers in every unit; guidance, videos and briefings on diversity issues.

The Territorial Army also makes a significant contribution to the Medical Group, particularly in the hospital role. The provision of medical capability determines the composition of the Medical Group rather than being defined by a Medical Regiment, which could deploy as a whole or in part as a component of the Medical Regiment. As such, calculating the tour interval for these units does not appropriately reflect the dynamic manner in which they are deployed or indeed provide insight as to the effect on individual Service Personnel who are trickle posted through these units.</p>

The six key factors used to determine job weight are: knowledge, skills and experience; complexity and mental challenge; judgment and decision-making; use of resources; communications; and working conditions. The results of job evaluation for all other rank trades are applied on a whole trade basis against the evaluation of a range of jobs selected as being representative of the main types of employment carried out across a particular trade, but with each rank being judged on its own merits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.2/1">To provide this specific information would require a departmental-wide trawl to ascertain the number and cost of involuntary and voluntary staff exits in each year since 2005-06. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.2/2">We do hold information centrally on the departmental-wide voluntary early release schemes which were launched in March 2005 and March 2008 (early retirement or early severance). The following table shows the number of staff who voluntarily left the Ministry of Defence in each year between 2005-06 and 2007-08, grouped by the cost of their severance package (over &pound;100,000); and those who are due to leave in years 2008-09 and 2009-10. These early release schemes are expected to reduce the MOD Salary Costs by around &pound;90 million over the period 2005-10. These early release schemes are expected to reduce the MOD salary costs by around &pound;90 million over the period 2005-10.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273W.5/1">This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Responsibility for veterans' health care delivery lies with the NHS. The Department of Health and Devolved Administrations, with support from the Ministry of Defence have launched a number of community mental health pilots for veterans at six NHS Trusts across the UK. Centred on the patient and GP, these arrangements should make it easier for veterans with concerns about their mental health to seek and access help. For those veterans not in the catchment area of one of the pilot sites and who are not satisfied with the support provided to them through the NHS, MOD's Medical Assessment Programme, based at St. Thomas's hospital London, provides expert mental health assessments.</p>

However, the needs of Gulf veterans and their dependants remain a priority for the Government. Appropriate medical treatment is provided by the NHS. Financial support is available to eligible Gulf veterans and dependants through MOD war pensions and armed forces occupational pension schemes. The UK has undertaken a substantial amount of research into the possible causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses costing some &pound;9 million from 1997 onwards. The focus of our research effort is now on rehabilitative therapies for those veterans with persistent symptoms as recommended by the Medical Research Council. A contract has been awarded to Cardiff university, acknowledged experts in this field, and work has begun on a rehabilitation research programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277W.3/1">Appropriate arrangements for the prosecution of suspected pirates are important to ensuring the maximum effectiveness of the EU counter-piracy operation Atalanta. We welcome the signature of the EU/Kenya exchange of letters on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-06">6 March 2009</phrase> for the transfer of persons suspected of committing acts of piracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.3/2">Nine suspected pirates were transferred to Kenya by the EU operation Atalanta on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-10">10 March</phrase> but it is too early to assess the effectiveness of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.3/3">The EU will be sending a delegation to Kenya next week to assess the level of support that the Kenyan authorities require in the prosecution of pirates. The EU continues to seek appropriate arrangements with other regional states to ensure that the burden of potential prosecution is shared. The International Contact Group on piracy off the coast of Somalia is also working on building capacity and capability in the region to prosecute pirates.</p>
