In reaching its own decisions in relation both to the administration of Members' allowances and publication of information about them the Members Estimate Committee has drawn on a range of sources including the other UK legislatures and assemblies. For example the Committee drew extensively on the experience of the Scottish Parliament in its Review of Allowances (HC 578) published in June 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1604W.5/1">The estimated empty property business rates payable for the year 2008-09 is approximately &pound;1.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1604W.5/2">The properties comprise approximately 121,244 sq m of largely office accommodation originally leased by the then British Railways Board to accommodate their own administrative staff. The properties were transferred to BRB (Residuary) Ltd (BRBR)&mdash;a wholly owned subsidiary of the Secretary of State&mdash;in 2002. The accommodation is now sub-let to a mixture of civil service Departments, the railway industry and other private sector tenants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1604W.5/3">The day to day management objective for the Estate is to keep operating costs to a minimum, including empty rates. This is done by renting out as much space as possible, consistent with value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1604W.5/4">The e-PIMs database identifies some 30,126 sq m as available to let. However, part of this space is also earmarked for redevelopment and early disposal. For example, the Rail House, Manchester space is subject to a major redevelopment to create over 10,000 sq m of accommodation for the civil service, with the Training and Development Agency moving up from London. The Furlong House and John Peyton House properties (6,200 sq m) are currently in the late stages of sale.</p>

Chapter 4 discusses response volumes, and Appendix B explains in detail the code frames used. 1549 'Justine Greening your views of Heathrow' postcards, and 584 'Justine Greening Petition' responses were received. However as the postcards were received before the start of the consultation, they were not analysed as individual responses.

	<p pid="b.1614W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-24">24 November 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that because of the exceptional circumstances in the economy and the housing market, the Government would maintain, for six months, the level of support for mortgage interest based on a standard interest rate of 6.08 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/3">Some people will experience a temporary drop below 6.08 per cent (to 4.58 per cent) because our IT systems had been programmed to track the Bank of England base rate. When the Chancellor's decision was made, our IT systems that are used to assess and pay of DWP benefits had started automatically to implement the 1.5 per cent reduction in the base rate announced by the Bank of England on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-06">6 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/4">We were able to re-adjust the rate back to 6.08 per cent for people getting income-based jobseeker's allowance and income-related employment and support allowance. This amounted to 5 per cent. of the affected cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/5">We could not do so for those getting income support and pension credit without a high risk of disrupting the normal running of our IT systems, most critically the uprating of benefits, which would have affected many more people than just those getting support for mortgage interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/6">We estimate that 80,000 income support customers and 115,000 pension credit customers receive support for mortgage interest and these are currently being paid at 4.58 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/7">We are taking urgent action to ensure that these customers do not lose out, and that cases are corrected to reflect the Chancellor's commitment. I can assure the House that no one is being paid support for mortgage at an interest rate below 4.58 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/8">In total, departmental expenditure on support for mortgage interest is currently being underpaid at &pound;1.5 million per week. In the vast majority of cases, we transfer customers' support for mortgage interest direct to their lender, so the customer will not see a fall in the amount of money they themselves receive each week. However we estimate that, on average, support for mortgage interest in respect of pension credit customers will have been underpaid by &pound;7 per week and in respect of income support customers by &pound;11 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/9">We will make a corrective adjustment for a period of five weeks from <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-02">2 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-08">8 March 2009</phrase>. During this period, customers will receive an increase in their benefit to compensate them for the earlier reduction. Then, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-09">9 March</phrase> benefit will be readjusted to the correct level with the standard interest rate set at 6.08 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/10">Mortgage lenders, via the Council of Mortgage Lenders, have also been advised about the situation to ensure that lenders are aware of exactly what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.3/11">Our staff have been fully briefed and we have issued clear guidance to local authority staff.</p>

Triggers based on forecast periods of seven consecutive days are notified on the first day of the forecast period. (This holds except when a trigger would be notified on a Saturday or a Sunday, when it is actually notified on the following Monday.) Payment scans are run at a weekend for triggers notified on the previous Monday to Thursday or on the Friday prior to that. Scan payments into bank accounts should arrive on the Wednesday after the weekend and cheque payments should be posted on the Monday after the weekend. Thus scan payments into bank accounts should arrive seven to 13 days after the temperature criterion has been met. Payments made clerically are not made as quickly as payments which can be made automatically. Information is not available on the split between payments into bank accounts and cheque payments, or on the time taken to process clerical payments, so the two questions cannot be answered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1622W.12/1">The Government introduced FSA regulation of mortgages in 2004. The FSA's regime provides important protections for borrowers. It requires lenders to treat their customers fairly, and to treat repossession as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid="b.1622W.12/2">FSA regulation is supported by the new mortgage pre-action protocol introduced in November 2008. This sets out clear guidance on what actions the courts expect lenders to take before bringing a claim in the courts, to help ensure that repossessions are a last resort and that lenders have tried to discuss and agree other alternatives with the borrower.</p>
	<p pid="b.1622W.12/3">Through the new Lending Panel, announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report, the Government are working closely with lenders, consumer groups and regulators to monitor lending and support best practice by lenders. The major lenders on the Lending Panel have committed not to repossess where the owner-occupier is less than three months in arrears.</p>
	<p pid="b.1622W.12/4">In December 2008, the Government announced a new Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme, which will enable households that experience a significant and temporary loss of income as a result of the economic downturn to defer a proportion of the interest payments on their mortgage for up to two years. Further details are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1622W.12/6">The Government have also launched a Mortgage Rescue Scheme to help borrowers facing repayment difficulties remain in their homes and this scheme has been extended to include second charge lending. Depending on homeowners' circumstances, local authorities and housing associations can either buy a property and then rent it back to them, or buy a share of the property to reduce the household's overall mortgage costs.

Compliance with the UN conventions is, therefore, an ongoing process through the daily operation of the 1971 Act and its subordinate legislation. As custodian of the UN conventions, the Home Office supports the work of the International Narcotics Control Board by supplying manufacturing and transaction data and ensuring industry adherence to the statutory controls, both national and international, through a system of vetting and licensing of those companies involved in the manufacture and trade of controlled substances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1632W.5/1">Serious violence at football matches is now extremely rare compared to the period between 1970 and 2000. On average there is just one arrest in connection with football matches played in England and Wales; and that covers arrests at any place within 24-hours either side of a match.</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.5/2">The English and Welsh football strategy for minimising football safety and security risks introduced after Euro 2000 has proven to be very successful. The strategy is based upon effective partnerships between Government, police, football authorities and supporter groups and on the concept of isolating risk fans whilst empowering the overwhelming majority of fans to take responsibility for their actions and self police.</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.5/3">The football banning order arrangements introduced in 2000 continue to be a highly effective cornerstone of the strategy and an important means for excluding known risk fans and deterring misbehaviour amongst the rest. The orders have proven to be a highly successful rehabilitative measure with around 94 per cent. of individuals whose orders have expired being assessed by police as no longer posing a risk of football disorder.</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.5/4">The strategy is now universally recognised as the best in the world and is being replicated around the globe. However, there can and will be no complacency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1636W.9/1">Home Office Ministers have not taken part in any recent discussions at European level on these specific topics. EU legislation on asylum and immigration matters, apart from rights of free movement for EEA nationals and their family members, is subject to the UK's opt in protocol. We will opt in only if this is consistent with maintaining our frontier controls and in the national interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.9/2">In respect of family reunification, to date the UK has not opted into the Family Reunification Directive. In respect of illegal immigration, I strongly support the principle stated in the European Pact on Migration and Asylum, which calls for illegal migrants to be removed to their countries of origin and transit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1637W.5/1">The UK has always maintained the position that all countries are under an obligation to readmit their own nationals who are removed from another country, independently of Readmission Agreements. The UK wants to build international alliances to help deliver our policies. A key element of this is to co-operate on migration through bilateral and multilateral relationships with other countries. To this end the UK has formal agreements and informal arrangements with various countries to readmit their nationals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1637W.5/2">Only where there is a specific need does the UK seek to negotiate Readmission Agreements. There is a bilateral Readmission Agreement in force with Switzerland, signed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase>, and we also have another with Algeria which was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>. There are currently no negotiations being undertaken for a bilateral Readmission Agreement with any third country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1637W.5/3">The UK also works closely with our European partners in the area of returns. The European Union has its own framework of agreements called European Community Readmission Agreements (ECRA). These are negotiated and signed by the European Commission on behalf of the member states and Ministers decide on the UK's opt-in position to these agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1637W.5/4">There are 11 European Community Readmission Agreements which have been signed and are now in force as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1641W.6/2">To our knowledge no estimates have been made on the impact of secure remand. There is little evidence available on the impact of tagging in reducing re-offending rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.6/3">In a 2006 House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts report this lack of evidence in relation to the effectiveness of Home Detention Curfew (HDC) was highlighted and a request for further research made. As a result of this a feasibility study on assessing the effectiveness of HDC was commissioned to the London School of Economics and research using existing administrative data has now been conducted. Publication of the report is expected by mid-2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1641W.6/4">Research carried out for the Home Office and published in 2001 showed a difference in re-offending rates within six months of release between those released on HDC compared with those not given HDC. However this was not determined to prove that HDC reduced re-offending but that the risk assessment process was effective. The results of the most recent research mentioned above will provide an important contribution to our knowledge of the impact of HDC.</p>

Any concerns that a local authority has not achieved best value should be addressed to the auditor in the first instance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1653W.8/1">An internationally agreed definition of what constitutes spending on (iii) adaptation to climate change does not currently exist, and the international financial institutions do not have publicly available estimates of their own spending in this area for the last two years. The Department for International Development (DFID) is working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to develop a methodology for collecting statistics from donors on support to adaptation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/2">DFID does, however, hold the following information on expenditure on (i) alternative sources of energy, and (ii) energy efficiency:</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/3" class="indent">The World Bank Group recently reported $476 million of lending to renewable energy projects, and $1,192 billion to energy efficiency for the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>. Disaggregated data are not available for the previous year. Together, this represents 35 per cent. of total World Bank Group energy sector lending for 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/4" class="indent">The Asian Development Bank's (ADB) investments in alternative sources of energy for the last two years are $121 million in 2007 and $1,152 billion in 2008. ADB's investments in energy efficiency for the last two years are $547 million in 2007 and $547 million in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/5" class="indent">The Inter-American Development Bank's (IADB) lending and investments in low carbon programmes, including alternative energy and energy efficiency, totalled $960 million in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/6" class="indent">For the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), data from 2007 (the only year for which we have accurate data) shows that of total energy sector lending of &euro;1.020 billion, 67 per cent. went to 'clean energy' activities, mainly energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1653W.8/7">It is not possible to state what percentage of spend by the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on clean energy projects is as a result of UK funding. MDB projects are funded through a variety of sources, including funds leveraged through their capital resources and lending and funding through concessional windows like the International Development Association (IDA), to which donors contribute directly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1655W.5/1">In June 2008 the UK Government launched &quot;Achieving Universal Access&quot; the UK's strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This reaffirms the UK's global leadership on AIDS, including through a commitment to spend &pound;6 billion over seven years to 2015 to strengthen health systems and services.

	<p pid="b.1655W.5/2">Preventing people from becoming infected with HIV is our best hope of stopping the epidemic and related illnesses. &quot;Achieving Universal Access&quot; sets out how the UK will intensify prevention efforts that have proven to be effective, such as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, family planning and reducing the harm from injecting drug use. The strategy recognises that an effective response to AIDS also requires action outside the health sector. The UK government is therefore committed to a multisectoral response to AIDS that includes action in education, social protection and justice.</p>

Given the complexities a simplified measure is shown in the following table. This shows the UK's dependence on imported gas over 15 years to 2008. A negative net import figure means the UK was a net exporter of gas. The final column shows that between the years 1996 and 2003 (inclusive) the UK was self-sufficient in gas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.2/1">Russia's decision to stem European gas supply had no direct impact on gas supply in the UK as the UK is estimated to receive less than 2 per cent. of its gas from Russia. However, the shortage of gas supplies to the continent was likely to have been the reason for the exports of gas from the UK to Europe through the Interconnector of, on average, 35 million cubic metres per day, in response to price signals. This was at a time of year when the UK would normally be importing through the Interconnector. The UK's diverse sources of gas supplies helped to ensure that gas supply in the UK continued to meet demand, which was high due to cold weather conditions prevailing at the time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.8/1">UK consumption of any gas sourced via the Ukraine (be it Russian or Ukrainian in origin) is negligible. Ukraine consumes its own domestic gas production with minute exports, but does act as a transit country for Russian gas entering the EU. There are only two routes to the UK for gas via the Ukraine. These are the Balgzand-Bacton pipeline from the Netherlands and the Bacton-Zeebrugge pipeline with Belgium. The physical origins of the gas through these pipelines are not available. It is possible that a very small amount of gas via the Ukraine finds its way across continental Europe to the UK, but given the gas pipeline infrastructure it is believed that most of the gas from the Netherlands is sourced from the Dutch sector of the North sea, and that most of the gas from Belgium is sourced from Norway via Zeepipe (which terminates at Zeebrugge).</p>

	<p pid="b.1668W.11/1">The strategic siting assessment is a process for identifying and assessing sites which are strategically suitable for the deployment of new nuclear power stations by the end of 2025. The Government believes that it is important to focus on sites which can come on stream in good time to contribute to our goals on climate change and energy security. 2025 provides sufficient focus to facilitate the achievement of these goals whilst avoiding an unnecessarily long list of potential sites which may not come on stream for some years. Should the need arise the Government will issue a second call for nominations for credible sites which might be deployed after 2025.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.11/2">The Government Response to Consultation on the SSA process and siting criteria, published in January this year set out the next steps, including nomination forms, guidance to nominators and the timetable of assessment. The deadline for nominations is <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>. The nominations will be published on the DECC website and there will be a month long period for public comment prior, and in addition, to public consultation later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1668W.11/3">In the consultation on the SSA process and siting criteria Government set out the proposal that the nomination window would be eight weeks. Having considered the responses to the consultation, the Government believes that an eight week window for nominations gives nominators sufficient time to absorb the changes to the criteria resulting from the consultation, to complete nominations and to perform their engagement activities. The Government did consider leaving time between the publication of the criteria in the Response and subsequently calling for nominations, but felt that this would introduce complexity into the nomination period. The Government's conclusions in relation to the nomination window are set out more fully in the Government Response to the SSA Consultation.</p>

We also want to make sure that IRENA works closely with, and avoids overlap and duplication with, other international bodies and organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership (REEEP). The IEA has a good understanding of the potential for renewable energy and its technology roadmaps published in its Energy Technologies Perspectives 2008 set out what needs to be done. The policy and analytical expertise of the IEA needs to be used by IRENA to accelerate deployment of renewable sources of energy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1678W.5/1">The Department has studied the &quot;Ear to Listen&quot; report, and feels there is merit in a number of the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1678W.5/2">The Department will be undertaking a consultation on giving pupils under 18 a right of appeal following their permanent exclusion from school, and as part of this will consult on a child's right of appeal in other related policy areas, including admissions and special education needs (SEN). The consultation will consider the type of support that pupils, particularly those with communication difficulties, might need in taking forward their right of appeal. In addition, following a recent consultation on handling parents' and young people's complaints about individual school issues, we will consider the place of mediation as part of the complaints handling process and how it could be used to best effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1678W.5/3">On the recommendation related to providing children with a suitable education, since September 2007 schools have been required to arrange a suitable full-time education for all pupils excluded from the sixth day of any period of fixed period exclusion of six days or longer. Local authorities are likewise required to arrange suitable full-time education from the sixth day of permanent exclusion. The term &quot;suitable&quot; education is not defined by law but should be suitable in relation to the individual pupil's needs and take account of any special educational needs. Parents should be notified of their child's continuing educational entitlement in the letter that notifies them of the exclusion and either that letter or a subsequent letter should provide them with detail about the provision, its address and start times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1678W.5/4">On the recommendation related to further investigating the reasons behind exclusions of children with SEN, as committed in the &quot;Children's Plan&quot;, we are already working to identify good practice in this area, and are about to begin a fact-finding study to determine further the factors which lead to high numbers of exclusions of children with SEN.</p>

	<p pid="b.1682W.9/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1682W.9/4" class="indent">Ofsted is a non-ministerial government department and its funding is provided by HM Treasury. Table A shows the total funding provided to Ofsted in each year since 1997, as well as Ofsted's total expenditure and expenditure related to inspection and regulation activity, including that on early years settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1682W.9/5" class="indent">Ofsted accounts refer to inspection costs under the category of total costs of inspection and regulation activity. The financial data in this response are derived from Ofsted's audited accounts using this wider definition, reflecting as consistently as possible the cost of inspection and regulation. The total programme cost of inspection and regulation activity includes only direct costs incurred by Ofsted in delivering inspection and regulation activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1682W.9/6" class="indent">Please note that Ofsted has undergone considerable change since the financial year 1997-98. From 1997-98 to 2000-01, Ofsted was primarily responsible for the inspection of schools, local education authorities and teacher training. As stated above, from 2001-02, Ofsted's remit expanded to include early years inspection and regulation. Since April 2007, Ofsted has also had responsibility for the inspection and regulation of care for children and young people, and the inspection of education and training for learners of all ages. Over the same period, improvements in the way we deliver inspection and regulation have enabled Ofsted to make substantial savings. These changes have affected the cost of early years regulation and inspection and year on year comparison of these costs. Further explanatory notes accompany the table below.</p>
	<p pid="b.1682W.9/7" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Rt Hon Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

There are other circumstances involving school closure which have been excluded from the table because replacement provision was established, for example in the case of a change to a school's religious character or an amalgamation of an infant and junior school to form a primary school.</p>

We also made a commitment in Aiming High for Young People: a 10-year strategy for positive activities (DCSF July 2007) to produce guidance for children's trusts and transport planners to encourage joined up planning and commissioning of local transport for young people. This guidance will be published in the spring and showcases a range of innovative transport solutions to accessing positive activities developed by local authorities and their partners.</p>

However, I recognise the importance of broadband access in rural areas and will be developing plans for a universal service commitment to be effective by 2012 as part of the Digital Britain report. We will set out our plans for the level of service which we believe should be universal and anticipate that this consideration will include options up to 2Mb/s.</p>

	<p pid="b.1706W.5/1">Issuing guidelines to electoral registration officers (EROs) on how to increase electoral registration falls within the remit of the Electoral Commission. The current guidelines, published in February 2008, include advice on the activities that EROs should undertake to comply with their duty to take all steps that are necessary to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries in connection with the canvass, making contact by such other means as the ERO thinks appropriate with a person who does not have an entry in the register, and inspecting any record that the ERO is permitted by law to inspect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1706W.5/2">The Government have not made an estimate of the number of people eligible to but, not registered to vote, in each region of the UK and there are currently no plans to commission research into low levels of registration. However, in their research report, &quot;Understanding Electoral Registration&quot;, published in September 2005, the Electoral Commission estimated that 3.5 million eligible electors were not registered to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1706W.5/3">Since this report was published the number of people registered to vote in UK as reported by the Office for National Statistics has continued to increase. Following the 2007 annual canvass the number of parliamentary electors grew by 307,669 to 45,082,854 and the number of local government electors grew by 463,340 to 45,920,503. In 2008, the number of parliamentary electors grew by 111,595 to 45,194,449 and the number of local government electors grew by 227,374 to 46,147,877.</p>

To this end, we have recently tabled amendments to the political parties and Elections Bill that will allow the Secretary of State to pilot data matching schemes under which public authorities will provide registration officers with information to assist them in maintaining an accurate and comprehensive register. In addition, we plan to introduce secondary legislation to enable EROs in areas where there are two tiers of local government to be able to access data held by the higher tier to help them identify individuals who are not registered to vote. This will mirror arrangements in place for EROs in single tier areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1706W.5/5">The Government have no current plans to produce a league table of electoral registration officers' performance in respect of registration rates. However, the performance standards-framework established by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 provides for the Electoral Commission to set and monitor performance standards for electoral administrators, including EROs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1706W.5/6">The Electoral Commission published a final set of performance standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain in July 2008. details of which have been laid before the House.

Member on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June 2008</phrase>,(Official Report, columns 999-1000W), funding for electoral registration activities such as advertising is included in the local authority formula grant issued by central Government. Once these funds are allocated, decisions on how they are utilised are a matter for the local authorities concerned. It is not known how much was spent in total or per elector for electoral registration in each local authority area, as these figures are not collected, and therefore no rankings are available. There has been no recent UK-wide assessment of the trends in the annual expenditure of local authority electoral registration officers. However, as part of its work in developing Performance Standards for electoral services, the Electoral Commission launched a financial information survey across Great Britain on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-10">10 September 2007</phrase>. Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers were asked to complete the survey and return it by <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-31">31 July 2008</phrase>. The Commission is currently analysing this information in conjunction with CIPFA (the Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accountants) and will publish results in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1711W.2/11">When the ECL scheme was first introduced, offenders released for the maximum of 18-days received their subsistence payments in instalments through the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), who make payments on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. Prisoners released for less than 18-days were paid in full by prisons on release. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-23">23 June 2008</phrase>, payment in instalments by DWP was extended to prisoners spending 15-days or more on ECL. From <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December</phrase>, payment in instalments by DWP has been further extended to offenders spending 8-days or more on ECL. The advantage of the system of payments through DWP is that prisoners receive their subsistence in instalments rather than in a single lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1711W.2/12">The administrative costs incurred in individual prisons in arranging payments cannot be separately identified as the work is carried out as part of the wider discharge process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1715W.3/1">The re-designate of HMP/YOI Drake Hall and HMP/YOI Morton Hall as closed prisons takes account of Baroness Corston's recommendation of the establishment of multi-functional units close to population centres. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-23">23 January 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-23.360"><i> Official Report</i>; column 360W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715W.3/2">The effect of the change allows for greater flexibility in the use of the estate; improving closeness to home and families for some women, allowing appropriate lifer and indeterminate sentenced women to be placed so as to better meet their needs, and in general enable more women to access the resettlement regimes available at the two prisons.</p>
