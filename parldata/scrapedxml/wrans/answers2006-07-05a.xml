	<p pid="a.1069W.6/2">The current development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Supervisory Board of the Galileo Joint Undertaking is established to ensure an adequate information flow and political control by member states of the implementation of the development phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.6/3">The Government are aware of the sensitive nature of some parts of Galileo. We continue to monitor the project closely. We have been careful to ensure that any agreements with partners in the programme that are not member states of the EU or ESA specifically exclude them from participation in all sensitive aspects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.6/4">Individual member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are responsible, under their own national and/or any international export control regimes&mdash;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime) and Wassenaar&mdash;of which they are signatories, for the control of strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required. For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assesses Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1074W.9/1">The Department has made substantial investment in road transport related schemes in Yorkshire during the first local transport plan period (2001-06) and will sustain this investment throughout the second period, which runs until 2011. This includes significant investment by the Highways Agency on the motorway and trunk road network in the Yorkshire and Humber region over the last five years. This high level of investment is set to continue with, for example, the innovative &pound;1.29 billion programme announced last year to reduce congestion on strategic routes in South and West Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.9/2">To enable better forward planning, the Government in July last year announced three year regional funding allocations to 2007-08 and planning assumptions for 2008-09 to 2015-16, amounting to over &pound;1 billion for the Yorkshire and Humber region. These cover major (greater than &pound;5 million) local transport plan schemes and major Highways Agency schemes other than on those on roads of the greatest strategic national and international importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074W.9/3">On rail investment, new services have been introduced between Sheffield and Leeds, and new rolling stock provided to increase capacity on routes in to Leeds and Bradford. In addition, the Secretary of State, through the rail re-franchising programme, has sought and will continue to seek improvements to rail links between the towns and cities of Yorkshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.1076W.2/1">The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Wales Office was an early adopter of pre-legislative scrutiny and the national health service (Wales) Bill was scrutinised during the 2001-02 session. Since then, a further three Bills introduced by my Department were published in draft for consultation: the Public Audit (Wales) Bill; the Transport (Wales) Bill; and, the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill. A public consultation has always been conducted in parallel with the pre-legislative scrutiny process. My Department has also introduced two further Bills. My Department had conducted a public consultation jointly with the Welsh Assembly on the principles underlying the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Bill, and as there was general support for the proposals, further scrutiny was not considered necessary, and would only have further delayed the legislation. The Government of Wales Bill, which is currently before the House, was introduced without pre-legislative scrutiny, because the proposals need to be implemented for the May 2007 Assembly elections. Extensive consultation was however undertaken on the White Paper, which was published well in advance of this Bill being introduced. All of the Department's formal consultations also abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation.</p>

In contrast to the EUWI, the EUWF is a funding mechanism. The Water Facility has made &euro;500 million available for water and sanitation and aims to leverage additional funds from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.3/8">Progress to date has been slow, mainly because of lengthy procurement procedures, but approximately &euro;230 million is currently being committed to co-fund 97 projects, valued overall at &euro;412 million. An initial analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010 approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &euro;500 million of the Water Facility will be committed by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1079W.6/1">The UK strongly supports the Global Fund and wants it to be effective in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Global Fund recently revised its resource needs to an estimated US$5.5 billion for 2006 and 2007. There is a current funding gap of US$2.1 billion for 2006 and 2007. Of this, US$1 billion is needed this year to fund a new round of grants which was launched by the board in April. The Mid-Term Review of the Global Fund (4-<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>) will review the fund's performance and mobilise extra resources for 2006-07 to fill the funding gap. The UK has committed &pound;359 million to the Global Fund (2002-08). We have doubled our pledge for 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million in each of those years. This means that our overall share of support for the Global Fund at around 5 per cent. is consistent with our support over the 2001-05 period. The UK is meeting its fair share&mdash;other donors need to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.6/2">The Global Fund is only one part of our contribution to tackling AIDS, TB and malaria. The UK is committed to spend at least &pound;1.5 billion on the global AIDS response over three years (2006-08), including our support to the Global Fund. We also provide support to the Roll Back Malaria (&pound;7 million pledged to 2008) and Stop TB initiatives (over &pound;49 million pledged from 1999 to 2007), as well as direct support to countries to help tackle diseases of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.6/3">The UK will continue to encourage other donors including the private sector to support the Global Fund. The Prime Minister has also recently made clear that we are committed to working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage the development of long term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to help ensure that predictable support is available from donors to support them. This will be key in helping countries strengthen their health systems and to be able to more effectively combat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080W.2/2">DFID does not track long-term health sector spending because we provide pooled financial support for basic health services. But, as the Prime Minister recently made clear, we are committed to making good on our G8 promises, and a key part of this is to support developing countries with long-term, sustainable financing for health. We are currently working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage development of long-term&mdash;10 year&mdash;health plans and to ensure that predictable support is available from donors for them. This long-term support will provide poor countries with the security to make long-term investments and meet the costs of salaries, drugs, infrastructure and training. We have also increased our funding to multilateral organisations supporting countries strengthen their health services, including to the Global Fund and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). We are spearheading innovative efforts to secure significant additional resources for essential health care through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, with the first bond issue due in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1081W.3/1">The main impact of recent military action has been to the loss of electrical power following damage to Gaza's only power plant. The closure of the Nahal Oz oil pipeline from <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-02">2 July</phrase> and greater difficulty in movement due to the destruction of three bridges providing north-south access have also had an effect.

It is difficult for anyone from the south to access to the main referral hospital in Gaza city in the north.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081W.3/2">The Gaza economy has been severely constrained since March, when Hamas assumed power. Since then, the access point for exports from Gaza has been closed, trade with Israel has all but stopped and a very limited number of public sector salaries have been paid. Most of the water supply to Gaza is pumped from wells. Supplies are being continued by connecting pumps to generators, but there is concern that fuel for these generators is dependent on the Nahal Oz pipeline remaining open.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082W.4/1">The House provides child care vouchers to the value of &pound;8 per child per day. The Commission favours the child care voucher scheme because of its flexibility and availability to staff wherever they are based. Vouchers are available for children up to and including age 11. The vouchers can be used to pay registered child minders, nurseries, playgroups, cr&egrave;ches, nannies, holiday play schemes for school age children, and close relatives who care for children, thus allowing staff a range of choices when making their child care arrangements. Information can be found on the parliamentary intranet. The scheme is currently under review to ensure the House continues to offer the most appropriate arrangements for the majority of staff.</p>

The difference in cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around &pound;90,000 of additional works expenditure was incurred directly by the House sitting in each September period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1096W.5/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Department holds regular meetings with representatives of the principal stakeholder groups for our policy areas and with relevant experts. Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the department's formal consultation which abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are alerted to the fact that a formal consultation is taking place. As required by the code, the DCMS then gives feedback on the responses received and on how the consultation process influenced the policy decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099W.6/2">When the UK forces' current deployment to Afghanistan is complete, there will be around 5,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan, of which the majority will be under the command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) with a small number, including the training teams in Kabul and a number of staff officers remaining under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) control. Our detachment of Harrier GR7s will be available to support both ISAF and OEF. These are separate and distinct missions, although troops deployed on OEF may also act in support of the NATO mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.3/2">At the recent UK-France summit on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June</phrase>, the United Kingdom and France re-affirmed their shared commitment to act together against evolving threats and challenges to our security and defence and to that of our allies and partners. An important element of this is the long-standing military co-operation between our armed forces, who currently work together on operations and regular exercises, and in the fields of concepts, doctrine and training. This collaboration is undertaken both bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as NATO and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.3/3">Our armed forces co-operate on operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia. Other recent interaction includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.3/4" class="indent">Routine integration of Royal Navy and French Navy ships into respective Task Group deployments, most recently in the UK Naval Task Group Deployment AQUILA 2006 and the French Carrier Task Group</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.3/8" class="indent">Agreement to co-operate in establishing a network of Peace Support' Training Centres in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.3/9">This close and highly valued military relationship is fostered through regular dialogue at all levels from the Chief of the Defence Staff downwards and underpinned by bilateral agreements and letters of intent. There is also a network of exchange and liaison officers across all three services. The continuation of our excellent military relationship with France will remain important as we work together to tackle the challenges ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.1109W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence's requirement for tetanus immunoglobulin is low. It is only used to treat patients with wounds who have not received the normal tetanus vaccine. Very few such cases arise in our armed forces since MOD aims to ensure that all its personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations prior to deployment. The only people who would need it would therefore be any service personnel who missed their vaccination and any non-UK individuals who are treated in our medical facilities in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1109W.5/2">There is a temporary UK national shortage of tetanus immunoglobulin. We do not currently have any centrally held defence stocks in the UK. However, with the exception of designated field hospitals, units are not required to hold tetanus immunoglobulin, although some do at the discretion of individual medical officers. We are not aware of any stock shortfall of tetanus immunoglobulin in the designated field hospitals and we do not expect a shortfall to arise before supplies become available again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1109W.5/3">Routine tetanus immunisation is given by the combined low dose diphtheria/tetanus/inactivated polio (Td/IPV) triple booster which is administered at trainee entrant establishments. Personnel who require a further booster dose because they have sustained an injury from which they could be at risk of an acute tetanus infection can also be given the Td/IPV triple booster. Supplies of the Td/IPV triple booster are not affected by the national shortage of immunoglobulin, and there are currently no known shortages in naval or military units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1109W.5/4">In light of the national shortage, the MOD has repeated recent Department of Health guidance on tetanus immunoglobulin to defence medical personnel, advising them of the necessary action they will need to take. This will mainly involve ensuring that all personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111W.2/1">I have never been informed that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra. No witness statements saying that &quot;wetting&quot; is official policy for dealing with looters in Basra were disclosed to Crown counsel either prior to the trial of soldiers relating to the death of an Iraqi youth in the Shatt al Basra River or since the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/2">I am told that during the trial three witnesses gave evidence as to a practice of putting detained looters in water which appears to refer to &quot;wetting&quot;. Mr. Daniel O'Connell formerly a Lieutenant Platoon Commander said there was a practice of making looters wet which was discussed at the company &quot;O&quot; Group meetings; however it was not formal policy. He indicated that he had witnessed one such incident of looters being put into a dyke where they were waist high and in no real danger.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/3">Major Peter MacMullen the Company Commander said that the looting problem was discussed at Battle group meetings and that he was aware of a range of sanctions that were being deployed, which included people being put into water so that they would be left cold, wet and miserable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/4">Mr. Niall Brennan, formerly the Company Second in Command, said he knew of other companies throwing looters into the Shatt al Arab River. He did not consider they were in danger of drowning and claimed that he did not consider this dangerous because it involved the use of minimum force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/5">Despite this evidence, coming from higher up the chain of command, the evidence given at trial made it clear that neither the commanders on the ground nor the individual soldiers were aware of such a policy or practice (officially sanctioned or otherwise). Not one of the accused raised this in their witness statements or interviews under caution. None of the members of their platoon or section who gave evidence knew of such a policy or had even heard of looters being put into water-knowledge of the policy, if one did indeed exist, was restricted to the middle echelons of the chain of command only.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111W.2/6">During the course of the trial a statement was obtained from the then Battle Group Commander, Brigadier Riddle-Webster, who said that the practice of &quot;wetting&quot; had never been discussed and had he heard of such a practice he would have put a stop to it immediately since he regarded it as illegal, dangerous and immoral. However due to legal reasons this was not put before the Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.5/1">There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by Defra, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all cases the relevant containment and operating requirements laid down by HSE/Defra would need to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.5/2">Provisions in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 place an obligation on managers of laboratories and other premises holding specified pathogens or toxins to notify the authorities and to comply with the security requirements which the police may impose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.5/3">There is a wide range of legitimate uses to which DNA sequences may be put and the imposition of onerous controls could discourage valuable scientific research and industry use. The Government do not believe that it is necessary to require suppliers of DNA sequences to be licensed or for them to screen customers or check the intended use of the sequences. But we will continue to monitor the situation as the relevant technologies develop.</p>

In respect of the numbers of those persons specified in the question who may be on the electoral register, I explained in my previous answer on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1045W, that this information is not collected. Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual. Currently, it is an offence to fail to supply information to the ERO and knowingly supply false information on the annual canvass form.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.2/3">The Electoral Administration Bill, strengthens the objection process and creates a new offence of supplying false information of any kind to an ERO, or failing to supply information, in connection with registration, at any time. The electoral register does not specify the immigration or asylum status of individuals entered on it; however, the addition of a &quot;nationality&quot; box in the registration form does provide an opportunity for EROs to determine the eligibility of an applicant for inclusion in the register on the basis of their stated nationality.</p>

	<p pid="a.1115W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.3/2">A key success criterion for Apprenticeships from the outset has been that the programme should be open to all young people regardless of gender, ethnic origin or disability and it should provide equal access particularly to those from potentially socially disadvantaged or marginalised groups. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has worked hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships Approvals Group (independently chaired by the Skills for Business Network ie Sector Skills Council led) have a key role to play in ensuring that Apprenticeship Frameworks make all reasonable adjustments to maximise participation from diverse groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.3/3">The LSC maintain a website detailing starts, leavers and completions of individual frameworks <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/">http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/partners/frameworks/apprenticeshipsdata/</a>. However, published figures for completions are not broken down by geographical area or sex. For this reason Mark Haysom, the council's Chief Executive, has written to my hon. Friend with this information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
