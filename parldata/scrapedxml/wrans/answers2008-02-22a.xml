	<p pid="a.1027W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase> the Government published their initial response to a public consultation carried out as part of the 2007 review of export control legislation. The response can be viewed on BERR's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1027W.3/4">The initial response commits the Government to (1) extending export laws to control the brokering and trafficking, by UK persons anywhere in the world, of small arms, man portable air defence systems (MANPADs), and those cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians; (2) extending controls on the export and trading of torture equipment to include sting sticks; (3) starting ED negotiations to introduce a new EU-wide torture end use control, which would enable all EU states to make licensable&mdash;and therefore refuse&mdash;the export of any equipment believed to be for use in acts of torture; and (4) rationalising the licensing treatment of long range missiles and unmanned air vehicles.</p>

There are considerable benefits to be had&mdash;customers changing supplier and payment type (eg credit to direct debit) should see an average saving of around &pound;130, however, andean make larger savings of up to &pound;200.</p>

	<p pid="a.1029W.9/1">I refer my hon. Friend to the answer to her earlier question on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 805W, which detailed the financial support to the furniture sector since 1990. Since that time we have continued to provide funding towards UK First, the furniture industry forum, and will continue to do so until March 2008. UK Trade and Investment continues to help the furniture sector succeed overseas with support under the Tradeshow Access Programme and the sector forms a component of the strategy to market the UK's creative industries overseas. In the regions Advantage West Midlands has set up Furniture West Midlands to support the sector and Furniture Link, managed by Business Link London, is helping furniture companies to develop business opportunities. In addition the Government Businesslink service offers a range of support solutions to companies in all sectors. Support is also available through the Manufacturing Advisory Service and under the Technology Programme if the industry can address the technology priorities identified by the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

There may also be domestic microgeneration projects which remain off-grid due to the property owners' choice. The Department does not hold statistics relating to these projects. As I understand it, larger distributed energy installations that use a private wire network for the distribution and supply of electricity tend to maintain a grid connection, for example to maintain supply in the event of a failure of their own generating plant. These installations could operate in what is known as &quot;island-mode&quot;, using their own generation in the event of a cut in grid supply, but we are not aware of any that choose to operate off grid at all times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033W.8/3">In addition, there are some renewable energy developments, such as renewable heat projects, that do not generate electricity and so do not require connection to the grid.</p>

	<p pid="a.1044W.2/1">&pound;182 million has been made available over the period of the 2004 Spending Review, up to 2007-08, for gap funding payments to registered social landlords taking negatively valued housing stock from local authorities under large scale voluntary transfer arrangements. These grant payment arrangements enable sufficient private finance to be levered in to enable full Decent Homes investment programmes to be undertaken by RSLs after transfer. We have currently entered into 28 gap funding arrangements with RSLs. Payments to those RSLs under these arrangements are made from the Department's Capital DEL budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.2/2">Details of the gap funding grant payments to date and current 2007-08 forecasts by local authority area are in the following table. The table does not include possible grant payments in the current year in respect of gap funding arrangements with RSLs that have yet to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044W.2/3">We estimate that about &pound;2 billion of private finance is likely to be levered in to support Decent Homes investment programmes by RSLs taking housing stock, where gap funding arrangements are in place.</p>

It also suggests that this additional amount of renewables as a result of the policy could be equivalent to around 1 per cent. of the total UK electricity demand by 2020. The modelling did not disaggregate capacity from on-site renewables.</p>

I have placed copies of JSP 584 (New Financial Assistance Regulations for Reservists and their employers) and JSP 712 (Working with databases) in the Library of the House. JSP 712 provided guidance on working with databases for all the IT systems that were currently in use in 2001.

Since then our high commission in Gaborone, working closely with EU partners, has maintained regular contact with the Government of Botswana on the issue of the San community. We continue to encourage the Government of Botswana to take an inclusive approach to finding a sustainable solution to the future use of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, underlining the importance of dialogue and negotiation with the San (Bushmen).</p>

We have concerns about this draft law; in particular the provisions set out in section five in relation to apostasy, heresy and witchcraft, which stipulate that these offences should be punishable by death. If the draft is adopted, it would be the first time that the death penalty is set down in Iran's criminal law for apostasy. We are concerned that these articles would constitute a violation of Iran's international human rights obligations, such as the right to freedom of religion and belief, and the provision that in countries that retain death penalty, the sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes. We are particularly concerned about the impact the new law, if adopted, would have on non-Muslim faiths in Iran. We are following developments closely and are currently discussing with our EU partners what representations to make on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1058W.2/1">The Government remain very concerned by the situation of the Baha'i community in Iran. The Baha'i faith is not recognised as an official minority religion under the Iranian Constitution and Iranian Baha'is face systematic discrimination and persecution. We regularly raise our concerns about the treatment of Baha'is with the Iranian authorities, bilaterally and through the EU. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-22">22 January</phrase>, the EU presidency, with strong UK support, raised specific concerns about the treatment of the Baha'i community in Iran during a meeting with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this meeting the EU expressed opposition to all forms of discrimination, in particular regarding freedom of religion. Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February</phrase>, the EU presidency issued a public statement expressing concern about the deteriorating situation of the Baha'i minority. We have also taken action at the UN; in December 2007 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution about the human rights situation in Iran. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the UK and all other EU member states, expressed very serious concern about increasing discrimination against religious minorities in Iran and the situation of the Baha'is in particular. We will continue to urge the Iranian authorities to uphold the right to freedom of religion and belief as described in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a state party.</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.2/1">Women invited to participate in the national health service cervical screening programme need to understand the potential benefits and harms in doing so and to be able to make an informed choice about whether or not they wish to take part in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.2/2">This is why all eligible women receive a national information leaflet on cervical screening, Cervical Screening - The Facts. This leaflet is included with each screening invitation and contains comprehensive and understandable information about cervical screening. It is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.2/4">The cancer reform strategy noted concerns about the fall in the number of young women taking up their invitation to be screened. That is why the NHS cancer screening programme have commissioned the Improvement Foundation to undertake work at a local level targeting this age group. The lessons learned from this work, due in 2009, will be shared with strategic health authorities and local screening programmes to develop best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.2/5">The NHS cancer screening programmes' press office is developing an information pack to be issued to all local screening programmes and also developing a public relations strategy, including articles in appropriate media publications, posters etc. In addition, Cancer Research UK have commissioned research on this issue, which we will monitor closely and will share the findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.2/6">Continued local action in this area is also essential and we will continue to monitor levels of cervical screening coverage through the office for national statistics/information centre annual cervical screening statistical bulletin.</p>

The guidance is intended to help all health professionals recognise the warning signs of forced marriage, understand the danger faced by women and to respond to their needs efficiently and effectively. As well as practical information, the guide contains a poster that can be displayed, and which gives the telephone number of the Forced Marriage Unit's confidential helpline.</p>

(187207)</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.6/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.6/6" class="indent">APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.6/7" class="indent">The table attached, shows the numbers of working age in employment who were not born in the UK and were resident in the county of Cambridgeshire, Peterborough UA and North East Cambridgeshire constituency, for the twelve month periods ending in June for 2005, 2006, 2007 from the APS. The July to June 2007 APS dataset is the most recent which is currently available. The table also shows the numbers of non-UK born persons as a percentage of all working age in employment, in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.6/8" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082W.6/9" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

DFID, however, remains abreast of the situation and a representative from the British Embassy in Jakarta is currently visiting East Timor. The Government of East Timor generates an increasing income from oil revenues, and a multi-donor trust fund has been established to assist the Government's delivery of the East Timor National Development Plan (NDP). DFID provided &pound;1 million to this trust fund in 2006-07 and again in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-22">22 February 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/3" class="indent"><i> </i>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what proportion of children were living with (a) both birth parents, (b) one birth parent and (c) no birth parents in each year since 1987, broken down by social class. (187143)</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/4" class="indent">This information is only available from the 2001 Census. It is not possible to readily identify whether children are living with their birth parents from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/5" class="indent">The question asks for the proportion of children by the number of birth parents in the family. In the 2001 Census the number of children living with both birth parents can be obtained from the number of children living in couple families that are not stepfamilies plus the number of children living in stepfamilies who are children of both parents. The number of children living with one birth parent can be obtained from the number of children living in couple stepfamilies who are the stepchild of one of the partners plus the number of children living in lone parent families. All other children living in households have been considered to be living with neither birth parent. This group will include children living with a step-parent only and those living with other relatives but not a birth parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/6" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the proportion of dependent children in households in England and Wales by number of birth parents and the NS-SEC of the household reference person, according to the 2001 Census. The table refers to children living in households only, because we cannot provide the requested information for children living in communal establishments. According to the 2001 Census, the number of dependent children in communal establishments in England and Wales was 47,643.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/7" class="indent">From 2001 the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) has been used for all official statistics and surveys as a replacement for social class. In some cases, the household reference person may not necessarily be a birth parent of the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107W.0/8" class="indent">Comparable data from the 1991 Census are not available because stepfamilies were not separately identified in 1991. Family data are available on an annual basis for recent years from the General Household Survey (GHS) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). However, these surveys do not readily identify children in families by the number of birth parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111W.2/2">395 tonnes of gold were sold from the reserves between July 1999 and March 2002 and re-invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets. Other central banks have adopted similar policies. The total proceeds were around $3.5 billion, equivalent to around &pound;2.3 billion (using exchange rates at the time of the sales). On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-15">15 February 2008</phrase>, the current market value of the gold sold was around $11.5 billion, equivalent to around &pound;5.8 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117W.12/1">The Government are committed to tackling avoidance and in recent years has taken a number of steps to identify and close down opportunities for avoidance. For example, they have introduced a Disclosure Regime which requires those designing and selling tax avoidance schemes to provide HM Revenue and Customs with details of those schemes within five days of them being first marketed. On receipt, the schemes are assessed for tax risk and consideration whether an urgent announcement of a legislative fix is needed to prevent extensive use of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1123W.3/2"><i> </i>Direct comparisons of levels of State Pensions between countries can be misleading, as differences may be due to underlying economic conditions or policy choices, such as different costs faced by pensioners and the presence of other policies targeting the welfare of elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/3">In contrast with many other European countries, the UK's policy on retirement income provision envisages the state providing benefits that act as a foundation for private saving, and not the state as being the sole provider. The UK state pension system is also structured differently than that in other European countries, in that it targets spending on those on lower incomes, rather than aiming at providing the same level of generosity to all income groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/4">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, &quot;Pensions At A Glance 2007&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase>, confirms that the UK targets the greatest resources on those most in need and that the UK has a very redistributive pension system that is more generous towards people on lower incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/5">Eurostat data indicate that the median income of UK persons aged 65+ (adjusted for cost of living differences), are much higher than the EU average and is the fifth highest in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/6">The OECD also noted that 'changes to the public pension system since 1997 have increased future benefits for low earners', with average pensions for this income group up by seven percentage points, while</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/7" class="indent">'recent reforms in France, Germany and Japan have cut benefits by around 15-20 percent'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/8">The average pension promise in 16 OECD countries studied was cut by 22 per cent. In only two countries&mdash;Hungary and the United Kingdom&mdash;did pension promises increase on average.</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/9">This Government are committed to further improve this situation. In fact, the latest assessment of the European Commission on UK pension policy, published at the end of January, endorsed our recent pension reforms, stating that</p>
	<p pid="a.1123W.3/10" class="indent">&quot;these reforms will ensure that recent achievements in reducing pensioner poverty are secure into the future&quot;.</p>
