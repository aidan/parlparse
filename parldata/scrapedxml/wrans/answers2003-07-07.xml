	<p pid=".560W.3/1">Current scientific knowledge indicates that many of the world's populations of sharks are under threat from fishing activities. The targeting of sharks for their fins alone adds to this threat. In view of concern over this threat to shark populations, this Department has been working to protect sharks at a national and international level. In addition to putting in place measures to protect the basking shark under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, we have secured strengthened protection for this species at an international level under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.3/2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) produced in 1999 an International Plan of Action for the conservation and management of sharks, to which the European Commission signed up on behalf of the European Union. We have been pressing the Commission for action to follow this up and are pleased that work will begin shortly on the development and implementation of a Community Plan of Action.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.3/3">Discussions on a Commission regulation to restrict the practice of shark finning have recently concluded. While it was not possible to achieve the complete ban on this practice that we would have preferred, we were able to secure some important concessions, including additional control clauses and a commitment to a complete review of the regulation in the light of the development of the Community Plan of Action.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.6/1">I am grateful to Laura Tyson and her group for her thought-provoking report. It shows the clear benefits for business of diversity at board level. It is vital for UK business that they look more widely for the best candidates. I also agree that it is important to monitor change and highlight best practice examples of building diverse and meritocratic boards.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.6/2">I welcome the report's three recommendations:</p>
	<p pid=".568W.6/3">1. Rigorous and transparent Non-Executive Director Selection Processes&mdash;This is being taken forward as part of the Financial Reporting Council's work on amending the Combined Code, following Derek Higgs' Review.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.6/4">2. An initiative to bring together companies and training providers to establish guidelines to ensure that training programmes for directors are providing what is needed, and that useful information about such programmes is easily accessible on a timely basis.</p>
	<p pid=".568W.6/5">3. An initiative to monitor both progress on achieving rigorous and transparent processes for NED appointments and progress on building more diverse boardrooms. I agree that it would be useful to monitor progress and disseminate best practice and we will be considering how best this should be done. But it is clear this is not the end of the story. We must see real results in broadening the talent pool of directors appointed to our boardrooms and we are also looking at what further work the government can do to help business achieve this.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.2/1">In its first term (1997&ndash;2001), the Government introduced a foundation of minimum standards in the workplace. Every employee now has, for example, the right to a minimum wage, paid holidays, rest breaks, time off for family emergencies, and a cap on the working week. Trade unions have the right to recognition by the employer where a majority of the workforce want it. Part-time workers have the same rights as their full-time colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/2">In its second term, the Government are building on all these measures in their drive to raise productivity, including a range of changes to support families and to make work pay. The Government have improved existing maternity rights and introduced paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time. For example, the payment period of Statutory Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance has been extended to 26 weeks. They have also introduced a right for working parents with children under six, or disabled children under 18, to request flexible working. This new right builds on existing best practice and further enforces our aim to promote greater dialogue in the workplace to find flexible solutions which suit both employers and employees.</p>
	<p pid=".569W.2/3">Recently both Houses have passed regulations to tackle discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion or belief, which will take effect in December 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".570W.11/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-02">2 May 2003</phrase>, my hon. Friend the then Minister for consumer affairs, announced that the DTI will no longer collect statistics on the causes and nature of home and leisure accidents. Following increased pressure on resources and the need to focus on the Department's core priorities, hard decisions had to be made on what to stop. The collection of accident statistics did not fit with these priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".570W.11/2">It is not true to say that DTI is withdrawing all free literature or from home safety campaigns. What we have done is to focus our limited resources onto areas where we believe DTI can make an impact and that are in line with the DTI's aim of promoting prosperity for all. The Department continues to provide information to support work undertaken by practitioners in areas such as falls prevention and fireworks safety.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.2/1">We believe that the most effective way to discourage firms from moving abroad is to create the best environment for business success in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.2/2">We assist firms in a variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.2/3">We provide practical advice and support to enable every company to be the best it can be. For example the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS), launched last year, provides expert advice and consultancy to help companies drive up their value added. On average companies who have participated in MAS in-depth consultancy projects have seen added value of nearly &pound;90,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.2/4">We support firms in the research and development activities that will keep them ahead of the competition. For example, an R&amp;D tax credit for large and middle-sized companies was introduced this year to complement the tax credit for small and medium-sized companies introduced in budget 2000. In 2001&ndash;02, the first year for which figures are available, somewhere in the region of 3,000 small and medium-sized companies made claims under the tax credit scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".573W.2/5">Each year we invest around &pound;1 billion in support for the businesses that create Britain's wealth. We support the investment work of the regional development agencies for example through regional selective assistance through which we offer selective grants to firms investing in the assisted areas and creating or safeguarding jobs. In England in 2002&ndash;03, &pound;934 million of business investment was secured as a result of 192 RSA grants totalling &pound;108 million. This is expected to create over 10,000 new jobs and safeguard a further 9,000. Financial assistance to companies in Wales is a devolved matter for the National Assembly for Wales. Data on financial assistance given under the Industrial Development Act 1982, including regional selective assistance, is contained in the Annual Report to Parliament for 2002&ndash;03 which was laid on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June</phrase>.</p>

While the military authorities have allowed a delegation from Amnesty International to visit Burma, this has not led to an improvement in the human rights situation. I am especially concerned about the situation in light of recent arrests and detentions in Burma. We will continue to press bilaterally with the Burmese regime and in international fora for a rapid improvement in the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.6/1">The UK established diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in December 2000 and opened an Embassy in Pyongyang in July 2001. Our contacts with the DPRK government in the period leading up to these decisions convinced us that it made sense to encourage the DPRK's integration into the international community, rather than see it remain isolated. Our diplomatic relationship has allowed us to keep open channels of communication which enable us to address the DPRK authorities frequently and directly on issues of international concern, pre-eminently non-proliferation and human rights. But we have told North Korea that there can be no normal relationship until the nuclear issue has been resolved.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/1">The majority of personnel deployed on Operation Telic benefited from the Operational Welfare Package (OWP), as opposed to LOA, and were also paid either the Longer Service Separated Allowance (LSSA) or in the case of Royal Navy personnel the Longer Service at Sea Bonus (LSSB). The current tiered rates of LSSA are Basic rate &pound;5.39, Middle rate &pound;8.43 and Higher rate &pound;11.49 per qualified person per day, taxable. The current tiered rates of LSSB are &pound;4.05, &pound;7.74 and &pound;10.32 per qualified person per day, taxable. LSSB has different qualifying criteria and hence the different tiered rates.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/2">Full rates of LOA are not paid when personnel are in receipt of the OWP. However, those individuals deployed from permanent overseas bases which attract LOA (such as Germany) retained residual rates of LOA for their permanent duty station throughout the operational deployment. The specific rates of residual LOA paid to each entitled Serviceman or woman are based on his/her rank, marital status and permanent overseas duty station.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.2/1">Almost 1.4 million have been sold in their first two years on the market.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.2/2">Stakeholder pensions impact on pension provision goes wider than its take-up. Charges on personal pensions have fallen by around a quarter since 1999 to around stakeholder pensions' 1 per cent. a year level. In addition, as an alternative to offering their staff access to a stakeholder pension scheme, some employers have widened access to their occupational pension schemes and others have set up group personal pension plans with an employer contribution. We recognise that more needs to be done to improve take-up of private pensions in general, including stakeholder pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.2/3">That is why we have set up an employer task force to develop and promote the employers' role in pension provision; established an independent pensions commission to report regularly to the Secretary of State on how the current voluntary approach to private pension provision is working; are developing an information pack for employers to make it clearer and easier for them to promote the benefits of their pension schemes; are framing initiatives to test the provision of advice and information at the workplace on saving for retirement; and have provided that members of money-purchase pension schemes receive annual illustrations, in today's prices, of what pension they might receive when they retire.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.2/4">Research by the Association of British Insurers shows that where an employer contributes to a stakeholder pension scheme take-up by employees is greatly increased.</p>

	<p pid=".604W.5/2">All Structural Fund programmes, including those funded by the European Social Fund (ESF), are currently being evaluated in all European Union countries. The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for evaluating the England Objective 3 and Great Britain Equal programmes. It also co-ordinates the evaluation of the Objective 3 Community Support Framework for Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/3">These programmes are part of a system of active labour market policies that, together with steady economic growth, has contributed to 1.5 million more people into work since 1997, of which 850,000 are additional women in employment.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/4">The evaluation of England Objective 3 will include the issues of employment, skill development, the employment of women and information and communications technologies (ICT). It will be informed by monitoring data, surveys of former participants and companies, and specially commissioned research projects. The latter will include, for example, research into the programme's effectiveness in promoting equal opportunities and ICT training. The evaluation will not examine the benefits of ESF in terms of GDP. While there have been positive results, it is unlikely that the programme is large enough to have a measurable effect on GDP. The evaluation will, however, examine how the programme adds value to domestic programmes, for example, by looking at how it interacts with the New Deal. There is a separate evaluation of Equal, which is testing new ways of combating discrimination and inequality in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/5">The Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government are undertaking similar evaluations of Objective 3 in Scotland and Wales respectively. The Department will bring together the England, Scotland and Wales Objective 3 evaluations, in an evaluation of the overarching Great Britain Community Support Framework.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/6">The Department will send its evaluation reports to the European Commission at the end of 2003 and place copies in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.0/1">As my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, explained to my hon. Friend when they met on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-12">12 June</phrase>, we are concerned about instances when the employer sponsoring a pension scheme becomes insolvent and the pension scheme winds up underfunded.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/2">We are very much aware of the serious impact this has on workers and their families. Indeed, it is because of cases like this that we are strengthening member protection and introducing a Pension Protection Fund to protect the long term security of occupational pension scheme members. However, as we have also made clear, while we will listen to constructive proposals we do not want to give false hope.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/3">Information on pension schemes is held by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR) that is maintained by the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA). The PSR does not collect information about the number of pension schemes where the employer sponsoring the pension scheme is insolvent. Data on the number of occupational pension schemes recorded by the Registry as wound up since 1997 is provided in the table. The figures relate to the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.0/17" class="italic">Notes</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/18">1. The PSR is not designed or intended to provide a comprehensive or continuous statistical record of the status of schemes. The PSR registers schemes for tracing purposes and collects the levy from pension schemes, including those in the process of winding up. New scheme data is being reported to the PSR on a continuous basis. Therefore, the figures are subject to continuous revision. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify of any change.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/19">2. A wound up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has completed winding up procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/20">3. The data in the table relate to defined benefit and defined contribution private sector occupational pension schemes. In addition to data on occupational schemes, the Registry also collects data on personal pension and public sector schemes. These schemes, however, are not included in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.0/21">4. The reason the figures for <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1998-03-31">31 March 1998</phrase> are so much larger than for other years is that from 1997, the rules governing which schemes had a levy liability were changed&mdash;all schemes with two or more members became liable whereas previously, only schemes with two or more active members were liable. So, in 1997, the Pension Schemes Registry issued levy requests to a large number of schemes, only to discover that a number of them had already wound up. All these schemes were recorded as having completed wind up in 1997&ndash;98 even if, in fact, they had wound up earlier. Therefore, we know these figures are inflated, but not by how much. This is because the figures were not collected for the purpose of recording the numbers of scheme wind ups.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.8/1">Preparations for the implementation of pension credit from October 2003 are well advanced. We have recruited extra staff and invested in new infrastructure to meet the additional demands of the new entitlement and we are making best use of the phased take-on period leading up to October to prove our systems and learn from experience before the main take-on begins. An existing tried and tested computer system will be used to make payments from October. The freephone application line is already fully operational and taking advance applications. We are also working with our partner organisations at national and local level to encourage eligible people to take up their entitlement. Our phased approach to take-on will ensure that the Pension Service is able to deliver pension credit successfully while continuing to deliver its existing range of services.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.3/3">The Special Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello, is now playing a full part in discussions in Iraq on the implementation of UNSCR 1483 and is working closely with US Ambassador Bremer CPA, other senior coalition representatives (e.g. UK Special Representative, John Sawers) and emerging Iraqi leaders.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.3/4">In addition to the UN's humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq, UK, US and UN officials are exploring possibilities for UN involvement in policing, law and order, legal reform, human rights, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of military forces (DDR), and support for an Iraqi Interim Administration when formed, including help in drafting a new constitution and preparing for elections. We very much welcome the expertise the UN can bring to the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.8/1">The funding of schools is a shared responsibility of central and local Government. In 2003&ndash;04, there have been a number of very significant pressures on LEA and school spending. Nationally, the additional resources provided for education more than match those pressures. However, changes to the distribution formula for Education Formula Spending, together with the ending of a substantial body of ring-fenced grants from my Department's Standards Fund, have meant that different LEAs and schools have received a wide range of year-on-year increases in overall support for education.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.8/2">The department has taken steps through an additional grant of &pound;28 million to ensure that all LEAs have at least a minimum increase of 3.2 per cent. per pupil, in addition to taking account of the effect of the Standards Fund and teachers' pension changes. We have also provided a special grant costing &pound;11 million to 18 London LEAs to help them fund this year's increases in London weighting. The allocations of these grants are shown in the following table. In addition, LEAs and schools will be given the additional flexibility to use their devolved formula capital funding from the Department to support revenue expenditure. The decision to use a school's capital funding in this way will need to be made jointly by the school and its LEA, and should only be taken in those circumstances where failure to do so would lead to excessive instability within that school.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.2/1">The Aided Pupil Scheme, part of the Music and Dance Scheme, is an annually assessed means-tested scheme that required parents to make a contribution towards fees according to their means. Gross income from all sources is assessed so that all parents are placed on a similar footing wherever they live. The amount (if any) parents pay is on a sliding scale linked to total income and the scales are constructed so that the least well-off families benefit most. No deductions are made in respect of outgoings such as mortgage repayments, pension contributions and the normal day to day costs of living when assessing a family's total gross income. The method of income assessment ensures that a proper balance is struck between the amount parents can realistically be expected to contribute and the amount of taxpayers' money that is provided for the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.5/1">The Department does not have this information. However, the issue of fire safety is of primary importance.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.5/2">If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.5/3">To help schools manage fire safety, the Department published &quot;Managing School Facilities Guide 6, Fire Safety&quot;, in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risks of both accidental and malicious fires occurring, and advises on how to identify hazards and carry out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.5/4">In addition, officials from the Department sit on the Arson in Schools Working Group, a group of experts representing the insurance industry, the fire and police services, local authorities and Government Departments. The group exists to research and promote ways of reducing malicious fires in schools. One of its outputs has been the publication of the guide &quot;How to Combat Arson in Schools&quot;, copies of which have been sent to all schools in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".633W.3/1">Pursuant to the reply by my hon. Friend of <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-17">17 June 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-06-17.134"><i>Official Report,</i> column 134</phrase>, clarification is required to the answer which sated that the standard tuition fee contribution for full-time home and EU students of &pound;1,125 is estimated to raise around &pound;887 million for English institutions and around &pound;60 million for Welsh institutions. The reply does not make clear that the sum of &pound;456 million, given as the public contribution to fees in England for 2003&ndash;04, includes public funding of approximately &pound;40 million allocated to support postgraduate study through the Research Councils. Correspondingly, the sum of &pound;31 million given as the public contribution to fees in Wales for 2003&ndash;04, includes public funding of approximately &pound;3 million allocated to support postgraduate study through the Research Councils.</p>
	<p pid=".633W.3/2">An amended table is set out below:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".633W.3/5"> <th>2003&ndash;04 Estimate</th> <th>England(&pound; millions)</th> <th>Wales(&pound; millions)</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".633W.3/8"> <td>Public contributions to fees</td> <td>416</td> <td>28</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".633W.3/9"> <td>Private contributions towards the cost of tuition</td> <td>431</td> <td>29</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".633W.3/10"> <td>Total</td> <td>847</td> <td>57</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".633W.3/13">The amount of private contribution to fees (&pound;431 milliion in England) is not altered by this and so there is no change to the figure of 90,000 places, referred to in the earlier answer, that would be lost if the private contribution were to be abolished.</p>

	<p pid=".635W.6/1">Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office regulates the use of protected animals in any experimental or other scientific procedure that may have the effect of causing that animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. The Home Office does not regulate the use of animals in experiments or procedures not covered by the 1986 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/2">The 1986 Act provides a strong regulatory framework and an effective means by which to balance the need to protect animals from unnecessary suffering with the legitimate requirements of the scientific community (and the public) for medical and other essential research and safety testing. The system set up under the 1986 Act has proved flexible and responsive to changing circumstances and requirements, and its enabling provisions allow changes to be made quickly and easily by administrative means, or using secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/3">The Animal Procedures Committee (APC) review of the operation of the Act, published in its Annual Report for 1997, concluded that the Act provides a good framework for a well-regulated and responsible use of animals in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom. A number of recommendations arising from the APC review to enhance the effectiveness of the Act have subsequently been implemented and further improvements are continually being sought. The APC has also recently provided advice on the cost benefit assessment conducted under by section 5(4) of the 1986 Act, which we will consider carefully. Section 24 of the 1986 Act is also currently being reviewed. Proposals are also awaited from the European Commission for the revision of Directive 86/609/EEC, which the 1986 Act transposes into United Kingdom law. These may result in the need for the 1986 Act to be amended in due course. However, we have no immediate plans for legislative change.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.6/2">EC law provides that EU member states shall admit an EU national on production of his valid passport or identity card. The UK would therefore expect Cypriot nationals to carry their passports or identity cards when visiting the UK. However, in very exceptional circumstances, such as if an EU national has lost his passport while travelling, the UK may admit EU nationals who can prove their nationality and identity by other means.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.2/1">In recent years the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and other legislation has been amended so that the minimum rank for taking a number of important policing decisions has been reduced from superintendent to inspector. These include taking fingerprints, intimate and non-intimate samples without consent, authorising intimate searches and delaying a detained person's right to let someone know they have been arrested.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.2/2">New legislation has also given additional responsibilities to inspectors. For example, they are able to authorise the searching or examination of a detained person to ascertain their identity and to deny independent custody visitors access to a detained person. In certain circumstances they can authorise surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) and approve searches for criminal cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).</p>
	<p pid=".641W.2/3">The way in which those powers are exercised, and the precise responsibilities given to officers at different ranks, depend on local decisions taken by individual chief constables and other police commanders. However, there has certainly been a very positive trend towards devolving decision making and responsibility from force headquarters to local managers.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.5/1">Airwave is the new TETRA radio system for police forces in England, Wales and Scotland. The network is the responsibility of Airwave 02, the Private Finance Initiative partner for Airwave. It is estimated that around 3,000 masts will be required to provide coverage for Airwave across the country. Final figures for the number of new masts in each constabulary will not be available until the end of the rollout, as adjustments will continue to be made across the system in order to optimise coverage. Airwave is currently available to 14 forces and the rollout is expected to be complete by mid-2005.</p>

	<p pid=".648W.3/1">Liberating the Talents provides a new framework for nursing in primary care to support the delivery of the NHS Plan. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to determine how they wish to implement the recommendations locally. PCTs are being supported by the Department to take forward Liberating the Talents through a range of work programmes. Workshops have been held in 26 of the 28 strategic health authorities for 290 PCTs, core elements of the framework have been included in the new general medical services contract and a guide one stablishing nurses with special interests has been published. The NHS University is piloting a learning programme to support nurses to provide first contact care, a new model of nurse-led managed care for patients at risk is being piloted in ten PCTs and we have set upinitiatives to support recruitment and retention of nurses in primary care.</p>

A further table in the National Report for England and Wales &quot;Table S027 (Households with a person with a limiting long-term illness (LLTI) and their age by number of carers in household and economic activity)&quot;, which you might find useful is also broken down by local authority and is on the same CD-ROM.</p>

	<p pid=".652W.5/1">Pain management is an important component of care. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report on pain services, published in April 2000, highlighted variations in access to pain services throughout the country. It made recommendations to national health service acute trusts and commissioners on how pain services should be delivered in order to reduce variations to access. It recommended that primary care trust commissioners should review local provision of pain services, looking particularly at the provision of more specialised treatments on a networked basis. In this review, account should be taken of the needs of both adults and children, and include patients with acute pain resulting from sudden illness or accident, as well as post-operative pain and chronic pain. Trusts should also agree with commissioners the services and resources which are appropriate to meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.5/2">The Department of Health does not collect information on those trusts which do not provide a chronic pain service. The CSAG report showed that, in April 2000, chronic pain services existed in 215 acute NHS trusts, which amounts to 86 per cent. of acute trusts in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid=".654W.2/1">It will be for the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) to determine what constitutes a reasonable time under clause 82 (formerly 85) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill. The purpose of this clause is to allow the CSCI to conduct an inspection of a premise at any time of the full 24-hour day so long as it is justifiable given the needs of the inspection. Whether it would be reasonable to give advance notice of an individual inspection would be a decision that the CSCI would have to make in the light of the particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".654W.2/2">CSCI would be able to enter premises that it reasonably believed were being used in connection with the provision of English local authority social services. It is not proposed that the Bill will define the term &quot;reasonably believed&quot;. Essentially, CSCI will have to establish that, at the time of entry to the premises, they genuinely believed on reasonable grounds that the premises were being used to provide local authority social services. CSCI's power and authority to inspect is derived from clause 82 of the Bill. Clause 82(3) of the Bill, requires a person proposing to exercise rights of inspection to produce a duly authenticated document showing their right to inspect. This will be proof of their identity and position within CSCI.</p>

	<p pid=".656W.5/1">My hon. Friend, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, (Ms Blears) met with representatives of the Health Food Manufacturer's Association to discuss the Food Supplements Directive on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-09">9 June 2003</phrase>. Issues covered in discussion fell under four main headings: nutrients and nutrient sources missing from Annexes I and II in the Food Supplements Directive and requirements for safety dossiers; the recently-published report of the expert group on vitamins and minerals and advice on safe upper levels therein; future setting of maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements at European Union level; and plans for future action on chromium picolinate.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.5/2">The Government, represented by the Food Standards Agency, is pressing the European Food Safety Authority for an urgent, substantive meeting with relevant parties to discuss dossier requirements and expects a positive response soon. The European Commission supports this move. The objectives of such a meeting would be to explain problems faced by the United Kingdom food supplements industry resulting from the omission of nutrients and nutrient sources from the Annexes to the Food Supplements Directive; and to explore the potential for simplified dossiers to be presented for vitamin and mineral sources with a long history of safe use and the potential for read-across between dossiers for substances which are likely to have similar toxicological profiles</p>
	<p pid=".656W.5/3">Further, to ensure that the Government's policy objectives for regulation of food supplements in the EU are met, the Government continues to press for maximum limits for nutrients in food supplements to be based on thorough risk assessment and set at levels which protect public health, but which neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. The Government continues to press this view strongly with other Member States at every opportunity.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.6/1">The Government has established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to improve the safety of national health service patient care by promoting an open and fair culture and by introducing a national reporting and learning system for patient safety incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.6/2">The NPSA has completed an extensive testing and development phase for its national reporting and learning system, which has involved work with 39 NHS trusts in England and Wales, reflecting a range of healthcare settings, and wide consultation with experts in data collection, risk management and statistical analysis. The NPSA will begin to roll out the reporting system nationally from the autumn of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.6/3">A vital part of the NPSA's work is to identify key areas of concern for patient safety in the NHS and to develop solutions to prevent errors being repeated.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.6/4">As one area for potential patient safety solutions, the NPSA is examining the role of manual and technological solutions in ensuring that patients receive the healthcare which is intended for them. It has commissioned research to identify best practice already in place in the NHS, and explore the potential to transfer technologies in use in other sectors, such as biometrics (for example, using iris recognition or thumb printing as a unique identifier). The national reporting and learning system will, in time, enable the NPSA to develop a much clearer national picture of the extent of patient mismatching.</p>
