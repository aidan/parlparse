The DFT is also currently assessing bids for the Nottingham Ring Road and Hucknall Town Centre schemes as part of the Development pool competition.

	<p pid="d.579W.2/1">In Ethiopia, DFID's investment to the agriculture sector focuses mainly on building the capacity of Ethiopian Government agricultural implementing agencies. For example, DFID supports the Ethiopian Government's Household Asset Building Programme, which improves the capacity of microfinance institutions in providing access to credit for some of the poorest farmers in Ethiopia. To date, 2,300 households have benefitted. DFID investments in the Protection of Basic Services and the Productive Safety Net Programme are also building the capacity of the agricultural extension workers in the crop production, livestock, and natural resource management and contribute to improving the natural resource base of smallholder farmers. Over five million smallholder farmers received this support. In addition, through DFID's humanitarian programme, 26,000 households received seeds and fertilizer, and 9,000 obtained animal health care support.</p>
	<p pid="d.579W.2/2">In Somalia, DFID supports the Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Bank implemented SEEDS (Sustainable Employment and Economic Development Somalia) programme, which is currently operational in Somali land and plans to expand into the severe affected areas of Puntland. SEEDS will directly lead to the creation of about 45,000 jobs, improvements in the investment climate and additional market-related investment. Due to agriculture and related trade being the mainstay of the Somali economy, almost all these jobs will be in agriculture directly or agriculture-related.</p>

	<p pid="d.581W.0/1">Since 2006 the UK has succeeded in increasing enrolment in six states by 35% and in getting 423,000 more girls into school in northern Nigeria where traditionally girls have not been encouraged to go to school. Through two programmes, over 4,000 head teachers have been trained in effective school management, 4,000 school-based management committees have been trained to monitor their schools and hold schools and teachers more to account, 500 inspectors have been trained and 3,000 scholarships awarded to poor women from rural areas to attend teacher training to return as teachers in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.581W.0/2">While encouraged by this progress, the UK is not complacent in the face of the extreme education challenges in Nigeria. The UK is therefore scaling up its effort to ensure more children, particularly girls, get access to education of ever-improving quality. The UK is therefore developing plans to help a further 800,000 children, of which 600,000 will be girls, into school by 2015 and to providing 5,000 further scholarships for women teachers.</p>

The Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information, an intergovernmental body with worldwide membership, has been the main means by which G20 objectives have been delivered in this area, for example by encouraging the signing of Tax Information Exchange Agreements and conducting peer reviews of countries' implementation of international standards. The Global Forum is due to give its latest report to G20 Heads of Government at the Cannes summit in November.</p>

As part of this programme the NRC is providing legal representation to the village of Khan al Ahmar to prevent the demolition of the school and houses.

Over 2,600 households have completed the full process to remain in their homes since the scheme began and almost 39,000 households with mortgage difficulties have received free advice from their local authority through the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.586W.3/2">The Government reviewed the scheme in July 2010, and again in February 2011, and made changes to improve the value for money by reducing unit costs to ensure that the scheme can help as many households as possible. The scheme will be kept under review to ensure it continues to provide value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.586W.3/3">The spending review confirmed over &#163;220 million funding for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme from April 2011 to deliver a two year scheme to provide on-going support to households facing repossession. The scheme is delivered by local authorities in partnership with registered social landlords and the Homes and Communities Agency. It is for local authorities to prioritise those households who are most appropriate for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme.</p>

It is too early in what is a very long term process to assess our contribution but I am confident that we are focusing on areas where we can add most value.</p>

	<p pid="d.593W.2/1">As set out in the Department's Legacy Plan, published in December 2010, the Government are committed to securing a lasting legacy from the Games which include ensuring that the Olympic Park can be developed as one of the principal drivers of regeneration in East London. The main departmental priorities and areas of spending are set out as follows, which are part of a wider commitment by Government to make the most of the Games.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/2">We will be delivering a sporting legacy for young people, and bringing back a culture of competitive sport in schools. Sport England is investing up to &#163;35.5 million of lottery funding from now until March 2015 in the School Games which is a key part of the Government's plans for a lasting sporting legacy. In addition, DCMS Exchequer funding of &#163;2 million will be provided in 2011-12. We have also allocated &#163;135 million of lottery funding towards Places, People, Play&#8212;the London 2012 mass participation legacy programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/3">We are also committed to ensuring that we deliver a lasting tourism legacy. The Prime Minister recently announced the launch of the GREAT campaign, which is designed to promote the UK abroad, and aims to deliver long-term economic benefits from the unprecedented level of interest generated by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The campaign aims to generate at least &#163;1 billion in Olympic business boost and attract 4 million extra visitors. In addition, over the next four years VisitBritain will be running the &quot;You're Invited&quot; programme, which will capitalise on the international interest in the recent Royal Wedding, as well as next year's Diamond Jubilee and Olympic and Paralympic Games, and showcase Britain to the world. The programme is backed by a &#163;100 million marketing fund, funded by the public and private sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/4">Olympic venues and investment in training facilities will support local communities after the Games. We are preserving Whole Sport Plans and holding sports to account on meeting challenging participation targets.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/5">75p of every pound the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is spending on the venues and infrastructure construction programme for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games is an investment in long-term regeneration. Therefore a considerable physical legacy from the Games has already been largely delivered in the host boroughs. The Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) of the ODA programme, including risks, scope changes and inflation is currently &#163;7.25 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/6">The job of transforming Olympic Park venues and infrastructure for legacy use after the Games has been passed from the ODA to the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC).</p>
	<p pid="d.593W.2/7">With regard to the Cultural Olympiad, we have contributed &#163;661,000 to part-fund a network of Creative Programmers in the English Regions, and &#163;3.06 million to help ensure the success of the London 2012 Festival&#8212;the finale of the Cultural Olympiad taking place from <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-21">21 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-09">9 September 2012</phrase>. The funding is for a small number of additional events that will be managed by LOCOC. The details of the events are being finalised, and will be announced this autumn.</p>

	<p pid="d.598W.5/1">The cost of a visit visa for the UK is significantly below the cost of processing an application. These costs are associated with securing the border and the Home Office only recover just over half of those. The fee charged helps to support the investment we make to ensure visas are issued safely, securely and quickly. Very few people choose their holiday purely on the basis of the cost of a visa, but rather on whether the overall cost of the trip (including much bigger items such as travel or accommodation) represents good overall value. That&#8217;s why econometric analysis of available data undertaken by the Home Office has indicated that visa fee levels have a minimal impact on application volumes. None the less it would be wrong to ignore the issue, which is why the Government&#8217;s Tourism Policy (published in March) aims to improve productivity across the entire visitor economy and, of course, the cost and convenience of visas are part of this.</p>
	<p pid="d.598W.5/2">As a result, improving the pre-entry visa experience is a key part of the Government&#8217;s new Tourism Policy. I am working closely with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to look at simplifying and improving the process of arranging a visa. For example, from the end of this year, the UKBA is moving to online visa processing and has already published visa application guidance in five key foreign languages.</p>

HM Treasury was also not involved in this decision for the same reason.

	<p pid="d.606W.2/4">UK specific inventories for the sources of black carbon are not produced by DEFRA at present. However, analysis carried out by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) estimates that in 2005 the major source categories making up 93% of UK black carbon emissions were: diesel vehicles for both on and off-road use (77%); flaring of oil and gas industry wastes (6.8%); domestic solid fuel burning (6.4%); and barbeque use (2.1%). As a result of existing measures to reduce emissions of particulate matter from these sectors, IIASA estimates that UK emissions will reduce significantly between 2005 and 2020, from 29.1 kilo tonnes to 8.3 kilo tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="d.615W.8/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.615W.8/2">Litigation matters in the UK are generally dealt with by the Treasury Solicitors Department, and there is little requirement for recourse to external solicitors. Barristers were engaged during the financial year 2010-11 for a variety of litigation matters. The majority of these barristers were appointed from the Attorney-General's Panel or were First Treasury Counsel. On the minority of occasions where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office required the services of specialist barristers not on the Panel, nominations were sought from the Attorney-General's Office. In these cases agreement of their hourly rates must be reached before a nomination is made. Guidance on the Attorney-General's Panels, including details of hourly rates, can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="d.615W.8/3"><a href="http://www.tsol.gov.uk/attorney_generals_panel_of_counsel.htm">http://www.tsol.gov.uk/attorney_generals_panel_of_counsel.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="d.615W.8/4">In relation to recourse to legal advice and representation on non-contentious matters (for example contracts or property matters) during 2010-11, in cases where the Treasury Solicitors Department was not used, external solicitors were chosen through a tender process in accordance with the Legal Services Framework. Legal firms which took part in the tender process will have competed on the basis of the quality of the service offered and the price. There is also scope for further competition on price before a firm is chosen. This process ensures that Government Departments are able to obtain legal advice cost-effectively.</p>

	<p pid="d.617W.11/1">Political transition in Egypt has opened up the potential for long needed reform to stimulate entrepreneurship and greater prosperity. The short-term impact, however, has been a sharp decline in growth due to disrupted economic activity, a weakened investment climate and a significant decline in foreign direct investment and tourism. Egypt will need to navigate through the economic downturn, with limited room for public spending and rising borrowing costs. The immediate challenge for the Government of Egypt is to fulfil public expectations and build social cohesion while preserving macro-economic stability. Restoring fiscal health and more inclusive growth which generates new jobs will be critical over the medium term.</p>

However Egypt has seen dramatic changes this year and significant challenges remain. As part of wider reform in Egypt, we support labour law reform and are monitoring the situation. In March 2011, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, raised our concerns about new Egyptian laws to outlaw protests and strikes with the Egyptian Finance Minister. Staff from the British embassy in Cairo have also discussed the possibility of establishing an independent Trade Union Congress in Egypt with local trade unionists in Cairo.</p>

This figure includes the estimate of &#163;195,000 provided in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-28">28 February 2011</phrase> and comprises the estimated staff costs incurred by those officials engaged full-time to prepare and support the passage of the Bill, the costs charged to the FCO by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for the same purpose, and administrative expenditure such as travel costs incurred engaging with the EU institutions on the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.620W.9/2">Both the assembly of a team of officials and the use of the services of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, for which a charge is made, are standard practice for Whitehall Departments in preparing legislation.

	<p pid="d.623W.0/1">The relationship between the UK and Ghana is strong and vibrant. It is rooted in our long-standing economic, political and cultural connections, our shared values, and the deep links between our peoples. The UK has historically played a key role in the country and we continue to work closely with the Ghanaians politically, commercially and through development aid.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.0/2">Politically, the UK enjoys close working relationships with all parts of the Ghanaian Government, co-operating on a range of issues, including migration, counter-narcotics and maritime security. Commercially, there are a number of large UK investments in the Ghanaian energy and telecommunications sectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.0/3">The UK is the second largest bilateral aid donor to Ghana and fourth largest overall. The UK has committed &#163;85 million in development assistance in the current financial year. This will rise to &#163;100 million in financial year 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="d.623W.3/1">The UK has long called for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit's immediate and unconditional release. We welcome the agreement between Israel and Hamas announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-11">11 October</phrase> to release him as part of a prisoner exchange. Holding him in captivity has been utterly unjustified from the beginning and yet it has gone on for five long years. We are pleased that this long overdue development is finally taking place.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.3/2">During his visit in June, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, met the father of Gilad Shalit and conveyed our sympathies and concerns. Baroness Ashton, EU High Representative, met the parents on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July</phrase> and issued a statement confirming that she would continue to raise this issue in all her meetings, on behalf of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-22">22 June</phrase>, I released the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.3/4">&#8220;On the fifth anniversary of the kidnap of Israeli Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit, we remember his family and call again for his immediate release. For five years Gilad Shalit's parents, Noam and Aviva, have been waiting for his return and praying that each day should be the last day of his captivity. It is unacceptable that Gilad Shalit is being held by Hamas without any access to the Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.3/5">Hamas must immediately allow a representative of the Red Cross to visit him. The last sign of life was received on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-02">2 October 2009</phrase>. Gilad Shalit's family have been waiting for almost two years for another such message. It is difficult to imagine the pain and anguish they must feel. My thoughts are very much with Gilad and his family on this day. I call again for Hamas to release Gilad Shalit immediately and unconditionally.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.623W.3/6">Mr Shalit's long captivity has been painful for his family and I hope that he will be reunited with them as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="d.625W.8/1">UN and EU sanctions against Iran have specifically allowed the construction and operation of the Bushehr power reactor. We have always respected Iran&#8217;s right to a peaceful civilian nuclear programme as long as it meets its international obligations and responsibilities. The Bushehr project underlines the fact that Iran does not need to pursue illegal activities in order to enjoy the benefits of nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid="d.625W.8/2">But it should be of serious concern that as Bushehr becomes operational, Iran will be the only country with a significant nuclear programme outside the convention on nuclear safety. Iran&#8217;s isolation means its nuclear programme falls short on safety in some key respects. The convention on nuclear safety is as system of mutual oversight that sets international benchmarks on the design, construction and operation of reactors. We are pleased that Russian experts are working to ensure Bushehr is operated safely, but full co-operation with the international community is the key to Iran accessing the best international expertise and realising the full potential of a safe, secure and economically viable nuclear power programme.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), most recently met with the Leader of the Opposition of Israel, Tzipi Livni, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-06">6 October 2011</phrase>. Speaking after the meeting, he issued the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="d.626W.5/2">&#8220;I was delighted to welcome Ms Livni to London at a critical moment for the Middle East. It was an appalling situation when political abuse of our legal procedures prevented people like Mrs Livni from travelling legitimately to the UK. We have dealt with this urgently as we promised to on coming to office. The UK will continue to honour our international obligations and make sure that people who have committed some of the most awful crimes&#8212;wherever in the world they took place&#8212;can be brought to justice in our courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.626W.5/3">Today's meeting showed the warmth and strength of our bilateral relations. Israel is an important ally and we will continue to work together to face common threats such as the Iranian nuclear programme. We discussed the importance of building support for a two state solution that leads to a lasting peace in the Middle East. I made clear my desire to see Israel secure now and in the future, alongside a Palestinian state, and my belief that both Israelis and Palestinians should return to talks in line with the Quartet Statement.&#8221;</p>

We further underlined our serious concern at the dangerous rhetoric President Mutharika has used against civil society, which has the potential to incite further violence. While HMG takes no partisan position in Malawian politics, we will continue to put pressure on the Government of Malawi to respect their international human rights commitments, and we intend to step up our support to civil society organisations in Malawi that promote accountability, transparency and respect for human rights.</p>

	<p pid="d.637W.0/10">There were 1,770 cases as at June 2011 where the parent with care was resident in Reading West constituency. Of these cases, 1,030 received a child maintenance payment in the quarter to June 2011 out of 1,310 cases where maintenance was due. This leaves 280 cases which did not receive a maintenance payment.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/11">There were 1,870 cases as at June 2011 where the non-resident parent was resident in Reading West constituency. Of these cases, 1,130 made a child maintenance payment in the quarter to June 2011 out of 1,430 cases where maintenance was due. This leaves 300 cases which did not make a maintenance payment.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/12">Please note a proportion of these cases will be the same caseload where both the non-resident parent and the parent with care are resident in Reading West constituency. Caseload figures include cases administered on the CS2 and CSCS computer systems as well as cases administered off-system.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/13">Failure to pay child maintenance is not a criminal offence, so parents can not be prosecuted. However, where a non-resident parent fails to pay maintenance, there are a number of enforcement actions available. Money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's earnings if the non-resident parent is employed, money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's bank or building society account, or action can be taken through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/14">The most serious forms of enforcement are commitment to prison or disqualification from driving. The decision whether to implement, and the length of the order, is at the discretion of a Magistrates' Court (or Sheriff in Scotland) where they are satisfied that a non-resident parent has &#8220;wilfully refused or culpably neglected&#8221; to pay child maintenance - but this is not a criminal sanction.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/15">Page 23 of the June 2011 QSS shows enforcement actions carried out by the Child Support Agency. It is not possible to break these figures specifically for those non-resident parents who have failed to pay maintenance for children residing in Reading West.</p>
	<p pid="d.637W.0/16">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.640W.8/1">The Department of Work and Pensions keeps in regular contact with the Scottish Government on the subject of welfare reform at both ministerial and official levels. For example, universal credit programme officials are working jointly with both the Scottish Government and with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, as well as wider Scottish stakeholders, on the delivery implications of universal credit in Scotland. The Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are also both members of the Universal Credit Senior Stakeholder Board, which provides advice and guidance to the Programme Board. This enables Scotland to share knowledge, experience and insights to inform the thinking of the Board and to support design, development and implementation. The views and advice of the group are represented at the Programme Board to inform decision making on issues including the delivery model.</p>
	<p pid="d.640W.8/2">Universal credit will be delivered by DWP&#8212;drawing on the expertise of HMRC and local authorities. As DWP start to build the organisation to deliver universal credit, and we have yet to settle on the precise detail, and select the right people with the right capability it is likely some of those skills will exist within local authorities. We will therefore always look to include local authority staff in our thinking. In relation to the longer term delivery of universal credit, we will continue to work with colleagues in HM Revenue and Customs and Local Authorities to test new ways of working and impact ongoing delivery model design at both a national and local level. Our aim is to work collaboratively to enable the decision making process and deliver optimal value.</p>

We have a number of laws in place which make it a criminal offence to use threatening words or behaviour and or to display, publish or distribute any written material with intent to stir up hatred on the grounds of race, religion or sexual orientation. These laws apply equally to online material and our courts have convicted offenders for such offences.</p>

	<p pid="d.651W.8/1">Data for selected offences involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument have been collected by the Home Office since April 2007. From these data, it is not possible to identify which offences specifically involved the use of a knife.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/2">In 2007-08, police forces in England and Wales recorded 25,548 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument for a select group of offences. These offences were: homicide, attempted murder, grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, GBH without intent and robbery.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/3">In 2008-09, the offence coverage was expanded to also include actual bodily harm (ABH), threats to kill, sexual assault and rape offences. Therefore figures are not comparable with those offences recorded in 2007-08. In 2008-09, police forces in England and Wales recorded 36,347 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument. The corresponding figure for 2009-10 was 33,774 offences.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/4">A 2009 audit of how bottle and glass offences were recorded in the knife and sharp instrument data collection identified that some forces were including unbroken bottle and glass offences in their returns, which should have been outside the scope of this collection. The 2008-09 and 2009-10 data above include these offences for four police forces. One of these forces, West Midlands police, subsequently changed its recording practice in April 2010 and now excludes these offences. As such, data for England and Wales for 2010-11 are not comparable to those for 2008-09 and 2009-10. In 2010-11; police forces in England and Wales recorded 32,714 offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument.</p>
	<p pid="d.651W.8/5">Comparable figures for 2008-09 to 2010-11 can be obtained only by excluding West Midlands from the total. On this basis, total figures for offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument in England and Wales (excluding West Midlands) are as follows: 2008-09&#8212;32,641 offences, 2009-10&#8212;30,549 offences and 2010-11&#8212;29,696 offences.</p>

Member with details of actual aggregate spending relating to the competitions held for HMP Birmingham, HMP Buckley Hall, HMP Doncaster, HMP Featherstone 2 and HMP Wellingborough, The Ministry of Justice does not hold the requested information for each of the individual competitions for the five establishments.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/2">Estimated or forecast spending on the prison competitions for HMP Birmingham, HMP Buckley Hall, HMP Doncaster, HMP Featherstone 2 and HMP Wellingborough, together with underpinning caveats and assumptions, is detailed as follows. All costs are given to two significant figures.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/3">(A) For their contribution to the work on the competitions for the five prisons named above, we forecast that the combined spending of Ministry of Justice Procurement and Ministry of Justice ICT will be:</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/4">(i) &#163;1,070,000 on staff;</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/5">(ii) &#163;0 on travel and subsistence; and</p>

	<p pid="d.668W.2/7">Operational input to supplier dialogue and evaluation phase have been excluded from this cost model.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/8">(B) The overall agreed value of the Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit for prison competitions was &#163;1,100,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/9">An agreed value was used in bidding, as the cost of the Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit was not identified separately by expenditure or by Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit itself within the accounts. No local cost tracking was undertaken. Delays in the bidding process added costs to the Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit, although the work undertaken could not be directly attributed to the above bids.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/10">Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit costs for HMP Wellingborough and HMP Doncaster ceased when MoJ Procurement stopped developing the relevant bids. Work on HMP Birmingham and HMP Featherstone 2 stopped when the announcement of contract award for these two prisons was made on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. Some support costs, which have not been quantified, have been incurred in the mobilisation phase at HMP Buckley Hall.</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/11">(C) For their contribution to the work on the competitions for the five prisons named above, we forecast that the combined spending of NOMS Business and Service Development Group, Estates, and NOMS ICT will be:</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/12">(i) &#163;1,300,000 on staff;</p>
	<p pid="d.668W.2/13">(ii) &#163;70,000 on travel and subsistence; and</p>

	<p pid="d.676W.5/2">For estimates of aggregated costs associated with the above prison competitions, I refer the right hon. Member to my response to his question of today.</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/3">Estimated or forecast spending on the prison competitions for HMP Birmingham, HMP Buckley Hall, HMP Doncaster, HMP Featherstone 2 and HMP Wellingborough, together with underpinning caveats and assumptions, is detailed as follows. All costs are given to two significant figures.</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/4">(A) For their contribution to the work on the competitions for the five prisons named above, we forecast that the combined spending of Ministry of Justice Procurement and Ministry of Justice ICT will be:</p>

	<p pid="d.676W.5/6">(ii) &#163;0 on travel and subsistence; and</p>

	<p pid="d.676W.5/8">Operational input to supplier dialogue and evaluation phase have been excluded from this cost model.</p>

	<p pid="d.676W.5/10">An agreed value was used in bidding, as the cost of the Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit was not identified separately by expenditure or by Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit itself within the accounts. No local cost tracking was undertaken. Delays in the bidding process added costs to the Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit, although the work undertaken could not be directly attributed to the above bids.</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/11">Public Sector Bids Unit/Business Development Unit costs for HMP Wellingborough and HMP Doncaster ceased when MoJ Procurement stopped developing the relevant bids. Work on HMP Birmingham and HMP Featherstone 2 stopped when the announcement of contract award for these two prisons was made on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. Some support costs, which have not been quantified, have been incurred in the mobilisation phase at HMP Buckley Hall.</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/12">(C) For their contribution to the work on the competitions for the five prisons named above, we forecast that the combined spending of NOMS Business and Service Development Group, Estates, and NOMS ICT will be:</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/13">(i) &#163;1,300,000 on staff;</p>
	<p pid="d.676W.5/14">(ii) &#163;70,000 on travel and subsistence;</p>

	<p pid="d.678W.2/1">The restrictions placed on industrial action by prison officers by section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (as amended) apply in both public sector and privately contracted prisons. This means that prison custody officers in private sector prisons are unable to take strike action.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.2/2">The Prison Service Pay Review Body makes recommendations to the Government for the pay of a defined group of public sector prison service staff. Private contractors have separate pay determination processes for their staff. Any compensatory measures for the restriction of staff&#8217;s ability to strike would be at the discretion of the private contractor.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.2/3">Contingency arrangements for operating privately-run prisons in the event of unlawful industrial action are the responsibility of the private contractor.</p>

	<p pid="d.678W.5/1">Probation Trusts were put in place between 2008 and 2010, following the implementation of the Offender Management Act 2007 and replaced the former Probation Boards. Financial year 2007-08 falls prior to the existence of Trusts. Figures for Boards and Trusts in financial years prior to April 2010 are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.678W.5/2">Figures compiled from annual net operating costs reported in the NOMS Agency annual accounts and supporting data for Probation Boards and those Trusts set up in 2008-09, show total spend of &#163;897 million (of which &#163;112 million relates to Trusts), and for 2009-10 total spend of &#163;899 million (of which &#163;194 million relates to Trusts).</p>

	<p pid="d.678W.5/4">The overall budget for Probation was &#163;864 million in 2010-11 and &#163;820 million in 2011-12. The following table sets out budget allocations for each Probation Trust in 2010-11 and contract values for financial year 2011-12 as agreed with each Probation Trust. It should be noted that, in addition to these amounts, some funds were held centrally for specific offender related initiatives. These are not embedded in the budget and contract values and therefore excluded from the table. Individual amounts may vary throughout the year, but are shown as at the start of the financial year. Probation Trusts may also receive income from elsewhere. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163; million.</p>

Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, inquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face-to-face doorstep canvassers. There will also be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission and we are testing data matching to identify people missing from the register and looking at how we can increase the choices people have over how to register, including greater use of online registration.</p>

It is an offence at present for anyone not to provide information when required to do so by an electoral registration officer (ERO), for example, in response to the household canvass form. The Government propose to retain this offence under the new system, however, it is not proposed to create a new offence for an individual failing to respond to an invitation to register.

	<p pid="d.732W.2/1">The Government are keen to make it easier to run a voluntary group, charity or social enterprise. For example the recently released Unshackling Good Neighbours report by Lord Hodgson has put forward a raft of recommendations to address the level of bureaucracy that civil society organisations and volunteers face. The &#163;30 million Community First programme aims to encourage more social action in neighbourhoods with significant deprivation and low social capital. It will look to help start more neighbourhood groups and revitalise existing groups and be a catalyst for community action. In July we launched the &#163;30 million Transforming Local Infrastructure programme which aims to transform the support provided to frontline civil society organisations by mainly supporting local infrastructure and volunteering infrastructure organisations to rationalise and transform.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.2/2">We are also working on a completely new legal structure for charities&#8212;the first incorporated legal structure designed specifically with the needs of charities in mind. Called Charitable Incorporated Organisation, it will contribute to the Government's aim of making it easier to set up and run a charity, voluntary group or social enterprise.</p>

	<p pid="d.732W.5/1">The Government are committed to making it easier for civil society organisations to do business with the state. For example the recently announced Open Public Services White Paper sets out our intention to make it easier for charities and social enterprises to compete for public sector contracts by opening up public services. Our approach will be guided by applying five key principles:</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/2">Choice&#8212;Wherever possible we will increase choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/3">Decentralisation&#8212;Power should be decentralised to the lowest appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/4">Diversity&#8212;Public services should be open to a range of providers.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/5">Fairness&#8212;We will ensure fair access to public services.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/6">Accountability&#8212;Public services should be accountable to users and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="d.732W.5/7">There is also the &#163;10 million Investment and Contract Readiness Fund to transform the support provided to frontline civil society organisations to help them develop the skills and infrastructure to win more capital investment and public service contracts. At the same time the Department for Communities and Local Government published the Best Value Guidance recently. The guidance makes it clear that councils should consider overall value&#8212;including social value&#8212;when considering service provision. This guidance sets out our desire that public agencies and civil society collaborate more in the running of public services.</p>

	<p pid="d.743W.5/1">DECC does not produce annual load factors split by size of installation. However, in 2010, the onshore wind load factor was 21.5% and the offshore wind load factor was 29.6%.</p>

	<p pid="d.743W.5/5">For <i>(a)</i>, most sub-100 kW installations are covered by the Feed in Tariff (FIT) scheme. However, generation data for this are not yet available, so actual load factors cannot be calculated. DECC estimates that load factors will be in the range of 15% to 20% depending on installation size. This assumes an average wind speed of 6.5 m/s, and excludes load factors for sub-1.5 kW installations, on the basis that nearly no projects of this type have thus far been registered under FITs.</p>

	<p pid="d.744W.5/1">The renewables obligation (RO) is currently the Government&#8217;s main mechanism for incentivising the deployment of large-scale renewable electricity deployment. Generators are issued renewables obligation certificates (ROCs) for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of eligible electricity they generate which can then be sold to suppliers, allowing them to receive a premium in addition to the wholesale price of their electricity.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.5/2">The RO is a market-based support mechanism, rather than a direct public subsidy, and ROCs are trade-able commodities which have no fixed price. The amount a supplier pays for a ROC is dependent on bi-lateral negotiations between supplier and generator. The nominal value of a ROC in any given year is equal to the buy-out price (the amount a supplier must pay for every ROC they do not present to Ofgem in order to comply with their obligation) + recycle value (the amount re-distributed to suppliers from the buy-out fund on a pro-rata basis depending on how many ROCs they presented to Ofgem) for that year. The nominal value represents the maximum worth of a ROC to a generator but is not necessarily the amount paid by a supplier. The nominal value of a ROC in 2009-10 was &#163;52.36.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.5/3">The following table sets out the number of ROCs issued for each MWh generated under the RO for onshore wind generation and other sources of renewable energy across the UK. Similar support mechanisms are not available to other generators of electricity.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.5/4">Eligible generators can also claim levy exemption certificates (LECs) which are also trade-able. The levy is currently set at &#163;4.85/MWh.</p>

	<p pid="d.747W.6/1">The issue has not been raised in meetings with business, but has been raised in correspondence and with officials in recent meetings with local authorities and non-Government bodies engaged in post-disorder recovery activity.</p>
	<p pid="d.747W.6/2">Government support schemes for business cover loss of goods, damage to property and other costs as a result of the disorder but do not extend to loss of trade or earnings. Many businesses will have insurance for &#8220;business interruption&#8221; that will cover this. In addition, the private High Street Fund and other charitable organisations may make grants to businesses suffering hardship as a result of loss of earnings resulting from the disorder.</p>

	<p pid="d.754W.2/1">Universities have duties under the Equality Act 2010 (which incorporated the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995) to support disabled staff and students in higher education, including those with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.754W.2/2">The law establishes a framework of responsibility which higher educations must comply with and also promotes an anticipatory and proactive approach to supporting disabled students, including those suffering from mental illness. This may mean that there will be different approaches taken by different universities on this issue, as they seek to offer provision that anticipates the needs of their students and staff based on the unique circumstances of the institution. Individual institutions will use the law as a baseline standard to establish their own tailored policies, procedures and approaches. The Government have no plans to amend the provisions in the Equality Act relating to higher education institutions' duties towards disabled students.</p>
	<p pid="d.754W.2/3">There is guidance available to universities on supporting students and staff with mental health conditions from a range of sector and medical bodies, including the Heads of University Counselling Services, the Association of Managers of Student Services in Higher Education (AMOSSHE), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the former Disability Rights Commission and most recently from the UniversitiesUK/Guild HE Working Group for the Promotion of Mental Well-Being in Higher Education.</p>
	<p pid="d.754W.2/4">Students can use an institution's internal complaints process to raise any concerns about discrimination and pursue their complaint with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) if they have exhausted the internal processes and remain dissatisfied with the outcome. Universities are subject to the courts in the application of these duties. Any student who feels they have been discriminated can seek legal advice about their situation, and the advice of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which provides guidance on discrimination matters and has a statutory enforcement role (established in the 2006 Equality Act).</p>

Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning services, taking into account the available evidence and the needs of the local population. PCTs are required to make decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments rationally, and following proper consideration of the evidence. If a PCT decides to prioritise funding for alternative drugs or treatments, it should be able to explain its decision and rationale. We have been clear that this should not lead to any blanket bans on procedures, and local processes should ensure eligibility criteria for procedures can take account of individuals' health care circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="d.763W.8/1">Because of the scientific uncertainties about the incubation period of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and the potential level of unidentified asymptomatic infection in the population the Department focuses on managing the potential risks of person to person transmission. Given the uncertainties, evidence based and cost effective steps are taken to reduce the potential secondary spread. The following actions are amongst those taken with respect of the risk of anyone potentially carrying the abnormal prion protein associated with human prion diseases such as vCJD.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/2">Since December 1997, blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops vCJD, have been withdrawn to prevent their use.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/3">Since October 1999, white blood cells have been reduced in all blood used for transfusion, a process known as leucodepletion or leucoreduction.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/4">Since April 2004 individuals who had themselves received a transfusion of blood components since January 1980 were excluded from donating blood, and since July 2004, this exclusion criterion was extended to include two new groups, who had received transfusions of blood components since 1980:</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/5">Previously transfused platelet donors; and</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/6">Donors who were unsure if they had previously had a blood transfusion.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/7">These criteria now apply to donors who have been transfused anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/8">Since 1999, plasma for the manufacture of fractionated plasma products, such as the clotting factors for treating patients with bleeding disorders, has been obtained from non-United Kingdom sources; and synthetic (recombinant) clotting factors have been provided to those up to the age of 16 since 1998 and for all patients for whom it is suitable since 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/9">Fresh frozen plasma for treating babies and young children born on or after <phrase class="date" code="1996-01-01">1 January 1996</phrase> has been obtained from the United States, and from July 2005 its use was extended to all children up to the age of 16.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/10">For over ten years the independent scientific Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Management Sub-Group has also issued guidance on managing potential transmission risks. This includes guidance on quarantining surgical instruments, on endoscopy, on management of instruments and tissues from brain biopsy procedures, on assessments carried out before surgery and/or endoscopy, on risk in ophthalmology and on handling of tissues from patients. ACDP's guidance is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.763W.8/12">The GJD Incidents Panel has since 2000 provided specific advice and guidance to health services on how to manage incidents involving possible transmission of CJD between patients, including those who may be asymptomatic. The Panel also provides advice on the notification of individuals where it is calculated that they are at potentially higher risk of vCJD than the general population (usually an additional 1% risk). Public information on the Panel's activities can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/13"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&amp;Page&amp;HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1204031511121">http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&amp;Page&amp;HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1204031511121</a></p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/14">The Department funds studies to help ascertain the presence of abnormal prion protein present in the United Kingdom population. These include a study of appendix and tonsil tissue published in 2004, the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive and an ongoing study of appendix tissue.</p>
	<p pid="d.763W.8/15">The independent scientific ACDP Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Assessment Sub-Group keeps the evidence of the asymptomatic presence of abnormal prion protein associated with human prion disease under review, the outputs are used by the groups tasked with advising on risk management, including the ACDP Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Risk Management Sub-Group, the OD Incidents Panel and the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs.</p>

	<p pid="d.765W.0/1">The Government will continue to consider advice and recommendations from independent scientific Advisory Committees, along with impact assessments of those recommendations, related to the scenarios used in assessing the potential risk of person to person transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and the implications of those scenarios.

	<p pid="d.766W.8/1">We want to see a two-thirds reduction in the level of prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs for people with dementia by November 2011 and we have commissioned an audit to measure this.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/2">The Dementia Action Alliance supported by the NHS Institute and the Department of Health launched a 'National Call to Action' on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-09">9 June 2011</phrase>, with the aim of ensuring that by <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase> all 180,000 people with dementia, who are receiving anti-psychotic drugs will have undergone a clinical review, to ensure that their care is compliant with current best practice and guidelines and that alternatives to their prescription have been considered.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/3">Reducing the use of anti-psychotic medication is a key element of the Dementia Commissioning Pack which is supported by a multi-disciplinary care pathway for the management of agitation in people with dementia and for the review of medication on people already receiving anti-psychotics.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/4">The Department provided funding of &#163;1.9 million in December 2010 to enable all strategic health authorities (SHAs) to accelerate improvements in prescribing practice. Each SHA has committed undertaking audits of current practice on anti-psychotic prescribing for people with dementia that cover prescribing by acute and community hospital doctors, prescribing by psychiatrists, prescribing by general practitioners and prescribing in care homes. This work will report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/5">The Department has also contributed &#163;100,000 to the Alzheimer's Society FITS (Focussed Intervention Training Scheme) programme. The overarching aim of the programme is to reduce the use of anti-psychotics in care homes. The FITS programme delivers a 10-day training course to nominated health professionals. These individuals disseminate the information as a trainer and act as a Dementia Champion in their care home.</p>

	<p pid="d.775W.2/1">Yes. This policy is already reflected in the Health and Social Care Bill. The National Health Service Commissioning Board and clinical commissioning groups established in accordance with the provisions proposed by the Health and Social Care Bill would be statutory public bodies and, as such, would be responsible for the exercise of their statutory functions. As now, NHS commissioners could arrange for external organisations to provide support for commissioning, but statutory responsibility for commissioning decisions would continue to rest with the NHS Commissioning Board or the clinical commissioning group.</p>

	<p pid="d.778W.3/1">The Department recognise the benefits of early HIV diagnosis which include preventing the onward transmission of HIV, improved treatment outcomes for patients and savings to the national health service. In March 2011, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its public health guidance &#8220;Increasing the uptake of HIV testing in men who have sex with men&#8221; and &#8220;Increasing the uptake of HIV testing among black Africans in England&#8221;, the groups most affected by HIV in the United Kingdom. The NICE accompanying costing report included a local costing template to assess the local impact of implementing the NICE guidelines including the costs and saving to the NHS. Both the guidance and the costing report are available on the NICE website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.3/2"><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/Search">www.nice.org.uk/Search</a>.do?keywords=HIV&amp;tsearch submit=GO&amp;searchSite=on&amp;searchType=AII&amp;newSearch=l</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.3/3">In 2009-10, the Department funded eight pilot projects to assess different models for expanding HIV testing in non-specialist health care settings in primary and secondary care. In September 2011 the Health Protection Agency published a report of their review of all eight projects&#8212;&#8220;Time to test for HIV: Expanding HIV testing in healthcare and community services in England&#8221; a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The Department will consider the report's findings in developing the new sexual health policy document.</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.3/4">Up to 2013, it is for primary care trusts to commission and fund interventions to increase the offer and uptake of HIV testing in a variety of health care settings, taking into account the local prevalence of HIV and other health care priorities. The Department is funding the charity the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health to produce information resources to support primary care staff in offering an HIV test.</p>

	<p pid="d.779W.5/1">Local authorities can contribute to the funding of national health service schemes which involve an element of delivering service for which they are responsible and accountable.</p>
	<p pid="d.779W.5/2">Any such scheme is subject to a value for money test as part of the standard business case process, which includes a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the optimal procurement route, i.e. whether to use of public capital or the private finance initiative (PFI). The exact form of public capital funding is not assumed or determined as part of the value for money test as the cost of raising the required capital by the Government is the same for all public capital funding options. Different forms of funding, such as loans under Prudential Borrowing Limits or Public Dividend Capital, used by different Government Departments for differing purposes, will mean different cashflow implications for the public authority concerned, such as an NHS trust. However, this will not affect the overall economic cost to the taxpayer, which is the criteria used in such value for money tests.</p>
	<p pid="d.779W.5/3">In the value for money test it is the balance between the additional cost of raising private finance under PFI against the value of risk transferred to the private sector and an adjustment to take account of differential taxation under each option which determines which offers best overall value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

			<tr pid="d.780W.2/8"> <td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><sup>(1)</sup> The 2010-11 data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest period, ie November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected. <i>Notes:</i> 1. A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. 2. Data for A&amp;E attendances is not available. 3. Cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in HES. The cause code used was W54&#8212;'bitten or struck by dog'. 4. In July 2006, the NHS reorganised SHAs and primary care trusts (PCT) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result, data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result, some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. 5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. 6. In-patients are patients who are admitted to hospital and occupy a bed, including both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.782W.2/1">All trusts are aiming to be independent of the Department's direct control by April 2014, i.e. becoming national health service foundation trusts. Accountability for effective procurement will sit primarily with their boards. The Department's strategy on procurement of goods and services (including consumables) is to develop trusts into better informed clients, able to make decisions based on improved and more transparent data and able to make better use of regional and national procurement organisations such as NHS Supply Chain.</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/2">To this end, the Department has been working with organisations such as Monitor and the Foundation Trust Network as well and holding workshops to support the NHS in delivering &#163;1.2 billion in savings on procurement of goods and services under the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) workstream. This applies exclusively to NHS providers&#8212;NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/3">These savings are to come in four main areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/4">reducing price variation (all providers to use best available prices): &#163;598 million;</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/5">efficiencies in back office organisation: &#163;65 million;</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/6">improved use and management of stock: &#163;283 million; and</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/7">clinical efficiencies (release of time for more direct clinical work): &#163;142 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.782W.2/8">To support this, the Department is currently working on the finalising of key performance indicators to be introduced by April 2012 which can successfully measure improvements made by trusts in the management of their non-pay spend. The new strategy based around the work strands of greater transparency on pricing; promoting and improving the national collaborative bodies such as NHS Supply Chain; and product standardisation and rationalisation, as mentioned above are currently being consulted on within the NHS will be formally launched by April 2012.</p>

	<p pid="d.785W.5/1">The Department has in place clear plans through the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) workstream to support the national health service in making &#163;1.2 billion in savings on procurement of goods and services over the next three years. This applies exclusively to NHS providers&#8212;NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/2">These savings are to come in four main areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/3">reducing price variation (all providers to use best available prices)&#8212;&#163;598 million;</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/4">efficiencies in back office organisation&#8212;&#163;65 million;</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/5">improved use and management of stock &#8212;283 million; and</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/6">clinical efficiencies (release of time for more direct clinical work)&#8212;&#163;142 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/7">To support this, the Department is currently working on the finalising of key performance indicators to be introduced by April 2012 which can successfully measure improvements made by trusts in the management of their non-pay spend. The Department has also developed a new procurement strategy based around three key work strands of greater transparency on pricing; promoting and improving the national collaborative bodies such as NHS Supply Chain; and product standardisation and rationalisation. Following completion of consultations on these measures within the NHS, this new procurement strategy will be formally launched by April 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.785W.5/8">In terms of procuring clinical services for NHS patients, the Health and Social Care Bill would provide for the Secretary of State to impose regulations on commissioners for the purpose of ensuring that they adhere to good procurement practice when commissioning health services for the purposes of the NHS.</p>

Implementation of the ODTF recommendations has seen donor rates rise by around 28%, since 2008. Work continues at a local, regional and national levels to further strengthen the donation infrastructure to reach the 50%, increase in donors by 2013 anticipated by the ODTF. This includes an increase in the number of highly trained Specialist Nurses for Organ Donation, the appointment of Clinical Leads for Organ Donation, and the establishment of Organ Donation Committees driving improvement locally.</p>
	<p pid="d.788W.2/2">Work also continues to encourage more people to add their name to the Organ Donor Register (ODR). Much of this work is led by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) in liaison with a number of partners in the private, public and third sectors. Examples include asking people to sign up to the ODR when they register with a new general practitioner (GP), when applying for a new passport or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), and when applying for a Boots advantage card. The prompted choice scheme, working in partnership with the Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, requires people applying for a driving licence online to make a choice about organ donation. NHSBT publicise the need for more people to register as donors through their public awareness campaigns, via the organ donation website and their national helpline.

	<p pid="d.789W.2/1">The proposed reforms to national health service commissioning arrangements do not in any way alter the existing duties of general practitioners (GPs) as clinicians to provide high quality primary medical care to meet the needs of patients, as required by their contracts and the terms of their registration as doctors. Under the proposed arrangements for clinical commissioning, GPs will also have an enhanced role in protecting the interests of patients, through their membership of clinical commissioning groups that plan and secure the majority of NHS services. This will ensure that commissioning decisions are made by those with the best understanding of local patients' needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.789W.5/1">Registered pharmacies are currently exempt under the 1968 Medicines Act from the need to hold a Wholesale Dealer's licence to wholesale deal licensed medicines. Such dealing should be limited to an inconsiderable part of their pharmacy business. Recent experience of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in investigating cases in which counterfeits have entered the legitimate supply chain suggests that there is a need to strengthen the rules governing trade in medicines not carried out by Wholesale Dealers to limit potential for infiltration of the supply chain by counterfeit medicines. The MHRA has undertaken two public consultations on proposals to address this issue as it relates to pharmacies, and is still considering what measures to introduce.</p>

	<p pid="d.792W.5/1">The provision of diagnostic services is a regulated activity for which the Care Quality Commission (CQC) sets essential and common registration requirements to ensure basic standards of safety and quality. The Department has also supported a range of measures intended to reduce variation in the way investigations are undertaken and recorded, working with relevant professional organisations such as the Royal College of Pathologists, Royal College of Radiologists and the Society of Radiographers to identify and implement opportunities for improving standards of professional practice in addition to the codes of practice already in use.</p>
	<p pid="d.792W.5/2">For pathology laboratory investigations, the Department is working with Connecting for Health and the Royal College of Pathologists to develop the first National Laboratory Medicine Catalogue (NLMC). This will enable a standardised form of requesting and reporting pathology results intended to improve patient safety and outcomes by ensuring that all pathology tests use the same terminology and units of measurement. Through minimising local variations in pathology test requesting and reporting, the NLMC will also improve general practitioner and trust ability to commission and provide services across regional boundaries. This will increase options for patient choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.792W.5/3">In addition, the Department has asked NHS Improvement to work with pathology laboratories across England to support the introduction of LEAN methodologies into laboratory practice. These will further assist standardisations in professional practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.792W.5/4">For x-ray investigations in radiology, also known as 'medical exposures', the standardisation of the way tests are undertaken is effected by legislation. The Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000 as amended 2006 and 2011 (IR(ME)R) are intended to protect individuals undergoing medical exposures against the dangers associated with the use of ionising radiation and define a number of obligations. The key requirements of IR(ME)R are that all such procedures are carry a net benefit to the individual (i.e. justified); a radiation dose as low as reasonably practicable is used (optimised); and that all personnel directly involved with the medical exposure are adequately trained for the tasks they carry out.</p>
	<p pid="d.792W.5/5">In addition the Royal College of Radiologists, in collaboration with the Society and College of Radiographers, have introduced an Imaging Service Accreditation Scheme. The Department supports and encourages organisations to be accredited against this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.792W.5/6">When recording x-ray investigations, standardisation is encouraged through use of technology. The main computer systems used in collecting patient information are Radiology Information Systems and for storing images, the Picture Archiving Communication Systems. These are procured to common specifications developed by the Connecting for Health programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.793W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/2">Universities have duties under the Equality Act 2010 (which incorporated the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995) to support disabled staff and students in higher education, including those with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/3">The law establishes a framework of responsibility which higher educations must comply with and also promotes an anticipatory and proactive approach to supporting disabled students, including those suffering from mental illness. This may mean that there will be different approaches taken by different universities on this issue, as they seek to offer provision that anticipates the needs of their students and staff based on the unique circumstances of the institution. Individual institutions will use the law as a baseline standard to establish their own tailored policies, procedures and approaches. The Government have no plans to amend the provisions in the Equality Act relating to higher education institutions' duties towards disabled students.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/4">There is guidance available to universities on supporting students and staff with mental health conditions from a range of sector and medical bodies, including the Heads of University Counselling Services, the Association of Managers of Student Services in Higher Education (AMOSSHE), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the former Disability Rights Commission and most recently from the UniversitiesUK/Guild HE Working Group for the Promotion of Mental Well-Being in Higher Education.</p>
	<p pid="d.793W.2/5">Students can use an institution's internal complaints process to raise any concerns about discrimination and pursue their complaint with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) if they have exhausted the internal processes and remain dissatisfied with the outcome. Universities are subject to the courts in the application of these duties. Any student who feels they have been discriminated can seek legal advice about their situation, and the advice of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which provides guidance on discrimination matters and has a statutory enforcement role (established in the 2006 Equality Act).</p>
