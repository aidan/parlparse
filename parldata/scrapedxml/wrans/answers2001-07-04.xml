	<p pid=".157W.0/1">Fire total standard spending was increased by 3.5 per cent. to &pound;1,463 million for 2001&ndash;02. The settlements took account of information on spending pressures provided by the local authorities Fire Service Expenditure Forecasting Group. Best Value administration was not identified as a separate significant pressure in the group's most recent report. Information on overall costs for the fire service is not held centrally. The scale of costs is likely to be different for county fire authorities compared with single-service fire authorities, like East Sussex, which are Best Value authorities in their own right. Additional items of expenditure for single-service fire authorities include publication of Best Value performance plans and distribution of summary plans to local households.</p>

This should identify gaps in the local network and potential improvements to the cycling infrastructure. Almost all authorities subsequently included strategies for cycling as part of their LTP submissions. Initial monitoring suggests that the strategies will result in considerable additional provision for cycling. The London boroughs will be expected to implement the policies for cycling contained in the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which is due for publication in the summer.</p>

The local transport settlement provided &pound;8.4 billion of Government funding which will help to promote sustainable transport measures, including cycling. The cycling strategies in local authorities' local transport plans will provide opportunities to improve the cycling infrastructure and make cycling more accessible.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/3">Action is being taken to effectively market the key messages of the National Cycling Strategy (NCS). An NCS website has been launched and a promotional video has been produced. A series of cycling seminars has just been concluded across England, which provided a good opportunity for local authorities, major employers and health and education practitioners to come together.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/4">We are also re-organising the way the National Cycle Forum, which co-ordinates progress on the NCS, works. The current Forum will be reconstituted, meeting annually to review progress on delivering the NCS, and to set the policy agenda for the year ahead. An executive board is to be established with the task of securing NCS objectives and developing broad policies established by the NCF. The NCS Board will be 8&ndash;10 people strong. We have advertised for a Chairperson, and are considering the applications at present.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.8/1">As travel by air is a predominantly international mode of transport, it was considered more appropriate to develop standards at international level for access to air travel for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid=".159W.8/2">My Department was closely involved, both through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), in drawing up the relevant advice for the aviation industry. We have more recently been working with the UK industry&mdash;airlines, airports and travel agents&mdash;and with our disability advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, to draw up a voluntary code of practice for the industry on meeting the needs of disabled passengers. The draft Code on which we have been consulting over the last few months draws on the work of ICAO and ECAC. We hope to publish the final version later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".159W.8/3">In responding to the Disability Rights Task Force report we also announced our intention to take a reserve regulation making power, when a suitable legislative opportunity arises, which could be used to give the Code statutory force if voluntary compliance proves ineffective.</p>
	<p pid=".159W.8/4">In addition, European airline and airport associations have recently agreed to commend a series of voluntary commitments on passenger rights to their respective members. Both the airline commitments and the airport commitments contain undertakings about the treatment of passengers with reduced mobility. We expect all major UK airlines and airports to adopt the relevant commitments, which will take effect from February 2002. Our Code of Practice will complement those commitments.</p>

In February this year the UK hosted a small arms and light weapons policy brainstorming seminar to which a wide selection of countries was invited. The then Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, addressed that meeting. We also hold regular EU Troika meetings with SADC (Southern African Development Community), and participated in an EU/SADC meeting in the margins of the third PrepCom. In addition, the EU Presidency will be organising consultations between the EU and SADC, Latin American countries and others during the early stages of the conference. The subject has been a regular agenda item for a wide variety of bilateral meetings over the past year. Most recently, the Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" name="Jack Straw">my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, discussed prospects for the conference with the South African Foreign Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".165W.2/3" class="indent">on west Africa, work on the implementation of the ECOWAS Moratorium, focusing, in the UK-authored &quot;next steps&quot; report of 2000, on building political will;</p>

	<p pid=".165W.2/5" class="indent">on southern Africa, UK support for EU moves to bolster the EU/SADC process and its regional action programme.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.2/6">The UK also co-ordinated work leading to the November 2000 adoption of an OSCE Document on Small Arms, a significant regional contribution in itself and a major confidence-building step towards the UN conference.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.2/7">The UK hopes that the UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects will agree a practical and constructive programme of action with sufficient political support to give an impetus to sustained follow-up and implementation. We are working with our EU partners to this end.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.0/1">The Belgian MFA has carried out an internal inquiry into allegations made by a former employee of the Belgian Embassy in Sofia regarding the sale of visas at the Embassy. Although passports were not included in the allegations, we understand that the inquiry also looked into passports. The inquiry found no evidence to support the allegations and concluded that no rules had been broken. Separately, a judicial inquiry was launched in 1997 into the allegations and is still under way. It will be for the Belgian Procurator General to decide the outcome in this case.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.0/2">Visas issued by the Belgian authorities allow access to the countries in the Schengen zone, which covers all EU countries except the UK and Ireland. They therefore do not permit entry to the United Kingdom, which maintains its own frontier controls and does not participate in Schengen visa arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.4/2">However, there have been two substantive reports on PFI, since its inception, which have indicated that PFI is delivering value for money. The independent Arthur Andersen and Enterprise LSE Report stated the average percentage estimated saving against conventional procurement for the sample of projects they looked at, averaged 17 per cent. Also the NAO report on &quot;PFI and value for money&quot; found an average cost saving of 20 per cent. or just under &pound;1 billion in total, across seven projects examined by the NAO up until December 1999. This saving is measured against the conventional procurement route.</p>

	<p pid=".171W.2/1">The new company car tax system from April 2002 is designed to achieve lower levels of harmful emissions from cars. It does away with the reductions for driving higher levels of business mileage as this can be an incentive to drive unnecessary business miles. The reforms have been projected to have a broadly neutral effect on tax revenues, so in overall terms there is no loss to employees.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/2">Many company car drivers will be paying less tax for the benefit of their company car under the new system. Having a company car with relatively low carbon dioxide emissions would help to ameliorate tax liabilities under the new system for any driver.</p>
	<p pid=".171W.2/3">It is worth noting that we expect more drivers to take the opportunity of having a company car under the new rules. In fact the Inland Revenue has estimated that the reforms will lead to a net increase of around 200,000 company cars in the long term.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.2/2">We continually monitor the rapid response fund to ensure it is used as intended&mdash;to provide specialist advice, training and other support to people involved in redundancies that have a significant impact on the local labour market and where no alternative existing provision is available. Proposals are considered against a variety of criteria that include the impact of the redundancy on the local labour market, the level of partnership involvement, clear outputs and value for money. We also expect training proposals to be matched as far as possible to the needs of employers with vacancies so that people can move quickly into new jobs. DfES officials make every effort to ensure bids submitted via regional development agencies are processed as quickly as possible and provide an initial approval decision within three working days. The fund is designed to be as flexible as possible and, within the last year, we have introduced changes to increase its flexibility and make it more responsive to local needs. Demand is high and has increased significantly over the last six months.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.8/1">The Department is pursuing a range of measures to tackle the digital divide in order to help increase people's employability, to enable them to use new technologies to enrich their lives, and to encourage lifelong learning for all. Our measures help provide access and the skills needed for individuals to use information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly for those most at risk from exclusion. We are providing public access to new technologies and the internet through UK online centres. There are almost 1,500 centres now open, with 6,000 centres planned in total by the end of 2002. We are investing in wiring up communities in some of the most disadvantaged areas in England, enabling people to explore the internet in the comfort of their own homes and to develop skills, access job opportunities and become more involved in their communities. We are also making progress in improving computer/pupil ratios, to ensure that in future all school leavers should be able to use and benefit from new technologies. 88 per cent. of all schools are now connected to the internet.</p>

	<p pid=".178W.3/1">The US has made it clear that missile defence is envisaged as one element of a comprehensive strategy to deal with a new threat caused by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is not aimed at defending against the Russian strategic arsenal, still less at giving the United States the capacity to attack Russia. President Bush has made it clear that it no longer considers Russia an enemy. I have discussed missile defence and related issues with President Putin on a number of occasions, and expect to continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.3/9">One current consultation has a consultation period of one month. It is on proposed amendments to the Working Time Regulations 1998 to remove the annual leave qualifying period. This shorter period is necessary because of the need to remove uncertainty and to amend UK law as soon as possible following a judgment by the European Court of Justice. This judgment found that the existing provision in the Regulations is contrary to the working time directive.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.3/28" class="indent">Draft Export Control and Non-Proliferation Bill. The consultation period in this case was eight weeks as most of the proposals in the draft Bill were the subject of previous consultation. In addition many of the issues consulted on related to secondary legislation. There will be an opportunity for further consultation during the Bill's passage through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.3/29" class="indent">Proposed amendments to electricity supply licences. This consultation period lasted for four weeks, because of the urgent need to consult on the desirability of bringing forward legislation to provide for additional powers to safeguard against potential market abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.3/30">Guidance has been issued more than 12 weeks before the relevant regulation came into force in relation to the following regulations which have entered into force since <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid=".189W.5/2">The Department has provided financial support for regional studies of the potential for renewables throughout the UK. A number of the regional development authorities (RDAs) have been very actively involved in these assessments and some RDAs, including the Welsh Development Agency, have conducted their own studies with a focus on manufacturing and employment opportunities. On the basis of this involvement, the RDAs will be well placed to promote all aspects of renewable energy, in pursuance of regional targets.</p>

The failure to report leakage from a storage tank would not therefore be specifically identified and case-by-case information would be disproportionately expensive to obtain.

	<p pid=".191W.11/1">I attended the meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-19">19 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.11/2">The Council adopted by qualified majority (Spain and Netherlands opposing) measures to tackle the problems in the EU beef market resulting from the discovery of BSE in certain continental countries late last year. I was pleased to secure important exemptions for United Kingdom farmers from the measures cutting back suckler cow production, in recognition of the particular impact of FMD, as well as rejection of the excessively bureaucratic proposals to impose individual farmer quotas on beef special premiums and to reimpose the 90 head limit on individual claims.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.11/3">The Council also adopted&mdash;by qualified majority with Spain opposing and Portugal abstaining&mdash;rules to restrict the use of close confinement stalls for sows. This brings other countries into line with conditions already applying here. It is an important and welcome step to improve pig welfare across the Community, albeit less radically than I would have preferred. The Council also resolved to improve the welfare of animals during transport, which I urged must be given effect speedily.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.11/4">I updated my colleagues on the latest situation on FMD in the UK. The Council also discussed further measures on BSE, as a result of which the Commission will enact a range of further controls including an extension to the current ban on the use of animal protein in animal feed.</p>
	<p pid=".191W.11/5">The Council unanimously adopted conclusions following up the Copenhagen Conference on organic food and farming, and setting the framework for the European Action Plan. It unanimously agreed proposals concerning the olive oil and hops regimes, inspection and control of animal feedingstuffs, a special aid scheme for small farmers and a common position on controlling undesirable substances in animal feed. By qualified majority, it agreed common positions on the processing, use and disposal of animal by-products and on classical swine fever (Germany and Austria opposing in both cases).</p>

	<p pid=".192W.2/1">The Tidy Britain Group (TBG) has carried out three surveys to determine the effect, if any, of the landfill tax on fly-tipping. The TBG's most recent report, &quot;Effects Of The Landfill Tax On Fly-Tipping (April 1997-March 1998)&quot;, confirmed that the type of waste most frequently fly-tipped is household waste. However, local authorities have a legal duty to collect household waste and householders are not directly affected by the landfill tax.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/2">The Fly-Tipping Forum, under the chairmanship of the Environment Agency, has commissioned research to assess the problem of fly-tipping on farm land. However, the survey which is an essential part of the project was suspended on the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. The Forum will consider in the autumn whether it is then practicable to carry out the survey.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/3">The action being taken by the Government on fly- tipping, and other forms of unlawful waste disposal, was set out most recently in the Government's response to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee's Report on the Environment Agency (Cm 4832&mdash;paragraphs 55&ndash;60).</p>

	<p pid=".193W.2/2">The Government's policy towards air pollution is set out in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. The Strategy sets health-based standards for the eight air pollutants of most concern, as well as the Government's and devolved Administrations' air quality policy objectives for the short to medium term. We will also be consulting shortly on a number of new or revised objectives for certain pollutants. In doing so, we will take full account of the emerging evidence on the health effects of long-term exposure to air pollution.</p>

	<p pid=".193W.5/1">Local authorities across the country have been carrying out detailed studies of their local air quality over the past three years. Within the Yeovil constituency, the relevant authority (South Somerset district council) is undertaking a major study of air quality in Yeovil town centre, having identified some potential air pollution problems there. No other areas within the Yeovil constituency have so far been identified as having levels of air pollution which might exceed the nationally prescribed objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".193W.5/2">Within Yeovil town centre, South Somerset district council has identified a potential exceedence of the nationally prescribed objective for nitrogen dioxide in the vicinity of the A30/A37 hospital roundabout. A new monitoring station has therefore been installed in the grounds of the Yeovil district hospital, to measure levels of nitrogen dioxide and particles in the area of concern. I understand that South Somerset district council is due very shortly to publish an interim report giving the first detailed monitoring results from this station.</p>

Consolidated historical figures are not available but the information we have gathered to date indicates that in excess of 1,750 kg of illegal meat was confiscated from individuals during the financial year 2000&ndash;01 and that over 450 kg was seized from commercial consignments at Heathrow airport alone in the 12-month period from May 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".195W.3/1">The new Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will bring together the Government's drive to help people get into work as well as to provide a better service for pensions and pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/2">The new Department will have two core operations to enable it to do this: Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/3">The Pension Service will offer a local service working in partnership with local authorities and voluntary organisations. To support the local service network, we will bring together the backroom processing in about 20 locations rather than over 400 at present, allowing frontline staff to concentrate on dealing with customers. For example, they will undertake outreach activity such as home visiting, private interviews in locations that suit pensioners and drop-in services.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/4">As we already process much of our pensions work for the whole of the UK in Newcastle, centralising processing work is a logical next step to support the national frontline network. Staff are being consulted and kept informed as plans develop.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.3/5">The proposed phase 1 locations are to be sited in Bath, Birmingham, Blackpool, Burnley, Cwmbran, Dundee, Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Norwich, Nottingham, Plymouth, Stockton, Swansea, Walsall, Warrington, Wolverhampton, and Wrexham. Phase 2 locations will be announced in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.2/1">The report of policy action team 8, published in March 2000, recommended that a named person in each local authority district should co-ordinate action on anti-social behaviour and also encouraged the setting up of specialist teams to focus on anti-social behaviour. This second point has been reiterated in our manifesto. We think it important that each local authority district should have an effective means of tackling anti-social behaviour. The precise level of resources will vary from area to area depending on local need.</p>

	<p pid=".199W.5/1">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has a broad remit to inspect and report to the Secretary of State on the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces in England and Wales, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Under the Local Government Act 1999 these powers were extended to cover the inspection of best value in police authorities. The Police Act 1996 provided that the Secretary of State may direct the inspectors of constabulary to carry out other duties for the purpose of furthering police efficiency and effectiveness. Under this provision, from April 2001, the inspectorate has additionally been tasked with inspecting, over a five-year period, every police basic command unit (BCU) in England and Wales. There are no plans at present to further increase the powers of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary.</p>
	<p pid=".199W.5/2">Budgetary allocation for the inspectorate in 2001&ndash;02 is just over &pound;7.7 million. This includes &pound;1 million for the additional costs associated with the BCU inspections.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.0/1">Tackling crime and the fear of crime is a clear priority for this Government. It applies to all areas, whether suburban, rural or inner-city, and our approach is to assist the police and the local crime and disorder partnerships to address local crime effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.0/2">We are providing increased funding for police forces covering rural areas to take account of the additional costs involved: &pound;30 million is being allocated to 31 forces this year. The allocation for Leicestershire police is &pound;433,516. In addition, the rural crime toolkit, on the Home Office's crime reduction website, provides a new resource to help local partnerships to address crime in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.0/3">The nine crime and disorder partnerships in Leicestershire are supporting a varied programme of crime reduction initiatives and projects as part of the Government's crime reduction programme. Each of the partnerships is being provided with &pound;10,000 from the crime reduction programme this year to help them to improve their performance in tackling crime in their areas. In addition, the partnerships in Leicestershire have received money to support closed circuit television initiatives, and they have been allocated &pound;565,000 this year to tackle drug related crime. In November last year, Leicestershire received &pound;341,000 for a project to tackle burglary in Leicester as part of the reducing burglary initiative, and &pound;168,000 was awarded to eight forces, including Leicestershire, to tackle distraction burglary in central and eastern England as part of the targeted policing initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.3/1">Statistics concerning asylum applications have been published since 1992. Separate figures are given both for principal applicants only, and for principal applicants and dependants; and cover the period from 1984 to the present. The information is published in the annual Home Office statistical bulletins entitled &quot;Asylum Statistics&quot;, copies of which are available in the Library and on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.3/2">Statistics concerning asylum removals published before March 2001 have given figures for principal applicants only. From April 2001, the figures show the total number of failed asylum seekers removed, including dependants. This is to reflect the change in the removals target for failed asylum seekers for 2001&ndash;02 which is expressed in terms of the total figure for the first time. The change is intended to give a more informed picture of the number of people being removed from the United Kingdom as a result of failed asylum applications and to give a fairer reflection of the activity involved in enforcing their departure. The details were published in December 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.3/3">The removals target is equivalent to some 24,000 principal applicants and 6,000 dependants, although the number of dependants removed will vary according to the balance between individuals and families as well as family size, and is difficult to predict. The 30,000 target has always been extremely ambitious and high risk; no European country has achieved levels of this kind. We are investing substantial additional resources, and the programme to increase the numbers is continuing. I will be monitoring the position closely.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.3/4">Despite these difficulties, the Government are committed to increasing the number of failed asylum seekers who are removed from the United Kingdom. The Labour manifesto said that in excess of 30,000 people who had not justified their claim would be removed in 2003&ndash;04, which is about 2,500 people a month. We have decided that that monthly target must be met by early next year, which enables us to have a commitment to reach and exceed 30,000 removals by 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.10/1">Twenty three countries have now qualified for exceptional relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. Over $53 billion of debt relief has been agreed for these countries, which will reduce their debts by almost two-thirds on average. The money released is directly linked to poverty reduction. The impact of this debt reduction means that, after debt relief, social expenditures in these HIPC countries are projected to rise by an average of some US$1.7 billion per year during 2001&ndash;02. We hope more countries will qualify for relief this year, but many of the remaining countries are affected by conflict or have yet to demonstrate their commitment to reform.</p>

At the beginning of that year, DFID commented on ECGD's terms of reference for an independent review of environmental and resettlement impact reports produced by the project sponsors. Turkey is not a priority country for DFID and since mid-July 1999 DFID has had no further advisory input into any decisions on the project.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.9/1">HIV/AIDS is the single most important development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. The epidemic is undermining economic growth and fundamentally threatens social and economic development in many countries in the region. We know what needs to be done to tackle the disease, and I strongly believe that commitments by the international community must now be transformed into a worldwide effort to contain the spread of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.9/2">DFID continues to give greatest priority to prevention, but we also place great emphasis on reducing the personal, social and economic impact of illness and death caused by the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.9/3">As national strategic plans to tackle the epidemic improve, we have begun to place our support within the framework of those plans. For example, we have recently approved significant HIV/AIDS related programmes in support of the national response in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe totalling over &pound;60 million, and a &pound;20 million programme is being designed to support Mozambique. A new programme for South Africa is also planned for this year. We have also committed &pound;25 million to support the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa, and &pound;7.5 million to a regional initiative on HIV/AIDS with the Southern Africa Development Community.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.9/4">In addition, the Government are exploring the potential of a number of options for increasing the long-term affordability and availability of treatment for HIV/AIDS and related infections which will benefit sub-Saharan Africa, while maintaining a focus on the development of long-term sustainable health systems which is needed to deliver them.</p>

Since 1978, China has experienced a remarkable reduction in poverty, and continues to achieve impressive social indicators, for example low child mortality and high rates of enrolment in primary education. There has been a significant improvement in respect for the economic and social rights of the poor in China. We will continue to press the case for more progress on civil and political rights.</p>

	<p pid=".221W.8/1">The Department is discussing with the Public Health Laboratory Service what suitable research in this area may be possible. The United States Centers for Disease Control have conducted two studies which have not demonstrated a causal association between autism and thiomersal (the amount of thiomersal in vaccines used in the UK childhood immunisation programme is considerably less than that used in the United States programme). A full joint statement by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices and the US Public Health Services is available on the world wide web at http:// <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/thimerosal/joint-statement-00.htm">www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/thimerosal/joint&ndash;statement&ndash;00.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".221W.8/2">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the Department of Health's statutory independent advisory committee, has reviewed the available evidence and has concluded that the present evidence did not support a link between thiomersal in vaccines and autism. They also concluded that there was substantial evidence that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&mdash;which is a live attenuated vaccine and therefore has never contained thiomersal&mdash;is not a factor, but the cause of autism remains unknown. The Department has asked the Medical Research Council to review current knowledge about autism and to suggest possible areas for further research development so that a cause may be found.</p>

	<p pid=".227W.0/1">No undertaking has been given to review the decision to close the Royal Hospital, Haslar. The decision to close the Royal Hospital, Haslar was taken by the Ministry of Defence in 1998. Portsmouth Hospitals national health service trust took over management responsibility for clinical services provided at the hospital with effect from April 2001. The hospital will continue to treat patients until its services transfer to the planned new facilities at Queen Alexandra hospital, part of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust.</p>
