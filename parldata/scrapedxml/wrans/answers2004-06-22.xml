	<p pid=".1288W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-18">18 June 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/2">Since 1987 successive Governments have run radon measurement programmes to identify the extent of the radon problem in the UK. Initially, these focused on areas of England such as Cornwall, Devon and Somerset where dwellings were most likely to be at risk from the naturally occurring radioactive gas. By 1998, every home in England with a greater than 5 per cent. probability of radon levels being at or above the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) recommended radon 'Action Level' (200 becquerels per cubic metre of air&mdash;Bq m <sup>-</sup> <sup>3</sup> ) had been offered a free radon test. In accordance with NRPB's recommendation, we advise that remedial action is taken to reduce radon levels in any home at or above the Action Level.</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/3">The measurement campaigns have revealed and confirmed that Cornwall is an area that is significantly affected by radon. Data published in the NRPB's &quot;Radon Atlas of England and Wales&quot; (NRPB-W26) in December 2002 showed that 97 per cent. of dwellings in Cornwall are likely to be in radon-affect areas. Of the 220,500 homes in the county, some 67,640 had been measured, mostly from Government-funded tests. Nearly 16,000 homes had been found to have radon concentrations at or above the Action Level. At that time, the highest level recorded in the UK of 10,000 Bq m <sup>-</sup> <sup>3</sup> had been found in the district of Kerrier. It is estimated that up to 41,000 dwellings in Cornwall may have radon levels exceeding the Action Level.</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/4">Defra's latest programme continues to offer free radon measurements to the most at risk households in England. However, the initiative places greater emphasis on helping home owners to take action to reduce radon levels in their homes. This is being achieved in partnership with 27 local authorities who joined the initiative when it commenced in July 2000. In Cornwall, we started work with Kerrier district council at the end of 2003 to roll out a programme of action designed to raise awareness and promote radon remediation in the community. This has included over 31,000 invitations sent to householders offering free tests and retests (upon completion of satisfactory remedial work); and workshops providing information and advice on remediation for those householders recommended to take action to reduce radon levels in their homes.</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/5">Over 11,000 householders have accepted the offer and to date results from around 4,000 measurements are available. Some of the results reveal particularly high radon levels, and measurements taken in three dwellings are well above the previously highest recorded level of 10,000 Bq m <sup>-</sup> <sup>3</sup> . Kerrier district council, together with NRPB and the Building Research Establishment (BRE), are providing the support to the occupants of these dwellings that is available under Defra's programme, to enable prompt remedial action to be taken to reduce the risk to their health.</p>

	<p pid=".1289W.2/2">The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) carried out an interim analysis of Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) data collected up to the end of August 2003. The analysis revealed that there was an increased risk of TB breakdowns in cattle herds occurring in trial areas where &quot;reactive&quot; culling had taken place, compared to the related &quot;survey only&quot; (control) areas <sup>1</sup> .</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.2/3">As a result of this finding, Ministers suspended culling operations in the &quot;reactive&quot; treatment areas of the RBCT from November 2003, because to continue would have meant the unnecessary culling of badgers, leading to an increased risk of TB in cattle herds. Such reactive culling has effectively been ruled out as a TB control option.</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.2/4">Culling operations continue in &quot;proactive&quot; treatment areas, where more widespread and repeated trapping takes place. The ISG has given assurances that Ministers will be informed as soon as the data yield a scientifically significant result. The ISG estimate that the RBCT will be completed in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-06">6 April</phrase>, a report was published from an Independent Review Panel, which reviewed the progress of the RBCT and associated research, as part of a wider review of Defra's science. The ISG do not agree with all aspects of this report, and Ministers are considering its recommendations, particularly where the ISG does not concur.</p>
	<p pid=".1289W.2/6" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> The increase, compared to survey-only areas, was estimated to be 27 per cent. with 95 per cent. confidence that the increase lies between 4.8 per cent. and 53 per cent. A more conservative analysis would give would give confidence limits of between a 2.4 per cent. decrease and 65 per cent. increase. The ISG's most recent analysis of data collected to mid-February indicated an increase of 28 per cent. with confidence limits of between 1.1 per cent. and 62 per cent. using the wider confidence limits recommended by the Independent Review Panel.</p>

	<p pid=".1291W.6/1">Changes in sea temperature could potentially affect stock distribution, spawning, migratory patterns and survival of very young fish but the effect of long term temperature trends on fish stocks is not easy to predict. Defra has commissioned a range of science to improve our understanding of the processes and predictions. Our monitoring of sea fish stocks allows for an appropriate management response as we begin to observe changes. Fishing rates on many stocks remains high, and if those stocks are also under pressure due to ecosystem change, then this reinforces the need for effective fisheries management.</p>

	<p pid=".1291W.9/1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-24">24 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1291W.9/2">The first agenda item, held as a public debate, was the Council Decision for the establishment of Regional Advisory Councils (RACs). RACs will enable the fishing industry and other stakeholders to have an input in the Common Fisheries Policy management process. The Council Decision provides the basic principles and guidelines for setting up RACs, and should enable interested parties to take forward their proposals quickly. We in common with most other member states stressed the importance of RACs as a key part of CFP reform, marking a step change towards more inclusive and regionally-focused fisheries management. There was unanimous support for the Decision, which incorporated important amendments on transparency, increased Community funding for RACs and provision for a seventh RAC to cover stakeholder interests in non-EC waters. The other six RACs will cover the North Sea, Mediterranean, Baltic, South Western Waters, North Western Waters and the pelagic fishery (species such as herring and mackerel).</p>
	<p pid=".1291W.9/3">We explained to colleagues in the Council that the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit had recently published a report of recommendations for a sustainable and profitable UK fishing industry. We noted that the report was relevant at EU level, and indicated that we were looking to engage with colleagues on these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1291W.9/4">The Council agreed a number of changes to the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) to make funding available at the discretion of member states: for the implementation of the strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture (part of CFP reform); to increase support to those in the catching sector subject to stock recovery plans, and to support the fitting of acoustic devices (pingers) on fishing nets to reduce by-catches of small cetaceans.</p>
	<p pid=".1291W.9/5">The Council received a report from Commissioner Fischler on developments in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations following the recent Lamy-Fischler letter to WTO Trade Ministers amplifying the EU's negotiating position, and on the negotiations on a possible EU-Mercosur free trade agreement. A number of Ministers stressed the importance of the Commission playing its hand carefully in these talks, avoiding the risk of giving concessions that were unreciprocated. I and several other colleagues endorsed the Commission's negotiating strategy and emphasised the importance of securing a framework DDA agreement before the summer break if at all possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1294W.3/1">The UK is fully committed to the cancellation of debt in the world's poorest countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".1294W.3/2">The UK has provided commitments of &pound;2.3 billion of debt relief to eligible countries and has pledged a total of US$474 million through multilateral institutions to provide further support for debt relief to the world's poorest countries. The UK goes even further than is required under the HIPC Initiative, and is committed to providing 100 per cent. debt relief to eligible HIPC countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1294W.3/3">The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. Debt relief of over $70 billion has already been agreed for 27 countries under the Initiative. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&mdash;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP.</p>
	<p pid=".1294W.3/4">However, the Government also recognises that we need to do more if we are to deliver a long-term exit from unsustainable debt for HIPCs. Last week, G8 Heads of State discussed proposals to enhance debt relief for the world's poorest countries. The UK successfully pushed for the extension of the HIPC Initiative by another two years, potentially allowing 10 more countries to benefit from debt relief in excess of $30 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".1294W.3/5">Heads of State also tasked Finance Ministers to consider further both reforms to the HIPC Initiative, and new and innovative mechanisms to deliver a long-term exit from unsustainable debt for the world's poorest countries. The UK will push for the granting of additional assistance (topping up) for all countries whose debt profiles have worsened after Decision Point as a result of factors beyond their control. We will also continue to press for additional bilateral assistance to be excluded from the calculation of this topping-up assistance at Completion Point, to ensure that every dollar benefits the recipient. The UK will also seek a firm commitment on financing the G7's share of costs for the HIPC Trust Fund, which we estimate at up to $1 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".1307W.2/3">Lone parents and sick and disabled people can qualify for income support. We have introduced work-focused interviews enabling everyone on income support to take advantage of the increasing opportunities to move into work by, for the first time, offering everyone of working age advice and guidance on the full range of employment programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1307W.2/4">The national minimum wage and tax credits encourage people to start work by making it pay for them. Together they guarantee a minimum income in work and provide much improved gains through work. The improvements in gains through work have made a substantial contribution to improving labour market outcomes; for example the employment rate for lone parents has increased from 46 per cent. in 1997 to 53 per cent. this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1307W.2/5">We have announced recent measures in the Budget to further improve gains through work for part time workers. We have introduced a disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit for all tenants working part time (typically lone parents and disabled people) who are eligible for working tax credit which will make them around &pound;10 per week better off.</p>
	<p pid=".1307W.2/6">We have also introduced a child care disregard in housing benefit which is fully aligned with the child care element of working tax credit. This will improve gains through work for families receiving housing benefit who have child care costs.</p>

	<p pid=".1307W.5/1">Through the New Deal we have introduced a wide range of initiatives to help individuals improve their employment prospects by giving them the skills, support and confidence they need to move into work. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-12">12 April</phrase> we enhanced the New Deal for Partners in order to offer partners taking part in that programme the same level of help and support as our successful New Deal for Lone Parents programme. Also from this April we have started to roll out Work Focused Interviews for Partners, offering greater support to partners of benefit recipients.</p>
	<p pid=".1307W.5/2">1,320 women have started New Deal for Lone Parents in Manchester, Central since the beginning of the programme in October 1998, of whom, 680 have gained a job: Information on the number of women who have benefited from the New Deal for Partners is not available.</p>

	<p pid=".1308W.2/21">1. The net cost includes all savings except for additional Income tax revenue, (see note (5). Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&ndash;05 price terms, using the GDP deflator index, rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/22">2. Basic State Pension (BSP) costs are estimated by the Government Actuary's Department, consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions, made using 2002 based population projections.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/23">3. The savings credit is abolished for those aged 80 and over from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/24">4. The savings from savings credit and other income related benefits (guarantee credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) are calculated using the Department's policy simulation model for 2006&ndash;7. It is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated for the first year is constant for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/25">5. (a) The net cost including tax revenues regardless of contribution record in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;1.3 billion. For illustrative purposes, we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&ndash;08 is &pound;1.5 billion and in 2008&ndash;09 is &pound;1.6 billion. Estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/26">(b) The net cost including tax revenues on the current system of entitlement in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;1.2 billion. Again we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&ndash;08 is &pound;1.4 billion and in 2008&ndash;09 is &pound;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/27">(c) Tax revenues have been calculated using the Department's policy simulation model, as this provides information at a household level.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/28">6. (a) All single over 80 year olds have been given the single rate of the guarantee credit and all couples have been given the couples rate of the guarantee credit, split equally between the two, regardless of contribution records.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/29">(b) Category A pensions are increased under existing rules (i.e. relative to the single rate of the guarantee credit) except that in a couple where one person is in receipt of a category B pension, the combined category A and category B pension is increased pro rata relative to the couples rate of the guarantee credit.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.2/30">(c) In both scenarios couples with only one person over 80 years old are treated identically to those where both are over 80.</p>

	<p pid=".1310W.5/22">1. The net cost includes all savings except for additional income tax revenue, (see note 5). Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&ndash;05 price terms, using the GDP deflator index, rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1310W.5/23">2. Basic state pension costs are estimated by the Government Actuary's Department, consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions, made using 2002 based population projections.</p>
	<p pid=".1310W.5/24">3. The savings credit is abolished for those aged 75 and over from April 2006 with no payments to existing pensioners and no new recipients after 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1310W.5/25">4. The savings from savings credit and other income related benefits (guarantee credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) are calculated using the Department's policy simulation model for 2006&ndash;07. It is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated for the first year is constant for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid=".1310W.5/26">5. The net cost including tax revenues regardless of contribution record in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;2.7 billion. For illustrative purposes, we have assumed income tax revenue to be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09. Therefore, the illustrative total net cost in 2007&ndash;08 is &pound;3.0 billion and in 2008&ndash;09 is &pound;3.2 billion. Estimates for later years would be subject to a greater degree of uncertainty. Tax revenues have been calculated using the Departments policy simulation model, as this provides information at a household level.</p>
	<p pid=".1310W.5/27">6. The state second pension is assumed to be unchanged.</p>

	<p pid=".1311W.2/1">The new local housing allowance is being tested in nine local authority areas, for tenants in the private rented sector. The intention is that by paying tenants a flat rate sum of money, based on family size, it will help increase the options open to tenants and provide a much clearer system from the outset for both tenants and landlords.</p>
	<p pid=".1311W.2/2">The nine pathfinders started between November 2003 and February 2004, and therefore it is too early to make any firm assessment about the impact on the choices made by tenants. This will be assessed by the comprehensive and independent evaluation that is in place, to consider the overall impact of the local housing allowance. The first interim evaluation report is due by early 2005.</p>

Accidents for which &quot;excessive speed&quot; was deemed by the police to be one of the contributory factors, though not necessarily the primary factor, accounted for 13 per cent. of all injury road accidents recorded in the police areas taking part in the pilot scheme. The proportion of accidents where 'excessive speed' is coded as a factor rises with the severity of the accident; it applied to 12 per cent. of slight accidents, 19 per cent. of serious accidents and 30 per cent. of fatal accidents in the pilot areas in 2002.</p>

We have also established mechanisms to monitor developments and provide information to the market, particularly through the Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group (JESS); investigated power failures in the UK to ensure that the lessons are learnt for the future; promoted energy efficiency; and further developed our plans for dealing with emergency situations.</p>

	<p pid=".1323W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".1323W.2/2">The Race Relations Act 1976 prohibits racial discrimination in employment (as well as education and the provision of goods and services) and established the Commission for Racial Equality to enforce the Act and provide advice and support to victims of discrimination. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 strengthened the Race Relations Act by prohibiting racial discrimination in almost all public functions not covered by the Race Relations Act and by placing a statutory duty on public authorities to promote racial equality, including in the field of employment. We have further strengthened the law on discrimination by transposing the EU Race Directive into domestic law in the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003. These improve the protection to employees by, for example, reversing the burden of proof in race discrimination cases, introducing a definition of harassment and narrowing the permissible exemptions to the employment provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976.</p>
	<p pid=".1323W.2/3">In addition to the legislative changes, the Government are also implementing the recommendations of the Strategy Unit report&mdash;Ethnic Minorities and the Labour Market. This report makes 11 recommendations to improve equal opportunities in the workplace which are being taken forward by the Home Office and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), but also by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). Implementation of these recommendations will result in better advice and support for employers; increased effectiveness of existing mechanisms to ensure race equality; and increased transparency and awareness.</p>

We last discussed Reverend Damanik's case with the Indonesian ambassador in November 2003. We will continue to remind the Indonesian Government of their human rights obligations and stress to them the importance of a fair and transparent judicial system.</p>

Planning for the school was progressed by the South Eastern Education and Library Board. The board and my Department have been working closely on the project and I can confirm that an agreed overall maximum cost should be finalized shortly and this will enable a contractor to be appointed. Once the contractor is in place, this will allow the design to be finalised and it is hoped to commence work on site, subject to Planning Approval, by around the end of summer 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1336W.5/1">Mirtazapine (Zispin) is included in the review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related antidepressants. The risks and benefits of mirtazapine in children and adolescents have been considered by the expert working group on SSRIs and the committee on safety of medicines. Analysis of controlled clinical trials did not find an increased risk of suicidal behaviour or self harm in the mirtazapine treated group compared to those treated with a placebo. A summary of the paediatric clinical trial data for mirtazapine was published on the website of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in April 2004. The review of a possible risk of suicidal behaviour in adults treated with mirtazapine is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".1336W.5/2">Bupropion (Zyban) has not been included in the review by the expert working group as it is licensed in the United Kingdom as an aid to smoking cessation. Bupropion has recently undergone a Europe wide review of its risks and benefits. The product information for prescribers states that, depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in patients undergoing a smoking cessation attempt. These symptoms have also been reported during Zyban treatment and generally occurred early during the treatment course. Clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of significant depressive symptoms in patients undergoing a smoking cessation attempt and should advise patients accordingly.</p>

The identity card will help front line staff to ensure that these rules are implemented by verifying that people are who they say they are and confirming information provided by individuals. Relevant information could include their nationality, United Kingdom address/es, residential status and how long ago they registered for an identity card. Final decisions on what information will be required and how any checks will work will be made in the light of the feasibility studies and studies of user requirements which are currently underway.</p>

National procurement and implementation by the NHSIA means that registration, access to learning materials, and testing all come at no cost to organisations or individuals other than staff time.</p>

	<p pid=".1349W.0/3">Data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally. The NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for cancer treatment, which may include radiotherapy where this is given as a first definitive treatment. From December 2001, there is a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for children's cancers, testicular cancer and acute leukaemia. From 2002, there is a maximum two month wait from urgent referral to treatment for breast cancer. By 2005, there will be a maximum two month wait from urgent referral to treatment and a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers.</p>

	<p pid=".1351W.9/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> nationals of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta, are no longer be eligible for support from the National Asylum Support Service or a local authority under the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999. This is because of the effect of paragraph 5 schedule 3 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/2">There is no scheme of transitional support for asylum seekers from the EU accession states. Asylum seekers from the eight Eastern European accession countries, namely the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia (&quot;the A8 countries&quot;), will generally be able to take up employment in the UK, providing they register under the Worker Registration Scheme, which will become operational from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. Once they have secured employment and registered under the scheme, asylum seekers from the A8 countries may become eligible for family tax credit and child benefit. If they are on low incomes they can also access housing benefit and council tax benefit. Part time workers may also be eligible for income based job seeker's allowance or income support, provided they meet the usual conditions for those benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/3">Maltese and Cypriot nationals will have the same rights as existing EEA nationals. If they are seeking work they have the right to reside and look for work for six months. If they satisfy the Habitual Residence Test they will be eligible to apply for income related benefits and for social housing and homelessness assistance. Maltese and Cypriot nationals who are not economically active will only have a right to reside if they are self sufficient and are not placing an unreasonable burden on UK social assistance funds.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/4">Support will continue for unaccompanied asylum seeking children until their 18th birthday.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/5">An asylum seeker who is sick or medically unfit for work will be able to remain in the UK if he can become self supporting, for example if he can stay with friends or relatives.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/6">If an accession state national wishes to return to his country of origin, he can seek assistance from the local authority who have a power under the Withholding and Withdrawal of Support (Travel and Assistance and Temporary Accommodation) Regulations 2002 to arrange travel. Local authorities also have the power to provide short-term accommodation and support for families pending return. For the cases that were formerly supported by NASS or by a local authority under the Interim Provisions the Government will reimburse local authorities' reasonable costs in implementing these arrangements. Additionally, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) can make arrangements for their return.</p>
	<p pid=".1351W.9/7">Schedule 3 of the 2002 Act does not prevent the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty if, and to the extent that, its exercise or performance is necessary for the purpose of avoiding a breach of a person's Convention rights or a person's rights under the Community Treaties. Some asylum seekers who are sick or medically unfit for work may be provided with support by NASS or the local authority under the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999 if support is considered necessary to avoid a breach of a person's Convention rights.</p>

Asylum seekers who receive a positive decision on their claim are able to receive income support if they are unable to be self-supporting. With the exception of families including children under the age of 18 support for asylum seekers whose claims are unsuccessful must end no later than 21 days after the receipt of the final decision on the asylum claim. Families currently remain supported until either they leave the country, the youngest child reaches the age of 18 or they fail to comply with directions for their removal.</p>

Returns will be taken forward on a case by case basis and we will only return to particular areas assessed as sufficiently stable, where we are satisfied that the individuals concerned will not be at risk.

	<p pid=".1367W.2/1">Since 2000, research on distraction burglary has been conducted under the Home Office's Reducing Burglary Initiative to help practitioners understand this crime, and to identify and evaluate ways of combating it. A number of reports have already been published. Two further reports, based on projects in Cambridge and Leeds, will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1367W.2/2">This research indicates that most distraction burglaries occur in inner cities. Homes within a mile of trunk roads or motorways are more likely to be targeted, as are areas with a high concentration of older persons and lower value housing. Environmental risk factors associated with an increased risk of distraction burglary include homes in an obviously poor state of repair (neglected gardens and outside maintenance), or with front doors not visible to the street or neighbours.</p>

	<p pid=".1369W.5/1">The Government have made clear that it is planning to build the base for a compulsory national identity cards scheme, but that this will be in two stages. The first will be linked to the designation of existing documents. The second stage move to compulsion would require full debate and a vote in both Houses of Parliament. The Government would only take this step after a rigorous evaluation of the first stage. In particular we would want to be confident that the scheme had rolled out to a significant coverage of the population and the Government were satisfied that the conditions set out in Identity Cards: the Next Steps (Cm 6020) were met.</p>

	<p pid=".1370W.6/1">Identity fraud usually occurs when someone's personal information such as name, address or date of birth is captured without their knowledge and used by someone else to support criminal activity, which could involve deception, financial gain or obtaining other benefits and services.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/2">Measures have been taken to improve the procedures for issuing and checking passports and driving licences, which are the two main official documents that are used currently to confirm personal details and therefore establish identity.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/3">UK Passport Service has produced guidance on keeping passports safe and what to do if they are lost or stolen. The guidance emphasises that a lost or stolen passport increases the likelihood of the holder's identity being misused. It has also developed and deployed a database of lost and stolen passports, which is being shared with border authorities and police worldwide to counter identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/4">DVLA is reviewing the advice that it currently provides to drivers. It is considering what guidance it can offer on looking after licences, including the fact that drivers' identity could be open to misuse if their licences are lost or stolen.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/5">In 2003 Home Office officials worked closely with colleagues in the UK Passport Service and DVLA to support the Association of Payment Clearing Services, CIFAS (the UK's Fraud Prevention Service) and the Finance and Leasing Association to produce &quot;Identity Fraud&mdash;The UK Manual&quot;. The manual provides advice to staff on spotting false UK passports and driving licences and preventing identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/6">We have also looked at legislative changes to make identity theft or fraud easier to prosecute or to ensure that the penalties associated with fraudulent use of documents take account of their use in creating false, or stealing genuine, identities. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and made these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link by fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/7">These measures should help to prevent fraudsters from using driving licences and passports to commit identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/8">We announced in 2003 our intention to create a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause. This offence will provide the police with the means to disrupt the activities of criminals who use false identity documents such as passports and driving licences at an earlier stage of their activities. We published a consultation paper on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April</phrase> on the legislation needed to introduce identity cards. The draft Identity Cards Bill includes the proposed false document offences.</p>
	<p pid=".1370W.6/9">The Home Office has recently established a cross public-private sector work programme to tackle identity theft and identity fraud. The programme co-ordinates existing activity in the public and private sectors and identifies new projects and initiatives to reduce identity fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".1372W.2/1">We have been incrementally developing and implementing policies and, where appropriate, legislative changes, to uphold and enhance border security in response to threats and abuses from 1997 onwards.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/2">Examples include the expansion of the Airline Liaison Officer network which offers vital support and assistance to airlines at key locations overseas and now has an enhanced response capability, and an informed visa strategy designed to consider qualification for entry before arrival and which is kept under regular review. In 2003 we significantly increased the number of countries whose nationals require Direct Airside Transit Visas in a response to an analysis of emerging risks. We have also enhanced and upgraded our intelligence capability to tackle organised immigration crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/3">Other initiatives have represented a more radical development in the approach to protecting border security. Key examples are listed as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/4" class="indent">1998&mdash;the White Paper &quot;Fairer, Faster and Firmer&quot; and in 1999 the Immigration and Asylum Act, set out a new approach to the management of the Immigration Control and those who seek to evade or abuse it. Key initiatives include civil penalties in relation to the transportation of clandestine entrants in road vehicles or rail freight wagons. These measures were brought into force in April 2000 and March 2001 respectively and have had a significant impact on the number of clandestine entrants detected.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/5">The Government's strategy for tackling specifically organised immigration crime is Reflex, the multi-agency forum established in May 2000 which brings together key law enforcement players under the chair of the National Crime Squad.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/6">2001 saw the initial phases of two pivotal initiatives which have fundamentally altered the way we operate border controls by moving elements of that process away from our geographical borders.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/7" class="indent">Juxtaposed Controls&mdash;the establishment of frontier control zones in key locations overseas to enable UK Immigration Officers to consider and decide the admissibility of passengers prior to embarkation for the UK. Such controls have been in operation for some time at Coquelles and Paris Gare du Nord and since <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-01">1 February 2004</phrase> UK immigration officers have also been operating in Calais and Dunkirk. A formal agreement was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-15">15 April</phrase> with the Belgian authorities to establish juxtaposed controls at the Gare du Midi in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/8" class="indent">In Calais, New Detection Technology has capacity to screen 100 per cent. of UK bound freight and deployment of the equipment elsewhere in Europe is well under way.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/9">These initiatives have contributed to a significant reduction in inadequately documented and clandestine arrivals following implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/10">We worked hard with our French partners to achieve the closure of the Sangatte centre in Northern France which had posed a threat to border security, particularly in the Dover area, and was closed at the end of 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/11">Measures to focus the asylum system have ensured that an asylum claim is not seen as a way of circumventing controls on entry. In September 2003 asylum applications were reduced by more than half compared to October 2002 and we continue to give this area the highest priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/12">In 2004 we have begun to roll out biometric (fingerprint) technology to key visa issuing posts overseas and to some specific types of passengers on arrival. The Immigration Nationality Directorate is also working with the other border agencies over the coming months to develop more closely aligned objectives and</p>
	<p pid=".1372W.2/13">priorities in order to ensure co-ordinated, strategically driven operational activity to protect our borders.</p>

The aim is to have a network of induction centres established by the end of 2004. The preferred method of procurement is working in partnership with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1374W.5/2">Two induction centres are already operating successfully. The Dover Induction Centre opened in January 2002. The Yorkshire and Humberside Induction Centre opened in June 2003. The Home Office has also signed a contract, for induction processes and accommodation for 200&ndash;300 asylum seekers, in the Greater Manchester area. This service will be operational in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".1374W.5/3">The network of induction centres will include a broader range of models than originally defined in the White Paper. This allows local authorities to provide induction arrangements that are sensitive to local circumstances. In Greater Manchester the accommodation and resources that will be used for induction are spread across a wide geographical area and wherever possible existing accommodation used to house asylum seekers will be utilised. There will be no overall increase in asylum seekers staying in the region.</p>

	<p pid=".1376W.6/1">The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is aware we are effecting the enforced return of failed asylum seekers to Somalia and we are in contact with the UNHCR on issues relating to this returns programme. In January 2004 UNHCR published a position paper on the return of failed asylum seekers to Somalia and this is taken into account by caseworkers considering the protection needs of individual Somali asylum seekers. As with applications from all nationalities, each asylum (and human rights) claim made by someone from Somalia is considered by the Home Office on its individual merits, in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p>
	<p pid=".1376W.6/2">Individual asylum seekers found by both the Home Office and the Independent Appellate Authority, not to be at risk of persecution and not in need of humanitarian protection are considered for removal on a case by case basis. The Home Office will not return vulnerable groups and will only enforce the return of those Somalis it is satisfied are not in need of protection.</p>

This year more applicants received funding under section 44 than in previous years. RECs still made up the large majority of organisations in receipt of grant from the CRE.

	<p pid=".1378W.8/1">Prior to 1997, the Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976 already prohibited discrimination on racial grounds. The RRA did not specifically refer to harassment, but it was clear from case law that racial harassment was a type of detriment capable of amounting to the kind of less favourable treatment prohibited by the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1378W.8/2">As part of its fulfilment of its obligations under the EC Race Directive, the UK amended the Race Relations Act 1976 (by virtue of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003) so as to make it unlawful to harass a person, on grounds of race or ethnic or national origins, in the areas of activity covered by the 1976 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1378W.8/3">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created new and separate offences where the offences of causing fear and violence or of causing harassment, alarm or distress under the Public Order Act 1986, or the offences of harassment or putting in fear of violence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 were racially aggravated.</p>
	<p pid=".1378W.8/4">Figures for the number of prosecutions in Rochdale for this type of offence are not centrally available. Greater Manchester police figures for harassment offences (published by the Home Office under the requirements of S95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991) show a total of 2,075 recorded offences of this type in the Greater Manchester police area over the period 1999&ndash;2000 to 2001&ndash;02.</p>

In addition, we will be introducing a new pre-marriage lawful status eligibility requirement for marriages involving non-EEA foreign nationals to further deal with those seeking to circumvent immigration controls by entering into sham marriages.

	<p pid=".1384W.2/1">Data on bullying are not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools to tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter for Action and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".1384W.2/2">In November 2003 I launched our anti-bullying charter for schools, which schools are now signing. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. The Charter was launched at the first of the Make The Difference series of regional conferences. The programme of conferences began in November 2003 and culminated with a final event on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-14">14 June</phrase>. These conferences are an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. Details of the conferences can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying">www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying</a>. Our new public information film, &quot;Tell Someone&quot;, also encourages children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied.</p>

	<p pid=".1387W.0/1">The Union Learning Fund (ULF) is a source of funding to help trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their own capacity as learning organisations. It was set up in 1998 and administered by the Department for Education and Skills until March 2003. From April 2003 the Learning and Skills Council has been responsible for the administration of the Fund. As ULF is a source of funding rather than a unit or body, there are no figures relating to full-time equivalent headcount. The Department's annual expenditure on ULF was &pound;2 million in 1998&ndash;99, &pound;3.1 million in 1999&ndash;2000, &pound;3.9 million in 2000&ndash;01, &pound;6.3 million in 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;7.4 million in 2002&ndash;03. Estimated expenditure for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;12.1 million and the budget allocation for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;14.2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1387W.0/2">The Implementation Review Unit was established in April 2003 with a remit to cut red tape and reduce bureaucracy in schools. The Unit has 12 panel members, each serving school staff, who work for the IRU an average 22 days per year. In 2003&ndash;04 the Unit was also served by a secretariat comprising three civil servants employed by the Department, working 0.5, 0.8 and 0.8 of the full-time equivalent, and two seconded advisers working for 20 and 50 days per year. Staffing figures for 2004&ndash;05 will be the same with the addition of another civil servant at 0.5 of the full-time equivalent. Estimated expenditure by the Unit in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;348,000 and its budget for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;500,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1387W.0/3">The National Remodelling Team is an integral part of the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) and we are unable to provide separate figures for the Remodelling Team.

	<p pid=".1390W.2/24">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/25">1. The financial data are taken from local education authorities' Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Up to and including 1997&ndash;98 figures are for Essex LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&ndash;99 onwards parts of Essex LEA became Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock LEAs. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are adjusted to 2002&ndash;03 prices using the March 2004 GDP deflators.</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/26">2. Spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local Government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local Government in 1998&ndash;99. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/27">3. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/28">4. The Outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the expenditure in 2002&ndash;03 is not strictly comparable with earlier years as it includes an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/29">5. Net current expenditure includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1390W.2/30">6. Net current expenditure after recharges was not recorded on RO1 until 1993&ndash;94. Consequently up to and including 1992&ndash;93 net recurrent expenditure is used and consequently figures in those years may not be strictly comparable with figures for future years.</p>

The 10 per cent. increase in core funding rates per qualification for further education colleges includes a 2 per cent. increase to compensate colleges for increases to the employer contribution to the Teachers Pension Scheme; and a 3.5 per cent. increase to reflect the consolidation of previously targeted funds for pay and staff training. The additional resources to schools for changes to the employer contribution to the Teachers Pension Scheme were allocated separately from the qualification rates to schools. The allocation was based on pupil numbers and area costs. The amount per pupil before area cost adjustments was &pound;103 in 2003&ndash;04.

Over the last year the further education (FE) sector and other providers have exceeded expectations in participation, retention and attainment and it is this success that has created pressures on funding for this year. Although we have already invested a record amount in FE this spending review, we have added &pound;130 millionextra to the LSC's budget that will allow allocations for 2004&ndash;05 to be kept on track for all colleges that are performing to target. This is an important extra investment which will also support a process of change and help colleges develop towards a more demand-led system in which colleges are increasingly funded from a variety of sources, particularly from employers.</p>

	<p pid=".1394W.5/1">Research reports commissioned by the ODPM and undertaken by Wilcox and PA Consulting concluded that key worker affordability is at its worst in London and the South East; the areas of the country with the highest house prices. Available evidence suggests that a significant problem for key worker employers is the retention of more experienced/older key workers. Each year, 3,800 teachers (school and FE) leave teaching in London, the South East and East for reasons strongly associated with housing. We therefore determined that our highest priority should be that set of London teachers identified in the London Challenge strategy document as &quot;leaders of the future', who currently leave London teaching in order to afford family homes elsewhere. This group numbers around 500 each year. Second priority is the next group of London teachers (school and FE)&mdash;numbering some 1,750, and the third priority is the remaining group of 1,550, largely outside London. We were clear that teachers in our target groups are largely looking for homes to buy, not rent. For our highest priority group, family homes are the issue.</p>

	<p pid=".1395W.2/1">In September 2003, the LSC published &quot;Successful Participation for All: Widening Adult Participation&quot;, setting out the Council's strategy for extending access to learning. The strategy requires local LSCs to adopt specific measures to support disadvantaged groups. It is being implemented by local LSCs, supported by a regionally held &pound;2.5 million pa Widening Participation Action Fund. Every local LSC has identified groups which are under represented in learning and adopted impact measures for improvement. This work is integral to meeting the objective in the White Paper, &quot;21st Century Skills, Realising Our Potential&quot;, to help individuals to obtain the skills they need to be both employable and personally fulfilled.</p>

	<p pid=".1395W.11/1">I am replying to these three parliamentary questions together as they all have links to the Post-14 Mathematics Inquiry. We are most grateful to Professor Adrian Smith for the work he has put into the report, &quot;Making Mathematics Count&quot;, and for his continued support. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said previously, the issues are complex and need to be considered carefully, particularly alongside the work of the Working Group on 14&ndash;19 Reform. A response is expected shortly. We have already announced that we accept the need for a high level post within the Department dedicated to mathematics and that we plan to undertake a marketing campaign to promote the take-up of mathematics. The post of Chief Adviser for Mathematics has now been advertised and in the meantime Anita Straker of the Centre for British Teachers, has been appointed on an interim basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1395W.11/2">Officials informally met members of the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (ACME) during 2001 while it was being set up and, since 2002, have met the committee on a regular basis to discuss mathematics education. Ministers from this Department and the Department for Trade and Industry have also met ACME. During the period of the inquiry, ACME organised a series of workshops for Professor Smith to develop and discuss key areas. ACME and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) held a joint workshop in March to discuss specific recommendations in the Smith report, which was funded and attended by this Department. Anita Straker, the Department's Interim Chief Adviser for Mathematics, is due to meet the committee later this month.</p>

	<p pid=".1398W.0/1">The results of the 2003/04 PE, School Sport and Club Links survey indicated that 62 per cent. of school children within a School Sport Partnership spend a minimum of two hours in a typical week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum. A copy of the full report has already been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The survey is used to measure progress towards meeting our target to increase the percentage of pupils spending a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".1398W.3/26">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1398W.3/27">1. The financial data are taken from Local Education Authorities' 2003&ndash;04 Section 52 Budget Statement Table 1 submitted to the DfES. Gross figures are provided rather than net as income cannot be split by phase of education. All figures are as recorded in LEAs' Section 52 Budget statements. Figures may not sum due to rounding.</p>
	<p pid=".1398W.3/28">2. In addition to the Total Schools Budget for secondary schools &pound;3,012 million was spent on total LEA central functions and part of this would have been used to support secondary education.</p>
	<p pid=".1398W.3/29">3. Within the schools' budget the amount available for delegation to schools after provision has been made for retained items is known as the Individual Schools Budget (ISB). ISB for secondary schools is &pound;9,985 million of which &pound;1,303 million is supported by the LSC for the funding of education for pupils in Sixth Forms.</p>
	<p pid=".1398W.3/30">4. Total Standards Fund includes: Standards Fund allocation&mdash;Revenue (the Standards Fund allocation that the authority expects to devolve to its schools); Standards Fund&mdash;Non-Devolved (Standards Fund allocations not yet planned to be devolved to schools or to be spent centrally on items in the schools block; and Specific Formula Grants&mdash;Excellence in Cities (expenditure pursuant to a partnership agreement (under the DfES programme known as &quot;Excellence in Cities&quot;) made between the authority, the Secretary of State and one or more of the authority's schools. In previous years this was not a separate line item but was recorded under the Devolved Standards Fund).</p>
	<p pid=".1398W.3/31">5. Total post-16 LSC funding streams comprises of the memorandum items of expenditure included within the Total Schools Budget. The allocation from LSC for 16+ funding is included in (i) within the ISB. The sixth form elements of the provision for pupils with statements, the fees to independent schools for pupils without statements and the fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad is included in other lines within the Total Schools Budget. Consequently the Total Schools Budget for secondary schools comprises of the total of (i) to (iii) plus additional expenditure of &pound;894 million for secondary schools on areas such as SEN, education out of school, school meals, school based strategic management, non-standards fund grants and capital expenditure from revenue.</p>
