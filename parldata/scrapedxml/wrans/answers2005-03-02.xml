	<p pid=".1150W.12/1">I have not had any discussions with the governments of tsunami-affected countries specifically about the representations of women on tsunami reconstruction panels and task forces. However, the Department for International Development (DFID) is working to ensure that the international response to the tsunami, which is being led by the affected governments and international organisations such as the UN and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), focus on helping the poorest people and those often marginalized because of gender, caste, age, ethnicity or religion.</p>
	<p pid=".1150W.12/2">For example, donors and the Government of Sri Lanka have agreed a set of Guiding Principles for post-tsunami relief and recovery. These provide the framework for all Government and donor initiatives and stipulate that the allocation of resources should be strictly guided by identified needs and local priorities, without discrimination on the basis of political, religious, ethnic or gender considerations. The Task Forces will include Government, civil society, private sector and donor representatives and will reflect gender concerns. In India, we are actively engaging with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to ensure that social inclusion and gender issues are central to the reconstruction and livelihoods work that they will be funding.</p>

	<p pid=".1152W.5/1">The UK Government remain firmly committed to the Cairo Programme of Action (POA) and its key goal of reproductive health for all by 2015. The UK believes that sexual and reproductive health are also fundamental human rights. DFID5s recently published position paper on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights makes this position clear and we continue to invest strongly in reproductive health, such as recent multi-year increases in funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF).</p>
	<p pid=".1152W.5/2">Progress on the POA has been made since 1994. The recent regional International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) plus 10 celebratory events in Asia and Latin America strongly demonstrated country ownership and commitment to the Cairo POA and how this has become a platform for real policy change at country level. The UK Government have also advocated vigorously to maintain the ICPD consensus within the UN and elsewhere. Tony Blair was the first Head of State to sign the World Leaders Statement in support of ICPD plus 10. DFID also continues to support country programmes via budgetary support and project funding to NGOs, and agencies such as the Global Fund, active in reproductive health supply security.</p>
	<p pid=".1152W.5/3">The UK believes that sexual and reproductive health and rights are fundamental to attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Progress towards the attainment of the goals is currently being reviewed. The Sachs Millennium Project Review and accompanying Task Force Reports, all emphasise the importance of reproductive health and rights to the attainment of the MDGs. Access to reproductive health, a key feature of the Cairo POA, is identified within the main Sachs report as one of the &quot;quick wins&quot;&mdash;solutions to implement now for speeding efforts to reduce poverty. DFID is therefore working with like-minded EU member states to ensure that positive reproductive health and rights messages strongly appear in the Secretary-General's report which is due in March.</p>

	<p pid=".1153W.2/1">The Iraqi Ministry of Health is leading on the rehabilitation of health services in Iraq, working closely with international agencies including the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Ministry of Health reports that more than 75 hospitals and nearly all the primary care clinics which were damaged or looted during and after the 2003 conflict have been rehabilitated. Further work to construct and rehabilitate hospitals in Iraq is under way, and health services are gradually improving. More than $1 billion has been pledged in donor support to the health sector. In 2003, DFID provided &pound;5 million to the WHO to enable it to assist the Iraqis on health issues, including improving the delivery of drugs and medical supplies. DFID is providing further support through its contribution to the United Nations and World Bank International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, and through the provision of an adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Health on secondment from the UK Department of Health. United States agencies are renovating 19 hospitals and constructing a new Paediatric Hospital in Basra, and the Japanese Government are funding the rehabilitation of 11 general hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".1153W.2/2">The WHO is working to improve primary health care and emergency obstetric provision. The World Bank has agreed an emergency health and rehabilitation project to finance the rehabilitation of emergency services in 12 hospitals. Nevertheless, it will still take several years for Iraq's health sector to recover fully from the under-investment and poor management which it suffered under Saddam Hussein's regime, and approach the standards experienced in developed countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1153W.2/3">Comprehensive figures on the numbers of civic and judicial buildings which have been rehabilitated in Iraq since May 2003 are not readily available. However, considerable progress has been made in rebuilding Iraq's civic infrastructure. In the first year after the conflict, DFID renovated over 50 public buildings in southern Iraq including hospitals, universities and governorate offices, enabling the resumption of public sector work and the continued provision of services to the Iraqi people. United States agencies carried out similar work in other parts of Iraq, are currently renovating buildings for three Ministries in Baghdad, and are planning the construction of new facilities for the Council of Judges, Court of Cassation and Central Criminal Court .</p>

	<p pid=".1157W.5/1">Under Part MA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 local authorities are under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its remediation in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime. DETR Circular 02/2000 &quot;Contaminated Land&quot; contains statutory guidance including detailed liability rules as to who is the appropriate person(s) to bear responsibility for remediation. In line with the polluter-pays principle, this is normally the person who caused or knowingly permitted the presence of the substances causing the problem. Where this person cannot be found, for example because the company no longer exits or has gone into liquidation, the landowner may be the appropriate person, subject to the Act and guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".1157W.5/2">The Act recognises that, particularly in the case of private individuals owning land, costs of remediation might cause hardship. Section 78P(2) of the Act requires local authorities to have regard to hardship and to statutory guidance when serving remediation notices, or recovering costs, and there is provision for remediation costs to be waived or reduced in certain circumstances. Charging notices may be used in certain cases to recover costs where local authorities carry out remediation on behalf of appropriate persons, which allows recovery to be deferred until land is sold. The regime does not provide compensation to any individuals, unless they are required to grant rights in order that remediation can be carried out.</p>

	<p pid=".1160W.8/1">During the Irish, Italian and Dutch Presidencies in 2003 and 2004 there were no Management Committee meetings on this issue. The Management Committee on the application of the &quot;Standardised Reporting&quot; Directive (91/692/EEC) last met in 1997. In 2002 the Commission started work on a new framework for environmental reporting in response to the 6th Environment Action Programme. An Expert Group was set up to discuss Commission proposals for a Directive. This group last met in October 2002. There is as yet no formal proposal for a Directive, and no Management Committee has been convened. In the event of any meeting being scheduled, officials will, as a matter of course, liaise with their counterparts in the Scottish Executive and the other devolved Administrations.</p>

These arrangements worked successfully in relation to the Boscastle and Carlisle floods.</p>
	<p pid=".1166W.2/2">The Environment Agency (EA) is required by section 106 of the Water Resources Act 1991 to carry out most of its flood defence functions through regional flood defence committees (RFDCs). The committees in particular take decisions about the annual programmes of improvement and maintenance work to be carried out by the Agency and oversee other aspects of the Agency's work and operations. RFDCs also decide on such matters as the extension of main rivers, the making and operation of land drainage byelaws and various issues affecting any internal drainage boards in their area. They are required annually to approve estimates of expenditure and to determine the amounts to be levied by the Agency on constituent councils.</p>
	<p pid=".1166W.2/3">Through Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 (PPG25) the Government have given strengthened guidance to local planning authorities regarding inappropriate development in areas of flood risk. The EA (in conjunction with RFDCs) provides advice to local planning authorities on planning applications in areas at risk of flooding and this is used by the authorities in reaching decisions. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Defra have recently consulted on the need to revise PPG25 and whether the EA should be made a statutory consultee on proposals for development in flood risk areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1168W.0/1">Defra does not hold separately, a list of countries that are recorded as having endemic foot and mouth disease (FMD). The internationally recognised central source for official information on the distribution of animal diseases such as FMD is the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Also known as the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE is the world organisation responsible for the collection and dissemination of information on international animal health&mdash;it has a role analogous to the World Health Organisation (WHO):</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/2">Information on FMD can be found on their website, at the following address: <a href="http://www.oie.int/eng/info/enfmd.htm">http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en fmd.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/3">Rather than listing countries in which FMD is considered to be endemic, the OIE lists countries and regions that are considered to be free of FMD, broken down into those that are free and do not vaccinate; and those that are free and do vaccinate against the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/4">European Community legislation permits the importation of meat from certain countries where FMD is present, but only where the disease is officially recognised as being restricted to specific areas and effective movement controls are in place within the country. Imports are permitted either from parts of the country that are free of disease or under strict conditions that ensure the meat does not come from any animal that may have come in contact with FMD before, during and after slaughter. These provisions are in line with the guidelines established by the OIE.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/5">All meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of FMD.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/6">Community legislation does not permit imports of livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs and goats) from countries with FMD.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/7">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of animals and animal products from all, or parts, of that country.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/8">All meat and animals imported into the EU from third countries must enter at designated border inspection posts where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. At least 20 per cent. of consignments of animal products undergo physical checks, and a number of animals in each consignment are physically checked. These checks ensure import conditions are met.</p>
	<p pid=".1168W.0/9">For personal imports meat and dairy products are banned from most countries outside the EU. Customs are responsible for enforcement at the border. Defra and Customs undertake publicity campaigns to make the public aware of the rules relating to personal food imports.</p>

	<p pid=".1169W.2/1">The decision tree published as part of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) contingency plan on the Defra website sets out the factors that the Government would take into account in deciding disease control strategy including vaccination or different approaches to culling in a future outbreak. The disease control strategy adopted will depend on many factors.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.2/2">The EU directive gives greater prominence to the potential use of emergency vaccination in the event of an outbreak as an adjunct to this basic slaughter policy. Article 14 of the directive places a duty on member states &quot;to prepare all arrangements necessary for emergency vaccination in an area at least the size of the Surveillance Zone&quot; as soon as the first case of FMD is confirmed.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.2/3">The Government will consider emergency vaccination as a disease control option from the start of any outbreak of FMD on the basis of vaccinate to live. The vaccines held by the UK are suitable for use in emergency vaccination. This is in line with the recommendations of the main FMD inquiries. The circumstances in which vaccination might be used are illustrated in the vaccination scenarios published last year on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.2/4">The decision tree makes it clear that other forms of culling beyond that on infected premises and dangerous contacts are not ruled out.</p>

	<p pid=".1169W.5/1">The measures that the Government would take in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease are set out in the Defra FMD Contingency Plan, the latest version of which was laid before Parliament at the end of March 2004. These include the immediate imposition of movement controls on all susceptible livestock, strict biosecurity guidance and enhanced options for controlling disease. Vaccination would be considered from the onset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.5/2">We are engaging with operational partners and with stakeholders to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and the measures that would be taken in an outbreak. Plans are also in place in the event of an outbreak to enable a rapid increase in resources and for the implementation of contingency contracts, including that for emergency vaccination. We have revised the instructions for staff and are ensuring that they are trained and equipped to deal with an outbreak of disease. A revised version of the contingency plan, incorporating lessons learned form the national Foot and Mouth Disease Exercise held last June, will be issued for public consultation shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".1169W.5/3">The current FMD contingency plan reflects lessons learned from the outbreaks of FMD in 1967 and 2001. The vast majority of the recommendations of the Northumberland Committee after the 1967 outbreak were applied during the 2001 outbreak. Such elements of the response in 2001 as bringing in senior administrators to allow vets to be relieved of non veterinary duties such as carcase disposal and cleansing and disinfection, and calling in the armed forces, resulted from the experiences of the 1967 outbreak and remain in the contingency plan. Lessons learned from 2001 and from the inquiries thereafter have resulted in the contingency plan including revised policies including the immediate imposition of a GB national movement ban on susceptible animals, closure of footpaths only within the 3 km protection zone and a hierarchy of disposal options for carcases headed by incineration and rendering. They have also led to the inclusion in the plan of senior management structures and systems that would be established in an outbreak.</p>

	<p pid=".1170W.2/1">In 2004 my Department commissioned a review of the literature on the implications of trade liberalisation for sustainable development, which included an initial assessment of the impact on biodiversity in developing countries of freer trade in agricultural products. The report, &quot;The Implications of Trade and Investment Liberalisation for Sustainable Development: Review of Literature&quot;, is available on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid=".1170W.2/2">The Department subsequently has commissioned new research which will include further assessment of the impact on biodiversity of trade liberalisation in agricultural products. The report is expected to be published this July.</p>
	<p pid=".1170W.2/3">In addition, the European Commission has released recently its draft sustainability impact assessment on agriculture which includes a more comprehensive assessment of the impact on biodiversity of freer trade in agricultural products. The draft report is available on the website of the Institute for Development Policy and Management at Manchester University.</p>
	<p pid=".1170W.2/4">The assessments carried out to date show that the impacts on biodiversity of liberalising trade in agricultural products depend upon a range of factors, including the location and type of agricultural activity being undertaken. However, the assessments suggest that there could be negative impacts on biodiversity in some areas and hence a need to develop policies to mitigate any such impacts.</p>

	<p pid=".1173W.2/1">A key objective of the UK Government's timber procurement policy is to encourage the protection of forest dependent peoples' rights and enhance their well-being. By requiring its contractors to supply only timber that has been legally harvested and by preferring timber grown in sustainably managed forests, the Government is helping to achieve this outcome in many producing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".1173W.2/2">The EU public procurement directives ensure that public bodies conduct their procurement in a fair and transparent manner, do not discriminate or create barriers to trade and obtain value for money for taxpayers. In line with the above requirements, the criteria for selecting bidders must be limited to their capacity and ability to supply the product or service, and the criteria for specifying requirements must be limited to relevant technical, quality and performance characteristics that can be objectively measured and priced. The criteria can include relevant manufacturing processes and that enables forest management standards that affect the product to be specified. Protecting and conserving a product's raw material is relevant, measurable and a reasonable demand to make of a contractor. Protecting and conserving the rights and socio-economic well-being of forest dependent people is not something a contractor based in another country could be reasonably expected to undertake. Such social and ethical issues are beyond the capacity of suppliers to control, measure and price. Furthermore, the introduction of non product related issues into contracts would enable contracting authorities to choose their suppliers on the basis of subjective judgements that would jeopardize the fairness and openness that have served the public procurement process so well for many decades.</p>
	<p pid=".1173W.2/3">A public authority can refuse to invite tenders from suppliers who have been convicted of an offence or grave professional misconduct in relation to the conduct of their business and that could include offences relating to the treatment of forest dependent people. Any such refusal would have to be proportionate to the offence.</p>

	<p pid=".1176W.3/2">Working holidaymakers are required to obtain entry clearance prior to coming to the United Kingdom. This allows them to take relevant employment, including as teachers, teaching assistants and as other school staff. No central record is kept by the Home Office of the numbers of working holidaymakers in each part of the work force, including teaching and other jobs in educational establishments, because they do not need separate permission to work after arrival.</p>
	<p pid=".1176W.3/3">After 12 months in the United Kingdom working holidaymakers are eligible for work permit employment in any of the occupations on the list of designated shortage occupations maintained by Work Permits (UK). These include all teaching posts that relate to the provision of compulsory schooling. Working holidaymakers were eligible to switch into these occupations after 12 months in the United Kingdom before the changes announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase>. The effect of these changes on recruitment into teaching roles in the education system is therefore neutral. Non-teaching roles in schools are not generally shortage occupations and so will not feature, but it is unlikely that there will be difficulty in filling such posts.</p>

Instead schools are required to provide access to a minimum of one course in each of the following areas: the arts; design and technology; the humanities; and foreign languages.

Success rates are continuing to improve in colleges and we expect every college to meet or exceed the minimum standard by 2006. On latest data, the percentage of Further Education and Sixth Form Colleges below this standard (for both short and long qualifications) has fallen from 30 per cent. in 2000/01 to 15 per cent. in 2002/03.</p>
	<p pid=".1181W.5/2">Value for money targets for colleges have not yet been set. The Department and LSC will develop and trial new value for money indicators during 2005/06 and implement new measures from 2006/07.</p>

	<p pid=".1186W.3/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1186W.3/18">1. Public spending on health per capita in England will always appear higher because many areas of health expenditure are funded centrally and are not factored into local health authority spending. These include medical research, the funding of Special Health Authorities, NDPBs and some central budgets.</p>
	<p pid=".1186W.3/19">2. Expenditure per capita for health authorities and the North East is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules that are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. Weighted capitation figures are used to determine expenditure per capita&mdash;these are population figures that are weighted to reflect differing needs. Figures are given in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid=".1186W.3/20">3. Figures for 1997&ndash;98 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure that would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>

Under the Paris Club deal, no payments are due from Iraq to Paris Club creditors until 2008. In addition to supporting the IMF and World Bank in providing assistance, the UK has pledged &pound;544 million in direct aid over three years to March 2006, of which over &pound;331 million has been committed.

Inspectors are deployed flexibly across a wide range of inspection, project management and assessment duties, all of which contribute to delivery of nuclear safety assurance, including performance monitoring.</p>
	<p pid=".1197W.5/4">NII does not have a fixed complement of site inspectors, but has a nominated lead inspector for every site. At present some 46 inspectors are employed full-time on site inspections (including investigations). In addition some inspectors normally employed on assessment work are also carrying out site inspections.</p>

	<p pid=".1200W.5/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Burnley constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Lancashire police force increased by 332 from 3,247 to 3,579. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 117 CSOs on Lancashire police force streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Lancashire police force area has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 41 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 39 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/3">Lancashire police will receive &pound;190.8 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 4.31 per cent. (&pound;7.9 million) over last year. Lancashire police also gains around &pound;0.4 million from the amending report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 4.52 per cent. General grants funding to Lancashire has increased by 29.9 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Lancashire will also receive around &pound;17.4 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. One CCTV project in the Burnley CDRP area received a total of &pound;426,000 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 crime and disorder reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;760,658 has been allocated to Burnley CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.3 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office regional director in the north west for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Burnley set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/8">The Government's crime reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Burnley a total of 51 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Burnley has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Lancashire Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;5.47 million, rising to &pound;7.61 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Burnley constituency can be obtained from the Lancashire Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the &quot;futurebuilders&quot; fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1200W.5/17">The Home Office allocated &pound;305,000 community support team funding (2002&ndash;04) for Burnley borough council. This funding covered four strands of work: leadership and change management (focusing on training and capacity building for members and officers) as well as providing managerial support, consultation and communications, youth and conflict resolution and race and community relations work.</p>

	<p pid=".1202W.2/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Huddersfield constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the West Yorkshire police force increased by 104 from 5,209 to 5,313. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 298 CSOs on West Yorkshire streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, West Yorkshire has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 23 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/3">West Yorkshire police will receive &pound;313.6 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 4.95 per cent. (&pound;14.7 million) over 2004&ndash;05. West Yorkshire police also gains around &pound;0.6 million from the amending report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 5.15 per cent. General grants funding to West Yorkshire has increased by 31.7 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, West Yorkshire will also receive around &pound;26.1 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the police authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Four CCTV projects in the Kirklees CDRP area (which includes Huddersfield constituency) received a total of &pound;438,650 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 crime and disorder reduction partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;2.07 million has been allocated to Kirklees CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;1.8 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office regional director in the Yorkshire and the Humber for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Kirklees set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/8">The Government's crime reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Kirklees a total of 66 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase>. Kirklees is also one of 50 communities across the country that have been designated as 'Together Action Areas' and are set to get extra help to tackle antisocial behaviour. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Kirklees has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drugs Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Kirklees Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;2.32 million, rising to &pound;3.06 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in Huddersfield constituency can be obtained from the Kirklees Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/17">To support strong and active communities in which people of all races and backgrounds are valued, in 2003 the Home Office allocated from the Connecting Communities Fund a total of &pound;590,000 to two, three-year projects in the Kirklees area. A Voluntary Action Kirklees project (grant &pound;338,812) is supporting the development of Asian women's networks to promote greater community involvement from Asian women. Outcomes include partnership work with South Asian Healthy Living to run a confidence project and fitness training programmes. A Kirklees Racial Equality Council project (grant &pound;251,718) is being launched in April 2005 and will see a series of seven faith resource centres, reflecting the major faiths, set up across Kirklees, with books, displays and other information materials. The centres will provide a unique educational experience for local school children and others wishing to learn more about faiths and cultures within Kirklees.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/18">Kirklees has also benefited from participation in the 18-month Community Cohesion Pathfinder Programme, established and launched in 2002 by the Home Office and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Kirklees was one of 14 successful Pathfinders and was granted &pound;285,000 to explore the best ways of building strong, active, and harmonious communities. Key outcomes from the programme included the 'Learning Lessons' report, which, by establishing what levels of community cohesion already existed, provided a basis for moving forward; and the &quot;Stories in a suitcase&quot; project, which encouraged people over 50 in the community to create a story board reflecting where they had come from. This project was popular with both white and Asian residents living in Kirklees and helped change local perceptions about the differences between community groups.</p>
	<p pid=".1202W.2/19">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer.

In Rochdale a total of 54 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-17">17 February 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library). Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Rochdale has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drug Intervention Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Rochdale Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;2.04 million, rising to &pound;2.31 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Rochdale constituency can be obtained from the Rochdale Drug Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the 'futurebuilders' fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/17">Rochdale was one of the founder members of the Home Office's Civic Pioneers network which now includes 14 local authorities in England. As a 'Civic Pioneer', a local authority shows its commitment to involving and engaging local people in decision making processes and in the design and delivery of local services, so that their involvement in local decision-making can be more diverse, constructive, sustained and rewarding. Rochdale has pioneered devolution to Area Forums and has been innovative in devising ways to engage and motivate young people at risk of offending, through schemes like Junior Wardens and projects to improve the local environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/18">To support strong and active communities in which people of all races and backgrounds are valued, the Home Office funded a Community Cohesion Pathfinder in Rochdale over 18 months from April 2003. This invested &pound;150,000 via the local authority and &pound;90,000 via voluntary and community sector partners. The Rochdale Community Cohesion Pathfinder focused on the complexity, diversity and distinctiveness of the local communities and put community partnership at the centre of the programme. Activities engaged a broad cross of people in the borough and included cultural and sports projects, local voluntary and community activity and activities developed by young people themselves. Examples of activity are the Sports United project which targeted territorialism and tension among local young people through the medium of sport and the Multi-faith partnership which promoted dialogue, learning and understanding between different faiths. Rochdale local authority achieved Beacon status for community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/19">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer. We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a> .</p>
	<p pid=".1208W.0/20">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

Estimates for the total number of adults living with HIV&mdash;undiagnosed and diagnosed&mdash;are available for the United Kingdom.

	<p pid=".1223W.2/3">Highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) became available in the mid-1990s. HIV infection can be well controlled if infection is diagnosed and appropriate treatment with these therapies is given. There is no sign of any decline in the effectiveness of HAART at a population level. Although it is not possible to estimate precisely the life expectancy of individuals whose HIV infections have been diagnosed and who are receiving HAART, the availability of these treatments has greatly prolonged the life expectancy of those diagnosed with HIV (and AIDS).</p>
	<p pid=".1223W.2/4">In 1990 (before the introduction of HAART), and in people today whose HIV infection is not diagnosed or is not treated, life expectancy varies considerably. It is estimated that the average time between HIV infection and developing AIDS is 10 years and from AIDS diagnosis to death is 18 months to two years.</p>

	<p pid=".1234W.6/1">At HM Naval Base Clyde, nuclear warhead handling, storage, transportation and fitting of components is carried out using rigidly controlled and approved procedures, and staff undertaking these activities undergo extensive training before they are designated competent to carry out the work. The potential risks arising from an accident and human error are therefore very low. It is also highly unlikely that a catastrophic malfunction of a nuclear warhead that involved nuclear yield (a high explosion and the release of radioactive material), would occur, whether onboard a submarine or elsewhere within the Naval Base.</p>
	<p pid=".1234W.6/2">Risks to employees, members of the public and the environment are routinely assessed during preparation of the Hazard Identification and Risk Evaluation (HIRE), which is the responsibility of the local authority and which is a requirement of the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001 (REPPIR). Such planning is based on a vigorous precautionary approach and the chances of any incident happening, for which the REPPIR emergency plans have been prepared, have been assessed as highly unlikely.</p>

	<p pid=".1235W.7/1">The Government conducted a survey of statutory organisations, including the police, together with the community and voluntary sector, in April/May 2004 after the reclassification of cannabis from Class B to Class C to assess the impact of this change.</p>
	<p pid=".1235W.7/2">While the level of response from the various agencies was disappointing, the general view was that reclassification had had little impact on overall attitudes towards cannabis, both among young people and adults. There was no evidence to suggest that consumption had increased or that adults and young people were more open about their use of cannabis. There was however, a view that young people did not fully understand all the various terminology such as &quot;reclassification&quot;, &quot;de-criminalisation&quot; and &quot;legalisation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1235W.7/3">Statistics from PSNI indicate that the number of prosecutions taken against younger people for possession of cannabis ( both actual and pending) has not reduced since reclassification. While separate figures are not kept in relation to adults, there was a small reduction in the number of arrests for possession of Class C drugs, in the three months after reclassification when compared to the three months prior to this change in status.</p>
	<p pid=".1235W.7/4">As this legislative change took place over 12 months ago officials are currently preparing to undertake a further assessment of the impact.</p>

	<p pid=".1238W.18/1">Patients who are also in receipt of certain state benefits, or are on a low income, may be entitled to reimbursement of hospital travel costs. Details are given in leaflet HC 11: &quot;Are you entitled to help with health costs?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1238W.18/2">The present scheme is directed towards those patients who do not have a medical need for ambulance transport, but who have difficulty meeting the cost of travel to hospital. It is not considered appropriate under such a scheme, which is based on financial need, to differentiate between patients with different medical conditions. The Department has no plans to amend the current hospital travel costs scheme to enable all cancer sufferers, by virtue of their illness, to recover the cost of travel to and from hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".1238W.18/3">The new cancer centre in Belfast city hospital, which is due to open in 2006, will include a patient hotel with 29 rooms, where cancer patients will be able to stay free of charge. Relatives will also be able to stay for a small fee. This should help reduce the amount of travelling required by some patients during their treatment cycles, with a consequent reduction in costs.</p>

	<p pid=".1244W.2/2">Central records of the type of applicants for DFG by age are not kept by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

	<p pid=".1244W.2/3">Apart from a disregard in relation to the 30 hour element of working tax credit, this credit is counted as income for the purposes of the DFG means test. This follows the procedures for eligibility for housing benefit and council tax benefit on which the DFG means test is based. The review of DFG is considering the DFG means test and the implications of any changes for the public sector cost of the DFG system will be fully considered.</p>

	<p pid=".1249W.0/1">I promised to write to you in answer to your parliamentary questions regarding the Meden Valley Partnership when my Department had looked closely at the issues you raised.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.0/2">On the important issue of improving communication with residents affected by proposals, you will be pleased to hear that the Meden Valley Board intend to appoint a Community Participation Officer to assist with the consultation process, and that in the short-term Leicester Housing Association will provide a secondee to the project. The Meden Valley Board has also confirmed that it will seek to hold monthly meetings with you, if agreeable, to address the concerns raised by your constituents, and the Community Participation Officer will be involved with these meetings. I hope that you will be able to work closely with this officer who will service the Residents Implementation Groups, which I understand you have played a role in forming through chairing the well-attended public meetings in Warsop Vale and on the Royal Estate. The Community Participation Officer will also help to develop an effective communication strategy with residents affected by the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.0/3">I understand that Meden Valley Making Places Ltd are making good progress on the negotiated acquisition of properties, but I can understand the frustration some residents must feel about the length of time to complete the Compulsory Purchase Order process. To mitigate the negative impact of abandonment, Meden Valley Making Places Ltd is prioritising joint working with the Police and Community Safety Officers to help minimise problems for residents who wish to stay.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.0/4">On the issue of alternative accommodation, I would support the Meden Valley Making Places Ltd's commitment to assisting homeowners and tenants, affected b redevelopment, to secure alternative accommodation on a like for like basis. I am sure that you would agree with this policy. The various options available to residents can be discussed with either Sarah Streater or Shamus O'Leary (Tel: 01623&ndash;847675) at Meden Valley Making Places Ltd.</p>
	<p pid=".1249W.0/5">I hope that you feel we are moving forward in Meden Valley and driving forward the Government commitment to developing sustainable communities.</p>

	<p pid=".1250W.5/1">Along with other Government Departments, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to improving the lives of people across the whole of the UK.

This is a 33 per cent. increase in real terms. Pendle council has received an average annual increase in formula grant since 1997 of 6.0 per cent. Residents of Pendle have also benefited from Lancashire county council's average annual increase in grant of 4.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".1255W.5/1">It is very hard to give precise figures for the number of casualties caused by the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. We do not have figures of casualties going back to 1997 on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1255W.5/2">The social impact of the conflict has been very considerable. Maoist violence, especially in the villages and towns outside the district capitals, has caused widespread fear among the locals. It has caused major disruption to key services, including education and health. Many schools have been forced to close and many locals have been forced to flee their homes to avoid being attacked by the Maoists or forcibly recruited into their ranks. Many thousands of people have been displaced, many are homeless and without access to basic amenities. The security forces' failure consistently to respect human rights has compounded the situation. The conflict has further damaged the social fabric by increasing ethnic divisions and reducing the rule of law in the rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1255W.5/3">The conflict has also done great damage to the Nepalese national economy, which has become one of the prime Maoist targets. The Maoists regularly extort money from local businesses and industries and prevent businesses from running normally. They enforce frequent strikes (bandhs) and seek to prevent the free movement of goods. Hundreds of companies have been forced to close. The Maoists have also attacked the tourism industry infrastructure, so damaging a key contribution to the Nepalese economy. Unemployment is now a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1255W.5/4">The Government of Nepal have employed a mixture of military and diplomatic measures since 1997 to combat Maoist activity and bring about a successful resolution of the conflict. There have been two rounds of negotiations, in 2001 and 2003, both of which broke down.</p>
	<p pid=".1255W.5/5">We continue to advocate the need for an inclusive peace process, involving all of the constitutional forces. We consider that this offers the only way to resolve the conflict in a manner which will lead to a stable Nepal based on a multi party democracy, good government and respect for human rights.</p>

Immediately following the King's takeover of power on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase> I issued a statement in which I said that this action would increase the risk of instability in Nepal and undermine the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. A copy of the statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases">www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases</a>. Such is the level of our concern that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary temporarily recalled our Ambassador in Kathmandu for consultations on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-14">14 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1257W.2/2">The UK has consistently held the view that there can be no military resolution and that a negotiated political settlement involving all parties offers the best way to resolve the ongoing conflict and to create a stable democracy with good governance and respect for human rights. We will continue to press all parties for an early return to negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".1267W.8/2">National Statistics on take-up of major DWP benefits are published annually by the Department in Income Related Benefits: Estimates of Take-up. These are based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the relevant year and take account of both entitled non-recipients and non-entitled recipients. However, they are published significantly in arrears and the 2004&ndash;05 statistics will not be available for some time.</p>
	<p pid=".1267W.8/3">In the interim, indicative take-up figures may be calculated by comparing estimates of entitlement with actual numbers of claimants in the administrative data. Projections from the Department's Policy Simulation Model, based on the 2002&ndash;03 Family Resources Survey, have yielded estimates of entitlement. This methodology suggests an initial view that in 2004&ndash;05 take-up is over 80 per cent. for those on the guarantee element, and could be as high as 90 per cent. for single women pensioners entitled to the guarantee element.</p>
