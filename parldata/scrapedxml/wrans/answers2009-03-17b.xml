	<p pid="b.969W.6/3">The Ministry of Defence takes the issue of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) seriously and we are continually looking at ways of monitoring and mitigating the risk in operational scenarios, including the development of improved hearing protection, while not hampering the operational effectiveness of combat personnel. A study is currently under way to determine the numbers of personnel that have been affected by acute acoustic trauma, the results of which will help to inform future policy on treatment and the provision of specialist support. I have met with The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) to discuss how they can further assist us and it has been agreed that they will have a representative at the Surgeon General's Working Group on Hearing Loss.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000W.2/1">The EU's third energy package, which is expected to be adopted mid-year, should improve the regulatory, legal and technical framework needed to promote interconnection. It includes a duty on national regulators to support the development of cross-border transmission capacity to enhance the integration of national markets and an obligation on the European Transmission System Operators to develop an EU-wide network development plan identifying the need for further interconnection. The UK is also actively engaged with the European Commission and other member states on action arising from the second EU Strategic Energy Review (SEER2) and its related Green Paper on energy networks of November 2008. SEER2 highlights the need for improved interconnection both within the EU, especially for member states on the EU's periphery, and into the EU from third countries. The UK will provide a formal response to the Commission on the Paper before the end of March 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.5/2">At the pre-Budget report (PBR), the Government announced &pound;3 billion of capital spending stimulus, including a &pound;535 million green stimulus to support low carbon growth and jobs, while still meeting ambitious long-term goals. This green stimulus supports programmes such as Warm Front and Decent Homes that include the installation of thermal insulation and efficient heating technologies, to save energy and cut CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.5/3">PBR's green stimulus included &pound;100 million of new funding for Warm Front, on top of &pound;50 million brought forward to support the economy. This will reduce CO2 emissions and help around 60,000 low-income households cut their energy use through insulation and improved heating systems. For 2008-09, &pound;50 million of the new stimulus funding was added to existing Warm Front funding for the year of &pound;345 million. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-25">25 January 2009</phrase>, over &pound;346 million had been spent on Warm Front, with 6 per cent. of households assisted located in the North East region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.5/4">In PBR the Government also announced additional brought forward expenditure to sustain and accelerate the Decent Homes programme in 2009-10. Significant elements of this will support expenditure above existing national budgets provided to schemes previously identified by partners in the ALMO and transfer programmes. Additional brought forward capital, up to a maximum total value of &pound;100 million, will be available to ALMOs in 2009-10 and the HCA has written to ALMO chief executives on the process for accessing this. A proportion of this spending will go towards energy efficiency and heating technologies, although we are unable to identify funding for this separately.</p>

	<p pid="b.1001W.2/1">We have fully supported the proposal for an International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

	<p pid="b.1001W.2/2">We have been very keen on joining and have been in close contact with the German government on the details of the new organisation. For example, we have been talking to Germany about how IRENA can contribute to the roll-out and deployment of renewables and how we can help to get other countries such as Canada, China, Japan, India and the US to join. We are also talking about how we can make sure that IRENA works closely with, and avoids overlap and duplication with, other international bodies and organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership (REEEP). The IEA has a good understanding of the potential for renewable energy and its technology roadmaps published in its Energy Technologies Perspectives 2008 set out what needs to be done. The policy and analytical expertise of the IEA needs to be used by IRENA to accelerate deployment of renewables sources of energy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002W.7/3">The London G20 Summit at the Excel Centre in east London, which will hold both the conference and a media centre, is therefore vitally important on the global stage. The current estimate of &pound;1.1 million for the space required should be considered in this context.</p>

In 2008, beekeepers in England benefited from nearly 23,000 colony inspections and an extensive programme of training, including over 800 technical events to date, delivered by the NBU to help improve disease control through good apiary management. Implementation of 'Healthy Bees', a 10-year plan to protect and improve the health of honey bees in England and Wales will help beekeepers develop their skills and thus continue beekeeping.</p>

However, Animal Health gives every cattle owner advance notification of the two to three-month period in which their test must be completed. These notification letters also make it clear that herd movement restrictions will be applied immediately a test becomes overdue&mdash;this provides motivation for herd owners to get tests completed on time, and reduces the risk of disease spread from herds with an unknown TB status. Veterinary practices are also advised of the test due dates for their client's herds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1017W.3/1">As part of DEFRA's Waste and Resources Evidence Programme, we have undertaken the project 'Carbon Balances and Energy Impacts of the Management of UK Waste Streams' (WR0602), and evaluated it through peer review. An additional project, 'Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Biowaste Management' (WR0210), is in the final stages of completion following peer reviewers' comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/2">The DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Programme (WRAP) has carried out a range of studies in this area which are available on their website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/3" class="indent">WRAP (2006) Environmental Benefits of Recycling;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/4" class="indent">WRAP (2008) Life Cycle Assessment of Mixed Waste Plastic Management Options;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/5" class="indent">WRAP (2008) Life Cycle Assessment of Plasterboard;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/6" class="indent">WRAP (2008) CO2 Impacts of Transporting the UK's Recovered Paper and Plastic Bottles to China.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/7">WRAP's research has found that for most materials, the emissions from transportation are far outweighed by the savings from processes avoided by recycling. This is true even when exporting materials to the far east.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/8">The Environment Agency carried out research into emissions from recycling plant and fuel consumption for collecting waste in relation to its life cycle software, Waste and Resource Assessment Tool for the Environment (WRATE), which uses the data to estimate the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from different waste management systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/9">The Carbon Trust, in association with DEFRA, has co-sponsored the development of PAS (Publicly Available Specification) 2050&mdash;Specification for the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services&mdash;through the British Standards Institution. This specification details a method for the assessment of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases arising from all processes in the supply chain of goods and services, which includes recycling and the transport activities. Through its application, businesses can understand the carbon impact of their products and ultimately follow this up with tangible ways to cut carbon emissions across the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/10">As part of the development and implementation of PAS 2050, the Carbon Trust has carried out research into the different methods used to measure these emissions, and sought to understand different stakeholder views of these methods; however, the Carbon Trust has not undertaken or evaluated specific research into the CO2 emissions from recycling and transportation of recyclable waste. Following the publication of PAS 2050, the Carbon Label Company has carried out further research into different methods of measuring emissions from recycling and transportation of recyclable waste to support its implementation.</p>

This equates to the hours provided by around 4,000 doctors in training.

In 2009-10, a further &pound;200 million has been included in PCT revenue allocations, of which &pound;150 million will flow through tariff income to trusts and the remaining &pound;50 million in PCT revenue allocations will be targeted to trusts according to strategic health authority (SHA) direction to support trained doctor solutions, particularly in paediatrics and anaesthetics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030W.8/3">The Department has estimated that the full cost of implementation could be around &pound;300 million per year.

	<p pid="b.1031W.8/1">Obesity in adults is measured using Body Mass Index (BMI). It compares weight to height by dividing the weight measurement in kilograms, by the square of the height in metres. BMI is the internationally recognised standard for identifying overweight and obesity. An adult who has a BMI equal to 30 or greater is classified as obese.</p>

	<p pid="b.1032W.2/1">The current mechanisms in place for entitlement to free prescriptions on the basis of a low income are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1032W.2/2">(1) People receiving the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.1032W.2/3" class="indent">income support,</p>

	<p pid="b.1032W.2/16">Prescription prepayment certificates (PPCs) for three months or 12 months are available for anyone who is not otherwise entitled to free prescriptions. PPCs offer savings to anyone who needs four or more prescription items in three months or 14 or more items in 12 months. 12 month PPCs may be paid for by 10 direct debit instalments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1032W.2/17">We recognise we need a fairer system of prescription charging. That is why the Prime Minister announced in September last year that exemption from prescription charges would be extended to cancer patients and to patients with other long-term conditions. In this way, we will alleviate the financial burden for those suffering from ill health.</p>

	<p pid="b.1034W.2/23">The advertising explained that the payment would be made separately from the usual Christmas bonus and could be received at any time between January and March.

	<p pid="b.1034W.2/24">The additional Christmas Bonus payment was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his 2008 Pre-Budget Report as one means of providing short-term support to help vulnerable groups through the economic downturn.

	<p pid="b.1036W.0/1">The Department provides directly, or supports the provision of, information on financial matters through a range of initiatives. All of these benefit older people, and some are designed specifically for them. All of this activity contributes to the goal, encapsulated in PSA 17, to tackle poverty and promote greater independence and well-being in later life, although no quantitative assessment of the impact of financial literacy on these outcomes has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.0/2">First, through the 'Now Let's Talk Money campaign', the Department has engaged with many partner organisations and forged links with over 4,000 intermediary organisations. One contract was awarded to encourage advice agencies and credit unions to target older people, whilst also encouraging older people to take up the advice which is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.0/3">The Department is also working closely with HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority on the Money Guidance pathfinder that will launch later this spring in the north-west and north-east of England and will provide impartial financial guidance to up to 750,000 people in these regions. The guidance will be delivered by telephone, face to face, and on the internet. Face to face provision will be delivered by a range of partners, including third sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.0/4">The pathfinder will be supported by The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS), an independent body that provides information and guidance across the full range of pensions issues. TPAS is funded by the Department. Its running costs are then recovered from the general levy on pensions schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.0/5">Further information on pensions, and saving for later life will be provided through the comprehensive communication strategy that the Department is developing to support the introduction of pension reforms that will extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time. This effort will draw on lessons learned from the Pensions Education Fund&mdash;a three-year UK-wide initiative using third sector organisations to test approaches, in a workplace setting, to provide information on saving for retirement. It involved a series of 26 pilot projects, 10 of which include older people aged 50 years or more in their target group.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.0/6">The Pension, Disability and Carers' Service provides older people with essential information on their entitlement to pensions and related benefits in later life. Its Local Service visits approximately 13,000 older customers each week, providing a holistic financial assessment and benefit service targeted at vulnerable older people. It delivers direct access and assistance to customers so that they receive benefits and services, promoting their independence and security. Information and guidance is also available through the Pension, Disability and Carers' Service contact centres and websites, on Directgov, and in leaflet form. Services on offer include the forecasting of state pension entitlement, based on an individual's contributions record, and the tracing of lost private pensions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1037W.5/2">Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 places a duty on authorities, including local authorities, to consider the likely crime and disorder implications of the functions that they carry out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/3">Local housing allowance is normally paid direct into bank accounts so the instances of issuing local housing allowance cheques should be minimal. Not being able to open a suitable bank account was accepted under the safeguards as grounds for reverting to payment of local housing allowance to the landlord, particularly in the case of people living in housing in multiple occupation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1037W.5/4">We do not collect any statistical information from local authorities specifically on instrument of payment fraud. However, the potential of fraud is expected to be very small given the drive for direct payment into bank accounts and the provisions of the safeguards which allow for reverting to payment of local housing allowance to the landlord in certain circumstances. We are closely monitoring how the scheme is working in practice and will undertake a review during the first two years of national operation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1038W.11/2">In pension credit the first &pound;6,000 of capital is fully disregarded (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes). For each &pound;500 (or part of &pound;500) above this level we assume notional income at a rate of &pound;1. There is no upper capital limit in pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/3">Receipt of the guarantee credit passports recipients onto full housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/4">In housing benefit and council tax benefit there is a capital limit of &pound;16,000, which means that people with capital above this level will not normally qualify for benefit. Capital of &pound;6,000 or less is ignored (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes). For those customers who have reached the age to qualify for pension credit notional income is assumed on capital between &pound;6,000 and &pound;16,000 at a rate of &pound;1 per week for each &pound;500 or part of &pound;500.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/5">The tariff income formula is not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing capital. It provides a simple method of calculating the weekly contribution that people with capital in excess of &pound;6,000 (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes) are expected to make from their resources to help meet their normal living costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/6">As there is no link with actual market rates, tariff income rules are not adjusted when interest rates change. If you were to calculate an implicit rate for pensioners, based on capital of &pound;6,500 it would be 0.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/7">In answer to part <i> (a)</i> of the question, abolishing the current capital disregard and assuming notional income at a rate of &pound;1 for each &pound;1,000 of capital or part of &pound;1,000 for pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit would save the Exchequer approximately &pound;70 million per year (2008-09 prices). However, pensioners with savings of less than &pound;6,000 would be worse off. Removing the current disregards would mean that all those pensioners with modest savings, who currently have no income assumed from capital, would see their benefit reduced. Retaining the current disregards and calculating national income based on bands of &pound;1,000 above the level of the disregard would cost the Exchequer approximately &pound;170 million per year (2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/8">In answer to part <i> (b)</i> abolishing the tariff income rules, but retaining the upper capital limits in housing benefit and council tax benefit, would cost approximately &pound;550 million per year (2008-09 prices).</p>
	<p pid="b.1038W.11/9" class="indentitalic"> Note:</p>

	<p pid="b.1041W.0/2">We have not invited local authorities to bid to bring forward Building Schools for the Future (BSF) funding, because the strategic planning that underpins BSF means it is not a suitable programme to act as a fiscal stimulus. BSF typically involves the building of entire new schools; so design and planning need care and time. Accelerating the construction would curtail this planning and would thereby jeopardise the quality and transformational nature of the programme. We are however working with partnerships for schools to simplify procedures and accelerate delivery, and the procurement process has already been accelerated and costs reduced.</p>

Dorset was allocated advances totalling &pound;12.0 million, of which &pound;9.0 million is for the local authority, and &pound;3.0 million for schools as an advance of devolved formula capital to be used by schools for their local priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/2">We recognise that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the third sector have a particular role as providers of learning to disadvantaged people, including disadvantaged young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/3">DIUS is currently developing a Department wide Third Sector Strategy which will address how we work with the third sector across the range of our policies and programmes. We aim to ensure we make best use of the potential of the third sector to contribute to meeting our skills agenda through its ability to engage with disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/4">To help ensure that the skills of people in the third sector are developed, DIUS, in conjunction with Office of the Third Sector, has supported the establishment of &quot;Skills&mdash;Third Sector&quot;, a new sector skills body. Skills&mdash;Third Sector will work with employers in the sector to identify and meet learning needs of the sector and work to increase take-up of training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/5">DIUS is already supporting small and medium employers to meet the training needs of their staff in a range of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/6" class="indent">In the White Paper &quot;New Opportunities&mdash;Fair Chances for the Future&quot; the Government have outlined a commitment to ensure young people who are persistent NEETs (not in education, employment or training) have the right support and incentives to move off benefits, or out of inactivity, into education, training or work. Part of our offer includes initiatives we are supporting through small and medium employers, such as local employment partnerships and apprenticeships, which we have reformed and expanded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/7" class="indent">DIUS published &quot;Skills for Life: Changing Lives&quot; this month, which sets out our refreshed strategy for helping people at disadvantage through lack of basic skills. This strategy will ensure that SME employers and employees can access Skills for Life courses at all levels up to and including Level 2, and drive improvements in provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/8" class="indent">Train to Gain is the Government's flagship service for employers, including SMEs. Train to Gain provides learning opportunities for all employees, including those disadvantaged in the workplace. Train to Gain is available to employees and volunteers in the third sector. The new package announced for SMEs in October 2008 includes additional flexibilities for SMEs including bite size learning and funding for learners who already have qualifications. From December 2008 the new flexibilities for SMEs were available to all paid employees in third sector SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1051W.0/2">At the beginning of the three-year spending review period 2008-09 to 2010-11, the Department allocated devolved capital funding to Sutton and other local authorities for the whole period, on the basis of forecasts local authorities supplied to the Department. All basic need resources designated for additional pupil places are allocated at the beginning of the period so that authorities can plan ahead and the Department does not hold back additional funding to meet unexpected changes in demand. Where an increase in demand does arise, local authorities are expected to use their other capital allocations to help meet any shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.0/3">We do not hold contingency revenue funding for additional primary school places. The organisation of a local authority's schools is for the authority to manage within the revenue and capital funding provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.0/4">School revenue funding to local authorities is based on actual pupil numbers recorded in the January school census. For 2009-10, a local authority's funding will be based on pupil numbers from January 2009. As a result, increases in pupil numbers up to that point, will be reflected in the authority's funding. If pupil numbers in a local authority's schools increase by more than 2.5 per cent. between January and the start of the academic year in the September following, the authority automatically receives additional funding for each pupil above the 2.5 per cent. threshold.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.0/5">The Department is working on means of taking account of projected demographic change in capital allocations for the year 2011-12 onwards.</p>

EFS comprised school functions and local education authority (LEA) central functions, whereas DSG only covers the school functions. The DSG is based on each local authority's spend on schools in 2005-06, uprated each year for cost pressures and adjusted for changes in pupil numbers. LEA central functions are still funded through the Local Government Finance Settlement but cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. For information, the EFS figures for Sefton for 1997-98 to 2005-06 were:</p>

	<p pid="b.1056W.7/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on the proportion of its income a charity can derive from the state whilst maintaining its independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1056W.7/4" class="indent">As the regulator, we see independence as key to charitable status. All charities must be independent of government and other funders, and the trustees of a charity are bound to act solely in the interests of the charity and its beneficiaries, complying with charity law and the requirements of the charity's governing document. It is for the trustees alone to decide on the most appropriate sources of funding for their charity, and this can include funding mainly or wholly provided by a public body. Where a charity receives funding from a public body the trustees must be satisfied that this does not impede the charity's independence. We produce guidance for charity trustees on this subject and I have arranged for copies of:</p>

	<p pid="b.1057W.2/1">There is no policy requirement for Government Departments and Executive agencies to advertise their vacancies on the Recruitment Gateway. However, the expectation is that all civil service jobs should be advertised on the Gateway.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057W.2/2">Government Departments and Executive agencies have delegated responsibility for recruitment advertising. Each Department determines its own policies on where they advertise their vacancies and have responsibility for assessing the equality impact of those policies.</p>

The civil service redeployment policy is comparable to the policies of other companies and organisations in handling surplus staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1057W.2/4">The Civil Service Recruitment Gateway has published a total of 8,456 vacancies in the past 12 months, of which, 4,474 were advertised to the general public and 3,982 within the civil service.

	<p pid="b.1063W.3/2">The Department does not routinely monitor or enforce the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 and has no express remit to do so. The regulations apply to providers and they must make decisions based on their own circumstances, the courses they run and their own legal advice. Ultimately, interpretation and enforcement will be for the courts to decide. Detailed guidance for the benefit of providers and learners alike is set out on the website of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1063W.3/3">I am aware that a number of providers, including further education colleges and local authorities, have been withdrawing fee concessions for older learners in the belief that the Regulations prohibit such positive action. The guidance makes clear that age-related practices like fee concessions may be objectively justified where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and it will continue to be the learning provider's decision as to whether or not they wish to offer these subsidies to individuals.

	<p pid="b.1071W.2/1">The interest rate to be charged on mortgage-style student loans is set out in the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 and the Education (Student Loans) Regulations 1998, which provide for a link to the retail price index (RPI). Specifically, the interest rate for an academic year is the annual movement in the RPI for the year to the previous March. Thus, the interest rate of 3.8 per cent. for the 2008/09 academic year reflects movements in the RPI for the year to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1071W.2/2">The interest rate for the 2009/10 academic year, starting in September 2009, will reflect the RPI for the year to March 2009. Consistent application of the RPI meets the intention that, in fairness both to the borrower and to the taxpayer, over the lifetime of the loan, the borrower will repay in real terms no more than was borrowed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1071W.2/3">The interest rates applicable to mortgage-style loans for each academic year since 1998 are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1073W.5/1">We recognise that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the third sector have a particular role as providers of learning to disadvantaged people, including disadvantaged young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/2">DIUS is currently developing a Department wide Third Sector Strategy which will address how we work with the third sector across the range of our policies and programmes. We aim to ensure we make best use of the potential of the third sector to contribute to meeting our skills agenda through its ability to engage with disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/3">To help ensure that the skills of people in the third sector are developed, DIUS, in conjunction with Office of the Third Sector, has supported the establishment of &quot;Skills&mdash;Third Sector&quot;, a new sector skills body. Skills&mdash;Third Sector will work with employers in the sector to identify and meet learning needs of the sector and work to increase take-up of training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/4">DIUS is already supporting small and medium employers to meet the training needs of their staff in a range of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/5" class="indent">In the White Paper &quot;New Opportunities&mdash;Fair Chances for the Future&quot; the Government have outlined a commitment to ensure young people who are persistent NEETs (not in education, employment or training) have the right support and incentives to move off benefits, or out of inactivity, into education, training or work. Part of our offer includes initiatives we are supporting through small and medium employers, such as local employment partnerships and apprenticeships, which we have reformed and expanded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/6" class="indent">DIUS published &quot;Skills for Life: Changing Lives&quot; this month, which sets out our refreshed strategy for helping people at disadvantage through lack of basic skills. This strategy will ensure that SME employers and employees can access Skills for Life courses at all levels up to and including Level 2, and drive improvements in provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1073W.5/7" class="indent">Train to Gain is the Government's flagship service for employers, including SMEs. Train to Gain provides learning opportunities for all employees, including those disadvantaged in the workplace. Train to Gain is available to employees and volunteers in the third sector. The new package announced for SMEs in October 2008 includes additional flexibilities for SMEs including bite size learning and funding for learners who already have qualifications. From December 2008 the new flexibilities for SMEs were available to all paid employees in third sector SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1086W.5/2">Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, Crime and Disorder Partnerships (or Community Safety Partnerships in Wales) were required to report annually to the Secretary of State on their activities. This duty was repealed in 2007 in recognition that partnership working practices had matured, to reduce bureaucracy and to enhance the response to the local community's needs. It was replaced by statutory requirements for CDRPs/CSPs to produce a strategic assessment identifying local community safety priorities and a partnership plan which sets out the approach for addressing these priorities and is published locally (in summary form). Hallmarks of Effective Partnerships were also introduced to drive up standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1086W.5/3">Regional Government offices' provide a link between CDRPs/CSPs and central Government and have a key role in improving the effectiveness of partnerships. They work closely with partnerships to monitor their work in relation to local and national priorities, and provide support and guidance on the implementation of the hallmarks of effective practice.</p>

In order to identify how many individuals who have been detained under immigration powers were previously convicted of a criminal offence within the United Kingdom which resulted in a custodial sentence and how many of those were subsequently granted bail it would be necessary to cross reference UK Border Agency records with those held by the Police which would incur a significantly disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1094W.2/2">The Chief Executive has regularly written to the Home Affairs Select Committee in order to update them with all of the most robust and accurate information relating to foreign national prisoners. She has explained that those who are detained have the right to apply for bail to the independent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. When the Agency believes that the individual concerned presents a risk of harm to the public, it will robustly contest the application for bail. The Agency will continue to pursue removal action where appropriate.</p>

My Department is currently consulting on new freedoms that would help councils build more council homes. Under the proposals, councils would keep all the rental income from new homes they build, and the full capital receipts if those homes were sold in future under the right to buy. This extra revenue and capital could be used by councils to help build more council housing. We are also inviting councils to bid for Social Housing Grant. Previously local authorities have not been able to get this funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1100W.12/3" class="indent">Your Parliamentary Question on what the Audit Commission's evidential basis was for the use of its statutory powers to obtain the personal bank account details of Arun councillors has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.12/4" class="indent">The request is not limited to councillors. All payroll data is treated in the same way whether it is a salary, members' allowance or other remuneration. Payroll data is one of the key sets of data matched under the National Fraud Initiative (NFI). For example, by matching payroll data to Housing Benefit claimants' data, we can identify potential fraudulent claims or overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.12/5" class="indent">NFI data processing looks at whether the bank account number and sort code is the same or different in the data provided. This information is then converted into a flag of either 'Yes' the bank details are the same on each data set or 'No' the bank details are different. It is this flag that is included in the NFI reports that helps those participating in the NFI exercise to prioritise cases where income has, for example, potentially been withheld (e.g. in an undeclared bank account). This data is highly significant in the fight against fraud and, in a previous NFI exercise, this information led to the detection of an additional bank account containing capital in excess of &pound;100,000 that was not declared by the housing benefit claimant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.12/6" class="indent">Although the bank account and sort code are included on the payroll data specification, the name in which the bank account is held is not collected so the Audit Commission cannot make a connection to other account holders or transactions. All the data collected for the National Fraud Initiative is treated with the utmost sensitivity and its use is strictly controlled as set out in the Code of Data Matching Practice, which was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July 2008</phrase>. In line with the Code, all original data provided to the Commission will be destroyed and rendered irrecoverable by the Commission at the end of the exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.8/1">The Government regard the disabled facilities grant programme as an important means to help disabled and older people continue to live as independently as possible by having their homes adapted. That is why we have increased the budget to enable more older and disabled people to receive the assistance they require. The effect of the annual grant increase will in part be assessed through the collection of data showing the number of grants awarded. We do not collect data on the time it takes an authority to deliver a disabled facilities grant as circumstances will vary from case to case but recognise that due to budgetary pressures delays in delivery can sometimes occur. The increase in the budget should help to address delays. Other data collected from local authorities will give an indication as to the effect of the wider changes made to the programme such as the relaxation of the grant conditions. We have also set up a group of nine local authorities to evaluate some of the changes to the programme announced in February 2008. The local authorities are assisting with the piloting of the removal of the grant ring fence. The pilot will run for 18 months and a full evaluation will follow prior to any possible implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1104W.5/1">The Department recognises that seaside towns have a distinctive role to play in sub-regional and regional economies. It supports efforts by the regional development agencies (RDAs), which receive the majority of their funding from CLG, to ensure that seaside towns in their regions are helped to achieve their full economic potential. Initiatives such as the New Deal for Communities, Working Neighbourhoods Fund, and the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative are also benefiting some seaside towns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.5/2">Local area agreements (LAAs) are helping local authorities, including those with seaside towns, to work alongside partners to improve public services and the quality of life for people living and working in their areas. Multi area agreements (MAAs) are enabling some seaside towns, such as Bournemouth and Poole, to develop stronger approaches to improving local prosperity. The Government Office for the South West is currently working closely with Torbay on plans to set up an Economic Development Company to promote economic growth and regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.5/3">The cross-Government working group on coastal towns, led by CLG, in partnership with the RDA Coastal Areas Network, is identifying areas where more can be done and to highlight existing best practice. This includes supporting work by the Coastal Areas Network to help coastal areas address employment and skills challenges.</p>

Get advice now&quot;, which has been widely circulated to national advice and support services.

	<p pid="b.1111W.2/1">There are no plans for Government to give local authorities greater powers to set business rate locally. The Lyons Inquiry into Local Government considered the case for returning business rates to local control. Its analysis concluded that this would not be appropriate at the current time. The Government agreed. However, Sir Michael Lyons did recommend introducing a new local flexibility to set a supplement on business rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1111W.2/2">In October 2007, alongside the 2007 pre-Budget report and comprehensive spending review, the Government published &quot;Business rate supplements: a White Paper&quot;.

We do publish re-offending statistics broken down by the length of prison sentence awarded, as shown in the following table.

	<p pid="b.1124W.0/1">Our assessment of the effectiveness of restorative justice for adults following the fourth and final report of the evaluation of the crime reduction programme restorative justice pilots is that it can deliver high levels of victim satisfaction and can be a positive service for victims if delivered appropriately and sensitively. It may also help to reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.0/2">We have already published &quot;Best Practice Guidance for Restorative Practitioners&quot;, which provided the basis for National Occupational Standards, a benchmark for the quality of delivery of restorative justice. We have also produced web-based guidance for local criminal justice boards, &quot;Restorative Justice: Helping to meet Local Needs&quot;. The latest research findings, together with the best practice guidance and the guidance to local criminal justice boards, have been widely disseminated, including to regional offender managers and regional commissioners, so that they can be taken into account in future business planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1124W.0/3">We are now considering what further encouragement we can provide to support the continued growth of adult restorative justice, in particular as a means of improving victim satisfaction with the criminal justice process. The National Criminal Justice Board has encouraged the local criminal justice boards to consider how restorative justice approaches for adult offenders could contribute to delivering on their priorities, particularly on victim and public confidence, and be included in their delivery plans. We are currently working with stakeholders, including the Restorative Justice Consortium, to develop a victim focused adult restorative justice strategy which will build on the learning from the pilots.</p>

In addition to the extensive information and advice available, Business Link provides a brokerage service to more specialist support. Business Link is also the main access point for the new streamlined Solutions for Business portfolio, which brings together all publicly-funded support under an easily recognisable brand identity; and provides access to the specialist services of other organisations whether in the public sector, such as the Manufacturing Advisory Service, or the private sector. Business Link's directory of business organisations can be searched online. Businesses in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also access local business support networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1126W.2/2">The Business Link service in England is delivered by operators under contracts let by the nine regional development agencies. Business link services are delivered under a framework agreement that describes the range of services that should be delivered. In addition (<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a>) website content managers and lead policy Departments work closely, using formal procedures, to ensure all information available to businesses on the website is accurate and up to date.</p>

Many other workers also use this important flexibility and so we are firmly of the view that this right should remain.
