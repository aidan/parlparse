We are now considering how best this approach could be put into action.</p>

	<p pid="c.2W.2/1">In October 2005, the Thai Burma Border Consortium estimated that there were 540,000 displaced people in Eastern Burma. Of these, 340,000 were living in ceasefire areas; 108,000 were in State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) relocation sites; and 92,000 were hiding in conflict areas. DFID's approach to providing assistance to these IDPs has been to work inside Burma&mdash;including assistance through local civil society groups (DFID has established effective relationships with a range of ethnic minority and other groups), through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and by trying to improve access to displaced people to benefit from our project activities. These are not the only mechanisms through which donors can help (many, for example, fund cross-border teams operating from Thailand) but they enable access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through mechanisms which are much less-well supported by other donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.2W.2/2">However, these extremely vulnerable people are very difficult to access&mdash;both cross-border from Thailand and from inside Burma&mdash;and there are currently no comprehensive figures on how much aid reaches them. We are in discussion with groups both inside and outside Burma to try to identify how we can increase the amount of assistance that reaches displaced people and we will be reviewing the nature of our own support before the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.3W.6/1">Internally displaced people in Burma are not a homogeneous group. In October 2005, the Thai-Burma Border Consortium, a Thailand-based non-governmental organisation which receives DFID funding, estimated that the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in eastern Burma was at least 540,000. This comprised approximately 340,000 people in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities, 108,000 villagers who had been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into designated relocation sites and 92,000 civilians hiding from the Burmese Army in areas most affected by armed conflict. The recent military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of civilians hiding in conflict areas by as many as 18,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.3W.6/2">DFID provides assistance to IDPs through a number of different routes within Burma. DFID's provision of emergency assistance to IDPs hiding in conflict areas is through local community groups inside Burma. DFID's support to IDPs in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas in eastern Burma is through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to which we provide &pound;500,000 a year, of which approximately 75 per cent. is attributable to work with displaced people in this area. In addition, our health, education and rural livelihood projects provide assistance in eastern Burma, and support internally displaced people in temporary settlements and designated relocation sites, as well as other vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.3W.6/3">It is not possible to provide an estimate of the percentage of IDPs in Burma who can be reached by aid delivered inside the country. This is primarily because it is extremely difficult to gather reliable statistics about the demographics of the population in Burma and often of the origin of project beneficiaries. We believe that it is not currently possible to reach all IDPs either cross-border from Thailand or from inside Burma&mdash;and that each approach enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means.</p>

With this support, volunteers organised by the DFID project provided sustenance, shelter and basic household equipment to thousands of people.</p>

	<p pid="c.8W.2/2">The Government believe that disabled people must be included in efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the internationally agreed millennium development goals (MDGs). We recognise that the needs of disabled people must be addressed across all the MDGs to ensure their achievement in an inclusive manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/3">The Department for International Development's (DFID) approach to disability is set out in an Issues Paper&mdash;&quot;Disability, Poverty and Development&quot;&mdash;published in 2000; copies of which have been deposited in the Libraries of the House. DFID seeks to take account of disability issues across all its activities, as well as supporting a specific range of activities to empower disabled people. In September 2005, DFID also published a policy paper on social exclusion, entitled &quot;Reducing Poverty by Tackling Social Exclusion&quot;; again, copies of this document have been deposited in the Libraries of the House. This sets out actions that DFID is taking, or plans to take, to tackle the social exclusion faced by many poor people, including disabled people, to make a real difference to their lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/4">The Government are actively supporting the drafting of a United Nations International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The purpose of the convention is to enable disabled people across the world to have the same access to human rights protection as non-disabled people. If the convention is adopted, it will enable Governments to be called to account for their record on protecting disabled people from human rights abuses and help raise the profile of disability issues worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/5">DFID also seeks to work with our international partners&mdash;including UN agencies, the World Bank and partner Governments&mdash;to gain further support for tackling issues of disability and other forms of social exclusion. However, we do not believe this requires the creation of a new MDG and furthermore, it could also detract from efforts to mainstream disability issues across all the MDGs.</p>

	<p pid="c.8W.5/12">All DFID's bilateral expenditure is allocated to specific Input Sector Codes, and these figures are based on this information. However, as water and sanitation initiatives are so cross-cutting, this approach is not sensitive enough to identify all expenditure in this area. DFID has therefore done further research to produce a more detailed analysis of its water and sanitation expenditure. DFID does not allocate its multilateral aid by sector, but we have taken steps to estimate this for water and sanitation. Based on these figures, DFID's total expenditure on water and sanitation was &pound;221 million in 2003-04, an increase from &pound;147 million in 2002-03.</p>

We anticipate that meeting the commitment will require an increase in expenditure through all funding mechanisms, including our own bilateral programmes, but also through encouraging others such as the World Bank and the EU to do more in water and sanitation.</p>

Major steps have been made recently in this direction but the cost of the CAP to consumers and taxpayers is still very high in relation to the public benefits which it delivers.</p>

We are working closely with the Commission and member states on the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which will help strengthen the scheme post-2012. We are participating fully in the process to develop a second European Climate Change Programme, designed to deliver ambitious cuts in emissions in the medium and long-term.

Centralised media expenditure in 2003-04 was noticeably less than previous and recent years, and reflected an uncharacteristic dip in total communications expenditure for that year. Defra underwent significant structural changes in 2003-04 which was the main reason for the temporary decline in expenditure, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.15W.2/2" class="indent">Changes in managing &quot;statutory notice&quot; advertising, which accounts for 83 per cent. of annual media spend. The change in process, and handover between agencies was reflected in minimal levels in advertising activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.16W.2/1">The definition of operator in the environmental liability directive suggests that all occupational activities (including doctors, veterinarians and farmers) fall within the scope of the directive. The Government cannot amend the definition to exclude specific occupational activities.

	<p pid="c.16W.2/2">In respect of strict liability, genetically modified organisms fall within the scope of the directive and genetically modified vaccines may do so by virtue of the provisions relating to dangerous substances.

	<p pid="c.25W.3/2">The most significant change has been the introduction of the single payment scheme which was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> and replaced at least 11 direct payment schemes, which had previously existed under the European Common Agricultural Policy. It has brought the benefit of a single annual application form instead of a series of claim forms with different rules, deadlines and, in some cases, claiming frequencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.25W.3/3">The launch of Environmental Stewardship in March 2005 took forward two of Defra's flagship schemes, countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas. Environmental Stewardship has three strands: entry level stewardship is open to all in farming, organic entry level stewardship is available to those wishing to farm organically, and higher level stewardship provides more resource in return for more specific environmental benefits in high priority situations.</p>
	<p pid="c.25W.3/4">In addition, Defra has made a commitment to reduce administrative burdens on farm businesses by 25 per cent. and we are undertaking a number of projects to look at the scope to consolidate and reduce the number of forms that farmers have to complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.25W.3/5">For example, the whole farm approach is expected to significantly reduce the bureaucracy farmers currently face. By streamlining regulation and offering a range of innovative online services the whole process of dealing with Government will become more efficient and user friendly&mdash;ultimately providing a range of benefits that will help to support a sustainable food and farming industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.33W.2/1">There are already a number of programmes in place that help councils and bus companies devise innovative ways of increasing bus patronage.</p>
	<p pid="c.33W.2/2">Councils have been able to apply for Kickstart and Rural and Urban Bus Challenge funding to pump-prime bus services that have the potential to increase patronage. DfT awarded &pound;20 million for Kickstart schemes in 2005-06 to fund 43 bus services that could become self-sustaining. Between 1998 and 2003 the Rural and Urban Bus Challenge supported over 400 projects at a cost of &pound;163 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.33W.2/3">In addition, the Government have provided &pound;350 million for 2006-07 and a further &pound;367.5 million for 2007-08 to fund free off-peak local bus travel for people aged 60 and over and disabled people. This will be extended further to national bus travel from April 2008, for which the Treasury has earmarked up to an additional &pound;250 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.33W.2/4">Also, all bus operators receive Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) which provides a rebate of about 80 per cent. of the duty paid by them on the fuel they use, with 100 per cent. rebate for environmentally friendly fuels. The budget for BSOG in England for 2005-06 was &pound;380 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.33W.2/5">The Transport Innovation Fund is a new approach to transport investment which is not geared to particular modes, but will support measures which help to tackle congestion and promote national productivity. Up to &pound;200 million of the fund has been made available specifically to support packages of measures that will address congestion in towns and cities through demand management and public transport improvements, including better bus services.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.5/1">Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) is the independent health and safety regulator for the railways, covering the safety of the travelling public and employees. HMRI was transferred from the Health and Safety Executive to the Office of Rail Regulation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.5/2">The incident occurred when a northbound Victoria Line train was held in the tunnel between Highbury and Islington and Finsbury Park stations at around 00.30 am on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">Tuesday 30 May</phrase>. This was the penultimate passenger service of the day. The problem required the traction current to be switched off and when repairs were completed normal passenger services had ceased and engineering hours started on the line. Delays then occurred as due to safety procedures the current could not be switched back on to move the train until it was confirmed that no workers were on the line. Eventually passengers were taken off the train and walked back to Highbury and Islington station before 03.00 am.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.5/3">HMRI and London Underground Ltd. (LUL) have both investigated this incident. LUL have now modified their procedures and decision-making processes, particularly for incidents within one hour of engineering hours. This should ensure that protracted delays in detraining passengers do not occur in the future. HMRI will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these and other procedures which relate to the evacuation of passengers from trains.</p>

	<p pid="c.39W.0/1">As we set out in the Department's Five Year Strategy and in the Green Paper &quot;A new deal for welfare: empowering people to work&quot;, we have a long-term aim of reaching employment equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. In order to achieve this we will reduce by one million the number on incapacity benefits, help 300,000 lone parents into work and increase by one million the number of older workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.39W.0/2">Because 80 per cent. employment is relative to the size of the future population, the total required increase in employment is dependent on population projections, which are revised regularly. Using the latest Government Actuary Department projections, employment would now need to increase by more than 2.5 million in order to achieve 80 per cent. in the long term. This is because the Government Actuary Department has increased their projection of the &quot;working age&quot; population.</p>

However, our long-term aim of 80 per cent. employment is unaffected, and the commitments in the Green Paper to reduce by one million the number on incapacity benefits, help 300,000 lone parents into work and increase by one million the number of older workers will still be delivered.</p>

They are based on sampling exercises and so are subject to sampling and other uncertainties. Sampling uncertainty is expressed in the form of confidence intervals; these have not been provided in these tables.<br/> 2. Income support, jobseeker's allowance and pension credit figures come from the National Statistics report &quot;Fraud and error in Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Pension Credit from April 2004 to March 2005: Full report&quot;, published more recently than the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account.<br/> 3. Disability living allowance fraud and error figures come from the National Statistics report &quot;Fraud, error and other incorrectness in Disability Living Allowance&quot; covering the period 2004-05. The 'customer error' overpayment figure includes around &pound;580 million (7.9 per cent. of DLA expenditure) which was removed when reported in the Departmental Resource Account. These were cases where the change in customer's needs may have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer's change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct.<br/> 4. Incapacity benefit estimates from the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account. Fraud and customer error estimates from April 2000 to March 2001, official error from April 2003 to March 2004.<br/> 5. Housing benefit estimates from the National Statistics report &quot;Fraud and Error in Housing Benefit April 2002 to March 2005&quot;. They are made up of reviews of around 85 per cent. of HB expenditure (used for measuring performance against the relevant PSA target to reduce fraud and error in HB) combined with more approximate estimates of error in the remaining 15 per cent. of expenditure. For further details on this, please see the relevant National Statistics reports.<br/> 6. Council tax benefit estimates from the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account. Council tax benefit has not been measured by the Department and was assumed to have the same levels of fraud and error as the latest housing benefit estimates available at the time (October 2003 to September 2004).<br/> 7. Child benefit is administered by HM Revenue and Customs and is a matter for HM Treasury.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.43W.2/6" class="indent">The cost of administering the Child Support Agency in 2004/05 was &pound;325.6m. Figures for 2005/06 will be available when the Annual Report and Accounts is published. A change in accounting policy proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions, and confirmed by National Audit Office, will lead to a restatement of 2004/05 expenditure reported in the Agency's annual accounts. This reflects the incorporation of costs associated with the modernisation programme in the accounts of individual Agencies rather than charging such costs directly to the central Departmental Resource Account. It is expected that the restated 2004-05 figure will increase expenditure to around &pound;425m. Costs for 2005/06 will be prepared on the same basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.45W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Hilary Reynolds:</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As he is currently out of the country, I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many single parents receive the &pound;5 deduction which claimants on benefit have to make towards Child Support Agency maintenance payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/6" class="indent">You also asked how many people on benefit are liable for Child Support Agency maintenance payments; and how many of this number have automatic deductions made against them.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/7" class="indent">The Agency records information in terms of cases rather than parents. Additionally the &pound;5 deduction from benefit only applies to the new scheme. My answer is therefore provided on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/8" class="indent">In order to obtain the benefit status of non-resident parents associated with new scheme cases, it has been necessary to match data from the Agency's administrative systems with data from the benefits system administered by Jobcentre Plus. The latter set of administrative data is published quarterly, and the latest information available is for November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/9" class="indent">At the end of November 2005, there were 70,000 new scheme cases involving a non-resident parent (NRP) in receipt of Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance or Incapacity Benefit with a positive maintenance liability. Of these, 54,000 had a deduction for benefit as the specified method of collection.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/10" class="indent">The number of new scheme cases with a deduction from benefit that at the Agency was collecting maintenance from was 26,000,</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/11" class="indent">It should be noted that although a case can have a liability to pay the &pound;5 deduction from benefit, the full amount may be owed to more than one parent with care. In this case the liable amount will be divided between the cases for which the non-resident parent has a liability.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/12" class="indent">It should also be noted that there are also a small number of NRPs (the number of which cannot be quantified) who receive other benefits against which the Agency has a claim; namely&mdash;Retirement Pension, Pension Credit, Bereavement Allowance, Widowed Parents Allowance/Pension, Incapacity Benefit, Carer's Allowance, Severe Disablement Allowance, Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, Maternity Allowance, War Disablement or War Widows Pension, also certain training allowances. However, it is not possible to provide information on these cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.45W.3/1">Staff in the Department for Work and Pensions have access to 32 holiday playschemes, five supported nurseries/cr&egrave;ches and six on site nurseries.

	<p pid="c.45W.3/9">The Department spends approximately &pound;1,200,000 on child care provision per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.3/10">Existing child care provision available across the Department has been developed according to local business need and is managed and funded from local budgets. As a result the Department has a varying range of subsidies and charges in place. Examples of subsidies and charges include &pound;6 per day per child for nurseries, &pound;4 per day per child for Holiday Playshemes, 35 per cent. of the cost of a holiday play scheme place. Pro rata subsidies are in place in a number of local areas for siblings.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.3/11">The Department will also shortly be implementing a Childcare Voucher (Salary Sacrifice) Scheme. This will be rolled out with the new payroll system provided by the Resource Management System (RMS) which is scheduled for release in August 2006. This scheme will offer the advantage of supporting parents to make their own choices about where and what type of child care they want for their child.</p>

	<p pid="c.49W.3/1">Like all other customers, people aged 50 and over can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/2">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 150 people in Kingston and Surbiton. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &pound;1,500 for training of which up to &pound;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/3">People aged 50 and over, including those in Kingston and Surbiton, are also eligible for help from new deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months, and who have not previously participated on new deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the gateway stage of the new deal 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/4">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the new deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Kingston and Surbiton was not part of the pilot, however, interim pilot data have yielded positive results and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be commencing a phased national rollout.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/5">Between 1979 and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits trebled. Growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly, and in November 2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. Although 46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age, between 2000 and 2005 the number of people in the 50 plus age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity benefits caseload.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/6">Like other age groups, people aged 50 or over who are on IB will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008, including Kingston and Surbiton. Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a 'Choices Package' of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.49W.3/7">Our Age Positive Campaign works with employers and others to promote the business benefits of an age diverse work force and best practice in recruitment, training and promotion. In May 2005 we launched the 'Be Ready' national information campaign to raise employer awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities to support the recruitment and retention of older workers in advance of age legislation due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.50W.2/1">Area-based employment initiatives continue to be important, particularly in our most deprived communities. The Department's priority is to ensure that all initiatives are more effectively targeted at those with the greatest degree of labour market disadvantage. This means that we constantly have to review our programmes and services to ensure that they provide good value for money and continue to meet the needs of our customers. Area-based initiatives such as Action Teams and the Working Neighbourhoods Pilot have, to date, helped over 170,000 people in some of our most deprived communities move into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/2">Many of the practices and ideas developed by Action Teams have been integrated into Jobcentre Plus mainstream programmes and services. Examples include outreach work in local communities and the greater discretionary funding that is available to advisers. We also aim to build on lessons learnt from the recent Working Neighbourhoods Pilot.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/3">Our successful Pathways to Work pilots have been acknowledged internationally as the best way of helping people on incapacity benefits back into work quickly and many of the pilots are located in areas with high levels of incapacity benefit claims. Much of the success of Pathways is directly attributable to the partnership approach at the local level with strong advocacy from local partners, access to a wide range of specialist expertise, and a unified complementary approach. It is this partnership approach that we are extending further with our Cities Strategy. Private and voluntary sector providers currently deliver and support a number of different programmes within our Pathways to Work pilots. We will shortly be announcing the future roll-out of Pathways.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/4">Our future strategy will build on the success of Action Teams, and other community-based initiatives; including the introduction of a Deprived Areas Fund (DAF) from October 2006, which will provide Jobcentre Plus with the flexibility to decide how funding could add value locally against a continued central objective of increasing the employment rate in the local areas. This fund will enable districts to target resources where they are most needed. Funding will be allocated at a district level, to enable Jobcentre Plus District Managers to exercise greater discretion over how the funding should be utilised in their area. DMs will use their knowledge of the local labour market, coupled with evidence of 'what works' to support the needs of local residents.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/5">Partnership working with local government is especially important to DWP in promoting the economic vitality of localities. Local area agreements (LAAs) have been devised to provide a common and simple framework that leads to central Government, local authorities and partners agreeing local outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase> the Chancellor announced the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI). Its purpose is to release the economic and productivity potential of the most deprived local areas through enterprise and investment&mdash;thereby boosting local incomes and employment opportunities and building sustainable communities. The proposed fund will distribute up to &pound;50 million per year for 2006-07 rising to &pound;150 million by 2008-09, and will be distributed through local area agreements (LAA).</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/7">As proposed in the Green Paper, the creation of 'Cities' pathfinders from 2007 will be charged with increasing employment and reducing social exclusion in our most deprived communities. In these areas, a consortium of local partners will be invited to join up and plan the delivery of their individual efforts and resources, with a strong focus on outcomes combined with greater opportunity for local flexibility and innovation. This approach will provide a real focus for local efforts to help people move back into work, so that the current patchwork of programmes and support, provided by a number of organisations, can be delivered in a more integrated, individually-focused and locally responsive way.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.2/8">The Deprived Areas Fund, along with our strategy for 'Cities' and local area agreements will play a significant role in increasing local employment rates; ensuring those most disadvantaged in the labour market can receive the help and guidance they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) seeks an effective and constructive engagement with its three recognised trade unions. We provide allowances of 0.2 per cent. over staffing costs (equating to around &pound;5.5 million of public money) to fund the cost of employee trade union representatives, in order to ensure proper engagement. Recent evidence of constructive consultative relationships include: a three-year pay deal negotiated and agreed with the unions; a &quot;seeking to avoid compulsory redundancies&quot; agreement signed in November 2004 which has the confidence of all parties and has enabled us to make significant staffing reductions without dispute; and a re-launch of our attendance management policy in July 2005 with a joint statement with the unions.</p>

	<p pid="c.59W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what the main causes for delay in applications for Jobseeker's Allowance were in the last month for which information is available; how many delays fell into each main category; and if he will make a statement. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.0/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is transforming the service it provides by making it available via the telephone, via the internet and through the personal service offered to people in Jobcentre Plus offices. We are also committed to implementing a major efficiency programme to deliver headcount savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.0/5" class="indent">The precise nature and extent of the issues which can cause delay varies between locations and stage of roll-out, and as some of these issues are inter-related and overlap, it is not possible to provide the specific information requested. However, we have put action in hand to address the delays, including the launch of a National Action Plan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Senior operational managers provided a formal assurance at the end of February that they were complying with all elements of the National Action Plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.0/6" class="indent">We have also undertaken the considerable task of moving a large number of staff into new posts in our contact centres, and delivering the training necessary to operate the new processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.0/7" class="indent">The chief operating officer is monitoring performance very closely and is addressing performance variations in benefit clearance times in specific locations and the actions required to clear backlogs. It should be acknowledged that concentrating on backlogs of work may initially cause average clearance times to rise. In order to focus management attention on this issue, the actual average clearance times measure of 12 days for Jobseeker's Allowance claims, has been added to the suite of Jobcentre Plus Targets for 2006-07</p>

	<p pid="c.62W.2/1">The White Paper 'Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system' (Cm 6841) sets out a package of proposed reforms. It includes a number of measures which would help to make the system more flexible, and make national insurance credits more valuable and more generous.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/2">The proposed reduction of the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension to 30 is a very significant change that makes the system more flexible; it allows people to undertake a variety of activities during their working lives, and still be able to build a full basic state pension. This would be particularly beneficial to women.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/3">Credits would be made more valuable by removing the first contribution condition, so that credits count towards pension entitlements in exactly the same way as paid contributions for the first time. This clearly signals that social contributions are rewarded and recognised by society in the same way as paid work. The credits would be awarded on a weekly basis only to the extent needed for the year to become a qualifying year.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/4">In addition to making credits more valuable, the credits system would be made more comprehensive and generous, by reforming home responsibilities protection into a weekly credit and introducing new weekly credits for parents and carers&mdash;aligned in BSP and S2P and these would count towards satisfying the qualifying years in the same way as paid contributions.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/5">Assuming the White Paper proposals are implemented in full, the new credits to be introduced are shown in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.62W.2/8"> <td></td> <td><i> BSP</i></td> <td><i> S2P</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.62W.2/9"> <td>Carer's credit (20 hours' caring)</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.62W.2/10"> <td>Parent's credit</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.62W.2/11"> <td>Foster carer's credit</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/14">All the credits will be awarded on a weekly basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/15">There will be no specific circumstances in which state second pension will accrue without there being entitlement to basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.2/16">Circumstances in which credits are currently awarded towards basic state pension are listed in the following table. Whether there is also eligibility for state second pension, if credits are awarded throughout the tax year, is also noted.</p>

	<p pid="c.70W.2/18">In both Bury St. Edmunds constituency and Suffolk county council area the stock of VAT registered businesses has increased each year since 1997, as registrations have exceeded de-registrations throughout this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.70W.2/19">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.71W.3/2">Against direct benefits of between &pound;160 million and &pound;340 million per annum there are a small number of provisions in the Bill that might in principle increase compliance costs. The direct costs associated with the Bill are expected to be in the range &pound;8 million to &pound;47 million.

	<p pid="c.71W.3/3">The additional costs of &pound;6 million to &pound;36 million are associated with the amendments to the &quot;Exercise of Members' Rights&quot; provisions made in the House of Lords. The direct cost estimates have been provided by stakeholders and are sensitive to assumptions such as the percentage of indirect investors opting to exercise rights. We will seek to revise those amendments during consideration of the Bill in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="c.76W.5/1">The Government are committed to funding the full costs of the decommissioning and clean-up of the historic civil nuclear liabilities by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The Consolidated Fund is the mechanism for funding this. Under the 2004 Spending Review the NDA received a budget of &pound;2.2 billion for 2005-06&mdash;about half of which was to be raised by the NDA's commercial activities. Following the successful conclusion of the EC State Aid Review on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-04">4 April 2006</phrase>, financial responsibility for decommissioning BNFL sites has passed to the NDA under the Energy Act 2004. Until this point BNFL held nuclear funding assets of some &pound;17.3 billion on its balance sheet to fund future decommissioning costs. Following the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning liability to the NDA, these assets have been transferred back to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.76W.5/2">There are separate arrangements for funding the decommissioning of British Energy nuclear sites. Since privatisation in 1996, British Energy has been making contributions into a segregated decommissioning fund. As a result of the restructuring, which completed in January 2005, British Energy will make enhanced contributions into the fund and Government will underwrite the fund to the extent that its liabilities outweigh its assets. On recent valuation, the assets of the segregated fund total some &pound;8.1 billion, the majority of which relates to the value attributed to the fund's 64.6 per cent. convertible stake in British Energy.</p>

	<p pid="c.80W.2/28">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register may not have closed. Only 1.8 million out of the 4.3 million businesses in the UK (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.83W.6/1">As an employer, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is subject to duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which requires us to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. These may include adjustments to physical features of premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.83W.6/2">The principle of &quot;reasonable adjustment&quot; is fundamental to the Act and factors such as the practicability of making an adjustment and the extent to which it overcomes the difficulties faced by the disabled person may be taken into account in determining what is reasonable. As the Disability Discrimination Act requires adjustments that are reasonable in the individual circumstances, it is not prescriptive about the level of access to buildings which must be provided for disabled people, and there are no disability access regulations made under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.83W.6/3">However, Part M of the building regulations aims to ensure that people, regardless of disability, age or gender, should be able to gain access to, and within buildings, and use their facilities, both as visitors and as people who live or work in them. The provisions of Part M apply only to new buildings and those non-domestic buildings undergoing alteration, change of use or which are being extended. Crown-owned or occupied buildings are exempt from the building regulations but it is the Government's policy for their buildings to comply with the regulations where there is no reason not to.</p>
	<p pid="c.83W.6/4">DCMS is currently undertaking a major refurbishment of our main Cockspur Street offices. We have given careful consideration to the needs of staff and visitors and are making many improvements to the building aimed at improving access for all. For example, all workstations will be fully adjustable; primary and secondary circulation routes are being widened and all will exceed the standards set by British Standard BS8300. There will be accessible signage, toilets and meeting rooms with induction loops on all floors.</p>

	<p pid="c.91W.8/1">The Government welcome the role of the credit union movement in helping to promote financial inclusion and contributing to choice and diversity in the financial services sector. The Government aim to encourage credit unions to be sustainable professional bodies so they can more effectively meet their members' needs and assist the financially excluded on a long-term basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.91W.8/2">Some of the Government action to facilitate this since 1997 includes bringing credit unions under the regulatory supervision of the Financial Services Authority in 2001, and using a regulatory reform order in 2003 to allow credit unions greater operational flexibility. More recently and following consultation with the sector and consumer groups, the Government introduced legislation increasing the maximum permitted interest rate on loans, from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. per month, in order to provide flexibility to lend to more people on low incomes. In addition, credit unions are now able to offer cash ISAs.</p>

	<p pid="c.101W.3/1">The Department collects data on the number of interventions provided but not on the number of young people receiving support. In the year 2005-06 18,849 young people were counted in the Connexions cohort of young people in the borough of Lewisham. They received a total of 22,488 interventions. The Department does not hold this information at constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="c.101W.3/2">Departmental guidance is that to count as an intervention there needs to be some element of assistance involving a substantial or meaningful exchange with the young person. As a rule of thumb this should be of enough significance to be noted in their client record. It would normally exclude straightforward referrals to specific opportunities e.g. job submissions, the provision of factual information and simple follow up to find out if the young person still wanted assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.103W.5/2">Following wide consultation on these changes the LSC has considered representations from key stakeholders and has agreed to allow some local discretion in 2006/07 to provide limited support for this provision depending on the assessment of need. Where this provision is part of a coherent curriculum offer supported by a clearly stated rationale then the provision will remain eligible for LSC funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.103W.5/3">The LSC is committed to carrying out an impact assessment of these changes working with key stakeholders and partner organisations. The LSC will continue to monitor the position but feedback from individual colleges indicates that many will continue to offer health and safety courses to employers, mainly on a full cost basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.106W.8/1">Responsibility for encouraging long-term unemployed people to return to education and training is shared between the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.8/2">Both Departments, along with their respective delivery agencies Jobcentre Plus (JCP) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), are working closely together to ensure that long-term unemployed people have the skills they need to secure sustainable and productive jobs. There has already been significant progress in joint working between the LSC and JCP and the Hartlepool area is now covered by joint delivery planning in order to meet local employment and skills needs. As part of this joint delivery plan, the LSC Tees Valley is currently piloting access trials to enable JCP customers in receipt of allowances to access LSC-funded provision. This enables customers to continue to receive their allowances while improving their skills with recognised qualifications and improve their employability.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.8/3">The Government's Skills Strategy sends out a strong signal about the priority we attach to helping adults with few or no qualifications to attain a platform of wider employability skills. All those on jobseeker's allowance or income-related benefits and their dependants receive free tuition in further education, in addition to the support available through their local JCP office. Unemployed people also have access to in-depth advice about their education and training options through the Learndirect one-stop telephone and on-line advice service.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.8/4">The Government do, however, recognise that more needs to be done to tackle long-term unemployment and published a Green Paper in January 2006, &quot;A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work&quot;, including measures to help low skilled adults secure employment through the New Deal for Skills. These include piloting skills coaching in a number of JCP districts and our latest evidence shows that skills coaching is helping long-term unemployed people improve their employability skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.8/5">In addition, the Chancellor announced in his Budget Report that Lord Leitch's review of skills would be extended to include better alignment of measures to tackle worklessness to support labour market flexibility, better employment outcomes and greater progression to productive and sustainable jobs for those with skill needs. We expect Sandy Leitch's report this autumn and my Department looks forward to working with the Department for Work and Pensions to take forward Lord Leitch's proposals.</p>

	<p pid="c.108W.0/1">Anyone concerned that a child may be a &quot;child in need&quot;, whether as a young carer or for any other reason, should refer the case to local children's services for an initial assessment. Children and their families are also able to make such contact direct.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.0/2">Section 1 of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 provides that at the time a local authority assess a person's needs for community care services or assess the needs of a disabled child, an individual who provides or intends to provide a substantial amount of care on a regular basis for that person has the right to request an assessment of his ability to provide and continue to provide care. The authority must take that assessment into account when making any decision about services for the cared for person or to meet the needs of the child, as the case may be.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.0/3">The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 (&quot;the 2004 Act&quot;) makes three principal changes to the law with the objective of providing further support for carers and helping to ensure that they are not placed at a disadvantage because of the care they provide. First, the Act requires local authorities to inform carers, in certain circumstances, that they may be entitled to an assessment. Second, when undertaking a carer's assessment, the local authority must consider whether the carer works, undertakes any form of education, training or leisure activity, or wishes to do any of those things. The effect of this is that the local authority will have to ask the carer about those activities during an assessment, and then take this into account when making the decision about whether the needs of the cared for person call for the provision of any services by them. Third, the Act provides for co-operation between local authorities and other bodies in relation to the planning and provision of services that are relevant to carers.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.0/4">Guidance makes clear that children who are carers should routinely be assessed under the Children Act 1989. The Children Act 1989 already gives local authorities a duty under paragraph 1(2) of schedule 2 to publicise their services to families with children in need and to take steps to ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive the information.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.0/5">The 2001 census recorded a total of 149,942 young carers in England and Wales, of whom 24,266 were providing 20 or more hours of care per week.</p>

Those found to be in need of international protection are provided with it. Failed asylum seekers of all nationalities who have been found by the Home Office and the appeals process not to be in need of international protection and have no legal basis of stay in the UK are expected to return to their country of origin and may have their removal enforced. The one exception to this is Zimbabwe, to where we have undertaken not to enforce returns pending the outcome of an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal hearing in early July.</p>

During this same period, the performance against the PSS for Enhanced Disclosure was 84.6 per cent. The CRB recently published its Five-Year Strategy and Business Plan 2006-07 and the PSS for the financial year 2006-07 for Standard Disclosures is 90 per cent. within 10 days and for Enhanced Disclosures 90 per cent. within 28 days.</p>

	<p pid="c.117W.12/1">By April 2007, neighbourhood policing will have been introduced to every community in England and Wales, and by April 2008 every area will have its own dedicated neighbourhood policing team. Neighbourhood policing puts local people's own concerns and priorities at the heart of local policing. Neighbourhood policing teams will be highly visible, will engage with communities to understand their priorities, and will tackle these issues in partnership with local partners. Neighbourhood policing will be protected and supported by the proposed reorganisation of police forces by getting more resources to the front line and keeping them there. The creation of strategic forces to deal with major investigations or public order incidents will help safeguard local policing by reducing the need to abstract officers from neighbourhood policing teams.</p>

The Government have recently announced an additional &pound;45 million funding for targeted youth crime and ASB prevention activities for those young people at most risk. This increase in funding means that all YOTs now have dedicated money to spend on prevention. Programmes are delivered by a range of multi-agency staff, including youth workers, enabling a wide variety of experience and expertise to be brought together. The new funding has been allocated to local YOTs and areas are beginning to deliver new prevention services from June 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.121W.0/2">The overall allocation from the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) for prevention programmes totals &pound;59 million, which includes existing Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP) funding of &pound;14 million, as well as the &pound;45 million of additional funding. The additional funding was allocated differently in England and Wales, as the Welsh Government became involved in devising the formula for the latter.</p>
	<p pid="c.121W.0/3">For the 138 YOTs in England, the allocation was based on the same funding formula as that used for the core support grant to YOTs. This formula weights each area's allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17 population (40 per cent.); size of area (10 per cent.); and six deprivation indices, including income and employment (50 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.121W.0/4">For the 18 YOTs in Wales, the allocation was based on a new funding formula devised by the All Wales Youth Offending Strategy Group. The formula weights each YOT's allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17 population (50 per cent.); sparsity (low population density, leading to difficulties accessing services and greater cost of providing them) (13.33 per cent.); five deprivation indices on income, employment, health, education and housing (26.66 per cent.); and caseload (10 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="c.121W.0/5">In some areas, YOTs were already receiving money for specific prevention programmes (YIPs) from an existing funding stream.</p>
	<p pid="c.121W.0/6">When the new funding formula was applied, the effect in these areas would have been to reduce the overall funding allocated to prevention. To avoid this and to allow them to begin to develop additional prevention services, funding for the affected YOTs was adjusted so that they all received an amount of at least &pound;20,000 more than they were previously receiving.</p>

	<p pid="c.125W.3/2">The information is not available in the form requested. The Coalfields Regeneration Trust, which operates throughout the English coalfields, is an independent grant giving body that seeks to spearhead the social and economic regeneration of the coalfields. Grants awarded by the trust range from small grants to local groups to larger awards that benefit coalfields more widely, sometimes at regional or national level. Grants are not constituency specific, with even small grants often benefiting areas outside of the constituency within which the group securing the grant is based. It is not therefore practicable to produce a list of constituencies which have received the highest level of funding. It should be noted that any list would change once a subsequent round of grants was released by the CRT, and therefore could significantly alter should a grant of considerable value be given to an organisation based in a constituency within a coalfield area.</p>

Best Value Performance Indicator 64 measures the number of private sector dwellings that are returned to occupation or demolished each year as a direct result of action by the local authority. Information, comprising local authorities' returns for Best Value Performance Indicator 64 for 2004-05 has been placed in the Library of the House. In the period 2004-05, the number of empty properties brought back into use or demolished by Luton council was 11. However, the variance in the overall size of the private sector housing stock, and the proportion of these houses which can be defined as empty, will differ between each local authority area and therefore, the indicator is not a straightforward reflection of individual councils' performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.134W.11/1">Planning policies to protect green belt and open space are set out at the national, regional and local levels and I will deal with each of these in turn.</p>
	<p pid="c.134W.11/2">National policies to protect the green belt are set out in PPG2. Polices to protect other areas of open space are set out in PPG 17. Planning authorities are required to have regard to these policies when preparing their development plans and these policies may be material to individual planning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.134W.11/3">In addition, the Residential Development on Greenfield Land Direction requires local authorities to notify the Secretary of State of applications for the provision of 150 houses or flats on greenfield land or any applications for the provision of houses or flats on five hectares or more on greenfield land. The notification requirements provide the Secretary of State with an opportunity to check general compliance with the guidance set out in national planning policies, and to consider whether an application should be called in for her own determination.</p>
	<p pid="c.134W.11/4">Regional policies to protect green belt and other areas of open space are set out in Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the North West of England, formerly known as RPG13. Particular emphasis is given to maintaining urban form and enhancing urban living. The continued and extensive use of green belt policy is an essential tool. The RSS says that the case for exceptional substantial change to green belt will need to be established by a strategic study and that, in turn, will inform a future review of RSS. It says that there will be no need for such a study in Greater Manchester before 2011. The RSS is currently in the process of being reviewed. The North West regional assembly published the revised Draft RSS for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>. The responses to the consultation will be examined by a panel set up by the Secretary of State. The panel will then carry out an examination in public to debate selected topics, based on issues raised in the consultation responses, before making their recommendations to the Secretary of State. It is likely that any proposed changes to regional green belt policies will be examined carefully by the panel and subsequently by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.134W.11/5">Local policies to protect green belt and other areas of open space are set out in local authority development plan policies. The Government office for the north west scrutinises these plans on behalf of the Secretary of State to ensure that the authorities have had regard correctly to national and regional planning policies.</p>

	<p pid="c.136W.2/1">We have received five proposals for funding by Bedfordshire county council under round 1 of the Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant (GTSG) 2006-08. GTSG is a capital grant available through the regional housing budgets for local authorities and registered social landlords (RSLs), covering both the development of new sites and the refurbishment of existing sites. Bedfordshire CC is bidding for refurbishment schemes, which are funded at 75 per cent. of the total bid.</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/2">Bids are evaluated against the following criteria:</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/3" class="indent">Does the scheme meet a clearly assessed need?</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/4" class="indent">Does the scheme offer value for money?</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/5" class="indent">Is the site sustainable?</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/6">Schemes must also demonstrate that they will be able to deliver to time and budget, and that stakeholders have been consulted. Another key criterion which will be used to determine whether a bid receives funding will be the extent to which schemes contribute to addressing emerging regional priorities in respect of Gypsy and Traveller provision, which is assessed by the Regional Housing Boards (RHBs).</p>
	<p pid="c.136W.2/7">An appropriate package of schemes within each region has been put together by the RHBs. These are under ministerial consideration and the successful schemes will be announced shortly.</p>

The research study, a copy of which has been deposited in the Library, also described the reasons why transactions fail. For example, the report indicated that 43 per cent. of transaction failures were attributable to an unfavourable survey report and the remainder were due to a seller deciding to sell elsewhere, unacceptable delays, chain breakdown and the property being taken off the market. The key findings of the research study indicated that many of the problems associated with the current system are down to information emerging later in the process and that buyers, sellers and professionals all agreed that sellers should offer more information up front.</p>

In Peterborough, the regional housing board for the East of England (RHB) has allocated just over &pound;19 million which is expected to deliver 572 new affordable units, via the Housing Corporation's National Affordable Housing Programme. In the other growth areas of the region, the RHB has allocated &pound;152.7 million which is expected to deliver 6,081 new affordable units.</p>
	<p pid="c.139W.5/2">The Housing Corporation is delivering the Government's affordable housing agenda in partnership with local authorities, registered social landlords and developers in developing schemes across the range of tenure which meets the needs of local people including the pathway to low cost home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="c.139W.5/3">The Government's shared equity task force is currently examining other ways to increase shared ownership schemes.</p>

In addition, the avoidance of predetermination is not an issue explicitly mentioned in the model code of conduct for local authority members, and so would not be an issue for the Standards Board. As far as determining planning applications is concerned, the Standards Board does provide specific guidance relating to members' personal and prejudicial interests.

	<p pid="c.150W.11/2">The Government's guidance to planning authorities on development and flood risk is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25. This advises that planning applications in flood risk areas are always accompanied by a flood risk assessment, and that the Environment Agency is consulted. Flood risk areas are those mapped by the Agency as being at risk from river and tidal flooding, but sites outside such areas can also be at risk due to local topography, for example at the foot of hills where storm-water runoff may overwhelm sewers. Flood risk assessments should address the source of flooding, its potential extent, depth and speed of inundation and its likely impact on the development during its lifetime, taking climate change into account. They should demonstrate how the risk will be managed and identify any residual risk (the risk remaining after flood defences have been taken into account). Proposals for the development of new properties with basements would have to demonstrate (to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency and the Local Planning Authority) that the residual risk to the development and its occupants was acceptable. In addition, the introduction of basement accommodation into a flood risk area should also not materially increase the flood risk to other properties or occupants. The new Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25 that we intend to issue this autumn will strengthen this advice.</p>

	<p pid="c.151W.2/1">The Government have issued detailed planning guidance on planning and crime prevention in England. &quot;Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development&quot; (PPS1), published in 2005, places strong emphasis on the role of planning in helping to create safe and sustainable communities. Planning authorities are asked to have robust policies which address crime prevention issues in their development plans. Crime prevention is also capable of being a material planning consideration in the consideration of planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/2">In applying the policy in PPS1 we have asked planning authorities to have regard to the guidance we have published in &quot;Safer Places: The Planning System and Crime Prevention&quot; (Office of the Deputy Prime Minster/Home Office, 2004). This offers detailed guidance on the lay-out of all buildings and spaces to reduce the risk of crime, including, where appropriate, the incorporation of target hardening measures such as CCTV in new development.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/3">&quot;Safer Places&quot; advises that in designing and considering development proposals, the physical protection of development by using target hardening principles such as Secured by Design should be considered. The guidance also highlights a number of examples of best practice involving Secured by Design principles and urges all involved in the planning and design of buildings and environments to work closely with police architectural liaison officers or crime prevention design advisors.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/4">Alongside this guidance we are also examining how best to incorporate measures to improve the security of new homes. Compliance with Secured by Design standards is one of the options being considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.153W.2/1">Government policies in relation to planning for village pubs are set out in planning policy statement 6: Planning for Town Centres (PPS6) and planning policy statement 7: Sustainable Development in Rural Areas (PPS7).</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/2">PPS 6 asks local planning authorities where appropriate to adopt policies that enhance the vitality and viability of rural service centres, such as villages. In considering proposals for new development, local authorities should take into account the likely impact of the new development on services that are important to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/3">Local planning authorities are also asked to consider the scale of new leisure development, including pubs, and its likely impact on the character and function of a village, for example in terms of antisocial behaviour, crime and the amenities of residents.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/4">PPS7 supports the PPS6 policy approach to enhancing the viability of village services, including village pubs. It advises local planning authorities to support the retention of valuable local facilities and to set out in their local development documents the criteria they will apply in considering planning applications that would result in the loss of important village services.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/5">The planning system cannot control the closure of a business or the sale of land or premises. Planning permissions relate to the use of land, and ownership is not a relevant consideration. The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, as amended, allows a change of use from A4 (drinking establishments) to A3 (restaurant and cafes), A2 (financial and professional services), and A1 (shops). A change to any other use would require planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/6">If a pub is converted to a use other than those described, without planning permission, local planning authorities have a wide range of discretionary enforcement powers to enable them to deal with unauthorised development. It is for the local planning authority to decide in each case which is the most appropriate course of action.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/7">The Government have no plans to control the buying and selling, or closure of village pubs. The use to which land and premises are put is a matter for individual land owners, so long as the necessary consents are in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.164W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-19">19 June 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.164W.3/2">We assess that the Priory Group provides an excellent in-patient psychiatric service based on an individual's clinical needs. Service liaison officers routinely visit the Group's hospital units where we have in-patients to ensure that our arrangements are working effectively in terms of patient care and treatment, including attending ward rounds that involve service patients; the service liaison officer also acts as a &quot;service advocate&quot; for the patient. They also meet regularly with Priory representatives to discuss treatment and best practice. We assess the contractual elements of our agreement with the Priory Group at quarterly meetings held between the MOD and the Priory Group. Both the service liaison officer and contract meetings examine the Priory's performance against the particular performance indicators of the contract. Furthermore, the MOD's Directorate of Healthcare monitors, on a daily basis, case management and financial components of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.3/3">The MOD's requirement for the provision of in-patient mental healthcare was advertised in the &quot;Official Journal of the European Communities&quot; and the &quot;MOD Contracts Bulletin&quot;. Four companies&mdash;The Priory Group Ltd., Cygnet Healthcare Ltd., Affinity Healthcare, and Selrack Consulting&mdash;expressed an interest in the requirement. They were then invited to an Industry Day, in order to give them a better understanding of the requirement and to enable them to discuss with MOD in more detail what they would be able to provide. Following the exchange of information at the Industry Day, the MOD decided that Selrack Consulting would be unable to provide the services required and therefore invited the three remaining companies to tender. The Priory Group Ltd. and Cygnet Healthcare Ltd. submitted bids. The bid from The Priory Group Ltd. best met our requirements to provide high-quality mental health in-patient care nationwide, without delay, and within easy reach of unit, base or home.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.3/4">The contract with the Priory Group commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase>. Reception of service patients by the Priory Group's inpatient facilities was phased in between <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase> and April 2004. This phase-in period allowed MOD and the Priory Group to develop interoperable working procedures and the MOD the opportunity to gradually enhance its community-based mental health teams.</p>
	<p pid="c.164W.3/5">Since the beginning of the contract, The Priory Group has admitted 730 service personnel for in-patient treatment. This can be broken down by year as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.164W.3/8"> <td></td> <td><i> Number of patients</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.164W.3/9"> <td>2003-04<sup>(1)</sup></td> <td>58</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.164W.3/16">While an individual's medical record will show their medical history, at present, we do not hold centrally a collated set of records specifically limited to former patients who have returned to duty or have been discharged following treatment at the Priory.

	<p pid="c.169W.8/1">Controls on imports into the European Community, including the UK, fall within the scope of the Community's Common Commercial Policy which is an area of exclusive Community competence. Member states can unilaterally adopt measures but these are limited to strictly defined and exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, any such measures would have to be notified and justified under these exceptions to the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.8/2">Any unilateral measures taken by the UK against Burma would also have to satisfy relevant World Trade Organisation rules on imports of goods and services. For example, a ban on imports of goods from Burma would be in breach of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules and therefore would, if challenged by Burma, have to be justified under either the general or security exceptions set down in the GATT Agreement.</p>

	<p pid="c.172W.0/1">The new UN Human Rights Council has the potential to improve on the work of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, in addressing pressing human rights issues around the world today. The UN General Assembly resolution establishing the Council provides for some significant improvements, including: more frequent meetings each year, at least three meetings per year for at least 10 weeks in total, which should allow the Council to address human rights issues more systematically; a new system of universal periodic review, under which the human rights record of each UN member will be reviewed; a higher election threshold for election to the Council; a wider-ranging mandate; and a more central place within the UN system, better reflecting the importance of human rights. At the same time, we expect that it should preserve some of the strengths of the Commission, including proper provision for the participation of non-governmental organisations. But, much will depend on member states' commitment to making a success of the new Council, and it is the responsibility of all UN members to ensure that it can work more effectively than its predecessor.</p>

Candidates are now required to win a simple majority, at least 96 votes, in the General Assembly to be elected. Candidates for the first elections, in May 2006, were encouraged to make voluntary pledges and commitments on the protection and promotion of human rights, to be taken into consideration when membership was voted on. All candidates did so, although some commitments were much more substantive than others. Members are expected to uphold the highest human rights standards, to co-operate fully with the Council and to be among the first to submit themselves to the new Universal Periodic Review. Although some countries with weaker human rights records were still elected, we expect all members to take seriously the responsibilities of membership and will be looking to hold them to this.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.2/1">The latest round of territorial talks, concluded in Tokyo on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase>, did not bring Japan and South Korea (RoK) any closer to resolving their dispute. Japan and RoK still remain apart over demarcating their exclusive economic zones around a pair of RoK-controlled islets, known as Takeshima in Japan and Tokdo in South Korea.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.2/2">The islets have long been a source of dispute between the two nations which both claim sovereignty over them. Even though no concrete progress was made during the talks, it is welcome that they took place, after a six-year suspension. The two sides agreed in principle to hold their next round of talks in September in Seoul.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.5/1">Since 2000, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has been improving its links on Science, Innovation and Engineering in Japan and South Korea through a dedicated network of Science and Innovation Officers. This has been as part of the Government' overall science strategy. The FCO has spent the amounts listed on promoting Science, Innovation and Engineering in Japan and South Korea. Since the FCO does not promote Science, Innovation and Engineering separately the figures relate to spending on all three of these areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.176W.11/1">We are very concerned about reports of a possible test-launch of a Taepodong-2 missile/Satellite Launch Vehicle and are monitoring the situation closely. We have made clear our view to the Democratic People's Republic Korea, as have the EU, US, Japan and others, that this would be seen as a provocative act, which would add considerable tension to an already complex regional situation. We have urged them not to test, but to stick to their commitments under the 1999 moratorium and the 2002 Pyongyang Declaration and return to the Six Party Talks. We continue to work closely with allies, including US, NATO and EU partners to ensure a co-ordinated UN response if the test goes ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.176W.14/1">The UK has undertaken many important steps in fulfilling its disarmament obligations under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Since the end of the Cold War we have reduced the total explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. and we are the only nuclear weapon state to have reduced its deterrent capacity to a single nuclear weapons system, Trident.</p>
	<p pid="c.176W.14/2">We continue to press for multilateral negotiations towards both nuclear, and general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, as required by Article VI of the NPT. On nuclear disarmament our current priority is to push for negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty, without pre-conditions, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which we view as the next appropriate step towards achieving the goal of nuclear disarmament. On conventional arms control, we are also active. The UK is leading the campaign to launch work within a UN framework towards an Arms Trade Treaty to regulate the global trade in all conventional weapons. And next week in New York at the First Review Conference of the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW), the UK will be leading the campaign to build maximum support for common international guidelines for transfers of SALW.</p>

	<p pid="c.178W.2/1">In her address to the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June</phrase>, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla Del Ponte, was critical of the Serbian authorities' efforts to arrest Ratko Mladic and the other remaining fugitive indictees. She noted that there was serious political and administrative resistance from within the Serbian system, and underlined that strong political will was required to overcome these obstacles.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.2/2">The Chief Prosecutor also stressed that the Republika Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) had to increase its efforts to locate and arrest fugitives. It was unclear where Radovan Karadzic himself resided, but part of his network and his family remained in BiH. She also expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in locating Vlastimir Djordjevic. She believes he may be in Russia but investigations by the Russian authorities have failed to produce results.</p>
	<p pid="c.178W.2/3">As we regularly make clear to the countries of the region, full co-operation with the ICTY remains a fundamental requirement for progress towards the EU and NATO. We supported the decision in May of EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn to disrupt Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations because of Belgrade's failure to co-operate fully with the ICTY. The Commission has made clear however, that they stand ready to resume the talks as soon as full co-operation is achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.180W.2/1">We remain deeply concerned at the violence in Sri Lanka and, again, offer our condolences following last week's attack in Kebitigollawe. Such barbaric acts have no place in the search for a solution to the conflict. I issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June</phrase> condemning this attack unreservedly along with all forms of violence and intimidation. That statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage</a>&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029391629&amp;a=KArticle&amp;aid=1150379181467%20&amp;year=2006&amp;month=2006-06-01&amp;date=2006-06-15.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.2/3">There is a real need for political will on all sides to change the dynamics of the conflict. Violence can never be an answer to Sri Lanka's problems; all sides need to understand this. It is vital that both sides, which were at the Geneva talks in February, live up to their commitments. This includes the Sri Lankan Government acting constructively to ensure that paramilitaries or others are not able to operate, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam (LTTE) calling a halt to acts of violence against civilians, the security forces and police, and both sides ensuring that intimidation, acts of violence, abductions and killings cease. We continue to believe that dialogue is the only way to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict, which takes full account of the legitimate demands of all communities and promotes a democratic and stable Sri Lanka. All sides need to exercise restraint and act constructively.</p>
	<p pid="c.180W.2/4">We fully support the Norwegian peace facilitation efforts. We welcome the recent statements of commitment to the Ceasefire Agreement by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE and continue to do what we can to encourage both sides to return in good faith, to face-to-face talks. We make this clear in our regular contacts with the Sri Lankan Government, Members of Parliament, including representatives of Tamil political groups, and civil society. We also actively contribute to the EU's work, not least in its role as one of the Tokyo co-chairs to the Sri Lankan peace process.</p>

	<p pid="c.190W.5/1">The independent Strategic Review of Education will consider how strategic planning and rationalisation of the schools' estate can best encourage and support cross-community and cross-sector collaboration and models of schooling that promote greater integrating of education. It is due to be completed by November 2006. In line with the First Triennial Action Plan for A Shared Future, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools and the Education and Library Boards will be required to demonstrate that options for collaboration/sharing on a cross-community basis have been considered and fully explored in developing their plans for reorganisation/rationalisation of the schools' estate. The outcome of the strategic review of education may lead to further refinement of the commitments and detailed actions in the Action Plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.197W.5/1">It is estimated that there are 270.8 hectares of land remaining with potential for housing development within the urban areas of Strangford parliamentary constituency. This could provide approximately 5,282 dwelling units.</p>
	<p pid="c.197W.5/2">However, it should be noted that there is a degree of policy uncertainty in relation to land which is currently the subject of objection through the development plan process; this issue will be publicly debated at the public inquiries convened to hear objections to the relevant draft plans i.e. draft Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan (BMAP) and the Draft Ards and Down Area Plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.197W.5/3">The Ards and Down public inquiry has recently been reconvened and has been scheduled to continue to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June 2006</phrase> to hear strategic objections to the extent of housing land identified within the draft plan proposals. It will reopen in September to hear site specific objections. No date has yet been set for the public inquiry to consider objections to the draft BMAP.</p>

	<p pid="c.216W.4/1">The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom (UK) comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for one in 16 hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States of America.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.4/2">This study highlights the importance of effective systems for monitoring and responding to issues relating to the safety of medicines, a process called pharmacovigilance. This study, which was funded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), underlines their commitment to improving the evidence base for pharmacovigilance in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.4/3">As part of this commitment, the MHRA is working to strengthen the yellow card scheme for reporting suspected ADRs and has widened access to the scheme to enable patients to report ADRs directly.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.4/4">This study also highlights the vital importance of safety information which meets the needs of prescribers and patients. The MHRA committee on safety of medicines publication &quot;Always read the leaflet&quot; proposed actions to improve risk communication, including development of a leaflet for patients published by the MHRA. The commission on human medicines has established a working group to examine ways to improve the provision of safety information accompanying medicines.</p>
	<p pid="c.216W.4/5">Changes to medicines legislation introduced in 2005 were also designed to enhance the capability of regulation to reduce the burden of adverse drug reaction, for example in the requirement on marketing authorisation holders to develop risk management plans for newly licensed medicines.</p>

	<p pid="c.220W.2/1">Specialist services including treatment for sexually transmitted infections, termination of pregnancy and mental health services are available for those children who need them as a result of sexual abuse. For children with less severe mental health problems, it is more appropriate for universal services to provide the psychological support they need than for them to be referred to specialist child and adolescent mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="c.220W.2/2">It is important that child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are developed in a way that is responsive to the needs of the populations they serve. The CAMHS standard of the children's national service framework (NSF) sets out the requirement for an assessment of the needs of particular groups of children in the locality who are vulnerable or at risk. The NSF also states the commissioners and services should be able to demonstrate multi-agency partnership working in the following areas: the provision of services to children and young people who may or may not have been harmed, as set out in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot;; contributing to the assessment of complex child abuse cases; the assessment and provision of post-abuse therapeutic services; and services for looked-after and adopted children.</p>
	<p pid="c.220W.2/3">The Department has been working closely with the Home Office to develop sexual assault referral centres (SARCs). A SARC is a one-stop location where victims of rape and sexual assault can receive medical care and counselling, and have the opportunity to report to the police and undergo a forensic examination. The joint Department of Health and Home Office National Service Guidelines for Developing Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) was published in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.220W.2/4">Since 2003, &pound;1.27 million from the Home Office's Victims Fund has been spent on new and existing SARCs. The Department has an important role in allocating these resources as departmental officials are on the committee that make grant assessments. SARCs currently operate in 14 locations in England and Wales and there are six more due to open in the forthcoming year.</p>
	<p pid="c.220W.2/5">The Department and the Home Office are supporting the development of appropriate services for children within existing or new SARCs. St. Mary's SARC in Manchester has established a service for children. In London, Project Amethyst was piloted in 2005-06 jointly by local police and health to provide services for children in association with the three London SARCs (the Havens in Camberwell, Whitechapel and Paddington). A number of the new SARCs scheduled to open will be providing services for children.</p>

	<p pid="c.227W.3/2">The Department conducted national capacity planning exercises through strategic health authorities (SHAs) in 2002 and 2004. Through these exercises SHAs estimated the additional capacity in elective treatment and diagnostics required to meet key public service agreement waiting times targets, and identified how much of this capacity would need to be sourced from IS providers.</p>

The report also refers to central expenditure of &pound;1.9 billion over 10 years. That will not just be spent on running the national programme, but also covers the functions previously undertaken by the NHS Information Authority, which was closed in 2005, and, in its last year, cost &pound;219 million. It is clear therefore that the &pound;1.9 billion is not additional funding but is in fact a reduction on what the central management of national health service information technology services cost before the national programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.237W.3/1">Raising the public awareness of prostate cancer is one of the key challenges for the future. We want men to know what their prostate is, what it does, and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety and worry, and also not to overwhelm national health service services when there is no clear clinical benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.3/2">Through the work of the prostate cancer advisory group, chaired by the National Cancer Director Professor Mike Richards, a pilot public awareness programme on the prostate has been developed. The pilot is jointly funded by the Department and signatories to the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action. The Department is providing &pound;100,000 for the pilot.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.3/3">ContinYOU, a community learning charity based in Coventry, were successful in being appointed to run the pilot following a formal tendering exercise. ContinYOU is currently holding focus groups with different groups of men to assist in designing the programme, which is due to run in September 2006 in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.3/4">A formal evaluation of the pilot will be undertaken, assessing the effectiveness of the intervention tools used in raising awareness of the prostate and the impact of the pilot on NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.3/5">If the evaluation proves that the pilot is successful, consideration will be given on how best to roll the pilot out across the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="c.237W.6/1">The Government are committed to introducing a national population screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed for such a programme to be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.6/2">The Department is supporting the development of screening technology for prostate cancer by having a comprehensive research strategy into all aspects of prostate cancer. We are jointly with other National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) members funding two NCRI prostate cancer research collaborates, and the Department is funding half of the total &pound;7.4 million cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.6/3">The research undertaken by the collaboratives covers all aspects of prostate cancer and has already generated the groundbreaking discovery of the overactive E2F3 gene in prostate cancer tumours. This discovery provides the potential not only to identify those at risk of developing the disease, but for the first time allows the prediction of how aggressive the cancer will be. Research is under way to turn this into a diagnostic test so that we can identify those patients whose prostate cancers are aggressive and urgently need treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.237W.6/4">It is important to note that in order for a screening technology to contribute to saving lives it is essential for there to be effective treatments for the disease detected. That is why the Department is funding a &pound;20 million trial of treatments for prostate specific antigen (PSA) screen-detected early prostate cancer (the ProtecT trial).</p>
