Relevant factors would include whether any significant change in the electoral process was being applied for the first time and the likely increase in turnout resulting from combination. The Commission's priority is that any combined event should be well run and easy for voters to understand and participate in.</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.9/1">The Electoral Commission informs me that it received representations from returning officers and electoral administrators as part of its 2005 review of the timing of counts at future combined Scottish parliamentary and local government elections, which suggested that staff fatigue arising from conducting an overnight Scottish Parliament count followed by a complex local government count the following day could lead to the accuracy of the count being called into question.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.9/2">However, the Commission further informs me that specific, statistical evidence on the relative accuracy of Thursday and Friday counts would be difficult to collate, not only because there have been relatively few counts commenced on Friday morning in recent years, but also given the many different variables which could affect accuracy.</p>

The Government consider it important to respect this policy, and therefore have no plans to consider the merits of instituting a General Service Medal for British forces personnel who served in Oman prior to 1970.</p>

	<p pid="a.521W.8/1">External policing at RAF Menwith Hill and RAF Fylingdales is primarily provided by the local constabulary, the North Yorkshire Police (NYP). At RAF Menwith Hill the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) conduct joint patrols with the NYP. The MDP costs are met from the defence budget. It is common practice that police forces do not release specific information relating to on-going police operations, to prevent the potential for operational compromise.</p>

	<p pid="a.528W.2/1">In the procurement of road construction and maintenance, the Highways Agency awards the contract to the tender that represents best value for money in terms of quality and cost. Highways Agency contractors are also required to develop proposals for renewal maintenance schemes using the agency's continuous value management process, which incorporates whole life cost tools. Whole life cost optimisation tools also support the setting of the national maintenance budgets.</p>

	<p pid="a.537W.0/1">An element of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) overall pay award is allocated to non-consolidated variable pay related to performance. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award for members of staff who demonstrate exceptional performance, for example by exceeding targets set or meeting challenging objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/2">Non-consolidated variable pay awards are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/3">The Department makes non-consolidated performance payments to its employees for two purposes: (a) in year non-consolidated performance payments to reward outstanding contributions in particularly demanding tasks or situations; and (b) year end non-consolidated performance payments to reward highly successful performance over a whole year. In both cases they support and help drive high performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.0/4">These figures are exclusive of two key senior staff in the Government Olympic Executive, who were appointed on fixed term contracts ending in 2012 and whose remuneration reflects extensive relevant experience and the unique challenge of delivering the Olympics to a fixed deadline.

We will also continue to direct written parliamentary questions on such matters to the chair of the organisation for answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.0/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) carried out a comprehensive review of the health impacts of trans fats in 2007, and reported that voluntary action taken by the food industry to reduce the levels of trans fats in foods in the United Kingdom has been successful in achieving the reduction in dietary intakes to 1 per cent. of food energy. As part of this review the Government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) examined the evidence regarding the health effects of trans fat, including coronary heart disease (CHD). The SACN review concluded trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils has a moderate impact on increasing the risk of CHD and recommended that trans fats should contribute no more than 2 per cent. of food energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/2">The FSA is aware that the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a scientific update on trans fats in 2009. This reviewed evidence since the 1993 joint Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Oils in Human Nutrition, including the effects of trans fat consumption on CHD. The WHO conclusions are consistent with the SACN position statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.0/3">The Government note the reports by the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal Society for Public Health regarding the banning of artificial trans fats from foods. However, given the reduction in levels of trans fat in the UK and that no new evidence has come to light since the 2007 SACN position statement, the UK Government believe that legislation would be unlikely to deliver any further health benefit.</p>

The National Patient Safety Agency's views were not specifically sought before publishing the consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.3/3">Under the Department's preferred approach (option 3), there are two mechanisms for ensuring that patients continue to receive the most appropriate treatment. Firstly, the creation of a select list will clearly define those drugs falling within the scope of the generic substitution arrangements. This list has been drawn up to include those medicines that deliver the most savings and excludes drugs where there are any general, clinical or patient safety concerns with regard to interchange between different manufacturer's products. Secondly, preservers' clinical autonomy to tailor prescribing to their individual patients' clinical needs will be maintained. Where a prescriber judges that there is a clinical need, a mechanism will be in place to ensure that patients can continue to receive a specific manufacturer's product.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.2/1">The Physical Agents Directive has yet to be implemented. The adopted Directive has been amended to provide for a later implementation date of April 2012 so that the European Union can reassess its potential impact. The Directive itself covers both optical and electromagnetic (EMF) radiation, but is specifically aimed at workers. Both the optical and the EMF parts of the Directive explicitly exclude patients. Therefore, there should be no effect on the number of medical scans patients receive each week unless implementation limits the types and number of scans that can be done because of exposure to clinical staff attending the patient. This cannot be assessed until the Directive is finally implemented.</p>

Local planning authorities are required to consult the Agency on all applications for planning permission (except for minor development) in areas with a medium or high probability of flooding, or in areas notified as having critical drainage problems (collectively known as &quot;flood risk areas&quot;), and for development on land exceeding one hectare outside flood risk areas.</p>

The Environment Agency can ask for any planning application to which it objects to be called in for decision by the Secretary of State. In addition, the (planning) Consultation Direction requires that planning applications for major developments (e.g., of 10 or more homes, or 1,000 square meters of new floor space) in flood risk areas where there is an outstanding Environment Agency objection on flood risk grounds, must be referred to the Secretary of State for consideration of whether they should be called in.</p>

The Code came into operation in April 2007, but we did not start seeing homes built to the Code standard until late 2008. The number of Code homes are increasing every month. At the end of December 2009, there were a total of 2,434 homes with Code certificates spread across all Code levels at post-construction stage (i.e. completed Code homes), 10,319 at design stage and over 300,000 registered homes on over 3,000 developments. Most of these homes are built to Code level 3-which represents for energy a 25 per cent. improvement on the current building regulations and is a demanding building standard. Homes funded by the Homes and Communities Agency are required to meet Code level 3 standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.3/1">No estimate of the average business rates charged in England for 2010-11 has been made, as this figure depend on the level of reliefs given, many of which are determined at the billing authorities' discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.3/2">For the purpose of modelling the 2010 transitional relief scheme, the notional chargeable amount (NCA) was calculated. The NCA for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition but before all other reliefs. Details on the methodology and assumptions used can be found on page 49 of the &quot;The transitional arrangements for the non-domestic rating revaluation 2010 in England&quot; consultation document. These include zero inflation, which does not reflect the latest information available, and adjustments for appeals.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.3/5">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.3/6">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government intend to put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

The Government intend to put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases, which in 2010-11 will ensure no business property sees its rates bill increase by more than 11 per cent. as a result of the revaluation, with maximum increases capped at just 3.5 per cent. for small properties. That is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and local authorities have the power to offer administrative penalties as an alternative to prosecution for benefit fraud. Section 115A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 provides for an administrative penalty in respect of benefit fraudsters and section 115B provides for an administrative penalty for collusive employers.</p>

	<p pid="a.572W.2/1">General office waste is managed for the Department for Work and Pensions by its PFI estate partner Telereal Trillium. Our largest waste stream is paper, and so efforts have been concentrated on increasing recycling of this paper across the whole estate. There is little scope for nation wide schemes to recycle further waste streams as the volumes generated in individual offices are too small to make a national system to segregate and recycle plastic, glass, metal or batteries either environmentally or economically viable. There are local schemes in operation run by Telereal Trillium or employees, but due to the administrative difficulties created by their small scale and informal nature, data is not collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.2/2">Minimal food waste is generated within sites as the majority of food preparation is done off site, with ready to serve products delivered. Data on food waste has only been collected since last financial year and is detailed in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.572W.2/5"> <td colspan="2"><i> Food Waste</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.572W.2/6"> <td></td> <td><i> Kgs</i></td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.572W.2/8"> <td>2009-10</td> <td>51,489</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.572W.2/11">This is either disposed by way of maceration to the foul sewer or within the general waste stream and is included within the landfill figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.2/12">Electrical and electronic equipment remains the property of our private sector partners, who manage and control the waste disposal. While duty of care is assured, we do not routinely collect management information on the volumes involved as it is not, strictly and legally, our waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.2/13">Clean paper and cardboard waste is segregated and recycled securely, by cross shedding and pulping. All remaining office waste, often resulting from food and drink bought in by our employees, is disposed of to landfill. The following table provides information on the volumes of general office waste generated over the last three years:-</p>

	<p pid="a.573W.2/1">The artists featured in the Directgov advertisement are Nick Moran, Honor Blackman, Janet Street Porter, Christopher Biggins, Kelly Brook and Graham McPherson (popularly known as 'Suggs'). Helen Mirren provided the voiceover. It should be noted that negotiations on the involvement of these artists in the project were conducted by the COI and all of the above agreed to participate in the project for a fraction of their normal commercial rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.573W.2/2">Directgov has the potential to enable Government to make substantial savings in shifting from traditional to digital channels. For those savings to be realised, it is vital that the public are aware of and trust Directgov as the Government's official website. The aim of the campaign is to increase awareness so that Directgov is the first site people think of for Government information, and one which they both trust and recommend to others.</p>

	<p pid="a.576W.3/1">The challenge of implementing these reforms is unprecedented with over a million employers and over 10 million people affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.3/2">In order to deliver the workplace pension reforms successfully, we are intending to stage in the new employer duties over a four year period, starting with large employers, medium and then small.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.3/3">Inevitably, staging of employers by size, including the temporary and agency sector, can affect the ability of all employers to compete with each other in the short-term as some employers will face the cost of administering the reforms and contributing to their employees' pensions sooner than employers staged later.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.3/4">We considered a number of approaches to staging, including segmenting employers by random selection, by industry type or by geographical region. We believe that staging by size offers the best balance of maximising deliverability while minimising employer burdens and competition impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.3/5">We believe that any impacts on competition will be short-term and outweighed by the overall positive benefits of our approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.576W.3/6">To further minimise competition issues we are also ensuring that employers will be required to contribute 1 per cent. of qualifying earnings throughout the staging period, before all employers move, at the same time, to 2 per cent. contributions, then 3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.5/2">Our investigations start when the Department receives details of the grant of probate. Those probate records are then matched against departmental records of deceased income related benefit recipients. In the majority of such cases no discrepancy with the records is identified. In those cases where further inquiries are required, the average time taken to complete those inquiries is 15 weeks. This is from receipt of the probate, including obtaining information from the executor, and ending with a formal claim on the estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.578W.5/3">We handle such cases as sensitively as possible, taking into account that this can be a particularly stressful time if the executor is a close friend or family member.</p>

So far 596 sets of remains have been exhumed and the remains of 196 individuals identified and returned to their families (145 Greek Cypriot/51 Turkish Cypriot). This is an essential humanitarian task. According to the Committee on Missing Persons' website, their budget for 2009 is US $3,014,567.32. The Government fully support the Committee's work, have made direct donations, and donate to the annual budget via the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.591W.5/1">The closure of Cheque and Credit Clearing, the UK system that processes cheques, is a commercial decision for industry. The Payments Council, an independent body that sets the strategy for UK payment systems, will ultimately take this decision. The Government, however, recognise that certain groups still value cheques as an important method of payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.591W.5/2">Before any final decision is made in 2016, and ahead of the closure of the cheque clearing system, the Council has committed to ensuring that adequate alternatives are in place for all users of cheques, in particular for users who are highly dependent on this method of payment.</p>

The problem of short notice eviction of tenants is due to a legal gap in protection.</p>

The most recent results from HMRC's customer satisfaction survey shows a result of 89 per cent. for overall customer satisfaction, which compares well with private sector benchmark of 87 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.604W.5/1">HM Revenue and Customs' Contact Centres, which handle the majority of HMRC telephone inquiries, use a variety of measures and indicators to gauge the level of performance. The main measures used to identify the number of calls which are not answered are the number of: engaged tones, busy messages played and calls abandoned in the queue.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.5/2">HMRC also measure the number of call attempts successfully handled, which gives another indication of unfulfilled demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.607W.0/2">The cost to the Exchequer of making the personal allowance transferable between couples individually subject to the basic rate of income tax, will depend on whether one or both members of the couple are subject to the basic rate of income tax; and if one, whether the intended focus is for second member to be subject to a higher rate of income tax, or alternatively a zero rate of income tax. Any answer would be highly dependent on these factors.</p>

To date EDCTP has provided &#8364;20 million for malaria vaccine development, funding high quality clinical trials to accelerate the process of vaccine development. These trials are necessary to ensure that safe vaccines go beyond discovery and actually enter the market in developing countries.</p>

This funding mechanism, launched by the Prime Minister at the G8 summit, commits governments to fund agreed volumes of as yet unavailable vaccines, at an agreed price, if a product is successfully developed. The first AMC is funding the pneumococcal vaccine. The DFID White Paper, 'Eliminating World Poverty: Building our common future', makes a commitment to consider the funding of malaria vaccine as a possible future AMC.</p>

	<p pid="a.620W.2/5">Breaking the link between disadvantage and low attainment is a national priority. To ensure we meet this priority, Public Sector Agreement 11 (PSA) specifically focuses on narrowing the gap between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers. Local authorities must set statutory attainment targets, in line with PSA 11, that amongst other things, increases the proportion of children eligible for free school meals achieving five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and mathematics. The performance of local authorities to date in narrowing attainment gaps is variable, depending on many circumstances including the starting point of children in that authority. All LA targets will be reviewed to ensure they are ambitious but realistic.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.5/2">Where a child is absent from school due to illness or injury then their absence will be recorded in the school register as an authorised absence. It is good practice for schools to monitor and escalate any concerns about high levels of absence due to illness or injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/3">Children with long term illnesses and other medical conditions may need additional support to continue their education, such as home tuition provided by the local authority or attendance at hospital schools. This should be tailored to suit the child's individual needs. Where such an education is provided schools can record those sessions as an approved educational activity and not as an absence.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.3/1">Where pupils are unable to attend school because of severe weather conditions their absence will be counted as an authorised absence. However, where pupils who rely on transport that is provided by the school or a local education authority to get to school are not able to do so because of severe weather conditions, then their absence is not counted in the statistics. Where a school is forced to close due to severe weather conditions the pupils absence is not counted in the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/2">Every lesson counts and it is right that schools should stay open during poor weather conditions where it is safe to do so. Those schools that remained open during the recent spell of poor weather should be commended for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/3">It is for this reason that we are asking local authorities to ensure that schools are not penalised for remaining open during the recent snow and to make it clear that we expect authorities to take any increased absences due to the poor weather into consideration when looking at school absence figures-where the head teacher is able to provide suitable evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/4">The Pupil Registration Regulations 2006 are clear that where a school is open and pupils do not attend, their non-attendance has to be recorded whether it is due to the poor weather or for any other reason (e.g. illness, or being on holiday). While this will mean that those schools will have a higher absence rate than if they had been forced to close, head teachers should not take decisions about closing schools based on concerns about absence records. Their primary concern in such cases should be for the welfare of their pupils and staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.3/5">The Department are currently looking at ways that absences due to exceptional circumstances, such as the recent poor weather conditions, can be reported and monitored within the school absence data. However, we will not be able to do this for the recent snow.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.0/1">No; there are no new burdens costs. When ISA-registration becomes mandatory in November 2010 for people starting new posts in regulated activity, payment of the &#163;64 registration fee will be the responsibility of the applicant, although employers may choose to pay on their behalf. The fee, which includes the cost of a Criminal Records Bureau enhanced disclosure, is payable just once in respect of working with children or vulnerable adults or both vulnerable groups. The applicant will then be registered for life if they so wish, unless they are barred from working with the vulnerable groups. The vetting and barring scheme will monitor continuously any information from the police, employers or other sources about registered persons, and the Independent Safeguarding Authority will bar them from working with children or vulnerable adults if they do anything that harms or poses a risk of harm to the vulnerable groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.5/2">The Tackling Gangs Action Programme (TGAP) was a six-month intensive programme of work launched in September 2007, which ended in March 2008. No funding was therefore provided to TGAP during the periods stipulated in the question.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.3/2">The number and proportion of recorded crimes of each type detected in which a DNA match was available in 2008-09 is shown in Table 1. The figures held do not include crimes detected as a result of one-off speculative searches of the NDNAD or from comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory. One off speculative searches and DNA profile comparisons are used mainly in the investigation of serious crimes such as murder and rape. Therefore the figures provided in Table 1 will under-represent the overall contribution of DNA matches to the detection of serious crimes such as murder and rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/3">It is important to note that detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone. The source of the figures provided is the forensic performance data, which are collected from police forces by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/4">Table 1 shows:</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/5" class="indent">the number and types of crimes detected for which a DNA match was available.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/6" class="indent">additional detections, where an offender admits further offences following a detection for which a DNA match was available.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/7" class="indent">the total of these two types of detections (labelled 'DNA-related') as a proportion of recorded crime and as a proportion of sanction detections (the sanction detection rate in 2008-09 for total recorded crime was 28 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/8">The table shows that 17 per cent. of all detected domestic burglaries, 20 per cent. of all detected other burglaries (burglaries other than a dwelling e.g. commercial premises, garden sheds, etc.) and 10 per cent. of all detected thefts of vehicle were 'DNA-related'.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.3/9">It should also be noted that most recorded crimes do not have any forensic opportunities (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.). In 2008-09, only a small proportion of recorded crimes had a crime scene examination (17 per cent.); and only 39,795 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD.</p>

The National Identity Service will be designed so that all adults resident in the UK will be able to apply for one or both of these products if they wish to do so. At present, approximately 80 per cent. of the adult population who are British apply for a passport over a 10 year period.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.0/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 1997. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. The available statistical information therefore relates to the London borough of Lambeth.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/2">In terms of police recorded crime in Lambeth, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 35 per cent. More specifically</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.0/10" class="indent">Drug offences-up 33 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/11">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at borough level is available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/12">Lambeth operational command unit had 1,010 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by 174 since 2001. Comparisons with 1997 for Lambeth are not available. There were 170 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a crime and disorder reduction partnership (CDRP). The CDRP has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/14">The CDRP paved the way for the Safer Neighbourhoods initiatives where there is now a dedicated police resource in each of the 21 wards in Lambeth which were not in place in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/15">Lambeth's CDRP and wider partnership approach has been recognised as good practice and overall crime levels continue to reduce: there was a reduction in the seven consecutive years up to 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/16">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Lambeth adopted a DPPO for Bishops Ward in Vauxhall in 2005 and a borough-wide controlled drinking zone is now in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.651W.0/17">In 1997, there were 40 CCTV cameras in Lambeth and since then two main schemes have been developed increasing CCTV to 966 cameras. The town centre scheme which has 133 cameras and 833 in housing estates and there are additionally Transport for London cameras.</p>

	<p pid="a.653W.0/4" class="indent">The Commission does not hold this information on charities centrally and there is no requirement for them to report to us regularly on it. However, in 2005 we conducted a survey, the results of which were published in our report, &quot;Cause for Complaint? How charities manage complaints about their services&quot;. This found that, of the 1,129 charities surveyed, 69% of charities did not have a complaints procedure. The figure ranged from 38% among very large charities (those with an annual income of over &#163;1 million) to 86% among small charities (those with an income of &#163;10,000 or less). Further details are below.</p>

	<p pid="a.653W.0/15" class="indent">We commissioned a postal survey of a random sample of 3,000 registered charities, weighted across four income bands. The postal survey achieved a 38% response rate, which is high for surveys of this nature. In total, 1,129 completed forms were returned for analysis. This allows a confidence interval exceeding +/- 3%, which is industry standard. The full publication can be viewed on the Charity Commission website:</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.8/1">The first annual update to the National Security Strategy, published in June 2009, identified both competition for energy, and climate change, as important factors that contribute to shaping threats to the UK's national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.8/2">In the case of competition for energy, the strategy sets out a number of likely trends in terms of increasing global energy consumption, increasing scarcity of resource, and concentration of those resources in areas that are: (a) harder to find, reach or access, and (b) in areas of environmental sensitivity and/or political instability.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.8/3">Climate change can act as a driver of insecurity, internationally through exacerbation of existing social, economic and political sources of tension, and domestically through increased frequency of extreme weather events. In this context, the Government have also begun work on the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment; as the National Security Strategy states, national security risks will be considered as part of this broader work, and will inform the National Risk Register.</p>

Productivity estimates are not available for the private sector but experimental statistics are produced for the Market Sector. The market sector includes almost all market activity and excludes most non-market activity, in particular that of general government. The measurement includes public corporations.

Once established, it will work in partnership with a range of organisations in local networks, including colleges and universities, and with Connexions services to support smooth transitions between services for young people and adults. It will also work in partnership with Jobcentre Plus as an integrated employment and skills system. Currently, Jobcentre Plus advisers have comprehensive guidance on helping people access graduate internships, either directly through the graduate talent pool or by signposting customers to university careers services. We are developing a partnership agreement to promote good practice and active collaboration between university careers services and Jobcentre Plus. We will also be developing a graduate guarantee so that all new graduates still unemployed after six months will have access to an internship, training or help to become self-employed.</p>

	<p pid="a.686W.5/1">Department officials have been in contact with Royal Mail during the severe weather. I understand that the vast majority of motorways and major trunk roads linking the UK have remained open during the severe weather allowing Royal Mail's national networking to operate, but local deliveries and collections have been disrupted, especially in remote areas, where local roads and access have been affected by extreme weather conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.5/2">Decisions relating to operational matters are the direct responsibility of the company and local assessments are made on whether services can operate safely under local conditions. Royal Mail has been keeping customers informed of disrupted services via its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.686W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.royalmail.com">www.royalmail.com</a></p>
	<p pid="a.686W.5/4">but due to the nature of the changing conditions, assessments are regularly made and it is not always possible to give customers advanced notice of whether local services will be operating as normal.</p>

	<p pid="a.698W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;Our approach to individual registration is to move in two phases: a voluntary phase and a compulsory phase. During the voluntary phase, it will be compulsory for electoral registration officers to ask individuals to provide the relevant identifying information-national insurance number, date of birth and signature-but individuals will not be required to do that to be on the register.....The voluntary phase will not commence before July 2010-in other words, it will not become entangled with the next general election, whenever that may be-and will not finish before 2014. That period will enable us to be fully confident that the system is ready before we move to the compulsory phase, when it will be obligatory for individuals to provide identifying information to electoral registration officers to be included on the register. It will enable us to prepare the public for the change, and to take steps to bolster registration rates in the meantime. That will be fundamental to protecting the system against the risk of a drop in the numbers registered.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.5/1">Succession to the Crown is governed by the common law rules of descent for hereditary titles, including legitimacy, as well as the Act of Settlement. Although the Legitimacy Act 1976 made it possible for persons born outside wedlock to be legitimised, for most purposes, by the subsequent marriage of their parents, succession to the Crown and to any peerage is specifically exempted. The Act of Settlement and the common law together form the basis on which the UK's interpretative declaration in respect of articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock was made and remains valid.</p>

	<p pid="a.705W.3/118">In 2007, there were nearly 136,000 persons sentenced to custody (immediate and suspended), the highest in a decade. This was an increase of 4.9 per cent. from 2006 and 39.6 per cent. from 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.3/119">This growth reflects increased use of immediate custody in the first half of the decade and in recent years growing numbers of suspended sentence orders (introduced in April 2005 for those aged 18 or over) which have more than compensated for the decline in the number of immediate custodial sentences.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.5/1">The report of the Cabinet Secretary's Review of Data Handling Procedures, published in June 2008, mandated that all Government Departments carry out privacy impact assessments (PIAs) when introducing new policies or processes involving the use of personal data. Each Department is responsible for implementing an appropriate process to undertake these assessments, taking into account the nature of their business and existing procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice has not issued any guidance to Departments, but the Information Commissioner's Office has published helpful guidance on PIAs which we would expect Government Departments to consult. Earlier this month, Government published the Protecting Government Information report, which noted that 270 PIAs are now complete or under way across Government Departments.</p>
