	<p pid="b.79W.2/1">We are working to address this problem in two ways&mdash;by seeking to prevent debts being sold to vulture funds in the first place and by limiting the damage done by cases already under way. To reduce the risk of debts falling into the hands of vulture funds, we are working with the World Bank to help poor countries buy back their commercial debts at a discount through the Debt Reduction Facility. The debts are then dealt with and cannot be taken through a court. More than $8 billion (approx. &pound;4 billion) of debts have already been cancelled in this way. We are also working with heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to strengthen their debt management capacity and overall governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.79W.2/2">In cases where poor countries' debts are already in the hands of vulture funds, we are working with the African Development Bank and others to ensure that countries have access to legal advice to help them fight these cases. The strong defence that the Government of Zambia mounted recently, for example, reduced its liability by around $40 million (approx. &pound;20 million). It was the first defence case of this kind that has been even partially successful.</p>
	<p pid="b.79W.2/3">The UK will also continue to raise this issue internationally. At the recent annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, G7 Finance Ministers agreed to examine whether additional steps can be taken to address this problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.92W.0/1">The Office of Rail Regulation's (ORR) HM Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) is currently assessing Network Rail's proposal to modernise Frinton-on-Sea crossing. As required by the Level Crossings Act 1983, ORR's consideration of the safety factors at level crossings must take into account the &quot;safety and convenience of all users at or near the level crossing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.92W.0/2">At present, ORR's view is that Network Rail's plans to modernise the crossing are acceptable, subject to continuing discussion and agreement as the scheme progresses. ORR plans to meet local people on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-16">Friday 16 November</phrase> to discuss their representations. Essex county council has given approval in principle for the highway element of the crossing modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.92W.0/3">The existing arrangements at the level crossing are unsuitable to deal with the current volume of road traffic and rail traffic. The planned modernisation will reduce risks to all crossing users, particularly those from the local community who have disabilities. It will also reduce risks to Network Rail's own staff&mdash;the current level crossing arrangements pose a significant risk to the safety of the crossing keeper.</p>
	<p pid="b.92W.0/4">Under Network Rail's planned proposals the crossing will be monitored at all times by the railway signaller from the signal box using closed circuit television. This is a common method of operation on level crossing across Britain's mainline railway network. These types of automatic barrier level crossings which are locally monitored have a very good safety record.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.6/1">DEFRA is aware of the press reports about the serious situation in the USA in respect of cases of abnormally high levels of colony loss described as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Scientists and inspectors at the National Bee Unit (NBU) are monitoring the situation and are in contact with experts in the USA and Europe to learn about developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.6/2">However, we do not have evidence to suggest that there is something similar happening in the UK. The very limited number of cases of high losses which have occurred this season, for which there is no ready explanation, are being investigated in depth by the NBU and bee inspectors. The causes of significant colony losses are being considered as part of the Central Science Laboratory and the NBU's horizon scanning work. Initial results indicate high levels of virus in samples taken from dead or dying colonies.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.6/3">DEFRA's annual expenditure on bee health research has averaged around &pound;200,000 since 2001. However, there is an ongoing review of expenditure on all DEFRA programmes, including bee health, and future funding will need to be considered alongside the full range of priorities facing the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.96W.3/1">Under EU regulations, the tuberculin skin test is (and is likely to continue to be) the primary diagnostic test for TB in live cattle in the field. We foresee only a minor, if any, role for non-immunological assays in the screening of cattle populations for TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.3/2">DEFRA has been funding work using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to develop tests for <i> Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i> M. bovis</i>) since 1999. This has included work to develop a reliable and rapid bovine TB screening test that can detect the presence of <i> M. bovis</i> DMA in infected cattle tissues. Work to date shows the value of the application of PCR techniques in certain situations, for example in cattle tissue samples from suspect cases of TB disclosed at routine slaughter, where the speed of the result is of importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.3/3">The use of automated PCR machines has been trialled by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for use in routine detection of <i> M. bovis</i> in a range of bovine tissue samples in the laboratory. A review of this and its incorporation into routine laboratory diagnostic techniques is currently being planned. However, PCR is not yet as sensitive, specific or reliable as conventional bacterial culture in detecting TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.3/4">DEFRA is investing &pound;1.3 million on work on PCR over the next 3 years that will allow us to tell the difference between <i> M. bovis</i> and similar species from environmental samples. This is not likely to be available as a field test in the short term.</p>
	<p pid="b.96W.3/5">No reverse transcription stage is required for the detection of <i> M. bovis</i> organisms by PCR, as DMA (not RNA) is the constitutive nucleic acid in the genome of mycobacteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.101W.2/1">A revised approach to public service agreements (PSAs) was introduced in the comprehensive spending review 2007, with a new set of PSAs coming into effect from April 2008. There is a much smaller number of key cross cutting PSAs, setting a vision for continuous and accelerated improvement in the Government's priority outcomes, and delivered collectively by multiple Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.101W.2/2">Fuel poverty is firmly embedded in this approach, no longer as a stand alone PSA, which is now contributing to the achievement of wider Government priorities.

	<p pid="b.102W.8/2">In its response to the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) report, the Government indicated that it would investigate alternatives to the use of carbon dioxide for stunning and killing pigs. DEFRA has commissioned two research projects that will examine the use of other gases or gas mixtures (including inert gases) for these purposes. The work commenced in 2005, but it will take at least five years to complete. The Government's response confirmed that it could not make a commitment to phase out the use of carbon dioxide within five years while there was no certainty that an effective alternative system would be available within that time frame. This remains the position.</p>

	<p pid="b.103W.7/1">The Treasury Solicitor keeps records primarily to meet the operational needs of his Department as the Government's solicitor. Cases tend to be categorised according to client and according to the nature of the claim at law, for example, assault, personal injury, unfair dismissal, misfeasance, judicial review. Homophobia as such does not constitute a claim at law. Rather, it may be, or may be perceived to be, a motivating factor in many kinds of claim. Whether, in any case, homophobia has been such a factor may never be established leaving the issue speculative and any record based upon it unreliable. No operational purpose of the Treasury Solicitor's Department would be served by keeping such a record and for that reason, having regard to the duty to be cost-effective, such records are not kept.</p>

	<p pid="b.112W.3/1">The military situation is confused because so many of the armed groups have splintered. Darfur remains insecure with continued attacks against African Union Mission in Sudan troops and Government forces, unrest in the internally displaced persons camps and inter-tribal conflict, as well as general banditry. The African Union Mission in Sudan currently has approximately 7,000 troops based in Darfur, under the command of General Agwai. UN Security Council Resolution 1769 mandated the deployment of a 26,000-strong African Union-UN hybrid force. We are working for the prompt and effective deployment of this force and the engagement of all parties in the political process to address the insecurity in Darfur.</p>

	<p pid="b.112W.6/1">Know Before You Go is a travel safety campaign run by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Consular Directorate, aimed at reducing the problems that British travellers face when on holiday abroad. It focuses both on the general travelling public and on a number of key target audiences who are involved in a disproportionate number of preventable consular cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/2">One of the campaign's target groups is young women aged between 16-24. Research shows that this audience responds particularly well to advice from celebrities and other aspirational figures. We therefore decided to involve a football wife and girlfriend (WAG) in the campaign to generate media coverage, which would deliver our messages to this audience.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.6/3">To front the WAG's guide the campaign recruited Charlotte Mears and she was paid &pound;2,000. Planning and administration of the campaign were covered as part of our ongoing contract with Know Before You Go campaign agencies at no additional cost. In total, Ms Mears worked for 10 hours on the WAG's guide and its promotion. The guide had coverage on GMTV, radio, websites, consumer magazines and national and regional press and generated over 27 million opportunities to hear and see Know Before You Go travel safety messages. This equates to &pound;170,000 worth of media advertising. For an outlay of &pound;2,000 we therefore secured coverage which would have cost &pound;170,000 to buy commercially, making the WAG's initiative a highly cost-effective way of getting safety messages across to a key target audience.</p>

Instructor training will be conducted through a combination of simulator training and use of operational conversion unit aircraft and the UK operational conversion unit will build over time to 16 aircraft.

	<p pid="b.137W.2/1">We are not cutting funding from higher education. We took this decision as part of the comprehensive spending review in order to target resources on our top priorities and the country's long term needs. While the policy has been set, we have asked HEFCE to consult widely on how it should be implemented. Our policy not only responds to the challenge in the Leitch report to increase the proportion of the work force with higher level skills from under 30 per cent. now to over 40 per cent. by 2020 but is also fairer to both taxpayers and students who have not yet entered higher education. Many of those in the work force without higher level skills may be mature learners who wish to study part-time. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities. Every institution will have an incentive to maximise its share of the &pound;100 million which will be redistributed through this change.</p>

	<p pid="b.138W.5/1">The UK Government have not independently procured any space systems for many years and have no current plans to do so. Departments like the MOD procure space enabled services on a regular basis, and this can involve the purchase of hardware, especially in the ground segment (e.g. MilSatCom handsets). In all cases, standard Government procurement policies are followed to ensure value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.138W.5/2">The UK is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) which does procure space systems. ESA procurements are undertaken within a geo-return framework, but are subject to affordability within the overall programme subscription and VFM through competition at both prime and sub-prime (sub-system) levels (and sometimes also below this). BNSC provides two delegates to the ESA Industrial Policy Committee which scrutinises and authorises all major procurements.</p>

	<p pid="b.140W.2/1">We took this decision as part of the comprehensive spending review in order to target resources on our top priorities and the country's long-term needs. Our policy not only responds to the challenge in the Leitch report to increase the proportion of the work force with higher level skills from under 30 per cent. now to over 40 per cent. by 2020 but is also fairer to both taxpayers and students who have not yet entered higher education. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities. Every institution will have an incentive to maximise its share of the &pound;100 million which will be redistributed through this change and no complete assessment of these changes on any institution can be made until that &pound;100 million has been redistributed.</p>

	<p pid="b.152W.5/1">The academies programme was introduced as part of the then Secretary of State (Mr. Blunkett's) March 2000 speech on transforming secondary education. The programme has always targeted areas with inadequate existing secondary schools, with some academies replacing under-performing schools and others meeting the demand for new school places.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.5/2">The first three academies opened in September 2002, and early projections included 25 academies in London by 2007 and a total of 57 academies.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.5/3">The Department's Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners, published in July 2004 included a target for 200 academies open or in the pipeline by 2010 with 60 in London. With an increasing body of evidence that academies are working and transforming the life chances of some of the most disadvantaged communities, in November 2006 the Government announced a scaling up of the academies programme, with an overall target to establish 400 academies.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.5/4">83 academies have opened to date and we estimate that around 50 will open in each year from 2008 to 2010. Financial allocations for later years are subject to future spending review decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.152W.5/5">The projected number of academies that are due to open at the beginning of any academic year is likely to change several times over the course of the preceding year as a result of project specific factors including land and site issues. A response detailing each change to projections and the reason for those changes could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.153W.2/1">The academies programme targets areas of inadequate educational attainment and opportunity. Some academies are brand new schools which need the extra school places, others are successful fee paying schools that wish to serve their whole local community and broaden their intake&mdash;providing high quality places where they are needed. However, most academies replace weak or underperforming schools. As a general rule, the Government are prepared to consider any secondary school where in 2006 fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at A*-C including English and maths as a potential academy project. In addition, local authorities would always consider an academy as an option for dealing with a school in special measures, or subject to an improvement notice, whatever it's results. They should also be considered where there is a need for additional secondary places. This policy is set out in the 2007 prospectus for academies, 400 Academies; prospectus for sponsors and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.154W.0/1">Academies are fully inclusive schools and they are established in partnership with local authorities. Their funding agreements set out that they are required to comply with admissions law and the statutory School Admissions Code. They are also part of their local school admissions fora. They must have regard to the SEN code of practice and statutory guidance on inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.0/2">The National Foundation for Educational Research and the Local Government Association published a report in summer 2006 entitled &quot;Admissions: Who Goes Where&quot;. The report found that academies on average admit more pupils with SEN (both with and without statements) than other schools in England. Academies also, on average, admit more SEN pupils (both with and without statements) than their predecessor schools. The report also found that academies admit higher proportions of pupils eligible for FSM than the proportion living in the local postcode districts.</p>

	<p pid="b.157W.0/1">The National Assessment Agency, which is responsible for administering the tests, advises schools to prepare their pupils for the tests by providing them with opportunities to familiarise themselves with the layout and design of past test papers, encouraging them to work independently and to be aware that there may be questions in the tests that they will not be able to answer. Head teachers have responsibility for deciding how much preparation pupils should have, but neither the Department nor NAA recommend intensive preparation for the tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.0/2">Information about time spent on test preparation is not collected centrally. However, as part of a research exercise, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) gathered information about test preparations in school year 2006-07 from 376 primary, infant and junior, schools. Those schools reported on the time spent in year six on direct preparation for key stage 2 tests as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.157W.3/2">The well-being of looked after children is paramount and legislation focuses on securing this. Section 23(7)(b) of the Children Act 1989 places a duty on local authorities to accommodate a child together with his/her siblings so far as is 'reasonably practical and consistent with his welfare'. The Act also requires local authorities to encourage contact between siblings.</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/3">An important factor to be taken into account in placement decisions is the number of children who may be placed in a foster home. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 7 to the Act prescribe a 'usual fostering limit' of three children. Local authorities may, however, exceed the usual fostering limit if the children concerned are all siblings.</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/4">This Government have invested significantly to improve the choice of placements available, so that a higher number of looked after children are now living in foster placements than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/5">In relation to adoption we have:</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/6" class="indent">issued statutory guidance to adoption agencies emphasising the importance of children being placed in sibling groups where this is in their best interests;</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/7" class="indent">required local authorities to make a range of adoption support services available, including financial support to facilitate siblings being placed together; and</p>
	<p pid="b.157W.3/8" class="indent">set up an adoption register for England and Wales which enables children and prospective adopters to be matched beyond local areas. It has an important role to play in finding matches for more difficult to place children, such as those in sibling groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.159W.11/1">The Government believe that all bullying is wrong and should never be tolerated in schools, and our guidance makes this clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.11/2">Since 1997 we have introduced an extensive range of measures to tackle bullying in schools. We have issued guidance for schools and the Anti-Bullying Charter which includes a detailed list of questions for the school community to consider when formulating its anti-bullying policy. We have worked with and funded a number of partners, including: the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) who arrange the annual Anti-Bullying Week, and provide a range of advice and support to local authorities; ParentLine Plus, who run a helpline for parents whose children are being bullied and provide other resources through their 'Be Someone to Tell' campaign; and ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) who run peer mentoring schemes for the Department. We also fund awards for anti-bullying work as part of the Princess Diana Memorial Awards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.11/3">We have placed a legal duty on head teachers to determine measures to promote good behaviour, respect for others and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils as part of their overall behaviour policy. The Education and Inspections Act (2006) Act also provides head teachers with the power, to such extent as is reasonable, to regulate the conduct of pupils when they are off-site or not under the control or charge of a member of staff. This is of particular significance to cyberbullying, which is often likely to take place out of school but which can impact very strongly on the school life of those pupils involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.11/4">We recently launched comprehensive new guidance for schools which replaces &quot;Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;. This was issued under the new title &quot;Safe to Learn: Embedding Anti-Bullying Work in Schools&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-21">21 September 2007</phrase>. It includes specific advice on homophobic bullying and cyberbullying, and links to pre-existing guidance on bullying around racism, religion and culture that was issued last year. To complete this suite of guidance, we have begun preparing advice on how to tackle the bullying of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities will publish this next spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.11/5">We have asked the National Strategies and anti-Bullying Alliance to work with schools and local authorities to ensure the guidance is effectively implemented on the ground and we will monitor this very closely. We have also asked the National Strategies to provide challenge and support to those schools which have been identified as weak or ineffective in their approach to dealing with bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.159W.11/6">This year the Department will provide around &pound;1.7 million for anti-bullying programmes, and funding levels are set to rise in future years. This covers the costs of grants to external organisations, as well as anti-bullying resources, the publication of guidance and support for local authorities and schools and directly funded external events.</p>

	<p pid="b.160W.2/1">I will write separately to the hon. Member, setting out the likely percentage increase in total schools capital allocation in real terms between 2008-09 and 2010-11 for each local authority, and will place a copy of the letter in the House of Commons Library. The figures will include allocations made to date, but not additional allocations that will be made through the Building Schools for the Future, academies and targeted programmes that require applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.160W.2/2">Allocations for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11 amount, in real terms, to a seven-fold increase since 1996-97. Total schools' capital funding available for allocation in the years 2007-08 to 2010-11 is set out in the following table, shown in cash and in real terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.161W.2/41">The revenue figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with those for the years 2003-04 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.2/42">The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. The 2003-04 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>

The headline success criteria for the Specialist Schools Programme are the numbers of schools achieving and maintaining specialist school status, and raising achievement at Key Stage 4. On the first of these, we are on track to achieve the target of 95 per cent. of eligible mainstream schools to become specialist or academies by the end of 2008. On the second, specialist schools have consistently outperformed other schools. On average, across all specialist schools, specialist status is linked to higher results at GCSE whether this is on the 5+A*-C measure, VA or CVA.</p>

	<p pid="b.173W.6/6">When taking decisions on statutory proposals the local authority and schools adjudicator must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. This guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered including a requirement to consider the impact on the balance of denominational provision when deciding proposals to close a school with a religious character.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.2/1">Improving standards of literacy is one of the Government's top priorities. Since 1997 the results achieved by 11-year-olds and 14-year-olds as measured by National Curriculum tests in English have risen dramatically. Provisional data for 2007 shows that 80 per cent. of 11-year-olds in England reached the expected level or above, an increase of 17 percentage points since 1997; and 74 per cent. of 14-year-olds reached the expected level or above, an increase of 17 percentage points since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.2/2">We judge children's attainment at age 11, 14 and 16 through Key Stage tests and GCSEs. The tables show the proportion of pupils in London achieving the expected level for their age, but failing to meet the expected levels is not equivalent to functional illiteracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.2/20">At age 11 (the end of Key Stage 2) the expected level of achievement is level 4. Provisional figures show that while 79 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved at least level 4 in English in 2007, 93 per cent. achieved at least level 3. That means they can read a range of texts accurately and independently; and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Level 4 is a much more demanding standard&mdash;children achieving level 4 have literacy skills that mean they can access complex forms of language and complex ideas. They can use inferences and deduction and can locate and use ideas and information. Their writing in a range of forms is lively and thoughtful. Their handwriting style is fluent, joined and legible. They use full stops, capital letters and question marks accurately and can use punctuation within a sentence. Of the 7 per cent. of children who do not achieve either level 3 or level 4, many have special and in some cases severe educational needs.</p>

These data show that around 28 million people accessed NHS dental services at least once during this period. This is the same as the number who accessed services in the two years ending March 2006. We are committed to widening access to NHS dentistry, and will look to Primary Care Trusts to do this as part of their role as commissioners of health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.180W.5/3">In September 2000 we published the NHS Cancer Plan, which introduced a number of targets and initiatives aimed specifically at breast cancer. These were:</p>

	<p pid="b.180W.5/6" class="indent">that there should be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum two month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for breast cancer, and</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/7" class="indent">a review of the Department's improving outcomes in breast cancer guidance by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/8">As well as updating the breast cancer guidance in August 2002, NICE has produced clinical guidelines for familial breast cancer and has issued appraisals on nine drugs to treat breast cancer, more than for any other cancer type, and is currently appraising a further two drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/9">We have also provided Section 64 funding to a number of breast cancer charities to improve awareness of breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/10">We are currently developing the Cancer Reform Strategy, which will set out the future direction of cancer services in England. We aim to publish by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/11">In September, my right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister announced proposals for cancer services including extending the breast cancer screening age range to women aged between 43 and 73 and a guaranteed appointment with a specialist within two weeks of referral for all patients with breast problems, not just those with suspected cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.5/2">People who live in deprived areas are less likely to attend for screening. For example, for cultural and religious reasons, women from minority ethnic groups are less likely to accept invitations for screening than the general population as a whole. Language and access to acceptable and meaningful information can also be a significant barrier and can affect coverage levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/3">The national informed choice leaflet, Breast Screening: The Facts, which is sent out with every invitation for screening, has now been translated into 19 languages. In December 2003, National Health Service Cancer Screening Programmes published Inequalities of Access to Cancer Screening: A Literature Review. The recommendations in the review have been sent to all local screening programmes. It is for primary care trusts, in close collaboration with their local screening programmes and stakeholders, to decide how best to provide and promote breast screening services for their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/4">On a national level, a paper on inequalities will be discussed by the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) at their next meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>. The NSC will consider what future action should be taken to reduce inequalities in our screening programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/5">Inequalities in cancer screening are also being considered as part of the development of the new cancer reform strategy, which we hope to publish by the end of the year. An equality impact assessment will also be published alongside the strategy.</p>

	<p pid="b.189W.9/1">Action was taken during 2006 on the seven challenges identified in January 2006 in the Department's restructuring exercise. This was summarised in chapter 11 of the Department's departmental report 2007 and included:</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/2" class="indent">development of the new Policy and Strategy Directorate;</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/3" class="indent">action to strengthen the challenge role of finance, including appointments to new posts of group and business finance controllers in support of the Director General, Finance and Investment;</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/4" class="indent">creation of new Directorates for Commissioning and for Provider Development;</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/5" class="indent">appointment of a Director General for Social Care, to lead a new directorate;</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/6" class="indent">expanded membership for the Departmental Management Board (DMB), and development of a new structure of board committees, to strengthen corporate governance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/7" class="indent">new and stronger corporate support arrangements for the Department, based on a business partnering model.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/8">Further changes to the Department's top structure have been made in 2007 consequent on the decision to split the Department's permanent secretary and NHS chief executive roles and to clarify lines of accountability and responsibility. Action on the six areas for business improvement identified in 2006-07 continued into 2007-08, as set out in the Department's business plan published in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.189W.9/9">The Department's recent capability review has highlighted the areas that need further attention. The Department has set out its action plan, including timed deliverables and metrics, in the development plan published by the permanent secretary in September 2007. The departmental board will monitor progress against the plan, and will keep Ministers informed.</p>

Diabetes Prevalence The disease register in QOF for diabetes does not include any patient below the age of 17. However the denominator is all registered patients. This means that the reported prevalence is lower than the actual value.  3. Coverage of QOF&mdash;Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF. Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially Primary Medical Service practices who are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for general medical service practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules which allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. Note also that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register.  <i> Source:</i>  Information Centre.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.192W.6/1">Work on the Review of the Genetics White Paper &quot;Our inheritance. Our Future&mdash;realising the potential of genetics in the NHS&quot; (2003) is in its final stages. The review process has involved consultation with key stakeholders with an interest in genetics in healthcare, and their views and comments will be reflected in the report of the review when it is published shortly. While the review has been progressing, our continuing commitment to improving genetics services in the national health service has led to the renewal of several contracts, including those with the National Genetics Reference Laboratories and the National Genetics Education and Development Centre as well as continued commitments to the ongoing funding of additional scientific trainer and trainee posts in the NHS.</p>

PCTs were awarded devolved primary dental service funding allocations from that date. Individual funding allocations were based on the level of dental activity and costs observed in each area in the 12 month period October 2004 to September 2005, with appropriate additions to absorb subsequent annual contract value upratings, previously agreed service developments, and expected changes associated with the new ways of working fostered by the new contract terms available to dentists. These allocations were planned to allow PCTs to honour the commitment to offer all serving dentists new contracts at their previous levels of national health service earnings in return for maintaining their levels of NHS commitment, and provide a stable base from which PCTs could plan the further development of dental services using the flexibilities offered by the new contract to make the most effective use of dental resources. PCTs are also free to supplement provision for dentistry from within their total NHS resources if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Based on PCTs' initial devolved dental allocations, NHS net expenditure on primary care dental services in 2006-07, after taking account of the contribution from patient charges, was over &pound;400 million higher than in 2003-04, an increase of 30 per cent.</p>

Compliance with the relevant accounting standards (for example, those promulgated by the Accounting Standards Board or the International Accounting Standards Board) is needed if a company's accounts are to provide the required true and fair view. International Financial Reporting Standard 7 was brought into UK GAAP as Financial Reporting Standard 29 in 2007. This does not specifically cover bad debts but it requires disclosure of the significance of financial instruments for an entity's financial position and financial performance, plus quantitative and qualitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments.</p>

	<p pid="b.208W.9/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles employment statistics for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>

In both tables the local authorities are listed in order of their employment rates. A copy of the tables has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.208W.9/6" class="indent">These statistics are published each quarter for all parliamentary constituencies and local authorities in the local area labour market statistical indicators publication (accessible from <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14160">www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14160</a>).

Estimates for the City of London in particular are based on very few observations. The employment rate is the number of working age people, in employment, who are resident in the area (not the number who work in the area), expressed as the percentage of all working age people resident in the area. Further, estimates of change over time for all areas should be treated with caution.</p>

	<p pid="b.210W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about what recent estimates have been made of the number of <i> (a)</i> non-UK EU and <i> (b)</i> non-EU nationals in employment in the UK who reside in communal establishments; whether houses in multiple occupation are regarded as communal establishments for the purposes of counting non-UK nationals in employment in the UK; and what criteria is used for this purpose. (162353)</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.0/4" class="indent">The Labour Force Survey covers people resident in private households and in NHS accommodation in the UK. A random sample is drawn from the 'small users' sub-file of the Postcode Address File (PAF) for Great Britain. This sub-file contains addresses which receive less than 50 items of mail a day and so covers 97% of private households in GB but not most communal establishments. For Northern Ireland, the Valuation List is used instead of the PAF.</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.0/5" class="indent">A study completed by ONS in 2005 investigated extending the LFS to cater for residents in small communal establishments such as hotels and guesthouses. The results concluded that it was possible to collect information from this type of accommodation and that the study should be extended to cover other communal establishments. Therefore, the ONS plans to investigate methods to collect data from communal establishments in the future and this extension, would in principle pick up the resident and migrant workers living there who are currently excluded. However, until such time, it is not possible to estimate their numbers from the LFS.</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.0/6" class="indent">The 2001 Census definition of a communal establishment is one providing managed residential accommodation with either full time or part time supervision. Therefore, multi-occupant households are not considered to be communal establishments. Houses in multiple occupation are included in the 'small users' sub-file PAF and sampled in the LFS and all residents of these households are interviewed including non-UK Nationals.</p>

We are also working with Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) to strengthen their debt management capacity and overall governance.</p>
