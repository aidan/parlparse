The duty will therefore influence the overall strategic plans and policies in the light of which individual planning and licensing applications are considered. It may also, in particular cases, be material to individual decisions, where the local authority considers these to be of a strategic nature.</p>

	<p pid="b.2296W.3/2"><i> </i>I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.2296W.3/3">There are currently 164 Family Intervention Projects (FIPs). The majority of these provide support on an outreach basis, supporting families in their own home. There are currently six projects that run core, residential units. Essex has two FIPs based in Harlow and Tendering, both of which provide an outreach service.</p>
	<p pid="b.2296W.3/4">FIPs are a key part of Government policy to support families at risk. The projects use a twin-track approach of support alongside sanctions to provide families with the incentives to change. An assertive key worker plays a pivotal, challenging and coordinating role in the projects 'gripping' the whole family, and the agencies involved with them. Early evaluation of Family Intervention Projects has shown that they are helping to reduce anti-social behaviour, prevent homelessness and improve the health and education of families.</p>

Additional investment of &#163;655 million allocated in Budget 2009 has enabled the number of post-16 learning places available this academic year to increase to all time high of 1.55 million.

The Department does not hold figures by constituency. The Department has placed the relevant information which shows the per school pupil expenditure for primary and secondary schools in each local authority in England from 1997-98 to 2007-08 in the House libraries.</p>

	<p pid="b.2304W.5/6">Please note that these figures are in cash terms and that have not provided figures for City of London or Isles of Scilly:</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.5/7" class="indent">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table is taken from the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.5/8" class="indent">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.5/9" class="indent">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2304W.5/10" class="indent">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 to 2008-09 for all local authorities are provided in the following table. The figures for all funded pupils aged 3-19 have been placed in the House Libraries and are in cash terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.2306W.3/35">The revenue per pupil figures shown in table 4 are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 (in table 3 above) because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/36">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/37">The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/38">In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/39">LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/40">To provide a comparison for 2008-09 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06 (the baseline); as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2306W.3/41">The per pupil revenue funding figures for 2005-06 and 2008-09 for Redbridge and Waltham Forest local authorities are provided in table 4. The figures are for all funded pupils aged three-19 and are in cash terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.2316W.9/24" class="indent">ISAF forces operating in Helmand come from a number of different nations, which often operate closely alongside each other and alongside Afghan Army and Police units. Without undertaking a detailed assessment of each engagement, it is not possible precisely to define in every case whether an attack was aimed at UK forces, at our ISAF partners, or against Afghan units. Data is therefore collected on the number of incidents involving ISAF forces in Helmand without attempting to identify the nationality of the forces actually being attacked. The environment in which forces are operating makes it extremely difficult precisely to distinguish between incidents initiated by insurgent forces and those initiated by ISAF.</p>
	<p pid="b.2316W.9/25" class="indent">This data is based on information derived from a number of sources and can only be an estimate, not least because of the difficulties in ensuring a consistent interpretation of the basis for collating statistics in a complex fast-moving multinational operational environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.2316W.9/26" class="indent">I hope that the above information addresses your concerns on this matter.</p>
