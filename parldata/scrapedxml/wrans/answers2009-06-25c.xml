	<p pid="c.1047W.3/1">The Government have introduced legislation to establish a new code of practice for alcohol retailers. This will ensure that all alcohol retailers sell alcohol responsibly, by banning irresponsible promotions which encourage excessive drinking and can lead to crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/2">The legislation for the new code of practice in the Policing and Crime Bill is an enabling power, which will allow the Home Secretary to set out a small number of national mandatory licensing conditions which could apply to all alcohol retailers. It will also give licensing authorities more power to tackle local problems which occur in many town centres, allowing them to impose a more detailed set of conditions on two or more premises at the same time, in an area experiencing particularly high levels of alcohol-related nuisance and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/3">Ministers have not yet taken any final decisions on the content of the mandatory code but some of the measures we are consulting on include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/4" class="indent">banning offers like &quot;all you can drink for &pound;10&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/5" class="indent">outlawing pubs and bars offering promotions to certain groups, such as &quot;women drink free&quot; nights;</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/6" class="indent">banning staff dispensing alcohol directly into customers' mouths;</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/7" class="indent">requiring that consumers are able to make informed choices when they buy alcohol; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/8" class="indent">requiring bars and pubs to offer smaller measures available for customers who want them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1047W.3/9">We are holding a series of meetings with key stakeholders, including representatives of local government, enforcement agencies and the general public about the content of the code.</p>

	<p pid="c.1058W.0/2"><i> </i>Public information zones (PIZs) around large-scale petrol storage depots and other COMAH 'top-tier' onshore non-nuclear major hazard installations are rarely circular. They reflect the effect of site specific conditions, for example, the quantities and locations of hazardous substances stored on the site, and the influence of local weather conditions. PIZs range from a few hundred metres for sites storing flammable substances to a few kilometres for sites storing toxic substances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/3">The PIZ around a single, large scale petrol storage tank has a radius of 400 m from the edge of the tank's circular bund. However, most large-scale petroleum storage sites have more than one storage tank, and in some cases the PIZ will extend beyond 400 m due to the presence of the other hazardous substances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.0/4">To provide details of the PIZs for all 'top tier' COMAH sites, including large-scale petrol storage depots, could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1059W.2/2" class="indent">The Government are committed to ensuring that people facing redundancy and long term unemployment are able to access the help they need to improve skills and find employment. Since April 2009, the government has made available a new package of help for the unemployed including a &pound;100m package of training for 70,000 people under notice of redundancy, newly redundant, or close to the labour market. This is part of a wider package of advice and guidance available to jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.2/3" class="indent">The Government are also investing &pound;83 million over the next two years to support 75,000 people who reach six month JSA claim point to up-skill or re-skill in an area linked to the needs of the local labour market in order to help them get a job. Provision will be tailored to meet the individual's needs and we expect learners typically to follow Skills for Life, Level 2 or Level 3 vocational training. Training will be linked to the needs of the employers in the local job market. Learners can progress onto qualifications from this provision through the Adult Learner Responsive budget or through Train to Gain if they are in employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.2/4" class="indent">In the period funded through this programme, we expect learners to achieve a significant step on the path to the qualification of their choice. However, we recognise that it may take longer for them to complete the full qualification and additional support will be available to enable them to do that through Train to Gain or Adult Learner Responsive funding. At this time it is not possible to confirm the average length of training overall which will depend on the nature of that training, and whether it is full or part time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.2/5" class="indent">Contracts have initially been allocated to colleges, and will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that there is a good coverage and learners' needs are being met. A list of providers with whom initial allocations have been agreed has been placed in the House Libraries. However, allocations may change in response to demand and provision may be extended to other providers in the future in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.2/6" class="indent">A further package of help for young unemployed people was announced in the Budget and includes &pound;122 million for training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1071W.8/1">Despite the admirable efforts of the Greek chairmanship to reach a compromise, we deeply regret Russia's decision to block the renewal of the mandate for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission to Georgia, which is now due to close on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.8/2">Russia refused to agree to terms which were acceptable to all 55 of the other OSCE participating states, and insisted that OSCE monitors could not have full freedom of movement. This development, together with Russia's decision on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-16">16 June 2009</phrase> to veto a resolution to extend the mandate of the UN Observer Mission in Georgia, undermines our continuing efforts to find a peaceful political resolution to the conflict in Georgia and to support the humanitarian needs of those affected by conflict.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.8/3">We, together with our OSCE partners, will look for alternative ways for the OSCE to engage in Georgia and the separatist regions which continue to respect Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge Russia to respond constructively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1097W.2/1">DEFRA's policy is not prescriptive in relation to the disposal technology procured by an authority using private finance initiative (PFI) funding. DEFRA does however insist that a thorough appraisal of the options is performed and documented as part of the Outline Business Case (OBC). The technology selected for the OBC forms the basis of the OBC costings but does not determine the choice of technology which is ultimately selected in the procurement stage. Hence PFI credit support is not tied to any type of technology and is available to projects both with and without combustion as part of their waste management solution.</p>

	<p pid="c.1097W.6/1">Viable alternatives to child labour in Afghanistan include raising family incomes and increasing the availability of primary and secondary education. The Department for International Development (DFID) is helping raise family incomes by spending over &pound;180 million on economic development over the next four years (nationally and in Helmand province). DFID's support for schooling comprises a &pound;225 million contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1097W.6/2">Afghanistan has now signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises the right of the child to be:</p>

	<p pid="c.1097W.6/4">Afghanistan's responsibilities under this Convention are monitored by the Afghanistan Independent Human Right Commission, support for which is provided by a number of other donors.

	<p pid="c.1098W.0/1">The UK's strategy for helping poor countries respond to the impact of the recession includes mobilising additional external resources, especially from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial institutions. An extra $50 billion of concessional resources for low-income countries was committed at the London summit in April. The IMF has increased concessional funds to crisis affected countries, helping partner governments to maintain funding of social programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1098W.0/2">The UK has committed &pound;200 million to a new vulnerability fund, managed by the World Bank, which will scale up social protection. Women and other vulnerable groups are explicitly targeted in many Department for International Development programmes and we have stepped up our bilateral support for social protection. In 2007-08, DFID spent &pound;45 million on social protection in Africa, an increase from &pound;35 million in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="c.1099W.2/1">Government corruption does not have a significant impact on the effectiveness of UK aid to Cambodia. When designing programmes the Department for International Development (DFID) works closely with the Cambodian Government and other development partners to mitigate against this risk and monitor progress throughout implementation. We also provide support to a joint programme to reform the management of public finances, which continues to make good progress in improving the Cambodian Government's financial systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/2">Only 8 per cent. of UK assistance to Cambodia was channelled directly through government systems in 2008. For this, we also designed additional safeguards to ensure UK aid was used effectively, including additional reporting by government on the use of funds. A recent independent country programme evaluation concluded that DFID had made a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to development in Cambodia.</p>

	<p pid="c.1101W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has so far made available &pound;22 million of humanitarian aid for those people who have been displaced by conflict in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas and north west frontier province, including the Swat valley. &pound;12.5 million of this has been allocated to support the UN co-ordinated Pakistan Humanitarian Response Plan and &pound;9 million has been allocated to the International Committee for the Red Cross. The remainder of our funding is being used to support a local non governmental organisation working with the displaced and to help the overall coordination of the humanitarian effort.</p>
	<p pid="c.1101W.3/2">An estimated total of 2.4 million people have been displaced, of which about 200,000 are living in camps and the rest with host communities. DFID's funding is providing food, shelter, water and sanitation, healthcare and protection for the most vulnerable. DFID is also making contributions to the funding that is being provided by the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund and by the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.1110W.6/2">While the priorities for tackling climate change should continue to be overwhelmingly focussed on greenhouse gas emission reductions, and adaptation to unavoidable climate change, we should not rule out any climate change mitigation technologies at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.1110W.6/3">Ocean fertilisation involves adding nutrients, usually iron, nitrogen or phosphorus compounds, to nutrient depleted areas of the open ocean, with the aim of increasing phytoplankton production to absorb additional amounts of carbon dioxide and storing a proportion of the additional carbon production below the surface layers of the ocean when the plankton dies. Further research into both the effectiveness of this practice as a carbon sequestration measure and the impact that this practice may have on the marine environment would be required before this technique is considered for use as a climate change mitigation technology.</p>

	<p pid="c.1122W.11/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government supports medical and clinical research. The MRC provides funding for research through a range of grants and personal awards to scientists in universities, medical schools and other research institutes. Applications are generally submitted by the scientific community in 'response mode' and the MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health. Funding is usually provided in open competition across all areas of science, though the MRC also issues targeted calls for proposals to stimulate research in strategic priority areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.11/3">The MRC has also earmarked specific funding to build capacity through studentships and clinical training fellowships in the stem cell area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.11/4">All applications are peer reviewed by independent scientific experts in the UK and overseas. This peer review is the first part of a two-stage process, which helps the MRC's research boards and committees to decide which proposals to consider at their funding meetings. The research boards use similar criteria to those of the referees and also identify any ethical issues or risks to human participants that need further attention.</p>
	<p pid="c.1122W.11/5">The primary considerations in funding decisions are research excellence and importance to health; however, high quality proposals in areas of particular strategic importance may be given priority in competition for funds.</p>

	<p pid="c.1124W.6/2">The National Apprenticeship Service online vacancy matching system has been developed to provide a high quality service to employers wishing to recruit apprentices, and to young people and adults considering an apprenticeship. This will help deliver the objective outlined in World-class Apprenticeships to expand and improve the quality of our apprenticeship programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1124W.6/3">At the end of April 2009, 4,157 vacancies were live on the system; a total of 8,051 vacancies have been posted since <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January 2009</phrase> when the system went live. 93 vacancies have been filled through the service with 2,445 vacancies having current applications. The figures at this stage provide provisional data on apprenticeship applications. Feedback from a number of employers suggest that the recruitment process can take up to four months. In addition, the system was built to allow employers flexibility to integrate the advertising of apprenticeship opportunities on the system, with their own HR systems. In these instances candidates click through the Vacancy Matching System to the employers' own recruitment website. The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) is looking at how feedback can be obtained from these employers, mainly national companies, without putting undue bureaucracy on them.</p>

The unit cost will vary according to the type and duration of training that individual does undertake. We have reassessed the capacity of the funding, and estimate that we will now support around 70,000 learners through this provision. This was announced as an important part of the wider package of support being made available to help those facing redundancy. The additional places are funded through the Learning and Skills Council and will help people improve their employability skills and find work.</p>

	<p pid="c.1138W.2/13">The figure for the National Offender Management Service does not include the 42 local probation boards and trusts. Information on the costs of furniture is held locally and can be collated only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.2/14">Furniture is typically used for a period of 20 years within the Department. Major acquisitions usually occur only where a new building is taken on following the expiry of building leases. The majority of headquarters expenditure relates to the move to a new headquarters building as part of a major rationalisation of the Ministry's London estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.2/15">The reduction in the number of buildings occupied in central London, increased capacity of the building and move to flexible workspace in 102 Petty France will in future save an estimated &pound;10 million a year. This move will enable more effective working and the reduction of the size and cost of the London estate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1138W.8/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children .from sexual exploitation. This makes direct comparisons with previous legislation very difficult. Many new offences created by the Act will not have a direct equivalent under the old legislation.

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="c.1142W.2/2">The Sexual Offences Act 2003 significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual exploitation. This makes direct comparisons with previous legislation very difficult. Many new offences created by the Act will not have a direct equivalent under the old legislation.

	<p pid="c.1148W.5/1">Records are not held of the number of prisoners granted temporary release. However, the numbers of temporary release licences issued in 2007-08 was 441,167. This figure is the total of all individual licences issued, as some prisoners will be granted temporary release on a number of occasions and as a result will be issued with multiple licences over the course of a year. The 2008-09 figure will be published in the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2008 at the end of July 2009. The publication of this bulletin has been pre-announced on the Ministry of Justice and the United Kingdom Statistics Authority websites.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.5/2">Release on temporary licence is the mechanism that enables prisoners to participate in necessary activities, outside of the prison establishment, that directly contribute to their resettlement into the community and their development of a purposeful law abiding life. Prisoners are not granted temporary release unless they meet the eligibility criteria and pass a stringent risk assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1149W.2/42">The table shows the sentences handed down to and the average custodial sentence length (ACSL) for determinate sentences for those aged 21 and over under sections 18, section 20 and 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for 2007. The table also shows the sentences handed down to, and the ACSL for, offenders aged under 21, sentenced under sections 18 and 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for 2007. Also included is the number of indeterminate sentences for the section 18 offences. These data are based on the offences under section 18, section 20 and section 47, where such offences were the principal offences for which the offender was sentenced. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed, where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.</p>
