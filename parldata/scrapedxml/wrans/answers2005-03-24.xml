	<p pid=".921W.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. David Burnside, dated March 2005</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what steps he has taken to consult local farmers and residents between Randalstown and Toome on the proposed building of a new motorway to replace the existing A road. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/4" class="indent">The A6 Randalstown to Toome Road forms part of the Key Transport Corridor linking Belfast and Londonderry. In recognition of its strategic importance, Roads Service is proposing to replace the existing road with a high standard dual carriageway from the end of the M22, west of Randalstown, to Castledawson, incorporating the recently completed Toome Bypass.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/5" class="indent">As part of this process, Roads Service held a public exhibition to inform local farmers and residents of progress on the planning of the scheme. The purpose of the public exhibition was to obtain comments on the alternative alignments that have been developed. Members of the public, whose property may be affected by these alignments, were individually invited to visit the exhibition and to express their views or preferences and the exhibition was advertised in the press. All visitors had the opportunity to record their comments at the exhibition, by completing a questionnaire, or by writing to Roads Service at a later date.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/6" class="indent">Following the public exhibition, Roads Service officials attended meetings with local representatives and landowners, to receive further comments and, where possible, to address their concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/7" class="indent">Roads Service officials are now considering all comments received during this consultation process and will take these into account in the selection of the preferred alignment. If necessary, a further public exhibition will be held before a single preferred alignment is proposed. The preferred route alignment will then, of course, be subject to the statutory procedures process, which gives further opportunity for public comment.</p>
	<p pid=".921W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".924W.5/1">The amending directive, 2004/28/EC, was published by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase> following a major review of EU medicines legislation. Member states are required to implement its provisions by <phrase class="date" code="">30 October 2005</phrase>. It includes a provision requiring all medicines for food-producing animals, including bees, to be available only on veterinary prescription.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.5/2">This provision was introduced with the intention of strengthening the control of these medicines and related consumer safeguards. While there are valid reasons for restricting some veterinary medicines to prescription supply, we do not consider this appropriate for all medicines for use in food-producing animals. Neither the Commission, nor the majority of member states supported the UK view and the requirement was consequently included in the amending directive.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.5/3">However, the UK successfully negotiated the inclusion of a provision that allows medicines that meet certain criteria, to be agreed subsequently, to be exempt from the prescription requirement. This provision also allows the current distribution arrangements to remain until a list of exemption criteria is agreed, or until January 2007 if no list has been agreed by then. The exemption list is to be proposed by the Commission and voted on by the member states. We are well aware of concerns expressed by UK beekeepers and will continue to argue strongly for medicines for routine use in bees that do not meet any of the other criteria for prescription only status to be included on the list.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.5/4">In addition to pressing for routine bee medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement, we have proposed new distribution categories for the UK that include tiered categories of prescription only medicines. If adopted, these will comply with the directive's provisions while allowing most medicines for food-producing animals that are currently available without prescription to be supplied by pharmacists or suitably qualified persons without the need to involve a veterinary surgeon.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.5/5">Antimicrobial resistance is a serious problem in human medicine resulting in increasing concerns about the use of antimicrobial products, including antibiotics, in human medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture and horticulture. It is therefore likely that any veterinary medicines containing antibiotics will be under veterinary control. There is one antibiotic authorised for use in bees, for the treatment of Nosema. Officials at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate will be discussing how this antibiotic is to be supplied with beekeeper representatives.</p>

	<p pid=".925W.2/1">Betton Abbots landfill site is operated by Shropshire Waste Management (SWM). In 2002, SWM applied to the Environment Agency for a permit under the provisions of the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Regulations to significantly extend the existing site. As part of the application process the company needed to demonstrate that the underlying groundwater resources would not be affected.</p>
	<p pid=".925W.2/2">A survey carried out by SWM for the extension of the landfill demonstrated that the geology beneath the site is primarily sandstone, which contains a major aquifer. Environment Agency guidance, based on the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive, precludes the authorisation of any new landfill sites located on major aquifers unless substantial low permeable barriers such as certain types of clay protect them. This does not exist at Betton Abbots and as a consequence SWM have withdrawn their permit application.</p>
	<p pid=".925W.2/3">In addition to the pollution control issues, there are outstanding planning issues before the site could be considered for further importation of waste materials, these relate mainly to the provision of a new road into the site.</p>

	<p pid=".926W.2/1">The provisional total of 736 million tonnes included in the UK's National Allocation Plan was calculated by estimating the projected emissions from the sectors covered by the EU ETS and subtracting the additional savings of 5.5 MtCO <sub>2</sub> which the Government decided the EU ETS would deliver. This calculation was based on provisional emission projections and this was made clear when submitting the UK's National Allocation Plan (NAP) to the European Commission in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/2">Following the finalisation of emissions projections and Climate Change Agreement targets UK emissions for the period 2005&ndash;07 are now estimated to be around 56 MtCO <sub>2</sub> higher than in April last year. These latest projections are more consistent with recent historic emissions levels.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/3">Rather than increase the total by that amount, the UK proposed to increase the total number of allowances by around 20 million to 756 million, which ensures that the UK strikes a balance between the concerns of business about potential competitiveness impacts and the UK's leadership on climate change. However, the Commission has made it clear that it does not consider that the provisional total of 736 million allowances can be exceeded and is not prepared to consider any increase.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase> the Government announced its intention to issue allowances in line with the NAP approved by the Commission (736 million) as soon as possible to allow operators to fully participate in the EU ETS, while initiating legal proceedings against the Commission, seeking to require the Commission to consider the substance of the amendment.</p>
	<p pid=".926W.2/5">In accordance with earlier announcements, the additional reduction will be taken from the electricity supply industry. As this industry is more insulated from international competition than others, this approach will have less of an impact on UK competitiveness than reducing the allocation to other industries. The Government does not expect this approach will have a material impact on electricity prices which will reflect the price of allowances in the EU-wide market, rather than the number of allowances allocated free to generators. In the event of a successful challenge, the additional allowances would be distributed between the installations in the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) sector.</p>

	<p pid=".927W.0/2">The monitoring programme will also explore issues such as visitor behaviour, enjoyment and satisfaction with access rights in more depth. The main elements of the monitoring programme include additional interviews in the continuing England Day Visitor Survey, which measures public use of access land, and using an Omnibus Survey to track public awareness and understanding of access rights and of what constitutes responsible visitor behaviour both in the countryside in general and in relation to access land. In addition there will be on-site surveys to establish a more in-depth profile of visitors and visitor behaviour on access land and an on-line (website) survey of access land users seeking to establish qualitative data on views, perceptions and levels of public satisfaction in relation to access land. The Agency's monitoring programme will include a land manager survey to assess the impact of the new rights of access on land managers and also a nature conservation monitoring element through an extension to the Breeding Bird Survey, operated by the British Trust for Ornithology.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.0/3">The England Day Visitor Survey records day visits to the countryside and will for the first time separately identify visits to open access land and to English National Parks. The Agency will publish the results of the England Day Visitor Survey and Omnibus Survey in April 2006. The report will include an assessment of the impact of the Act on the number of people accessing the countryside including the effect on the number of walks undertaken in the South East and Lower North West. This assessment will be possible once a full year of data is available to compare against the visits recorded by the Great Britain Day Visit Survey 2002&ndash;03. The other elements of the monitoring programme are scheduled to commence from summer 2005 and the Agency will publish reports from these early in 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.0/1">My officials have been in contact with Corby borough council over funding of intrusive investigations at various sites. Subsequently, the Environment Agency has been asked by the council under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to inspect on its behalf one site in the ironworks area, and other sites in the borough, as potential special sites. They are meeting to discuss this shortly. Investigations under Part IIA help to establish the level and nature of any risk to human health or the environment from land contamination, and may inform decisions about subsequent remediation.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.0/2">The Agency has also been consulted by the borough about several planning applications, as a statutory consultee under Town and Country Planning legislation for certain types of application. Such consultations enable the Agency to comment on risks to controlled waters in connection with development proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".933W.5/1">The severely disadvantaged areas (SDAs) form part of the less favoured areas (LFAs) of the UK as listed in EU Council Directive 84/169/EEC. The LFAs are further divided for domestic purposes between SDAs and disadvantaged areas (DAs), the distinction being one of degree, most significantly of land quality. Upland SDAs are disadvantaged relative to non-SDA land in respect of a number of handicaps. These include higher altitude, harsher climate with a shorter growing season, low soil fertility, difficult topography, and remoteness.</p>
	<p pid=".933W.5/2">Both the SDAs and the Moorland Line have been taken into account in establishing English areas for the purpose of the single payment scheme (SPS.) In view of the considerable redistributional effects that would flow from a single flat rate payment under the SPS, it was initially concluded that England would be divided into two areas, SDAs and other land. However, following representations from a number of key stakeholders (including the NFU and the CLA) this has been amended so that the area boundaries that will apply in England divide the country into three, broadly corresponding to land types and still using existing boundaries. One area comprises the upland severely disadvantaged area (SDA), another the Moorland Line within the SDA and the third area will be all land outside the SDA.</p>

	<p pid=".934W.2/1">The UK Government accepts that social criteria is complementary to environmental and economic criteria in the context of sustainable forest management and that international guidelines, including the Pan European Operational Level Guidelines, recognise this principle. The UK Government timber procurement policy has been devised so that one outcome will be the enhancement of forest dependent peoples' well being through an increase in the amount of legal timber and timber from well managed forests being supplied.</p>
	<p pid=".934W.2/2">European procurement directives require public sector contracting authorities to limit their contract specifications to criteria that are relevant to the product or service being purchased. The UK Government believe that forest dependent people play a part in sustaining forest health and vitality. However, as far as the procurement directives are concerned, their well being does not appear to be sufficiently relevant to the subject matter of contracts to warrant inclusion as contract specification criteria. The UK's interpretation of the directives is based on legal advice and on advice from officials responsible for procurement policy. It would appear that a different view is taken by Denmark. However if it were ever to be established beyond reasonable doubt that the well being of forest dependent people could feasibly be included as a requirement in public sector contracts then the UK Government would reconsider its position.</p>

	<p pid=".936W.5/1">Water companies may increase their charges only within the price limits set by Ofwat. Ofwat's approach to setting price limits is to allow no more than is necessary for efficient companies to finance their functions. In co-operation with the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, Ofwat monitor companies' delivery of their functions and levels of service and takes regulatory action where their performance falls short.</p>
	<p pid=".936W.5/2">In the period covered by new price limits, 2005 to 2010, companies will be undertaking a range of measures in order to meet their water supply duties. Companies will, for example, take measures to increase the security of supply where supply is most at risk, including measures to reduce leakage. They will be making improvements to water treatment works to continue to meet the standards of drinking water quality, as well as improving the taste, colour and odour of drinking water in areas where this has been an issue of local concern. They are also expected to reduce the number of homes at risk from sewer flooding so that by 2010 no more than 0.01 per cent. of properties will be at risk of internal flooding from overloaded sewers at least once every 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".936W.5/3">The reduction of pesticide run-off is the responsibility of the farmers and growers who apply the pesticides to their crops not the water companies. The Government encourages farmers and growers through advice and Codes of Practice to minimise their use of pesticides to avoid the risk of run-off to surface waters.</p>

However, in a News Release of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February</phrase>, accompanying a technical note of the revision it was pointed out that the revision was most easily explained as removing depreciation from both the current budget and net investment.

	<p pid=".951W.0/1">The Government have funded three rounds of warden pilot schemes. The information is in the following table. Funding for the first round of warden pilots began in 2000&ndash;01, with rounds two and three starting in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 respectively. Funding for the first round of warden pilots ended in March 2004, funding for the second round will end in March this year and funding for the third round will end in March 2006. Of the 84 round 1, neighbourhood warden schemes, 70 (83 per cent.) have been sustained after the end of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's funding and continue to operate as successful warden schemes. For the 122 round 2, street warden schemes, the majority already have future funding agreed although in some areas decisions have yet to be taken. Guidance has been issued to all round 2 street warden schemes whose funding ends in March 2005. This includes information on how other schemes achieved continued funding, a list of funding sources and guidance for schemes on how they can contribute to Government floor targets. Sustainability events have been organised regionally by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's funded warden resource centres. Letters of support from senior officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and visits from trained consultants are also available to schemes who are seeking future funding. In addition at least 150 more warden schemes have been set up by LAs, RSLs on other bodies without pilot funding.</p>

	<p pid=".957W.2/2">The Government have concluded that legislation should set a default retirement age of 65, but also create a right for employees to request working beyond a compulsory retirement age, which employers will have a duty to consider seriously. Provided that they have the consent of their employer, people over the age of 65 will be able to stay in employment. Legislation from 2006 will make unjustified age discrimination in recruitment, training, promotion and dismissal unlawful for workers of all ages.</p>

	<p pid=".957W.8/1">Government planning policies on parking are laid down in Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG) 13 Transport. We want to promote accessibility, the use of public transport, walking and cycling and to reduce the need to travel, especially by private car. The availability of parking is an important factor in people's transport choices. So we encourage local authorities to develop and implement policies on parking that, as part of a package of planning and transport measures, ensure levels of parking provided in association with development will promote sustainable transport choices. There should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people, and policies in development plans should set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.8/2">PPG13 sets national maximum standards at Annex D for certain classes of use, and local authorities should follow these unless the applicant has demonstrated that a higher level of parking is needed. Primary care centres are not one of the uses where the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has set specific standards but officials have been asked to keep this under review for any future guidance that might be issued.</p>

	<p pid=".964W.0/1">Home Office quantitative polling research in August 2004 and February 2005 show a significant increase in awareness with 77 per cent. of those interviewed in February 2005 having heard of HMD compared with 53 per cent. in August 2004. 66 per cent. agreed that events like HMD have an important part to play in combating racism and discrimination compared with 51 per cent. in August 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.0/2">To give a comparison, in February 2004 a BBC survey revealed only 55 per cent. of the UK's population had ever heard of Auschwitz. A new BBC survey conducted in January 2005 has shown that now 94 per cent. of the population in the UK has heard of Auschwitz. This awareness is not just superficial, with half of the UK population feeling that they now know quite a lot about the Holocaust, compared to only 30 per cent. last year. In establishing HMD the Government wanted to drive up awareness and understanding of the Holocaust. The televised national event in January, preceded by a reception for survivors at St. James's Palace in the presence of Her Majesty The Queen and supported by other media programming about the Holocaust, has succeeded in this aim. Understanding the continuum of hatred and marginalisation that led from racist abuse to mass genocide will help new generations to stand up to anti-Semitism, racism and intolerance.</p>
	<p pid=".964W.0/3">The 2005 commemoration provides an excellent basis for the work of the new Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, which will shortly be launched and will assume responsibility for the delivery of HMD from now on.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.2/1">Drug testing on arrest is a provision within the Drugs Bill currently before Parliament. The provision builds upon the existing drug testing on charge scheme and will mean that persons who are in police detention having been arrested for a trigger offence (or an offence to which an inspector has reasonable grounds for suspecting that misuse of a specified Class A drug contributed), may be tested earlier than at present. The Drugs Bill also contains provision for those who test positive to be required to attend an assessment of their drug use and related issues. Assessment in this context has previously been voluntary on the part of the arrestee.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.2/2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) programme tested a sample of arrestees at 16 custody sites from 1998&ndash;2002. The survey, which was not nationally representative, found that 69 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for any drug and 38 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates and/or cocaine/crack.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.5/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, anti-social behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Ribble Valley constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/2">For example, between March 1997 and September 2004, the number of police officers in Lancashire police force increased by 297 from 3,247 to 3,544. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 117 CSOs on Lancashire streets, with funding available to recruit a further 57 by end of March 2005 to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;4, the Lancashire police force area has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 41 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 39 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/3">Lancashire police force is receiving &pound;190.8 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 4.31 per cent. (&pound;7.9 million) over 2004&ndash;05. Lancashire police also gains around &pound;0.4 million from the Amending Report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 4.52 per cent. General grants funding to Lancashire has increased by 29.9 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Lancashire will also receive around &pound;17.4 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. One CCTV project in the Ribble Valley CDRP area received a total of &pound;572,151 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include communities against drugs, the safer communities initiative, the small retailers in deprived areas scheme and the building safer communities fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;298,794 has been allocated to Ribble Valley CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.32 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office regional director in the north west for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a prolific and other priority offenders (PPO) scheme in Ribble Valley set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/8">The Government's crime reduction website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle anti-social behaviour and nuisance. In Ribble Valley a total of 10 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling anti-social behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/10">Tackling drug misuse is a priority of this Government and their policy is set out in the 10-year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the House Library.) Under this, the Government have invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focussing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Lancashire has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drug Interventions Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Lancashire drug action team amounted to &pound;5.47 million, rising to &pound;7.61 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Ribble Valley constituency can be obtained from the Lancashire drugs action team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a> .</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/16">The Government are working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/17">The Home Office has funded a Time Limited Development Fund (TLDF) project in the Ribble Valley, the Trinity Community Partnership (Clitheroe) Ltd. They were awarded &pound;113,930 for three years (the project finishes <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>). The project has recruited, trained and developed mentors for young people, particularly for those excluded or in danger of being excluded from school or on the periphery of offending, and has encouraged young people to take up volunteering.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/18">This year, 2005, is the year of the volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with community service volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/19">We are particularly keen to encourage young people, black and minority ethnic groups, those with no qualifications and disabled people to get involved. More details can be found at <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a> .</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/20">Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in the Home Office Annual Report and in the Strategic Plan for 2004&ndash;08, available on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".976W.2/2">Since 1997 the Government have built a platform of economic stability which allows all businesses, small and large, to thrive. Businesses in Edinburgh North and Leith, and throughout the UK generally, are benefiting from low inflation, low interest rates and sound public finances. Furthermore, the UK now has the lowest ever corporation tax rates for small businesses and the lowest starting rate among major industrialised countries. Other initiatives introduced since 1997 have included the introduction and improvement of R and D tax credits, the reform of capital gains tax and steps to reduce the regulatory burden for business. Further support is delivered through the Scottish Executive and its various agencies.</p>

The key purpose of SESA support is to help less experienced businesses to identify opportunities and deal with low-level commercial risk in investigating export markets. The scheme also supports seminars which promote UK sectoral capabilities to overseas business people and opinion formers.</p>

	<p pid=".978W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/2">The Government, via the local Business Link and Advantage West Midlands have provided significant support to small businesses in both Newcastle-under-Lyme and the whole of Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/3">Wide-ranging support has been delivered via the local Business Link operator and the Regional Development Agency, Advantage West Midlands (AWM). Core funding from the Small Business Service (SBS) to Business Link Staffordshire has totalled approximately &pound;2.8 million per annum for each operational year since April 2001. Additional funding at least equal to that amount has been sourced from local and regional partners and ERDF as a direct result of that core funding. Whilst that funding covers the whole of the county of Staffordshire, Business Link has been pro-active in its work with companies based in Newcastle-under-Lyme.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/4">There are a total of 3,170 businesses based in the Newcastle-under-Lyme district. These businesses are able to access a wide range of business support services. These range from basic business information through to long-term, in-depth support project that assist companies to diversify into new product areas or to capitalise on new market opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/5">Businesses are able to benefit from a range of Workforce Development services to help them achieve the Investor's in People (IIP) standard and develop their workforce. Subsidised workshops are available to assist businesses to become IIP accredited, and to maintain that accreditation once they have secured it. In total, companies are able to access up to &pound;1,000 financial support to assist them along their journey to Investors in People recognition.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/6">The new Director Development Programme is also able to assist businesses that are seeking to grow and develop by enhancing and developing the skills of the directors within the business. Individual training plans are agreed with directors to encourage them to develop their business skills in order to enhance the profitability and long-term success of the businesses they are responsible for.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/7">Business Link Staffordshire has worked with over 1,650 businesses in Newcastle-under-Lyme since April 2001, a total of 52 per cent. of the overall business population. Some of those companies have been assisted to diversify into new products and markets to secure their ongoing viability. Other businesses in the area have been assisted with the implementation of e-commerce to ensure that in today's modern society they are able to respond to customer demand for online ordering.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/8">4 per cent. of the total number of businesses the Business Link have worked with (140) have received intensive assistance to enable those SME's to implement improvements to specific business practices.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/9">With support from the DTI and AWM the Rover Task Force has supported more than 160 Staffordshire companies in the automotive supply chain to diversify and to help start ups with high growth potential to establish themselves, 16 of which are based in Newcastle-under-Lyme. The regional Accelerate programme which helps manufacturing companies modernise themselves has also provided specific assistance to three companies in Newcastle-under-Lyme. The Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) a DTI and AWM funded initiative has supported 150 companies in the Newcastle-under-Lyme and immediately surrounding area. With 65 companies having received in depth support.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/10">A key area of concern in Newcastle-under-Lyme is the rate of new business formation. Business Link Staffordshire has assisted over 150 entrepreneurs to establish new businesses within the constituency. Those businesses are assisted for a period of two years to ensure they are capable of surviving in the long term. Our business start up survival rate after 12 months is 92 per cent. which reflects the depth and quality of business advice those start up businesses receive. Each start up business must produce a comprehensive business plan that is then reviewed by an experienced business advisor. Having reviewed the plan, goals are established with the entrepreneur which are then reviewed at regular intervals. Any variation from those goals is then explored in detail with the entrepreneur and where appropriate, action plans are developed to help them get back on track.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/11">The availability of suitable premises has also been an issue in Newcastle-under-Lyme and through working closely with partners, including the Business Innovation Centre, a range of specific support has been made available. First, a number of incubator and business starter units, managed by the Business Innovation Centre, have been developed by Staffordshire county council, bringing brownfield sites back into effective use. Those businesses have often qualified for grant assistance of up to &pound;3,000 to develop innovative products.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/12">Business Link Staffordshire has worked closely with the north Staffordshire regeneration zone and other relevant local bodies, including Keele and Staffordshire university to ensure that businesses have been able to benefit from other services, including STEP and knowledge transfer placements. The emerging science park at Keele university has benefited from a dedicated medical technologies adviser to assist businesses within that cluster to establish themselves on the park and become successful.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/13">Since 1997 Advantage West Midlands and it's predecessors responsible for delivery have offered Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) and Selective Finance for Investment (SFI) grants to 10 companies in Newcastle-Under-Lyme totalling &pound;7.8 million. Take up of the grants offered has been &pound;560,000 to two companies. It is expected that over the coming months a further five companies will receive grant support totalling &pound;850,000. The discrepancy between grant offered and take up is largely due to the &pound;5 million project with S and A Food not proceeding.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/14">The SBS via it's SMART and Grant for Research and Development product has provided offers of grant totalling &pound;611,000 to support 14 companies in Staffordshire (one of which is based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Faraday Technology &pound;114,000 to develop new products and bring them to market.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/15">The North Staffordshire Risk Capital Fund is available to businesses in the Newcastle-under-Lyme area, encouraging businesses to consider appropriate long-term finance rather than short term overdrafts. This is a relatively new initiative that will be on benefit to companies in the long-term.</p>
	<p pid=".978W.9/16">Business Link Staffordshire has also provided funding for the Minority Business Association in north Staffordshire to ensure that businesses operated by people from ethnic minority backgrounds are not disadvantaged in any way. The MBA has been proactive in its work in Newcastle&ndash;under-Lyme.</p>

Specifically, Article I-33 of the Constitutional Treaty, which describes the legal acts of the Union, provides for (among other things) European laws and European framework laws. The definition of a &quot;European law&quot; in Article I-33 corresponds closely to the definition of a &quot;regulation&quot; in the existing Article 249 TEC and the definition of a &quot;European framework law&quot; in Article I-33 corresponds to the definition of a &quot;directive&quot; in Article 249.

	<p pid=".989W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/2" class="italic">Outcome of the <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase> General Affairs and External Relations Council</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/3">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/4">Conclusions were agreed on the Middle East, Human Rights&mdash;Preparation for the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), Lebanon, Croatia, and Iran.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/5" class="italic">General Affairs Session</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/6" class="italic">Preparations for the European Council&mdash;22&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March</phrase>, Brussels</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/7">The Council discussed the revised European Council Conclusions. Member states raised the importance of the Lisbon Strategy and the importance of growth and employment. UK and a number of other member states underlined the importance of further developing the EU's medium and long-term strategy to tackle climate change. Language was also agreed on better regulation and administrative burdens. Overall, member states thought that the text represented a good balance. The Government agree.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/8" class="italic">Enlargement&mdash;Croatia</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/9">The Council referred to the Conclusions reached by the European Council in June 2004 confirming Croatia as a candidate for membership as well as further Conclusions reached in December 2004. The Council reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the accession of Croatia and referred to the importance of full cooperation with the ICTY on the part of all Western Balkans countries as an essential requirement for closer relations with the EU. After deliberation by the Council it was agreed that the opening of accession negotiations should be postponed. Conclusions were accordingly agreed reiterating the importance of Croatia cooperating fully with ICTY, and confirming that negotiations would open as soon as the Council had established that Croatia was so doing. The Government underlined their desire to see Croatia as a full member of the EU as soon as possible but reiterated that this could only happen when there was full cooperation with the ICTY.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/10" class="italic">Future financing 2007&ndash;13</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/11">The presidency presented its so-called &quot;negotiating box&quot; for future financing&mdash;essentially a list of issues up for negotiation in the form of possible June European Council Conclusions. The presidency did not invite comments. The Government's position on future financing remains that the Commission's proposals for real term spending increases of 35 per cent. from 2007 to 2013 are unrealistic and unacceptable. We, along with France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, believe that the priorities of an enlarged Union can be met within a budget of 1 per cent. EU GNI. This is sufficient to meet the challenge of cohesion provided that resources are focused on priorities&mdash;namely the poorest member states.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/12" class="italic">External Relations Session</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/13" class="italic">Middle East</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/14">Over lunch the Foreign Secretary briefed Partners on the outcome of the London Meeting and thanked them for their support. There was agreement on the need for continued EU engagement. Ministers then turned to the situation in Lebanon, reaffirming their strong support for a sovereign, independent and democratic Lebanon. They welcomed the commitment to these values shown by the people of Lebanon. They highlighted the importance for the EU that the forthcoming legislative elections in Lebanon be held in accordance with a free and fair electoral process based on the Lebanese constitution, free from foreign interference. The EU will closely monitor the electoral process and be ready to provide assistance. This may, if invited, include sending an election observation mission. Ministers agreed Council Conclusions calling for a full and immediate implementation of UNSCR 1559, the withdrawal of Syrian intelligence services, and the importance of free and fair elections.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/15" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/16">High Representative Javier Solana updated the Council on the state of play of negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme undertaken by France, Germany and the UK (the 'E3'), plus the Council Secretariat. Ministers exchanged views on the negotiations. They expressed their support for the E3's approach, welcoming the support from the international community and the announcement by the United States on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March</phrase> that it would actively support these negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/17" class="italic">Russia</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/18">The presidency underlined its commitment to conclude agreement on the Four Common Spaces as a package at the EU-Russia Summit on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-10">10 May</phrase> and drew to Ministers' attention the remaining issues. A number of member states raised the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation on the Georgia/Russia border and the EU's response to the blocking of its mandate. The Government welcome the progress made on the Four Common Spaces and supports the presidency in their efforts to reach an agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/19" class="italic">Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/20">The presidency emphasised the importance of reaching agreement on the new GSP scheme to meet the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to countries affected by the Asian tsunami to bring it into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Ministers discussed the two outstanding problems, which were the graduation threshold for textiles and clothing and the granting of &quot;GSP plus&quot; to El Salvador. Member states reiterated their positions on the graduation threshold for textiles. The Government had pushed for the same threshold across all sectors, but were willing to compromise and supported the Commission proposal in order to reach agreement in time for the <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> deadline. However, member states arguing for a lower threshold were unwilling to compromise. The Council was unable to approve the new GSP regime. The Government will continue to work to ensure that a new GSP is agreed at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/21" class="italic">European Neighbourhood Policy</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/22">The European Commission presented European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Country Reports on Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Egypt and Lebanon. There was no discussion. The Government welcome the timely preparation of the Country Reports and supports the inclusion of all of these countries in the ENP. The Government believe the ENP will provide a useful tool to encourage reform in all five countries, and progress on conflict resolution in the South Caucasus. We therefore support the recommendation in the Country Reports that Action Plans should be prepared for all five countries.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/23" class="italic">Sudan</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/24">The Council exchanged views on the situation in Sudan, especially on the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the conflict in Darfur. The Council expressed the hope that the negotiations underway in the UN Security Council would lead to consensus in favour of the implementation of a UN mission to Sudan and of measures that would end the violence and impunity in Darfur through referral to the International Criminal Court. This was reflected in Council Conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/25" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/26">Over lunch the Foreign Secretary raised the <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase> Zimbabwean elections and the need for a fair but firm EU assessment. He highlighted that the UK remained concerned about the prospects for free and fair elections. Constituency boundaries had been redrawn in favour of Zanu PF, the voters' roll was a mess, newspapers had been shut down and foreign journalists prevented from working, and intimidation against the opposition continued. The elections should not be seen in isolation, but in the context of the political climate that had prevailed since the 2002 presidential elections. The changes that the Government had made in the last 30 days could not make up for the brutality and lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law over the past three years. The Foreign Secretary offered to write to Partners setting out the issues further.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.0/1">Whenever possible and appropriate, I try on trips abroad of any length to visit areas beyond the capital cities concerned, as well as the capitals themselves. Thus in early 2004 I visited Peshawar as well as Islamabad, Pakistan, and Bangalore as well as New Delhi, India.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.0/2">In respect of my visit to Pakistan in February 2005, the proposal for a visit to Lahore came initially from the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Khurshid Kasuri. Lahore is his home. It is the second largest city in Pakistan, and a major centre for the media and commerce, as well as being the capital of Punjab province. Mr. Kasuri arranged for me to meet a wide cross-section of the business and political leaders of the province. In addition, I gave the keynote speech of my visit to Pakistan there, entitled: 'Pakistan and the United Kingdom: a modern partnership for engagement and understanding'.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.0/3">I also expressed an interest in visiting one of the major centres to which many of the large UK population of people of Pakistani heritage trace their roots. My original idea was to visit Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. However, I decided not to do so for foreign policy reasons. I then sought suggestions from a number of people of Pakistani origin in the UK, in my Blackburn constituency and elsewhere. Two suggestions were made to me&mdash;Jhelum or Gujarat in Punjab province. I decided, following advice from officials, to visit the latter as it was easy to slot into my programme and because it is the home city of the Chief Minister of Punjab province, Pervaiz Ellahi. During my visit to Gujarat I was also able to pursue the Government's consular and immigration objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.0/4">To avoid confusion, I last visited the Indian state of Gujarat (Ahmedabad, the state capital) in September 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".994W.3/1">India's assistance is more immediately critical than the UK's as they provide lethal hardware. The UK's support has been non-lethal and focussed on improving general professionalism and intelligence capabilities. However, given the topography of Nepal and the capabilities of the security forces and the Maoists, it does not appear that either side can win the conflict militarily. A negotiated political settlement involving all the constitutional forces offers the best way to resolve the conflict in Nepal and to create a stable democracy with good governance and respect for human rights. We assess that by taking power the King has undermined democracy, increased the risk of instability and that this is likely to lead to intensified conflict. The UK's military support has been predicated on multi-party democracy and the preservation of democratic freedoms. We are considering with international partners what our longer term policy should be in the new political context.</p>

I discussed OSCE business with the Russian ambassador in January and with Deputy Foreign Minister Chizhov last month. The functioning of the organisation is also the subject of frequent discussion with Russia at senior official-level in London, Brussels and Vienna. In these discussions, we have made clear to Russia the importance the UK attaches to the central role played by the OSCE in European security architecture, not least through its human dimension work. We have also set out that, while the UK is content to see OSCE reform, this must not be at the expense of the organisation's democratic values and core commitments, including in the field of human rights.</p>

	<p pid=".1002W.2/2">The underpinning standards for the Induction Programme for those awarded QTS require teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively, meeting the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement.

	<p pid=".1002W.2/4">The Department also continues to work closely with both the British Dyslexia Association (BDA) and the Dyslexia Institute (DI), and have supported a number of initiatives aimed at raising awareness of dyslexia to help teachers to identify pupils with dyslexia and to take appropriate action at an early stage. For example, we have grant-aided the production and dissemination of 'Achieving Dyslexia Friendly Schools' a school resource pack which promotes a whole-school approach to supporting pupils with dyslexia and provides examples of best practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.2/5">The Department through its National Primary Strategy has produced an extensive range of specific guidance material for schools on evidence-based interventions for children with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties.

This is designed to help school staff increase their awareness and understanding of the barriers to learning presented by dyslexia, and the teaching strategies that can be used to overcome them. This resource is expected to be available to schools from May.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.5/1">We are already doing much to support private and voluntary sector early years' providers in developing the skills of their work force. We are giving &pound;129.9 million to local authorities (LAs) in England over the two years 2004&ndash;06 for developing the early years and child care work force.

We are committed to this radical reform and we will work with leading bodies in the sector to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.5/3">We recognise that quality improvements may have cost implications for all early years' providers, which is why we have created a 'Transformation Fund' of &pound;125 million a year.

	<p pid=".1003W.5/4">In addition, we have developed the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge to support and focus professional development in the children's work force, including those working for private and voluntary sector early years' providers. This sets out the areas of expertise that everyone working with children, young people and families (including those who work as volunteers) should be able to demonstrate. It sets out the skills and knowledge that, if accredited, could form the basis of a minimum competence for working with children, young people and their families.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.2/15"><sup>(22)</sup> The total expenditure on education in schools and LEAs is drawn from the net current expenditure column of the total education spending line. This includes expenditure on schools, education out of schools, continuing education, youth and community and also central LEA management and support. However excluded from the total expenditure is any capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). HE expenditure is not allocated on an LEA basis and instead is largely funded by Government with the money allocated annually, to individual universities through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Similarly, the Department does not collect information on the level of funding per student in FE at a local or regional level and therefore we are unable to identify the per capita cost in respect of HE and FE provision for Wirral and Cheshire LEAs and as such it has been excluded.</p>

The population figures are estimated resident mid year population figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and these have recently been revised following the 2001 Census. Thus for financial year 1997&ndash;98 we have used the population estimate from mid year 1997 and for 2001&ndash;02 we used the mid 2001 estimate (and so on).</p>

As a result, 1997&ndash;98 data is for pre-LGR Cheshire LEA and data for subsequent years is for the part of pre-LGR Cheshire now known as Cheshire LEA and is not therefore comparable with the 1997&ndash;98 figure. This break in the time series is shown by the blank row.</p>

	<p pid=".1009W.5/1">Exclusions are one of a number of indicators we monitor closely as a measure of school behaviour. The other key indicators are Ofsted inspection evidence and the perceptions of people working in schools and of parents. Exclusion is used generally as a last resort after a range of other strategies to tackle poor behaviour have been tried. The number of exclusions may therefore not be a valid measure for levels of low level disruption or minor offences in schools that do not result in exclusion. Also, many schools are now trying, by a variety of means such as learning support units and managed moves, to support disruptive pupils within a school setting, although not necessarily in a classroom, so as to prevent exclusion.</p>

The latest personnel figures, as at March 2005, are 120 employed by the agency, of which again less than five are employed in Scotland. The increase in staff numbers this year resulted from the pre-merger process of the DSA with part of the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) following an &quot;End-to-End Business Process Review of the disposal process within the MOD&quot;. The additional staff will not be funded by the agency until <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, when it transfers ownership to the DLO.</p>

	<p pid=".1031W.6/1">The Government are actively involved in raising awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning by means other than national television campaigns. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) arranged for the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) to run a publicity campaign in February 2005 to raise awareness about CO poisoning targeted at vulnerable groups of the young and the elderly. That campaign reached an estimated 11,000 GP surgeries and 4 million people through radio.</p>
	<p pid=".1031W.6/2">The Department of Health has additionally produced a new leaflet about domestic carbon monoxide poisoning that is endorsed by HSE, industry and the registered charity CO-Gas Safety.</p>

This has included new gas safety legislation, new competence requirements for gas installers and substantial public investment in publicising carbon monoxide (CO) dangers.</p>

	<p pid=".1035W.0/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mrs. Annette Brooke, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-24">24 March 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the plans he has to change training programmes on offer through Jobcentre Plus in Dorset; whether clients due to start in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase> on programmes for self-employment training in Dorset funded by Jobcentre Plus will be able to complete their training, and whether it is his policy that programmes of self employment training supported by Jobcentre Plus are promoted equally in all counties in the South West Region. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/5" class="indent">In answer to your first question, Jobcentre Plus is currently considering its future strategy around contracting for programmes including training and self-employment support. We need to take account of the Department for Work and Pensions' recently published 5 year strategy and an increased priority on helping those who are out of work because of sickness or disability and lone parents.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/6" class="indent">We are currently in the process of extending current contracts where appropriate, with a view to inviting tenders to compete for new contracts from Autumn 2005. We are clear that with fewer people unemployed and a greater emphasis on providing support to disabled people through the New Deal for Disabled People and the Pathways to Work pilots, we need to review our contracts and focus support on those who need the most help.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/7" class="indent">Dorset and Somerset District will communicate any emerging strategy to their local stakeholders and partners as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/8" class="indent">In answer to your second question, we have offered to temporarily extend the Self Employment contract in Dorset in order to ensure that clients currently engaged in training, and those who were due to start this month, can complete their current stage of training. If providers chose not to extend their contracts then this will affect clients and we will try to find alternative solutions to enable these clients to complete their training.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/9" class="indent">Finally moving to your third question, decisions to extend contracts are made at local level, taking into account local labour market needs and provider performance against agreed outcome targets, to ensure that sufficient capacity is maintained to deliver both policy intent and meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/10" class="indent">A more detailed future strategy for Self Employment training will become clearer once the national contracting strategy is available.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/11" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".1040W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Stourbridge will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 21 per cent. of adults and 6 per cent. of children in West Midlands region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>

	<p pid=".1040W.2/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Stourbridge, the proportion in employment has risen to 76.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.25 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 1,680 in Stourbridge alone.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit uprating. All of this has benefited 1,400 families in Stourbridge.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billon more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/24">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 4,290 pensioners in Stourbridge are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;39.26 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70 plus payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80 plus annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1040W.2/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 16,300 pensioners in Stourbridge have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".1046W.6/1">We do not consider that research into the effects of late payments is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.6/2">The Department acknowledges that late payments may have an impact on charities and voluntary organisations. We support and have taken on board the good practice guidance on procurement of services from the voluntary and community sector published by the Home Office and the Compact Code of Practice on Funding, both of which emphasise the importance of prompt payment within payment procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.6/3">The Section 64 General Scheme of Grants represents the greatest single source of grant funding from the Department to the voluntary sector. The Department may also contract with voluntary organisations for a specific service outside the Section 64 scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.6/4">The majority of Section 64 grants are paid in quarterly instalments starting when the organisation has formally accepted the grant conditions and the project has started. Payments in subsequent years are made following receipt of financial and monitoring information as specified in the conditions. Payment schedules are notified to the organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.6/5">The Department's general payment policy is that, where there is no contractual provision or other understanding or accepted practice governing the time of payment, the Department should pay within 30 days of receipt of goods and services, or of the presentation of a valid invoice or similar demand for payment, whichever is the later. Our records show that over 90 per cent. of invoices in the current financial year have been paid in accordance with this policy.</p>

Their delay has been due to a number of reasons such as staff sickness, problems with locating notes from the independent sector and new information being made available.

	<p pid=".1064W.5/2">The Payment by results market forces factor (MFF) used in 2004&ndash;05 was updated for 2005&ndash;06 to take account of the most recently available data on earnings, expenditure, land values and building costs. Following advice to Ministers from the independent Advisory Committee on resource allocation, we also made a change to the methodology to make it more sensitive to cost pressures within individual primary care trust areas, rather than the larger areas previously used. Full details are available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/02/99/04100299.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/02/99/04100299.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1064W.5/3">In 2004&ndash;05, the MFF was a determinant of the prices paid by primary care trusts (PCTs) to national health service trusts for only 48 groups of procedures (known as healthcare resource groups). In 2005&ndash;06, the scope of payment by results will be increasing to cover the whole of elective in-patient care for NHS trusts. PCTs will pay the same national tariff to any trust with which they commission, and an allocation for the MFF for elective care will be made to providers directly from the centre. 2005&ndash;06 will be the first year in which such allocations will be made.</p>
	<p pid=".1064W.5/4">The Department provided details of the 2005&ndash;06 MFF allocations to the NHS on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase>. There are three reasons why Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre hospital NHS trust (Blackpool) would have a different MFF allocation to Lancashire teaching hospitals NHS trust (Preston): differences in their volume of elective activity (more activity requires more funding); differences in the case mix of that activity (more complex activity requires more funding), and differences in the MFF itself (trusts located in more expensive areas require more funding). The 2005&ndash;06 MFF for Lancashire teaching is 1.1 per cent., higher than for Blackpool largely because the MFF allows for higher general wage pressures in Preston.</p>

In addition to this, approximately &pound;200 million of mainstream local expenditure is spent on drug treatment.

	<p pid=".1066W.5/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, responsibility for funding the bursaries for nurses returning to work in the national health service has been devolved to primary care trusts. (PCTs). This gives PCTs the flexibility to determine the appropriate investment for return to practice, working in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders. Furthermore, we are allocating historic levels of funding to PCTs to ensure the NHS secures the workforce necessary to deliver improved services. For the three-year revenue allocations to cover 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, PCTs received an average cash increase of 9.22 per cent., 9.55 per cent. and 9.32 per cent. This is an average over the three years of 30.83 per cent. For the recent round of allocations to cover 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, PCTs received average cash increases of 9.2 per cent. and 9.4 per cent. This is an average over the two years of 19.5 per cent.</p>

In 2002, there were 52 main renal units, and the number of satellite units had risen to 101. This does not reflect the full increase in capacity, as additional facilities were also put into existing units; the total number of haemodialysis stations in England rose from 1,890 in 1998 to 2,582 in 2002.

	<p pid=".1074W.9/2">Based on the work of its expert working group on the safety of SSRIs, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) issued advice on the use of SSRIs in the paediatric population in June, September and December 2003. That advice was that the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of depressive illness in under 18s is judged to be unfavourable for paroxetine (Seroxat), venlafaxine (Efexor), sertraline (Lustral), citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex) and mirtazapine (Zispin). It is not possible to assess the balance of risks and benefits for fluvoxamine (Faverin,) due to the absence of paediatric clinical trial data. Only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating depressive illness in children and adolescents, although it is possible that, in common with the other SSRIs, it is associated with a small increased risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Overall, the balance of risks and benefits for fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive illness in under 18s is judged to be favourable.</p>
