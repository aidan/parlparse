For the purpose of providing this answer they have been interpreted as any DfT or any agency corporate branded stationery such as letterhead, compliment slips or pens, or any piece of corporate merchandise that is corporate branded (e.g. slap wraps, pens, lanyards etc). Costs have also been limited to the production of materials and do not include storage or distribution costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.14/21">The Department also produces a range of materials under non-corporate brands in support of its objectives, such as the THINK! road safety brand, Act on CO2 brand and Transport Direct. These have not been included as the costs for materials using these brands are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.894W.5/1">The Department for Transport does not routinely collect or require data to be submitted on the use of speed cameras, although the Department's guidance does recommend that speed and collision data are collected by partnerships. However, the Department has an interest in the effectiveness of all road safety interventions and so from time to time requests evaluation work from delivery partners. For example, as part of two wider rural demonstration projects supported financially by the Department, Norfolk and Lincolnshire county councils are proposing to install permanent average speed enforcement cameras during the next year. Because these are demonstration projects the Department will receive information about the impact of these cameras alongside the other road safety measures being implemented locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.2/2">Meanwhile, DEFRA continues to work with other European member states for strict control measures to contain the threat of other BTV serotypes in Europe, and will continue to conduct double post-import tests on all imported animals for all Bluetongue serotypes.

Once we have considered the responses to the consultation, we will then ask Parliament to approve a revised code.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.2/1">We have been closely monitoring the statements of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE) on the new variant Influenza A/H1N1. Contacts with the OIE are normally made though the offices of the European Commission. We have maintained close contact with the European Commission and other member states on this subject since the situation began.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/2">To date the information available from all sources indicates that infection with the new variant Influenza A/H1N1has occurred primarily in humans. The Canadian authorities reported on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-02">2 May 2009</phrase> that this infection was also identified in a herd of pigs in Alberta, Canada. This single report from Canada indicates that this strain readily infects pigs and is of low pathogenicity to pigs. It is not possible to be certain that this virus will infect and affect other pigs in the same way, nor any other animal or bird species. To date there are no other reports of infection in pigs (or other animals). We understand that a joint OIE/FAO mission has taken place in Mexico where areas of further co-operation with Mexican authorities has been discussed. We would expect to see a report of this mission in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/3">Apart from this information from Canada, the possible effect of this strain of H1N1 influenza on the animal kingdom is unknown.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/4">The OIE is collaborating with the EU, WHO, UN FAO and a network of reference laboratories and collaborating centres (including Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge) in scientific investigations on the current situation and whether this strain of H1N1 is capable of infecting other animal and bird species.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/5">The issues of novel influenza A/H1N1 virus will also be on the agenda at the EU member states Chief Veterinary Officer's Council meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-12">12 May</phrase>, 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.0/1">We have not found the new variant Influenza A/H1N1 in pigs in the UK and continue to maintain our surveillance. The Food Standards Agency's advice is that the novel influenza A H1N1 virus does not pose a food safety risk to consumers. It has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating pork and pork products.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/2">Our advice to pig keepers is that they should stay out of contact with pigs if they have influenza signs. We also continue to advise pig keepers to ensure they have good biosecurity procedures in place, something which is important at all times. Our information to pig keepers also includes details of the surveillance programme for swine influenza which DEFRA has been funding since 1991.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/3">European Community rules only permit imports of live swine from approved third countries and pig meat products from approved plants in those countries that have agreed animal and public health certification in place. Countries such as Mexico, which are not able to meet the certification requirements, are not permitted to export live swine and pig meat products to the European community.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/4">All animals and meat, which can only be imported to the European Community from approved third countries, must be accompanied by veterinary certification which must confirm, among other things, that live animals have been examined by an official veterinarian within 24 hours of loading and showed no clinical signs of disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/5">Meat must have been derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.0/6">Animals and meat imported into the European Community from approved third countries must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections.</p>

	<p pid="b.906W.6/1">To ensure that all remote gambling operators take steps to prevent under 18s from gambling via the internet, the Gambling Commission undertakes a rolling programme of mystery shopping exercises. While their initial focus was on UK-licensed operators, the Commission has recently extended these exercises to look at a number of websites licensed overseas but accessible to UK residents, including those in EEA states and Gibraltar as well as those on the 'whitelist'. Further details of those exercises will be published as soon as practicable, and in the Commission's annual report.</p>

It is currently planned around 630 people and 8 sites will be transferred to Jobcentre Plus by the end of June 2009.

	<p pid="b.911W.9/1">Even in the current economic climate, we would expect most customers to move into work relatively quickly without the need to re-train in new skills. Our policies will continue to help them to do that to avoid the costs, both to individuals and to government, of delaying a return to work and keeping people on benefits for longer than necessary. There is therefore no current basis on which to make estimates of the costs of extending the training opportunities described to customers from the start of a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.9/2">Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) recipients can train for up to 16 hours per week alongside active job search.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.9/3">They may also undertake up to two weeks of full-time training in any 12-month period, without jeopardising their benefit entitlements. Additionally, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> anyone who has been unemployed more than six months can study full time for up to eight weeks on a job related training course approved by an employment adviser (operationally we do this by transferring the customer to a training allowance).</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.9/4">People from disadvantaged groups, or those for whom lack of basic skills is a barrier to employment, are eligible for training support from day one of unemployment. Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers are also able to agree early access to the job-search and training support offered by the New Deal for people whose circumstances may make it particularly hard to find work.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.9/5">In addition, the Government announced last autumn that additional funding of &pound;158 million has been made available through the European Social Fund for the Learning and Skills Council's Train to Gain programme for people who are newly unemployed or facing redundancy to undertake training linked to opportunities in the local labour market for up to two weeks full time and up to eight weeks part time.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.5/2">Between 1997-98 and 2008-09 pensioners benefited from above-inflation increases in the basic state pension, with pensioners better off by 7 per cent. in real terms than if the basic state pension had been increased only by prices over the same period. From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, the basic state pension increased by 5 per cent.&mdash;this is the highest percentage increase since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase> the pension credit standard minimum guarantee increased to &pound;130 a week for single customers and &pound;198.45 a week for couples&mdash;this above-earnings increase was the highest since pension credit was introduced in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/4">In 2007-08, winter fuel payments were paid to over 12 million people and have helped over 8.8 million households. Winter fuel payments are worth &pound;200 for those aged between 60 and 79 and &pound;300 for those aged 80 and over. For winter 2008-09, the Chancellor announced an additional payment of &pound;50 for those aged between 60 and 79 and &pound;100 for those aged 80 and over resulting in payments per household of &pound;250 and &pound;400 respectively. This increase will be repeated for winter 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/5">The Government have also announced that the capital threshold for pension credit (and housing benefit and council tax benefit for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) will be increased from &pound;6,000 to &pound;10,000, bringing it into line with the threshold for those living permanently in care homes. This change will take effect from November 2009 and will allow these customers to retain up to &pound;10,000 of capital before it affects their benefit. This change represents a generous increase in the capital thresholds for pension credit recipients and a significant simplification to the benefit. Half a million pensioners stand to gain from this change, with an average weekly gain across all benefits of &pound;4.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/6">The Government have also committed to maintain the standard interest rate applied in the support for mortgage interest scheme at 6.08 per cent. for a further six months until the end of December 2009; this will help those on pension credit who receive help with their mortgage.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/7">The higher amounts of income tax personal allowances for those aged over 65 are substantially higher than the personal allowance for those aged under 65. For the tax year starting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, the personal allowance for people aged 65 to 74 has been increased to &pound;9,490 and the personal allowance for people aged 75 and over has been increased to &pound;9,640. For the tax year starting on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April 2011</phrase>, pensioners aged 75 and over will not pay tax on incomes under &pound;10,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/8">Council tax benefit makes an important contribution to the financial security of around 2.6 million pensioner households. The Government have already simplified the claims process to make income-related benefits easier to claim. Since November 2008, pensioners can claim housing benefit and council tax benefit with pension credit, entirely over the phone without having to fill in and sign a claim form.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/9">In addition, we are writing to over 200,000 pension credit recipients in May to encourage them to contact their local council to check if they are entitled to council tax benefit or housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.5/10">Last winter the Government also increased the Christmas bonus to &pound;70 for all those who meet the eligibility criteria with &pound;10 being paid before Christmas and the remainder in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.5/1">Individuals who apply for employment and support allowance will be asked to undertake a work capability assessment which will be used in determining their eligibility for the benefit. This differs from those currently claiming incapacity benefits, who will have undertaken a personal capability assessment. The work capability assessment follows a similar format to the personal capability assessment, as a points based assessment, but has been developed to provide a more accurate assessment of an individual's limited capability for work in the modern workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.5/2">The new assessment is more positive than its predecessor, focusing on what an individual can do as well as what they cannot. It includes a work focused health related assessment which helps individual's identify and consider ways to overcome their specific challenges to work. The mental function aspect of the assessment has also been expanded and developed to take better account of cognitive and intellectual function.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.5/3">We have announced that we plan to migrate existing recipients of incapacity benefits to employment and support allowance. Recipients will have to undertake this same work capability assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.917W.6/1">The improved procurement project is generating value for money savings from reductions in the costs of goods and services purchased by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) during the Comprehensive Spending Review period. The savings are achieved through better management of our expenditure by utilising the following techniques:</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.6/2" class="indent">Collaboration with other Government Departments (OGDs) and the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) Buying Solutions</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.6/3" class="indent">Mandatory use of corporate FCO contracts to achieve better value for money</p>

	<p pid="b.917W.6/5" class="indent">Better market analysis and a more strategic approach to procurement overseas</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.6/6">Benefits will be realised in the main through utilising OGD and OGC contracts and re-tendering processes for major contracts and commodities which assess value for money and efficiency as part of the process. This is based on a number of factors including unit prices and balancing quality measures to ensure that service levels are maintained or improved. In addition costs savings will be realised through improvements in the on-going contract management.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.5/5">Spouse Compensation is paid to Diplomatic Service staff, whose spouse/registered partner has spent at least three years accompanying them overseas. It is to compensate the spouse/partner who, if they had not been following and supporting their partner overseas, would have been working and contributing towards a state and/or private pension in the UK.</p>

Battlemind is a military skills training programme, developed in the US by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, to prepare service personnel for the demands and challenges of operational deployment, and to enable them to adjust successfully to the peacetime environment when they return home. A version of the programme, modified for the UK, is currently being trialled by the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health, King's College London (ACDMH).

	<p pid="b.941W.3/1">Research undertaken at the King's Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) has produced evidence which strongly suggests that such processes are ineffective and may indeed be counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="b.941W.3/2">Recent research is summarised in the KCMHR &quot;Ten Year Report&quot; published in 2006 by the University of London and covering a decade's worth of research concerning the health of UK service personnel and veterans. This explains that selecting out individuals who might be at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties prior to deployment is a flawed strategy because, whether one uses clinical interviews or questionnaire-based methods, it is impossible to distinguish reliably between those who will go on to experience psychological difficulties and those who will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.941W.3/3">Furthermore there is evidence of a detrimental effect on those screened out, even though they may, in reality, be suitable for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.941W.3/4">Similarly, although mental health screening after deployment is practiced by other countries, the Department is not aware of any evidence which demonstrates that formal mental health interviews or the use of questionnaires on return from deployment are able to distinguish effectively between those who might benefit from further intervention and those who might not. The MOD does, however, strongly support the notion that the psychological welfare of troops is primarily a chain of command responsibility. We place great emphasis on ensuring that those in positions of command remain vigilant for signs of any mental health difficulties and support these aims through our post-operational stress management protocols which include, but are not limited to, the use of decompression and of Trauma Risk Management (TRiM).</p>
	<p pid="b.941W.3/5">The MOD also funds six mental health pilot projects for veterans, has dedicated psychiatric nurses in Afghanistan and funds the Medical Assessment Programme at St Thomas Hospital.</p>

The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures.</p>

A lot of work has been put into reducing the number of such deaths in general, as well as specifically, in early custody. The following table details the number of self-inflicted deaths that occurred within seven days of commencing custody. Some prisons hold both adults and young offenders; therefore the figures are broken down by the age profile of the prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.966W.14/11">The Prison Service definition of self-inflicted deaths is broader than the legal definition of suicide and includes all deaths where it appears that a prisoner has acted specifically to take their own life. This inclusive approach is used in part because inquest verdicts are often not available for some years after a death (some 20 per cent. of these deaths will not receive a suicide or open verdict at inquest). Annual numbers may change slightly from time to time as inquest verdicts and other information becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="b.974W.5/1">I visited eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from 26 to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-29">29 April 2009</phrase> and was made acutely aware of the alarming humanitarian situation. The Lords Resistance Army (LRA), FDLR (ex-FAR Interhamwe) and other rebel groups, continue to prey on the civilian population, provoking displacement and untold suffering. The United Nations (UN) estimates some 1.7 million are displaced with over 300,000 newly displaced in 2009. The humanitarian community is currently bracing itself for the humanitarian consequences of the joint FARDC and MONUC military operation against the FDLR (Operation Kimia II) in South Kivu and has, as a result, developed contingency plans. In meetings with MONUC, I pressed upon MONUC the importance of ensuring adequate steps are taken to mitigate the impact of military operations on civilians and to work closely with the humanitarian community.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.5/2">The well-established humanitarian response to the ongoing crisis in eastern DRC is able to cope with current levels of displacement and existing need. DFID established Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) in 2005, run by UNICEF with NGO partners, to provide water and sanitation, shelter, non-food items and education for conflict affected populations. Other DFID partners, including Oxfam, IRC, MERLIN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provide food, nutrition and health assistance. However, DFID is constantly assessing the situation and is ready to provide additional support if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.5/1">Our assessment of the effects on private sector investment following the pause in the negotiations on the St. Helena airport is that it is likely to be reduced in this financial year. This is because many current plans for investment by local businesses, which are modest in scale, have been put on hold pending a final decision following the consultation that is under way. In regard to foreign investment, the St. Helena Development Agency (SHDA) has received interest from five investors in a range of development projects, which are now on hold. The largest potential investor in the hotel resort sector has confirmed commitment to St. Helena while the prospect of air access remains.</p>

	<p pid="b.981W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned and evaluated the effects of the use of polypills. However, there are at least three phase I or II studies under way:</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/2" class="indent">At Imperial, Neil Poulter and Simone Thorn are already involved in a primary prevention trial of a Polypill (simvastatin 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 75mg) cost ~ 1 dollar/month. The collaboration is being led by Anthony Rodgers in Auckland and includes centres in Brazil, United States of America, the Netherlands, India, Australia, United Kingdom (our centre here at St. Mary's-Imperial) and New Zealand. The pill has been made by Dr. Reddy's which is a big generic pharmaceutical company in India. The project is supported by the Wellcome Trust, the New Zealand medical research council and by other local organisations in the participating countries (for us&mdash;the British Heart Foundation). The pilot phase has started-the first patient was evaluated here in London last week&mdash;this is a 12-week pilot to test tolerability, safety and efficacy. Towards the end of next year they hope to proceed to the main morbidity and mortality trial that will include five-7,000 patients over three-five years. The project is quite well summarised in a recent <i> Guardian</i> article:</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/sep/29/health">www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/sep/29/health</a>.medicalresearch</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/4" class="indent">Dr. Rodgers has been working with Dr. Reddy since about 2000 and the technical problems of Galenic formulation for a four component cardiovascular Polypill (the Red Heart Pill) have been solved. This Polypill has been approved by several regulatory authorities (including the UK and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency)&mdash;hence the primary prevention trial described above.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/5" class="indent">The University of Birmingham and Tehran University of Medical Sciences have completed a randomised controlled trial of a four component polypill in approximately 500 men aged 50 to 79 and women aged 55 to 79. This is a pilot study, with the aim of starting a fully powered clinical trial if this is successful. The Polypill consists of aspirin, a statin, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and a thiazide diuretic. The aim is essentially to look at compliance and determine the effects of treatment on blood pressure and lipid concentrations. Recruitment began in 2006 in Golestan (northeast Iran), and follow-up was completed earlier this year. They proposed to submit for publication soon. This is led by Tom Marshall, senior lecturer in public health University of Birmingham, on behalf of Fatemeh Malekzadeh Akram Pourshams, Mina Gharravi, Afshin Aslani, Alireza Nateghi, Mansoor Rastegarpanah, Masoud Khoshnia, G. Neil Thomas, Bagher Larijani, Reza Malekzadeh, K. K. Cheng.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/6" class="indent">Trial in Madrid, Spain&mdash;Secondary Prevention study&mdash;a three-component polypill, which comprises aspirin, a statin and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (which helps lower blood pressure), for secondary prevention in patients who have already suffered an acute myocardial infarction. The project is a private-public venture with Ferrer-Internacional, which is a Spanish pharmaceutical company based in Barcelona with experience in the development and launching of international projects. The new formulation will be available in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/7">The Department has met the original Polypill authors on a number of occasions. The initial conclusions were that this type of approach would be more suitable in developing countries rather than in more sophisticated healthcare systems such as ours where tailored therapy is more the norm.</p>
	<p pid="b.981W.2/8">The Department is currently exploring how to reassess this issue in the light of fresh interest in the topic.</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.5/1">Health care organisations should investigate all concerns about the quality of care given by a health care professional working for them, whether in a locum or substantive capacity. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-26">26 February 2009</phrase>, the Department published &quot;Listening, responding, improving: a guide to better customer care&quot;, aimed at health and social care staff involved in receiving feedback and resolving concerns and complaints. This is generic guidance to help local complaints managers to work with colleagues to make their organisations better at listening, responding and learning from people's experiences of care. Additionally, each national health service health care provider must make information available to the public regarding arrangements for dealing with complaints. The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency is responsible for providing advice to agencies on complaints procedures and for monitoring complaints about agency workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.5/2">The Department's advice to employers &quot;Handling Concerns about the Performance of Healthcare Professionals: Principles of Good Practice&quot; was published in September 2006. This document sets out the principles for effective systems for handling performance concerns and outlines good practice for managing concerns about individuals. &quot;High professional standards in the modern NHS&quot;; a framework for the initial handling of concerns about doctors and dentists in the NHS, was issued in 2005 and applies to the NHS in England. It sets out the procedures to be followed when the quality of services provided are called into question. Similar guidance is also issued by individual regulatory bodies, which can be accessed from their websites. Copies of the publications referred to in the reply have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.5/3">Under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, it is the duty of each NHS body to put and keep in place arrangements for the purpose of monitoring and improving the quality of health care provided by and for that body. The Government have taken additional powers through the Health and Social Care Act 2008 which will enable the introduction of new regulations intended to strengthening local clinical governance arrangements. This includes the introduction of responsible officers, who will have statutory responsibility for ensuring that there are robust systems in place to monitor the conduct and performance of all doctors, including those working as locums. Health care organisations and designated bodies will also be subject to a new duty of co-operation, which will ensure that concerns about health care workers are shared and acted upon, to protect patients and ensure quality of care. The new regulations will be accompanied with guidance for employers and patients. A public consultation on the regulations will be undertaken later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.985W.5/2">Revalidation is being built on the White Paper principles of public protection, patient safety and quality of care, with the recognition that revalidation is as much about sustaining, improving and assuring the professional standards of the overwhelming majority of health professionals as it is about identifying and addressing poor practice or bad behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.3/1">In September 2008 the independent regulator, the Healthcare Commission, published its review of Urgent and Emergency Care which rated the Peterborough primary care trust (PCT) area as 3 or &quot;better performing&quot; and the Cambridgeshire PCT area as 4 or &quot;best performing&quot;, of which performance on out-of-hours services contributed around 25 per cent. to this score.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.3/2">More widely, the review found that the national health service has made significant progress on performance against the out-of-hours National Quality Requirements for the delivery of out-of-hours services compared to a similar survey carried out by the National Audit Office in 2005. In addition, the overall results of the review were positive, with 60 per cent. of PCTs scored as &quot;better&quot; or &quot;best performing&quot; and 82 per cent. rated as at least &quot;fair performing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.3/3">PCTs have a responsibility to ensure they provide, or secure provision of a high quality, sustainable service for their local population. Where a provider is failing to meet the National Quality Requirements, PCTs, as commissioners of the service, and strategic health authorities must act to support out-of-hours providers to improve their performance. It is vital that if the local NHS has concerns about the quality of out-of-hours provision in its area, it takes urgent and robust action to improve services.</p>

However, housing receipts arising from sales that are neither right to buy nor to any owner-occupier can be retained by local authorities provided they are used for affordable housing or regeneration projects. Furthermore, we have consulted on provisions which will effectively allow authorities to retain all RTB receipts, provided they are used for the same purposes, if they arise from newly-built or newly-acquired dwellings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1012W.8/1">Information on the number or proportion of computers infected with malware is not collected centrally from either local authority children's services or from schools. However many schools do employ a managed service for their ICT support and those organisations will normally maintain this information and report to schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1012W.8/2">The Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS) computer network is supported by an outsourced IT service provider who do not routinely capture this information. However, the CAFCASS network and equipment is protected by anti-virus software and firewalls that prevent unauthorised access, so the potential for a malware infection is low. CAFCASS have no record of any infection by malware in 2008.</p>

Youth offending teams will have also considered other factors, such as local levels of school attendance or unemployment. The Welsh Assembly Government selected the areas in Wales. Since 2005, youth offending teams have determined the areas themselves using the Youth Justice Board's guidance which advises them to consider a range of crime, economic and population data. Youth offending teams have the flexibility to change the areas over time in order to reflect changing local circumstances.</p>
