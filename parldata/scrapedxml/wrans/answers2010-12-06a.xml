	<p pid="a.13W.2/1">We have assessed deep geothermal energy alongside other innovative renewable technologies. A particular barrier is the sector's ability to secure upfront capital support, which we have addressed through the two rounds of the Deep Geothermal Challenge Fund. The first round awarded &#163;4 million in capital grants to three projects in financial year 2009-10, while the second round is currently under way with several bids under consideration. Another potential barrier is establishing investor confidence in ongoing returns at a commercial rate. This is provided by deep geothermal power's eligibility for 2 ROCs under the Renewables Obligation, as for other innovative renewable power technologies. Deep geothermal energy has also been considered during the development of the Renewable Heat Incentive. In addition, some in the industry have commented that the lack of a licensing regime creates a barrier to the sector's development.

	<p pid="a.14W.3/2">The security of supply of gas is a top Government priority in the UK. Gas is fungible and DECC does not distinguish between types of gas consumed in the UK but instead aims to create an environment where there are incentives for investing in all viable forms of gas production. The energy security and green economy bill contains measures to strengthen the market incentive mechanism for ensuring sufficient gas is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.3/3">The UK is already benefiting from the technological breakthroughs in unconventional gas production methods. Recent increases in shale gas production in the United States has reduced the US's demand for imports of LNG, freeing up this LNG to be imported by other countries such as the UK and helping to put downward pressure on wholesale gas prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.3/4">Further increases in the global production of shale gas are expected. This may help the UK to meet its demand for gas either directly (i.e. by being consumed in the UK) or indirectly (i.e. by freeing up other gas resources for consumption by the UK).</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.3/5">The British Geological Survey estimates that there could be worthwhile shale gas resources in the UK. However it is not possible to make an estimate of reserves without drilling and production testing, and it is not yet clear that the success elsewhere can be replicated in the UK.</p>

Nevertheless the Government are keen to promote both green jobs and energy from waste and is therefore considering the issue very carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.25W.8/1">Climate change is a key priority for this Government, and as with all sectors of the economy, the agriculture sector will need to play its role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the changing climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.8/2">In England, the farming industry has taken responsibility for reducing emissions from agriculture through the development of a Greenhouse Gas Action Plan, for which a Framework for Action was published in February. This approach was supported by the previous administration and this Government continue to encourage the industry to work in partnership to achieve significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We look forward to the publication of a delivery plan in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.8/3">The Government have made a significant investment of &#163;12.6 million over four and half years, in partnership with the devolved Administrations, in a series of projects that aim to strengthen our collective understanding of on-farm emissions, allowing for better targeting of actions and capturing improvements made in livestock and crop management practices. We will also ensure Carbon Trust interest-free loans are available to farm businesses to invest in energy-saving equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.8/4">Farmers and land managers are also vulnerable to the effects of climate change and will need to take action to adapt sustainably. The Government are looking at enhancing existing advice and guidance arrangements to support voluntary adaptation action. DEFRA also undertakes research on the impact on climate change in the farming sector; future funding will depend on the specific projects undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.8/5">We will support the sector through the development of training packages to deliver integrated advice, which will cover both mitigation and adaptation objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.25W.8/6">Funding is currently available for farmers under Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) to address challenges including climate change. For example, Environmental Stewardship provides farmers with a range of management options that are able to deliver multiple objectives, including climate change mitigation and adaption benefits. Climate change was embedded as an over-arching theme into Environmental Stewardship following the 2008 Review of Progress. An evaluation of the RDPE is currently under way and we look forward to its findings on the effectiveness of the programme which will be available early in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.2/2">All flood defence projects already under construction will be completed. It is too early to identify individual new flood defence projects that will be funded during the coming spending period. This is partly because annual budgets are still being finalised. It is also because the way in which Government funding is allocated to projects, and who decides which projects go ahead, may be changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/3">DEFRA launched a public consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November</phrase> seeking views on how capital funding should be allocated to individual projects in the future. Subject to final decisions in the spring, the new approach could apply to all projects seeking funds to begin construction from April 2012 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/4">The proposed approach would mark a departure from the existing system in that the Environment Agency would no longer decide the list of projects that go ahead, and which others need to be deferred as a result of annual limits in Government funding. Instead such decisions in most cases would be devolved to local authorities acting collectively as part of Regional Flood Defence Committees (to become Regional Flood and Coastal Committees under the Flood and Water Management Act). The approach also rewards public bodies and communities if they find ways of keeping project costs down, as well as if they can find additional local funding to come forward. In doing so, each community at risk could have a bigger say in which projects go ahead over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/5">Whichever means of capital allocation is adopted, DEFRA expects that improved standards of protection will be delivered to 145,000 households by March 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.28W.16/1">The Commissioners have received no direct representations, however, the Church of England has a presence in almost every rural settlement and village in England and plays an important and intricate role in rural community life. The Church of England manages 9,639 buildings in rural areas which are often the only space left open for the use of the community. Clergy undertaking rural ministry are receive support from the Diocese Rural Officer and specific training for rural ministry is available through our partners at the Arthur Rank Centre and the Churches Rural Resources Centre in Warwickshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.16/2">In rural areas parishes are often grouped together into multi-parish benefices or team ministries which can range in number from two to five parishes to 17 to 24 in which usually an ordained minister is assisted by voluntary workers to ensure that within each parish worship and pastoral care is provided appropriately. The committed ministry of volunteers, particularly from within local congregations is essential to sustaining and extending the work of the church in rural parishes. Recently we have focused on developing the skills and gifts of rural congregation members which has allowed rural churches to explore new ways of ensuring regular worship and a high standard of pastoral care and outreach in rural communities. Stress in clergy particularly those with charge of several parishes is of great concern to the church. Clergy are encouraged to take appropriate time off and to use the services of spiritual directors. Continued training is provided throughout ministry to enable new challenges to be addressed, and specialised training is available for those in working in multi-church situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.16/3">The Church of England is undertaking to make its buildings available for wider extended community use, examples of projects which are currently, including as post offices, shops, libraries, internet cafes, benefit advice centres and citizens advice centres. Wherever possible, we want to see churches as living buildings where as much community activity as possible takes place, and the Church Commissioners will always support such activity. At the recent 'Faith in the Future of the Countryside' conference members of the Church of England discussed the Government's latest plans for the 'Big Society', development and housing in the countryside and the future of the government forests with several of our ecumenical partners. The conference urged the Church to engage with sustainable communities in its work on the 'Big Society' ensuring the safeguarding of ecological, cultural, economic and spiritual benefits which are already evident in the work of the Church in local communities.</p>

For example, DFID assistance to the Tanzania Revenue Authority helped increase the tax take from 12% of GDP in 2006 to 14.5% by 2007-08.

For example, care home premises may not necessarily be suitable for the keeping of pets, or certain kinds of pet. The wishes of all residents must be taken into account; some may not wish to share their environment with animals. Residents who are frail or in poor health may not be able to care for their pets properly, however much they might wish to.</p>
	<p pid="a.51W.5/4">The Government consider that the only practically workable approach is to allow care providers the freedom to decide, in the light of individual local circumstances, whether or not to permit residents to keep pets.</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.2/2">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/4">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected. Information on acceptances and number of households in temporary accommodation at local authority level is available from 1997-98 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/5">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/6">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.55W.2/7">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the DCLG website:</p>

Trials of suitable prebiotics or other adjuncts to treatment may be considered in addition to the implementation of best practice guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of clostridium difficile infection. This guidance stresses the role of isolation of cases, hand washing with soap and water, and the use of appropriated antibiotics for treatment, together with sound antibiotic stewardship policies.

	<p pid="a.80W.0/1">The Department is fully committed to the coalition's pledge to promote small business procurement, as set out in section 2, page 10 of the document 'The Coalition: our programme for government'.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/2">In the financial year 2009-10, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) accounted for more than 25% of the total of suppliers to the Department and it is anticipated that a similar level of business will be awarded by the Department to SME's in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/3">In addition, to further encourage and support SMEs and third sector organisations to compete for contracts, the Department complies with the requirements of the coalition's transparency agenda by publishing online all new information and communications technology contracts and tender documents over &#163;10,000. From January 2011, all new contracts will be published online. It is also the Department's intention to utilise an online 'contracts finder' application, which will give users greater visibility on procurement opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.2/1">In 1983, scientists from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, now part of the Health Protection Agency) and from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (now Cancer Research UK) were commissioned by the Ministry of Defence to carry out an independent epidemiological study of participants in the United Kingdom atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, both in the Pacific and in Australia:</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.2/3">The success of the study depends on accurate and unbiased cause of death and cancer incidence data. This is sourced, through the National Health Service Central Registers (NHSCRs), from national registries such as cancer registries and mortality registers. The NHSCR records are flagged but medical records are neither flagged nor accessed for the study. Every individual study member was submitted for flagging with the NHSCRs.</p>

According to this regulation, novel foods may not be marketed in the European Union without an authorisation. Applications for authorisation of novel foods are evaluated by national authorities against criteria of safety, nutritional quality and not misleading the consumer. The Food Standards Agency is the competent authority for novel foods in the United Kingdom and expert advice on applications is provided by the independent Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes. This advice would form the basis of the Agency's risk assessment which would be subject to review by all 26 other EU member states before an authorisation is issued. To date, the Agency has not received any applications for the authorisation of food produced from cloned animals.</p>

Support for employers to offer more Apprenticeships will be a key part of that response. The Apprenticeships Programme is demand led, so the Government do not set targets for Apprenticeships by sector or level. But the Government have announced that they will increase annual funding for Apprenticeships by up to &#163;250 million a year, so that by 2014-15 up to 75,000 more places will be available than under the previous administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.3/1">Well-informed, empowered consumers are central to our vision for how a credit market between customers and lenders should work. I want to encourage both to take responsible decisions and to strengthen protection where necessary, particularly for the most vulnerable. Earlier this year I announced a joint BIS and HM Treasury review of consumer credit and personal insolvency that will look at all aspects of the consumer credit lifecycle from the decision to take out a loan through the lifetime of the loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.3/2">The review will also provide a framework for us to consider how best to take forward the recommendations from the recent OFT review of the high cost credit market. Among those being considered are that the Government should work with lenders to provide information on high-cost credit loans through price comparison websites, and that the Government work with credit reference agencies to explore ways in which high cost credit lenders could provide information to credit reference agencies on the payment performance of their customers, allowing those with good payment records to use mainstream lenders more easily in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.3/3">Government are also firmly supportive of a stronger link up between the Post Office and credit unions and we are actively looking into ways the two can work more closely together. For example, Post Office Ltd plans to share guidance with sub-postmasters shortly to demonstrate how they can work with local credit unions.</p>

	<p pid="a.114W.2/1">Reducing tax loss, whether it stems from avoidance or evasion, is a key priority for this Government and we have recently announced that &#163;900 million will be made available over the spending review period, to enable HMRC to step-up its activity in tackling tax loss to bring in &#163;7 billion additional benefits per annum by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.114W.2/2">HM Revenue and Customs deployed approximately 31,000 staff across all grades at <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> on a variety of compliance activities including risk assessment, addressing inaccurate returns and verifying repayment claims, debt collection and criminal investigations across all heads of duty. We estimate that at <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> there will be approximately 29,000 compliance staff. HMRC are expected to find resource savings of 15% through the better use of new technology, greater efficiency and better IT contracts. HMRC are not able to provide estimates for 2012 yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.114W.2/3">HMRC are currently working on business plans which will be published in spring 2011. These will include for example a new team to crack down on offshore tax evasion and additional criminal investigations to increase the number of criminal prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.114W.2/4">The additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) resulting from all HMRC compliance work in 2008-09 was &#163;12 billion. Data for 2009-10 is not yet available. HMRC do not have a breakdown of how much they hope to recover from compliance activity in 2011-12 or 2012-13. The Government's investment of &#163;900 million should raise additional benefits of around &#163;7 billion by 2014-15.</p>

Those serving determinate sentences of 12 months or more serve the second half of the sentence on licence in the community under supervision, and subject to recall to custody. Eligible offenders serving a determinate sentence of less than four years may be released under the home detention curfew scheme up to four and a half months earlier than the half-way release point if they pass a risk assessment. Offenders serving an indeterminate sentence, either a life sentence or a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP), must serve in custody the full minimum term imposed by the court. After that point it is for the Parole Board to determine if and when they are safe to be released on licence.</p>
