	<p pid="a.375W.0/1">Radioactive material when transported by sea must be packaged and stowed in accordance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code). Where certain types of radioactive materials (such as spent nuclear fuel and high level waste) are carried the ships must be certified to meet the requirements of the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-level Radioactive Wastes on board Ships (INF Code) produced by the International Maritime Organisation as appropriate to the quantities of material transported. These regulations aside there are no specific restrictions or requirements placed on the sea transport of radioactive materials beyond the general requirements applicable to all ships and cargoes.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.0/2">The responsibility for producing emergency plans for dealing with incidents on board ships lies with the organisations operating them. In the case of shipments of nuclear material on Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ships these are produced and maintained in accordance with the requirements of the IMDG and INF Codes. Their Shipboard Marine Emergency Plans are endorsed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.0/3">Emergency exercises involving these vessels are undertaken in accordance with the above codes and the International Atomic Energy Agency Safety Guide on Planning and Preparing for Emergency Response to Transport Accidents Involving Radioactive Material.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.0/4">The MCA undertakes a National Contingency Plan (NCP) exercise on an annual basis. The programme of exercises involves both UK ports and local coastal authorities and each scenario is designed to cover a range of possible shipboard maritime incidents including dangerous cargoes. Although an incident with a ship carrying a nuclear cargo has not been specifically exercised, the response principles will remain the same. In the case of a nuclear incident technical support will be provided by a designated contact for the ship owner at International Nuclear Services (INS).</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.0/5">The MCA UK Counter Pollution and Salvage Response Team has a tiered callout procedure to any maritime incident. This applies the generic response principles found in the NCP for marine pollution from shipping and offshore installations. Within that team, the MCA duty Counter Pollution and Salvage Officer (CPSO) provides an initial assessment and incident response, alerting if necessary the Secretary of State's Representative for Salvage (SOSREP).</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.0/6">SOSREP and those in the MCA responsible for emergency response have demonstrated a high degree of expertise in a wide range of salvage and counter-pollution operations.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.16/2">The requirement for battle casualty replacements (BCRs) is identified by the Permanent Joint Headquarters. The processes for generating BCRs, once this requirement has been confirmed, differ between the three single Services. For Army and Royal Marine units BCRs are drawn from a nominated cohort based in the Unit's rear party at the home location. This cohort will have been selected and trained at the same time as the deploying Unit and will be up to date on their core military skills. The exceptions to this are for some pinch point trades, where personnel are usually pulled forward from the next Brigade in line to deploy; and senior officer replacements, which are generated by the relevant headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.16/3">For the Royal Air Force, BCRs for formed units are drawn from the rear party at the home location. Other replacements are generated by Headquarters Air Command. If the replacement is required immediately and the gap is affecting operational effectiveness, a waiver to deploy without completing the required pre-deployment courses can be given by theatre. This has not been necessary to date.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has a particular responsibility to help seriously injured and disabled service personnel, and works closely with service charities in discharging this responsibility. One of the most important requirements of seriously injured service personnel is accommodation adapted to meet their specific personal circumstances, and the MOD provides some 1,300 adapted Service Families Accommodation (SFA) which includes over 2,000 specific adaptations (such as a stair-lift or walk-in shower) for either service personnel or their dependants. Personnel will continue to receive medical treatment from the Defence Medical Services for as long as they remain in the armed forces, and ongoing welfare support is available from the chain of command; through the Army Welfare Service; and from service charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/2">For service personnel who are medically discharged as a result of their injuries, and thus lose their entitlement to service accommodation, MOD welfare staff will assist as necessary in liaising with local authorities regarding provision of suitably-adapted local authority or private housing. Further, the Service Personnel Command Paper in 2008 stated that MOD would assist service personnel who wished to purchase their adapted SFA. Service personnel injured in service now have their lump sum compensation payments disregarded for purposes of the capital means test for the affordable homes schemes in England and Wales and can have them disregarded in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/3">This will help ensure that the most seriously injured can benefit from those schemes to get on to the housing ladder.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.5/1">The Royal Navy plays a leading role in international coalition counter-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia.

	<p pid="a.382W.8/1">Since 2002 the Royal Navy has been conducting maritime security operations in the Gulf region, including around the coast of Somalia, as part of a US-led coalition-the Combined Maritime Forces (Combined Task Force 151). Following a sharp increase in piracy levels in 2008, a separate task force was created in January 2009 to focus on the deterrence of piracy in partnership with other counter piracy initiatives. The UK provides the Deputy Commander to the operation, based within the UK Maritime Component Command in Bahrain, and periodically allocates a frigate and tanker as operational priorities dictate.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.8/2">In December 2008, the EU established operation ATALANTA to protect World Food Programme and other vulnerable shipping transiting through the Gulf of Aden. The UK has provided the Operation Commander and Operation Headquarters at Northwood since its inception and will continue to do so until the end of the mandate, which has recently been extended to December 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.8/3">The UK also provided a frigate for the first three months of the operation and will provide a warship for a period in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.8/4">In July 2009, NATO set up a complementary operation, Ocean Shield, which is primarily focused on deterring and disrupting pirate activity. To date, the UK has provided a frigate for a large part of this operation, including taking command between June to November 2009 and March to July 2010. The UK also provides the NATO Maritime Component Command at Northwood.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.8/5">Finally, the UK provides support on an ad hoc basis to all three counter piracy operations as military assets transit through the region. This has included warships, support vessels, and the enduring delivery of shipping advice and reassurance to the merchant community through the UK Maritime Trade Organisation.</p>

Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr O'Brien), following his earlier meeting with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. These meetings reaffirmed the importance of the UK-Kenya partnership on a range of shared interests, and the UK's commitment to supporting the reform agenda pursued by Kenya to ensure the country's future stability and prosperity. I praised progress on Kenya's constitutional review ahead of the August referendum, and reiterated UK support in areas such as constitutional, electoral and police reform. I encouraged strong leadership from Prime Minister Odinga and President Kibaki to combat corruption and impunity, including by those who perpetrated the post-election violence of 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.5/3">The UK was saddened to hear of the attacks that place in Nairobi on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-13">13 June</phrase> at a constitutional rally. In a public statement following the attacks, I said that we condemned any such acts of violence, and would stand with Kenya in fighting such destructive acts. I look forward to visiting Kenya soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.394W.5/1">The Government identified inherited spending plans where funding was reliant on underspending across Government though the End Year Flexibility (EYF) system or additional funding from the Reserve. However, it was highly unrealistic to expect that underspending would have been sufficient to cover all these commitments. There is insufficient contingency in the Reserve to cover the remainder. Therefore, without urgent action, the difference would result in higher borrowing this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.394W.5/2">As a result the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> that four Departments had worked with the Treasury to cancel &#163;1.5 billion of commitments that relied upon access to the Reserve and EYF, of which &#163;220 million was from the commitments the previous Government made to the Department for Communities and Local Government for access to EYF in 2010-11. Moreover given public sector borrowing in 2010-11 was forecast to hit &#163;167 billion such levels of spending on 'borrowed money' was unsustainable-contributing to the forecast &#163;1.4 trillion of public debt by 2014.</p>

	<p pid="a.404W.3/2">We will of course want to discuss with Cabinet colleagues how Apprenticeships can contribute to the policies and priorities of all Departments.

	<p pid="a.404W.3/3">Extending Apprenticeships into new areas and embracing new technologies and emerging industries is fundamentally important to the very nature of Apprenticeships-we must be responsive to the changing demands of employers and industry. Sector Skills Councils are playing a lead role and collaborating over Low Carbon skills, including working with employers to design new Apprenticeship frameworks.</p>

	<p pid="a.412W.2/1">Budget 2010 announcements on the personal allowance for under 65s and basic rate limit are aimed at ensuring that the majority of higher rate taxpayers will pay broadly the same total level of tax and national insurance as previously planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.412W.2/2">This is consistent with current estimates which suggest that around 1.9 million higher rate taxpayers may gain an average of just &#163;5 in 2011-12. Such estimates depend on economic assumptions, in particular for inflation in September 2010. The projected small benefit arises due to differences in rounding amounts for the personal allowance and basic rate limit.</p>

Where the Ministry of Justice has organised conferences, the costs of staff time are not separately recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.2/14">With respect to the attendance at conferences, it is possible that additional related costs may have been incurred for travel and subsistence where this was not covered by the overall amount charged for conference attendance.

	<p pid="a.426W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice does not hold centrally details of whether the offender was related to the victim other than where the offence is specified separately in law. It is therefore not possible to identify from convictions for murder or manslaughter those specifically of parricide or matricide.</p>
	<p pid="a.426W.5/2">Available information given in the table is from the Home Office's Homicide Index and relates to the number of homicides where a victim was the parent of the principal suspect and the principal suspect was convicted of murder, section 2 manslaughter (diminished responsibility) or other manslaughter. The data reflect the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-24">24 November 2009</phrase>, when recording closed down for the purpose of analysis, and will change as subsequent court hearings take place or other information is received. Data can be provided only for cases initially recorded as homicide by police during 2007-08 and 2008-09; prior to this the 'parent' relationship category also included the relationship 'step-parent'.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.6/1">Published statistics show that offenders subject to court orders under probation supervision have a lower reoffending rate than those sentenced to custody. Some of this effect may be because offenders discharged from prison have characteristics associated with a higher rate of reoffending, such as more previous convictions. But some may be due to the fact that offenders on community sentences are taking part in programmes which promote rehabilitation and because they have not been taken away from their homes, jobs and communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.434W.2/1">The use of the word reshaping in the Cabinet Office Structural Reform Plan reflects the two specific programmes in question ContactPoint and ID cards. I have used the Cambridge English Dictionary definition of reshaping-to shape something again or differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.2/2">In the case of ID cards, the closure of the programme has been announced and the process of closure is now under way. We have already announced the early release of 70 temporary staff in Durham as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.434W.2/3">We have made clear our intention to end ContactPoint as soon as is practicable and are considering developing a new service aimed at supporting vulnerable children. We recognise that significant investment has already been made in developing ContactPoint and the infrastructure that supports it. Therefore, we will seek to make the most appropriate use of that investment when considering a new approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.0/1">The Government have set out a number of major welfare to work reforms, including a core integrated Work Programme and a number of measures designed to support people to find employment. These measures are designed to help in the Government's key aims of fighting poverty, supporting the most vulnerable and helping people break the cycle of benefit dependency, and will be introduced at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.0/2">The Work Programme, which we aim to introduce by summer 2011, will be an integrated package of personalised support providing help for people who find themselves out of work. This support will be made available on the basis of need rather than on the benefit claimed. The Work Programme will be delivered by contractors drawn from the private, public and voluntary sectors. We will offer them stronger incentives to work with the harder to help, paying delivery partners out of the additional benefits they realise as a result of placing people into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.0/3">Alongside the core Work Programme, a series of individual support measures will be introduced to Get Britain Working such as:</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.0/4" class="indent">Work for Yourself, giving access to business mentors and start-up loans;</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.0/5" class="indent">Work Clubs, to give unemployed people a place to share skills and experiences;</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.0/9">Until the Work Programme is implemented, the Government will ensure appropriate support is in place.</p>
