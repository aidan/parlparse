In 2008, DFID also paid off outstanding arrears owed by the Liberian General Auditing Commission (GAC), which amounted to a total of $43,145, allowing the Auditor General and his staff to attend specialised training courses to enable them to undertake more comprehensive and detailed audits of government finances.</p>

In 1999, the Department created the Defence Fraud Analysis Unit (DFAU), and in 2006 established the Defence Irregularity Reporting Cell to act as the central point for the reporting of all suspicions of irregularity, including fraud, theft and corruption. Defence Equipment and Support, which was formed in 2007, has created a Defence Crime Forum to address the risk of fraud and corruption in the procurement environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.7W.2/1">The end of the Korean war is due to be commemorated in 2013, the 60th<sup>( )</sup>anniversary of the armistice. It is too early to say how this anniversary might be officially marked or indeed how many might attend. My officials have been in contact with the Korean Veterans Association who are content that the commemorations should take place in 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.10W.13/1">Civil aviation safety in the UK is regulated by independent aviation safety regulators: the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). As such the Department for Transport does not itself issue guidance. In July 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) related to a potential unsafe condition associated with unreliable airspeed indication. The AD was issued in order to mandate action for Airbus A330 aircraft registered in the US, which had already been taken in Europe by France as the State of Design for that aircraft. The French Directorate General of Civil Aviation recognised a potential safety problem and issued two ADs on the Airbus A330 in February 2001 The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) made the ADs mandatory in the UK at that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.17W.5/3" class="indent">Your Parliamentary Question has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.17W.5/4" class="indent">Data on local councillors has been collected since 1998. During each cycle of the National Fraud Initiative, local authorities have been required to submit payroll data that includes salaries, wages and members allowances.</p>
	<p pid="b.17W.5/5" class="indent">Prior to 1998 and based on known frauds reported by audited bodies, pilot exercises were run to determine the value of data matching payroll within NFI. The pilot data was used to provide anomalies to audited bodies and as a result of their investigations they detected significant numbers of payroll and housing benefit frauds by public sector employees and elected members. Consequently payroll became a core element of the data used in NFI. The long standing principle of running pilots to assess the fraud risk in a dataset is enshrined in the Commission's Code of Data Matching Practice laid before Parliament in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.17W.5/6" class="indent">Individual case studies and the total of frauds detected have been reported in the NFI national reports published at the end of each exercise and many have been covered by local and national media particularly where custodial sentences have resulted. Many local authorities have rightly adopted a zero tolerance approach to fraud and it is important that this is as robust with staff and elected members as it is with members of the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.5/1">While there is no specific requirement in place, the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is encouraging all contractors to use the waterways to transport materials. The ODA's work to open up navigable waterways will actively encourage contractors to employ sustainable transport methods at every opportunity. Contractors are embracing this challenge; for example, Team Stadium (the consortium constructing the Olympic Stadium) are building offloading facilities near the stadium to enable movement of materials by water. Two of the ODA's other tier one contractors, Veolia and Aggregate Industries, have also committed to using the waterways to transport materials in and waste out. Veolia, the site waste management contractor, is expected to have the first barge carrying waste out of the park at the end of June 2009, following the opening of Three Mills Lock (formerly known as Prescott Lock) this month.</p>

	<p pid="b.26W.8/2">The Lea Navigation canal, which runs along the western perimeter of the site, already enables 100 tonne barges to access the park. Access to Waterworks River (which runs through the centre of the Park) has been facilitated by investment in a new lock at Three Mills (formerly known as Prescott Lock). This lock will enable the passage of 350 tonne barges to the Olympic Park wharf&mdash;located opposite the aquatics centre. Dredging has been undertaken along Waterworks River to ensure barges can reach the new wharf.</p>
	<p pid="b.26W.8/3">The construction of Three Mills lock was managed by British Waterways with funding contributions from the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), Transport for London, Department for Transport, London Development Agency and the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation. Dredging was undertaken by British Waterways. The new wharf along Waterworks River has been constructed by the ODA's tier one contractor, Volker Highways.</p>

	<p pid="b.27W.2/1">Contracts for landscaping of the London 2012 Olympic Park are the responsibility of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and are awarded following a competitive tendering process. The authority is a public body whose procurements are subject to the public contracts regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.2/2">The ODA, in support of its overarching commitment to value and quality, sets a number of requirements, including demonstration of quality and functionality, equality and diversity, design and accessibility, and sustainability, as part of the evaluation criteria used to award contracts. In addition to this core criteria, bespoke commercial and technical conditions are set as appropriate for each of the individual contracts within the Landscape and Public Realm project.</p>
	<p pid="b.27W.2/3">Further detail on ODA procurement policy and principles can be found in the ODA Procurement Policy (published March 2007) and the ODA Supplier Guide (published June 2008).</p>

	<p pid="b.36W.8/3">The Internet Advertising Bureau (the IAB), the UK trade association, has developed with Members a set of principles on the use of data to provide online behavioural advertising (OBA) to safeguard individual privacy. They are public commitments of good practice made by the signatory Members to users.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.8/4">They are based on three core Principles&mdash;notice about data collection, user choice as to whether to participate and education about behavioural advertising and its benefits&mdash;with the goal of building trust and understanding in OBA and enhancing users' ability to control the use of information for these purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.8/5">The Principles address a broader scope than required under existing law, by covering the use of all information used for OBA&mdash;both anonymous information and personal data (in the United Kingdom, the latter is primarily addressed by the Data Protection Act 1998, as amended, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003). They also consider where special care is needed for certain categories of data, such as personally identifiable information or sensitive data.</p>

	<p pid="b.44W.5/1">Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>(th)</sup> Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the Personal Capability Assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on the incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. For example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the grounds of alcohol and/or drug related conditions would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the Personal Capability Assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking for a recent estimate of the number of permanent Jobcentre Plus staff who a) are classified as without a permanent post and b) have been classified as without a permanent post for more than 12 months. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/4" class="indent">In Jobcentre Plus, anyone who is formally recognised as not having a sustainable posting is classified as surplus. This provides such individuals with priority status when seeking a permanent post in Jobcentre Plus or elsewhere in Whitehall. As at April 2009, there were 155 surplus staff in Jobcentre Plus. Of that number, 81 people have been surplus for more than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/5" class="indent">Naturally, in a large customer service organisation structural change is often required in order to meet changing customer needs. Of the 155 cases we are reporting, 125 are Band As. The Band A position was subject to structural change in parts of the Jobcentre Plus operation during 2007/08 and resulted in 550 Band As being declared surplus. We have been successful in reducing that number to the current level. Surplus staff are actively engaged in delivering a range of Jobcentre Plus projects and duties while seeking a new permanent position.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.5/6" class="indent">Line managers are responsible for supporting individuals who are declared surplus. We manage such impacts of workforce reductions on our people, through a framework agreed with our Trade Unions and these are operated within a set of Cabinet Office protocols that apply across the Civil Service. These require us to take all reasonable steps to minimise compulsory redundancies. To date no members of staff have been made redundant against their will.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.2/1">Nine out of 10 families are entitled to tax credits. This near-universal provision has helped reverse decades of stigma attached to financial support that prevented the very poorest taking up the help they needed. Take-up of tax credits is now the highest ever for an income-related system of financial support, at 81 per cent. overall and 92 per cent. for the poorest fifth of families. Tax credits are carefully targeted so that the greatest support goes to the poorest families. Only a tiny proportion of tax credits spending goes to those earning more than &pound;50,000&mdash;just 0.2 per cent. of overall entitlement in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.60W.2/1">Custody for young people under 18 is the last resort. Where a person under 18 has committed a very serious offence (generally one for which a person aged 21 years or over could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years or more), section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act 2000 enables the court to impose a term of detention not exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment that a person aged 21 or over could receive for the same offence. Before the court may decide to impose a sentence of detention under section 91, subsection 3 requires it to consider all other possible disposals, including a shorter period of custody under a detention and training order.</p>
	<p pid="b.60W.2/2">Data provided by the Youth Justice Board indicates that at the end of March 2009 there were 2,036 young people under 18 serving custodial sentences, including 349 serving a sentence imposed under section 91. Of those, 150 had received a section 91 sentence principally for an offence of violence against the person.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.2/1">National Offender Management Service (NOMS) probation leadership and management development at first line manager level has to date largely been delivered at a local level in areas and trusts, through training consortia or areas and according to local need. A full audit and review of management development on the probation side is currently being undertaken through NOMS headquarters to inform planning for future delivery. In the interim, all NOMS managers (probation and prisons) have access to the NOMS tool, &quot;My Leadership Potential&quot;, a new e-learning management development package launched in April 2009. This provides an opportunity for managers to develop their skills and knowledge on a self-managed learning basis. In addition, first line management development activities are run locally by some probation areas and trusts according to need.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/2">Data on how many and what proportion of probation first line managers have undertaken training has not historically been collected centrally, as first line management development has largely been organised and delivered locally. The current audit and review will provide information on which to base decisions on future interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/3">On the prisons side, the standard offering is the level 3 award in first line management, the introductory certificate in management, which has been offered to all first line managers since 2005. Until April 2009, all first time, first line managers with line manager support were eligible for this programme. In the region of 500-600 have participated annually during this time. This represents on average approximately 45 per cent. of the total number of newly promoted first line managers on an annual basis and 12-14 per cent. of the total number of first line managers. In April 2009, the programme was temporarily closed pending review of continuing fitness for purpose and an updated version or a comparable level 3 nationally accredited programme will be re-launched in October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.2/4">With regard to plans for further training and development, on the probation side, the audit and review will provide information on which decisions will be made about future interventions. For prisons, the appropriate level 3 programme will be launched in October 2009.</p>

The first, focusing on treatment offered and responses to treatment, is being carried out by the University of Oxford. It is due to report to the stakeholder Departments, the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health, by the end of this year. The second, concerned with staffing and organisation, is by Imperial College. It is due to report in the first quarter of 2010.

	<p pid="b.66W.5/1">Prisons in England and Wales are asked to send mobile phones and SIM cards they find to a central unit for analysis. In 2008, 8,062 mobile phones and SIM cards were analysed. This figure includes items discovered within prison perimeters and on entry to establishments.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.5/2">We believe that this figure may understate the actual number of finds because it does not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones found indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.5/3">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons are being provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report, &quot;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&quot;, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of &quot;BOSS&quot; chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>
	<p pid="b.66W.5/4">We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment to bring an unauthorised mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

Details of the age, sex and ethnic group of the young person restrained were also collected from that point, but it is not possible to provide a further breakdown, by those categories, of the reasons for restraint, as the Youth Justice Board does not receive the data in that format. Statistics relating to young offender institutions and secure children's homes are not collected in the format requested and obtaining them would require a search through individual records, which could not be carried out without disproportionate cost. The YJB does not collect data on whether or not a young person restrained has a disability, or the requested information about removal from association, and these could not be provided without disproportionate cost.</p>

All UK licence applications for exports to Sri Lanka have been carefully assessed against the criteria on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature of the goods, the end use, and end users, and with full consideration of the prevailing situation.

	<p pid="b.77W.6/1">REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) aims to minimise animal testing, and actively promotes the development and use of non-animal alternative test methods. However, it is inevitable that some further animal testing will be necessary in order to fill the many gaps which currently exist in our knowledge of the way chemicals impact on human health and the environment. Animal testing is only allowed as a last resort where no suitable non-animal alternatives exist. REACH prohibits repetition of animal tests once they are completed, and requires the data from them to be shared between everyone wanting to register the same substance.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.6/2">In October 2006, the European Commission estimated that in the region of between 8 and 13 million additional animals might be used across Europe over the entire REACH registration period. However, we expect that number to be significantly reduced as a result of the additional drivers to reduce the amount of animal testing that were incorporated into the final agreed REACH text in December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.6/3">These figures should also be read with caution because of the uncertainty about how many registrations will be made over the next nine years. It is not possible to estimate how many tests might take place in the United Kingdom as there are no restrictions on where any individual company may choose to commission any procedures it needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.78W.2/1">It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern review on the economics of climate change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. Some of these benefits will accrue to Departments as cost-savings over the next three years, with further more significant gains to be made in future years. The main rationale for investment to address climate risk will be to reduce the UK's vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>

This means the party doing the recycling is paid by the authority where the waste originated.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.0/3">The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme is now called the Landfill Communities Fund. It is a voluntary scheme whereby landfill site operators can only claim tax (landfill tax) credits for 90 per cent. of contributions (up to 6 per cent. of their annual landfill tax liability) they make to environmental organisations in support of environmental and community projects. One of the aims of the scheme is to redress some of the disadvantages for those living within close vicinity of a landfill site. The scheme is regulated by Entrust and overseen by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.9/1">DEFRA does not provide direct funding to reduce water consumption in specific areas. However, the Department is supporting a media campaign to be launched this summer that will encourage water efficiency under the Act on CO2 banner. In addition, DEFRA has funded research to support the aims of the Water Saving Group, including work on developing the evidence base for water efficiency projects, improving water efficiency in new buildings, and introducing water efficiency targets. To encourage resource efficiency in business, DEFRA jointly runs the enhanced capital allowance (ECA) scheme for water efficient technologies which provides accelerated tax relief to businesses investing in designated water saving technologies.</p>

Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> <i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.113W.3/1">The recovery of payment owed to national health service trusts by foreign nationals for treatment provided to them is a matter for the individual trust. The National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, set out the criteria for eligibility for free NHS hospital care. It is the legal responsibility of all hospital trusts to ensure that the eligibility of all patients seeking treatment is confirmed and, if they are not eligible for free healthcare, that the appropriate charges for treatment are levied and subsequently recovered. The Department has provided comprehensive guidance on implementation of the charging regulations to help the NHS to discharge their responsibilities.</p>

As part of this, the agency will shortly consult on voluntary recommendations for action by the industry to reduce added sugar in soft drinks.</p>
	<p pid="b.120W.0/3">The Government have also launched the Change4Life campaign which provides messages on reducing intake of added sugar.</p>
	<p pid="b.120W.0/4">Further work to limit sugar intake in children is being taken forward by the School Food Trust, e.g. providing healthier foods in vending machines and the introduction of nutrient based standards for school lunches. In addition, Ofcom has restricted the broadcast advertising of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar during children's programmes and programmes of particular appeal to children up to the age of 16.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.3/1">DECC's analysis estimates that the benefits to the UK of our main measures to help avert climate change could outweigh the costs by more than 10 times. Where these measures lead to an international climate agreement consistent with delivering a 450ppm stabilisation of greenhouse gas atmospheric concentrations, we estimate the total benefits at &pound;241.9 billion. This compares with total costs of &pound;20.6 billion. The Impact Assessment can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.3/3">Of current average electricity bills for medium-sized household consumers, approximately 12 to 14 per cent. is attributable to climate change legislation (the Renewables Obligation, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target).</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/4">For domestic gas consumers, DECC estimates costs of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target on average gas bills at approximately 2 per cent. However the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target supports energy efficiency measures for households and so will deliver over time an overall saving greater than its total cost to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/5">The Climate Change Levy and Climate Change Agreements apply to businesses, not to households.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.3/6">An energy and climate change strategy setting out the proposals and policies for meeting carbon budgets will be laid before Parliament in the summer. This report will put the Government's carbon reduction strategy in the context of the overall programme for delivering secure and low-carbon energy, transport and housing, in a way which benefits the UK economy into the future. An estimate of the cost of the proposed financial mechanism for carbon capture and storage demonstration will also be published as part of the Impact Assessment alongside the consultation in the summer.</p>

Supporting 16 to 18-year-olds is one of the NAS's key priorities for 2009/10. The NAS works with employers across the country to develop Apprenticeship opportunities, and works with Connexions and other agencies to ensure that young people have the information and support they need to access them. From the beginning of this year the on-line apprenticeship vacancy system has been operating, providing a free service for employers and providers to advertise apprenticeship vacancies, and allowing potential apprentices to register and apply for vacancies. Young people can also access apprenticeship opportunities through their local 14-19 Prospectus, a user-friendly, fully searchable directory of education and training available in their area at entry level through to NVQ level 3.</p>

	<p pid="b.136W.5/1">Statistical disclosure rules are operated to protect the inadvertent disclosure of personal information about an individual pupil. For achievement data, the recognised approach is to suppress school level performance information where there are 10 or fewer pupils at the end of key stage 4 in the school.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/2">That is accepted practice in the published Achievement and Attainment Tables. Following that approach, it would not normally be possible to give school level performance information for schools with 10 or fewer pupils at the end of key stage 4 with statements of special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/3">While naming individual schools would potentially disclose personal information about individual pupils, simply stating the number of schools does not.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/4">Additionally, in the previous answer, the approach was relaxed slightly to fewer than 10 pupils (rather than 10 or fewer) at the end of key stage 4 with statements of special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/5">There are 26 maintained mainstream schools with more than 10 pupils with statements of SEN at the end of key stage 4, where no pupils with statements of SEN achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C or the equivalent in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/6">There are 43 maintained mainstream schools with 10 or more pupils with statements of SEN at the end of key stage 4, where no pupils with statements of SEN achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C or the equivalent in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/7">As the number of pupils was over the 10 pupils threshold for those schools, they were named in previous answers.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/8">There were 2,542 maintained mainstream schools at which between one and nine pupils at the end of key stage 4 had statements of special educational needs in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/9">There were 1,279 maintained mainstream schools at which between one and nine pupils at the end of key stage 4 had statements of special educational needs and where no such pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grade A* to C or the equivalent, in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.136W.5/10">To prevent inadvertent disclosure of personal information, it will not be possible to name those schools in subsequent answers.</p>
