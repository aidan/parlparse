	<p pid="b.1824W.2/1">Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04, the risk of poverty for children in families with three or more children has fallen more quickly than the average risk. However, the Child Poverty Review highlighted the fact that these families remain at greater risk of poverty than other families, and that nearly half of children in poverty live in large families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.2/2">Since the review, the Government have increased the child element of the child tax credit (CTC), which is paid in respect of each and every child in a family and so of particular benefit to large families. The child element rose by &pound;65 a year in April 2005 and will rise by a further &pound;75 a year in April 2006, to &pound;1,765. As a result of these and other Government reforms to the personal tax and benefit system since 1997, by April 2006 families with three or more children with an income of between &pound;10,000 and &pound;20,000 per year, for example, will be on average &pound;100 per week better off in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.2/3">The Government have committed to increasing the child element at least in line with earnings in 2007&ndash;08. The Government have also commissioned research into poverty in large families to inform future policy, which is expected to report in 2006.</p>

It removes unnecessary obstacles to retirement planning and saving across the whole spectrum of pension saving. Lifetime allowances give much more flexibility about when a person can save, so if a person can only afford to start saving for a pension late in life, there is plenty of headroom to boost those savings when it is affordable for a person to do so.</p>

Each year, around half of the beef imported into the UK from outside the European Union comes from Brazil. Such imports are a valuable source of raw material for our processing industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1845W.0/2">Our beef industry currently faces a number of challenges, including those arising from the ending of production based CAP subsidies and also in relation to the ending of the Over Thirty Month Scheme for cattle. My noble Friend, the Minister for Food and Farming (Lord Bach) recently hosted a high level meeting to bring the supply chain together to discuss the future, at which he also announced a package of measures worth around &pound;8 million to help the beef sector move forward.</p>

However, I have recently approved a &pound;1.2 million Countryside Agency research project which will explore and demonstrate how the dedication mechanism can be used to improve public access to the countryside. The project will raise awareness of dedication as well as deliver a number of actual dedications. Most dedications are likely to be for access on foot, but the agency will encourage landowners to consider dedicating suitable land for access by horse riders.</p>

	<p pid="b.1855W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/2">During the 21st century, snowfall is expected to decrease over the United Kingdom as a whole. This is a consequence of further warming of climate expected as a result of past and future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. However, the predicted changes vary with location, and are subject to considerable uncertainties arising from the natural variability of climate, errors in the representation of physical processes in climate models, and uncertainties in future emissions. Therefore, it is possible that some parts of the UK could experience periods of increased snowfall during the next few decades. During the second half of the century, however, snowfall is very likely to be lower than at present, in all parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/3">For Worcester, the latest climate model predictions are expressed as percentage changes relative to the climate of the past 30 years. The predictions show a wide range of possible values, due to the uncertainties previously noted. For a typical year around 2010, snowfall could range from about 15 per cent. above the recent recorded levels to about 30 per cent. below. For 2020, values range from a 10 per cent. increase to a 35 per cent. reduction. For 2030, values range from a five per cent increase to a 40 per cent. reduction. For 2050, values range from a five per cent reduction to a 60 per cent. reduction. Within these ranges, the best estimates are for reductions of about five per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent. and 30 per cent. at 2010, 2020, 2030 and 2050 respectively.</p>

The UK also requires non-scheduled services where payment is made for carriage, and passengers and cargo are embarked or disembarked, to seek prior permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1856W.3/5">All other aircraft have the right to land in or to fly across UK territory without the need to obtain prior permission from the UK (Article 5). However, the commander of each aircraft operating in controlled airspace in Europe is required to file a flight plan with Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation.

Where a loss is incurred through the failure of a contractor to fulfil their obligations under a contract, redress is sought through a liquidated damages clause. The amount included in a liquidated damages clause is a genuine pre-estimate, at the time of the issue of tender documents, of the loss that will be incurred in the event of a breach of contract.</p>

	<p pid="b.1878W.2/2">Iraqis detained by UK forces are either criminal detainees or security internees. Criminal detainees are transferred as soon as practically possible into Iraqi custody on their detention by UK forces, usually within eight hours. Security internees are detained and then held at the Divisional Temporary Detention Facility (DTDF) at Shaibah.</p>
	<p pid="b.1878W.2/3">The table gives a monthly breakdown of the number of internees entering the DTDF from its opening in December 2003 to the present. Once security internees are no longer judged to be an imperative threat to security they are released. There are currently 35 internees in the DTDF.</p>
	<p pid="b.1878W.2/4">Before the DTDF was opened, security internees detained by UK forces were transferred into US custody at Camp Bucca. In total, around 1,000 individuals detained by UK forces were interned at Camp Bucca. We do not hold a monthly breakdown for this period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1878W.2/5">We do not have a record of the number of Iraqis convicted in Iraqi courts. This is a matter for the Iraqis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1878W.2/6">The Ministry of Defence does not keep any record of the number of Iraqis convicted in Iraqi courts of offences connected to insurgent activity since March 2003. This is a matter for the Iraqi Ministry of Justice.</p>

At the local level, DFID recognises that, in many developing countries, the systems for monitoring and regulating business activity are weak. We provide support to countries' efforts to develop an appropriate legal framework, including protection of the environment and community rights, and to strengthen their capacity to enforce these laws. An example is the Pathways to Environmental Action in Kenya where DFID supports work with local regulatory authorities and the private sector to find the best means of meeting environmental standards.</p>

DFID also encourages companies to participate in ethical trade schemes such as the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which DFID has funded since it began in 1998. ETI members adopt a code of conduct that includes the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation. They work with their suppliers, in collaboration with trade unions and non-governmental organisations, to improve working conditions in their supply chains and develop and disseminate best practice.</p>

In addition our country and regional programmes are supporting a number of ILO projects that focus on the elimination of child labour and the prevention of trafficking of women and children for forced and exploitative labour.

	<p pid="b.1884W.5/1">I am in regular contact with the US Global AIDS Co-ordinator, Ambassador Randall Tobias, and there is established dialogue at both international and country level between UK and US colleagues. The UK and the US are the two largest bilateral donors on AIDS and have shared views on a range of key issues. For example, together we have emphasised the importance of county ownership for more effective national responses, by securing the 'Three Ones' harmonisation principles and developing the recommendations of the Global Task Team on Improving AIDS Co-ordination among Multilateral Institutions and International Donors. The UK maintained close dialogue with the US to secure the agreements made at Gleneagles and the World summit on getting as close as possible to Universal Access to AIDS Treatment by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/2">The US does have different policies from the UK in a number of areas related to international development, including on some HIV prevention issues. We have different policy positions on issues including promotion of abstinence, sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as access to clean needles and syringes as harm reduction measures. We have made the US aware of our views, yet we do, as we always have, continue to work with them to tackle HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/3">There has been discussion of these different views both bilaterally and in global meetings. The UK encouraged the US to adopt the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) policy position paper Intensifying HIV prevention&quot;, agreed at the UNAIDS Programme Co-ordinating Board (PCB) in June 2005. This is an excellent basis for action, stressing the importance of countries implementing the most effective, comprehensive prevention programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/4">The UK remains committed to accelerating action on prevention. Globally, less than one person in five has access to basic HIV prevention services. This 'prevention gap' is fuelling the spread of HIV. Improving comprehensive HIV prevention services has never been more important, and this is what DFID supports&mdash;not abstinence-only programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/5">As EU President, we steered and secured agreement on the first EU-wide policy Statement on HIV Prevention. This Statement was launched by the Secretary of State on the eve of World AIDS Day 2005. It affirms the commitment of all European member states to comprehensive, evidence-based HIV prevention programming, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/6" class="indent">Universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services;</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/7" class="indent">Provision of harm reduction programmes and supplies to drug users to prevent transmission of HIV through dirty needles;</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/8" class="indent">Challenging and combating HIV-related stigma and discrimination through legislation, awareness campaigns and education;</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/9" class="indent">Providing universal access to prevention services, including voluntary counselling and testing for HlV;</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/10" class="indent">Reliable access to essential Sexual and Reproductive Health commodities including condoms (male and female) and kits for the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and to essential harm reduction commodities including clean needles and syringes; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/11" class="indent">Continued support to the research and development of new prevention technologies including microbicides and vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/12">The UK will continue to work closely with our US counterparts on tackling the global AIDS crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1886W.3/1">There was a chronic shortage of condoms earlier this year after a large shipment of poor quality condoms were withdrawn from the market in October 2004. The UK responded by providing an emergency supply of 20 million condoms at the beginning of 2005. Other development partners including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Fund, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria are supplying condoms in large numbers. The latest information I have is that there is no immediate shortage of condoms in the country as a whole, but more work is required to ensure their effective distribution. DFID is helping to address this problem through support for the distribution of condoms and their use. DFID is also working with the Government and other development partners to maintain an updated picture of all condom supplies in Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1886W.3/2">The Government of Uganda's HIV/AIDS prevention policy includes the three elements of abstinence, being faithful and condom use. The long term supply and effective distribution of condoms are essential parts of a comprehensive strategy to fight HIV/AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="b.1887W.5/1">We are working to ameliorate the impact of the EU reforms to the sugar industry by providing support for development of the national sugar action plans and by pressing for an appropriate amount of EU transitional assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1887W.5/2">It is important that each country's sugar action plans sets a clear framework for donor support and private sector investment. DFID is supporting five of the six sugar protocol countries in the Caribbean (Belize, Jamaica, St, Kitts and Nevis, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago) in the development of these plans and will shortly be providing technical assistance to Barbados as well. We will also ensure that, where possible, our ongoing bilateral support to Jamaica and Guyana, and our work with Caribbean regional organisations, respond to the needs created by the sugar reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1887W.5/3">DFID, as part of a wider UK Government effort, continues to do all it can to push for an adequate transitional assistance package for those countries affected by the EU reduction in sugar prices. We funded a study to estimate the impact of EU sugar reform on the sugar protocol countries, and through our support for the action plans are helping to identify the financing needs for each country. Lobbying of other member states is likely to secure an initial &euro;40 million for 2006. DFID will continue to play an active role in the wider UK efforts to lobby both member states and the European Commission to ensure adequate levels of transitional assistance for the period 2007&ndash;13.</p>

	<p pid="b.1888W.2/1">DFID commissioned consultants (LMC) estimated in June 2005 that the proposed 39 per cent. price cut for sugar would put 44,800 jobs at risk in these three countries&mdash;33,000 for Jamaica, 1,200 in Guyana and 10,600 in Belize (assuming that the current sugar quotas allowing duty free access for the African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP) producers are maintained). These figures are hotly contested in the region and the national Sugar Action Plans currently being developed by the Governments of these countries seek to identify both alternative employment opportunities and training programmes for those made redundant.

	<p pid="b.1888W.5/1">The UK Government will continue to work hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisations (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements. In the context of the WTO negotiations, we are firmly committed to ensuring that developing countries are given appropriate flexibility to adjust to trade reforms, i.e. special and differential treatment (SDT). These include proposals for special products in developing countries, which may require protection due to their importance for rural development and food and livelihoods security. They also include proposals for a special safeguard mechanism for developing countries to temporarily protect vulnerable sectors if affected by import surges.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.5/2">In the negotiations poor countries are not being forced to open their market through any trade negotiations, multilateral, bilateral or otherwise. The UK Government believes that developing countries should be allowed to choose the best policies for the poor and the environment. New trade rules made in the WTO have to be agreed by consensus and thus all countries have the right to veto any agreement they do not consider to be in their best interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.5/3">The UK Government believes that trade rules should take account of different .countries' development needs. The answer, however, is not greater protectionism in the form of higher tariff barriers as these will limit the opportunities for poor countries to trade with each other, and with developed countries, and thus exclude them further from the benefits of international trade. Instead, we believe that existing and new trade rules should be made flexible enough so that they meet developing countries' needs. This is the policy the Government is pursuing in the WTO.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.5/4">In services such as water, education and health, increasing access, coverage and quality is vital if countries are to reach the Millennium Development Goals. In March 2005, DFID published a policy paper entitled 'Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: changing aid conditionality', which shows that we are committed to helping Governments of developing countries make their own decisions about how to develop their economies and provide services to their people, based on evidence of what works best in reducing poverty. The policy makes it clear that DFID will not make aid conditional on specific policy decisions by partner Governments or attempt to impose policy choices on them, including in sensitive economic areas such as privatisation or trade liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.5/5">DFID also encourages developing countries to make their own decisions about service delivery, including whether or not to open their service sectors to foreign providers. However developing countries are not obliged to accept any request or to open up their services sectors. It all comes down to which option is the most effective in reducing poverty, a decision for Governments of developing countries to make through their own political process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1888W.5/6">The WTO Ministerial Conference taking place in Hong Kong this week, represents an important opportunity to make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty. The UK Government is working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest.</p>

	<p pid="b.1895W.2/5">Data for 2003 and 2004 at local authority level are not reliable enough.

	<p pid="b.1895W.2/6">Figures for socio-economic groups can only be derived using the 10 percent. pupil level sample dataset supplied by local authorities (LAs).

	<p pid="b.1895W.2/9">The final 2005 dataset represents the most reliable set of information on the outcomes of children on the foundation stage profile for local authorities and reflects the fact that ongoing improvements to the assessment process are at their most advanced and have been applied more widely.</p>
	<p pid="b.1895W.2/10">This SFR will also include broad figures on the proportion of children who are achieving a good level of development in England for some of the most disadvantaged areas in England. The figures will be derived from the pupil level sample and will form the baseline for the SR 2004 public service agreement 1 which aims to improve children's communication, personal, social and emotional development.</p>

The improvement of the A21 is one of the transport priorities identified in the Five Point Plan for the regeneration of Hastings and Bexhill. The role of SEEDA, and the Task Force, has therefore been to advocate the bringing forward of A21 improvement schemes. The Highways Agency is the responsible body for delivering these schemes, SEEDA has no direct role in them. Therefore SEEDA has received no funding for such schemes.</p>

We have conducted a wide-ranging market sounding study to obtain the market view of the feasibility of an identity card with a ten year life. The survey was distributed to a cross section of suppliers in the smartcard value chain and completed responses were obtained from twelve suppliers. Amongst other questions, suppliers were asked for their views on the durability and costs of contact, contact-less, dual interface and hybrid cards. This survey concluded that a ten year life for a contact-less card incorporating a secure smartcard chip with a radio frequency contactless interface was feasible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1921W.0/3">At a ministerial level, several meetings have been held with network operators, retailers and handset manufacturers&mdash;these have all proved to be productive. The mobile phone industry are committed to helping the Government and law enforcement agencies tackle mobile phone theft and have worked very positively in partnership with us over the past three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1924W.6/1">The UK Passport Service has not yet completed the procurement process for the introduction of the high street network of offices for conducting interviews for all first-time adult applicants for passports. It is therefore unable to release details on costs at this time as it could prejudice the contract negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1924W.6/2">As stated in the corporate and business plans, the average unit cost for the production of passports will rise from &pound;42.36 in 2005&ndash;06 to &pound;57.93 in 2006&ndash;07 to cater for a range of improvement initiatives, among which is the introduction of biometrics and the interview for all first time adult passport applications.</p>

During the early stages of transition, some customers will receive a biometric passport but most will continue to receive a digital passport. UK Passport Service will only switch over completely to biometric passports once it establishes it is safe to do so without compromising customer service.

	<p pid="b.1930W.2/3">We have made good progress in reducing the bureaucratic burdens on police officers by cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring that forces have the best scientific and technological support like video identity parades and electronic fingerprinting so that officers spend more time in communities tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and reassuring the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.1934W.14/2">We continue to see a vital role for police authorities in setting policing priorities for the force and holding the chief officer to account for the delivery of an efficient, effective and responsive policing service. To maintain democratic legitimacy, we envisage that the majority of police authority members will be local councillors, as now. We are considering options for strengthening the accountability arrangements at BCD level to ensure that local communities have a stronger voice in setting local policing priorities. A number of authorities are already piloting various models at this level. One model that seems promising is that of a local policing board. We will be exploring with the association of police authorities how such boards might operate and their relationship with crime and disorder reduction partnerships and local authority scrutiny committees. The establishment of such boards would not affect the current lines of managerial accountability within forces</p>

On initial computerisation in the 1980s the system provided for the input of three codes. Codes capable of capture electronically were expanded from three to 10 in April 2002 and from 10 to 17 in March 2003. Value significant codes (VSCs) are part of the 17 dwelling house codes.

	<p pid="b.1946W.2/1">In 1998 Government asked Lord Rogers of Riverside to set up the Urban Task Force to examine causes of urban decline and recommend practical solutions to identified problems. The task force's report Towards an Urban Renaissance&quot; was published in June 1999. The Government endorsed the principles behind all of the 105 recommendations, which were fed in to the development of the Government's Urban White Paper. This White Paper, Our Towns and Cities: the future&mdash;Delivering an Urban Renaissance&quot;, was published in November 2000 and incorporated the majority of the task force's recommendations. An annex to the White Papers lists specific responses to each Urban Task Force's recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/2">Significant progress has been made in implementing all of the measures in the White Paper. An implementation plan reporting on progress made between 2000 and 2003 is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/3">These achievements have since been built on by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan, launched in February 2003. This plan sets out a clear set of objectives and actions for the long term development of sustainable communities. It takes forward ideas developed in the Urban Task Force's report and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's subsequent White Paper, creating a robust framework and action plan for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/4">More recently, Lord Rogers reconvened the task force and prepared an independent follow-up report, Towards a Strong Urban Renaissance&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November 2005</phrase>. As he acknowledges in his foreword to this report,</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/5" class="indent">for the first time in 50 years there has been a measurable change of culture in favour of towns and cities, reflecting a nationwide commitment to the Urban Renaissance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/6">Lord Rogers highlighted how this Government's urban policies have resulted in English cities becoming the powerhouses&quot; of the UK economy and have become centres for cultural innovation that stand confidently on the international stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.2/7">Government welcome the contribution that Towards a Strong Urban Renaissance&quot; makes to the continuing and evolving debate on how best to sustain this success. We are currently considering the report and its 53 recommendations, and are exploring how these can best inform our existing and substantive agenda of work already under way to develop world-class, well-designed and sustainable towns and cities that satisfy the demands of residents, workers and visitors alike. The vitality of our towns and cities is an important priority for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the work under way includes the State of the Cities Report. This is a report to Government from a group of city experts led by Professor Michael Parkinson, due to be published in January 2006 alongside other research and analysis undertaken by the Department such as the findings of the first eight City Summits and research findings from the Framework for City Regions study.</p>

We are seeking to safeguard a significant capacity building element for the AU and the RECs within the EU Africa Peace Facility, and to boost efforts under the European Security and Defence Policy, including support for the African Standby Force, the provision of technical advice and enhanced co-ordination of EU member states assistance to the AU and RECs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1948W.8/1">The EU's current contribution agreement with the African Union (AU) already provides for the swift transfer of funds and gives the AU significant responsibility in determining how peace facility money is utilised. The procedures for the African peace facility (APF) also require a request by the AU for APF support before any proposal for expenditure is made. By way of further improving AU control, the APF includes an allocation for capacity building assistance, which is being used to enhance the AU's management of peace support operations. EU member states are also working to ensure a long term funding arrangement for the APF, that safeguards AU control over the disbursal of funds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1951W.3/2">We remain concerned about the continuing tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea over their disputed border.

Lord Triesman also made clear, in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December</phrase>, our condemnation of Eritrea's request to withdraw certain members of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).</p>
	<p pid="b.1951W.3/3">In our frequent contacts, at ministerial and senior official level, with representatives of Ethiopia and Eritrea, we regularly underline that there should be no return to war; that the decision of the Boundary Commission is final and binding, and must be implemented; and that they should engage in dialogue on all issues that divide them. We have also called on both parties to respond promptly and positively to the demands contained in UN Security Council Resolution 1640, which the UK supports fully.</p>

	<p pid="b.1958W.9/1">The Law Officers' Departments have either had no consultant-led projects or none has been assessed as unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1958W.9/2">The Crown Prosecution Service has adopted the Office of Government Commerce's Gateway review process to provide assurance at critical stages of a programme's or project's lifecycle, whether led by departmental staff or consultants. Best practice project techniques and governance procedures are followed to ensure the consultant(s) meet their terms of reference and deliverables for the project and guidance has been issued to departmental managers on the monitoring and reviewing of consultants performance. Where appropriate, payments are linked to the achievement of milestones. Failure to deliver milestones could result in payment being withheld. No project has been assessed as unsuccessful in the time cited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1958W.9/3">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate rarely uses external consultants for analysis, advice, the investigation of problems or assistance in developing new systems, structures or capabilities within HMCPSI. In the event of a consultant-led project which was completed unsatisfactorily, a reduction or cancellation of fees would be sought. No instance has occurred in the time cited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1958W.9/4">The Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Service was created on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-18">18 April 2005</phrase> and has not run any projects assessed as unsuccessful. It has arrangements in place, which would evaluate progress during and after project completion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1958W.9/5">The Serious Fraud Office has had no consultant-led projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1958W.9/6">During the time cited, the Treasury Solicitor's Office, including the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, has had no consultant-led projects assessed as unsuccessful. The officer commissioning the project has reviewed output. Consultant-led projects in TSol have been relatively small and subject to contractual obligations, with appropriate controls. These included defined deliverables and time scales, options for withholding payment until output is delivered to an acceptable standard or terminating contracts at given stages without penalty. There was also an agreed escalation process for dealing with any contractual issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1959W.2/1">All the Law Officers' Departments scrutinise expenses claimed by the consultants they employ.</p>
	<p pid="b.1959W.2/2">Expenses by consultants working on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service must be approved in advance by the Project Manager. Expenses are reimbursed on the basis of the costs actually incurred and must be supported by original receipts. Costs must be within the ceilings determined by the Departments' travel and subsistence policy. CPS includes these requirements in its letters of appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1959W.2/3">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate consultancies are agreed on a fee for the work or daily rate with necessary travelling expenses. HMCPSI's prior authority would be required for any further disbursements. Claims for travelling expenses or disbursements which were insufficiently justified would be queried before payment</p>
	<p pid="b.1959W.2/4">The Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Service employs consultants via the Office of Government Commerce's S-CAT service ensuring that procurement of consultancy services accord with the terms and conditions agreed by OGC, Expenses are included in monthly reports, scrutinised by RCPO staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1959W.2/5">In the Serious Fraud Office, authorisation of consultancy fees and any associated expenses are subject to internal SFO governance and authorisation controls applicable to all expenditure, ensuring that invoices are for agreed rates, for services delivered correctly and to standards agreed in the contract. All projects are led by a Senior Responsible Officer and internal project boards regularly monitor performance against planned activity and budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.1959W.2/6">The Treasury Solicitor's Office, including the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, applies to appointing the services of consultants and management of their contracts, including charges and cost monitoring, the same government accounting principles on procurement as they do on the engagement of external service providers generally: to achieve value for money, with due regard to propriety and regularity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1960W.5/1">Statutory Instruments are drafted by departmental lawyers based on instructions from policy divisions. Where SIs amend primary legislation, Parliamentary Counsel are consulted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1960W.5/2">As members of the Government Legal Service (GLS), departmental lawyers receive extensive training on the preparation and drafting of statutory instruments. This consists of a combination of lectures and practical exercises run by experienced practitioners in the GLS, coupled with training given by legal advisers who advise the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees. In addition, senior managers in the GLS take a close interest in the quality of SIs and provide frequent feedback and on the job training to those with lead responsibility for drafting. This is an ongoing process and part of the continuing education of government legal advisers.</p>
