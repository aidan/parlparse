There has been no change to this policy since the government's announcement in August 2010 of its plans to disband the Commission. The Commission has not recruited a replacement to the former post of MD Corporate Services and has therefore saved the costs associated with that post.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.11/2">The performance of Cardiff and the rest of Wales in this area is impressive. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the BBC is already developing a new &#8220;Drama Village&#8221; in Cardiff Bay. The previous Welsh Assembly Government announced their intention to develop proposals for a linked &#8220;digital media centre&#8221; close to this new development. These proposals open up opportunities to create a dynamic media hub for independent production companies and we will maintain a close interest as the plans develop. They had also identified creative industries as one of their priority sectors. I look forward to hearing whether the new Welsh Government will continue with these plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.11/1">No reliable or comprehensive figure is available. Such information as we do possess does not include payments made by Government Procurement Card or payments for goods and services agreed locally by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and suppliers, as in both cases, neither the location of the work nor whether a supplier is a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) is recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.11/2">There is no central store of data which would allow the calculation of a separate estimate for agencies and therefore this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.11/3">However, in this context, and based on a sample of contracts, we estimate that around 50 of the circa 6,000 new contracts placed directly by the MOD in 2010-11 across the UK are known to have been awarded to Scottish-based SMEs. Significantly, this figure does not include contracts and payments made by the MOD's prime contractors through their supply chain, which are extensive and include a high proportion of SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.11/4">The location of work data held on MOD systems does not align with parliamentary constituencies and thus does not allow for separate calculations for South Lanarkshire and Rutherglen and Hamilton West to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.11/5">The Department values highly the contribution of SMEs to Defence, who often bring a level of innovation and flexibility that cannot be replicated by larger companies. Following the consultation Green Paper on Equipment Support and Technology for UK Defence and Security issued in December, the MOD is developing a number of proposals to improve access to Defence contract opportunities for small businesses, and these will be set out in a Defence White Paper later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.2/3">As they are based on survey data, child poverty estimates published in LID only allow breakdowns to UK level and analysis by region is not possible. However, figures for the UK are set out in the following table. The latest persistent poverty data cover 2005-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.2/4">Persistent poverty is defined as the percentage of children living in relative low income for at least three out of the last four years. As a result the percentages shown in the table reflect the four-year period over which they were derived.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.2/5">It is not possible to estimate persistent poverty by region for future years. Modelled tax and benefit reforms announced since Budget 2010 may have a small reduction in relative child poverty in 2011-12 and 2012-13 for the UK overall; however given the uncertainty around these types of estimates, this change may be on the edge of statistical significance.</p>

	<p pid="a.309W.5/1">The Government set out their vision for the child maintenance system in the Green Paper &#8220;Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance&#8221;. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-07">7 April</phrase>. The proposals seek to encourage parents to recognise their ongoing responsibilities following separation, and to support more separating families to work together to make arrangements that are in the best interests of their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.5/2">Our discussions with the voluntary and community sector during the consultation period indicate that the vision to join up existing support to families, including support available locally, is shared by this sector. While excellent support already exists, it can be difficult for parents to access it when they need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.5/3">We are working with the voluntary and community sector to understand how best to facilitate the joining up of local support, as well as working closely with the Department for Education as we build the evidence base on what support is most effective for different families. The Government are also awaiting the findings of the child poverty pilots to understand what approaches to co-locating services together are most effective in supporting separating families.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.5/4">We aim to publish the Government's response to the consultation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.2/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Noel Shanahan</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will assess the merits of increasing the use of direct payment of child maintenance by deduction from earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/5">Deduction from Earnings Orders are an effective means of collecting child maintenance either through a non-resident parent opting for this method of payment or where it is imposed following a non-resident parent's continued refusal to pay by other means.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/6">However, imposing these orders more frequently could place an unreasonable burden of additional work on employers and increase the administrative cost of operating the statutory child maintenance system.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/7">The Government wants to encourage parents to work together, and where possible, make arrangements for child maintenance between themselves. .However, for cases where family-based arrangements are not appropriate or have broken down there will still be access to the statutory scheme which will use all the powers at its disposal to secure regular payment of child maintenance.</p>

It is also important to note that, where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/2">From April 2012 onwards, it is proposed that claimants of contributory ESA in the Assessment phase or Work Related Activity Group will have their contributory benefit time-limited to 12 months. However, for those who leave contributory ESA as a result of the time limit, it is estimated that around 60%, or approximately 400,000 people, are expected to be fully or partially compensated by income-related ESA, so will retain entitlement to ESA.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/3">People in the Support Group will not have their benefit time-limited because they have the most severe health conditions or impairments and are the least likely to move into work. People receiving income-related ESA will not have their benefit time-limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/4">There will be some people leaving the benefit because their health improves; others&#8217; health will deteriorate and they will move from the WRAG into the Support Group. Those claimants that remain in the WRAG will include claimants whose conditions fluctuate or who have developed other functional impairments.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/5">The following tables show the number of claimants in receipt of contributory ESA in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) phase, the Support Group phase and the Assessment phase by main disabling condition and duration, as at November 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.318W.0/2">The Government's measure of material deprivation combines material deprivation and low income. The following table shows the number and percentage of children living in <i>(a)</i> relative poverty, Before Housing Costs (BHC) and <i>(b)</i> combined material deprivation and low income (BHC) in each region.

	<p pid="a.318W.0/3">It is not possible to estimate low income and material deprivation or relative low income by region for future years.

	<p pid="a.320W.6/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Darra Singh</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many people in (a) Central Ayrshire constituency and (b) Scotland are registered on a training course arranged by his Department. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/4">Jobcentre Plus refers customers to various training opportunities that are available. These could be nationally based opportunities or those only available locally. Our advisers are also able to refer customers to training provision that is not necessarily organised, arranged or paid for by the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/5">As a result, we have no centrally held records that inform us how many of our customers are registered on a training course at any one time. However Jobcentre Plus does record &#8216;opportunities&#8217;, be they training or some other type of work related activity that is not directly employment, for example work experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/6">For 2010/11 and April and May of 2011/12 the total number of customers recorded as being referred to an opportunity in Scotland was 31,418. Similarly 3,392 customers were referred in the district that covers Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway. In addition advisers may refer customers to local training provision that does not get recorded on our national system; therefore these figures may be understated.</p>
	<p pid="a.320W.6/7">The source of the data is an internal system called EPR (Employment Provision Reporting).This is a performance management, data capture and reporting tool. This type of internal management information does not form part of the official statistics outputs that are released by the Department in accordance with the UK Statistics Authority's Code of Practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.4/1">The responsibility for the conduct and delivery of elections, including the purchasing of all necessary equipment and software to run the polls, rests with locally appointed returning officers. The Government do not, therefore, have a role in the administration of individual elections on the ground. The Government's role is to maintain the legislative framework within which elections are run and to provide returning officers with funding for UK parliamentary and European parliamentary elections. It is therefore not the Government's role to promote competition directly among companies which provide electoral services, although we ensure that returning officers are aware of the need for value for money judgments to be made when purchasing equipment or procuring services for the conduct of the elections from suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.4/2">The Government look to ensure that best value for money is achieved when entering directly into contracts with electoral suppliers and that the relevant legislative requirements are followed with regard to procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.4/3">Anti-competitive agreements and practices that have the effect of restricting or distorting competition, and abuse of market power by companies that have dominance in a market are outlawed by the prohibitions contained in the Competition Act 1998. Responsibility for enforcement falls to the Office of Fair Trading which has been given significant powers to investigate and act where it finds companies have breached those provisions.</p>

This &#163;16.5 billion comprises a number of different expenditure categories such as drugs, non-clinical supplies and services, transport and establishment; all of which may include elements of medical supplies and equipment. But the category &#8216;clinical supplies and services&#8217; will cover most of the purely medical and surgical equipment and consumables (such as single use drapes and gowns, bandages etc.). Expenditure in this particular category for 2009-10 was &#163;4.5 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.328W.2/1">In line with the recommendations of the NHS Future Forum, the Government intend to bring forward amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill to provide a more direct duty on clinical commissioning groups and on the NHS Commissioning Board to obtain advice from a wide range of health professionals, including those with expertise in the protection and improvement of public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.2/2">As announced in the Government's response to the NHS Future Forum, it is also intended that the NHS Commissioning Board will in future host clinical senates that bring together a range of health and care professionals, including public health specialists, to give expert advice and support the better integration of services for patients. The Department also intends to bring forward more specific proposals in response to the recent public health consultation on how to ensure that public health professionals, in partnership with NHS commissioners, play a key role in providing leadership to drive improvements in quality and patient outcomes and to reduce health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.328W.2/3">Under our proposed amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill, all clinical commissioning groups will have a governing body with decision-making powers. We do not intend to prescribe in detail the professional membership of governing bodies, but they will have to include at least one registered nurse and one doctor who is a secondary care specialist. The main function of the governing body will be to ensure that commissioning groups are run in a way that ensures effective stewardship of public resources and effective decision-making. This will include ensuring that the group obtains advice from the appropriate range of health professionals.</p>

	<p pid="a.330W.5/1">Approximately 75% of the Department for International Development's (DFID) humanitarian support in Somalia is focused in South Central Somalia where needs are greatest, but where humanitarian access is most challenging. DFID supports United Nations, Red Cross and international non-governmental organisation partners who have experience of working in the area and who have robust programme and financial management and monitoring systems in place. DFID also actively supports the United Nations humanitarian co-ordination for field-level capacity to effectively manage, monitor and report on the overall international humanitarian response.</p>

This decision was taken following consultations with the Peace Implementation Council of which the United Kingdom is a member.

The improvement is in part due to actions taken by the security forces and the Indian Government since last year. Local elections have also enabled people to address grievances through the ballot box.

The method of assessing the noise impact of a wind farm locally is described in &#8216;The assessment and rating of noise from wind farms&#8217;, ETSU-R-97, by the Working Group on Noise from Wind Turbines for the Department of Trade and Industry. We have no plans to change the noise limits that ETSU-R-97 recommends, and will shortly publish a report which investigates matters arising in the consideration of noise impacts in the determination of wind farm planning applications in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.3/2">The Merlin target that was agreed with banks is &#163;190 billion of gross new lending to UK corporates, including lending of &#163;76 billion to small and medium-sized enterprises. The banks will be judged against these published and agreed numbers. Figures published in May by the Bank of England show that the UK's five largest banks lent &#163;16.8 billion to UK small and medium enterprises in the first quarter of this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.6/3">The Government were not satisfied that these were sufficiently ambitious and pushed them to set a more demanding target&#8212;which was what was agreed and published in the Merlin agreement, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.344W.6/4">&#8220;That will put in place for 2011 new committed lending capacity of &#163;76bn for UK small and medium sized businesses, which is materially higher than both the actual gross new lending delivered by the five banks in 2010 of &#163;66bn and the banks' revised expectations for 2011.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.350W.8/2">Companies that make recorded calls to sell or promote their product or business have to comply with Regulation 19 (1) and (2) of the Privacy Regulations, which require that prior consent of the consumer has to be obtained before such calls can be made. Also, Regulation 24 (1) (a) states that all messages must include the identity of the caller and an address or free phone number at which the caller can be contacted. Where a consumer receives an automated call they have not agreed to, or has registered their number with the Telephone Preference Service, there may have been a breach of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.8/3">Therefore, if at any time a public information message turns into a marketing message then would be a breach of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.8/4">The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is responsible for considering complaints about possible breaches and they are able to issue a penalty of up to &#163;500,000 for the most serious breaches of the regulations.</p>

The Department will continue to provide capital funding and monitor the situation with local authorities to ensure there are sufficient school places.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.8/3">The Department does collect information from each local authority on school capacity in maintained schools through an annual survey, which includes local authorities' own pupil forecasts.

	<p pid="a.353W.8/5">We can only estimate the level of demand for school places. It cannot be determined by pupil forecasts alone as other local factors have an influence; for example, changes to school capacity and spare school places. The survey data indicate that there will be a need for an additional 260,000 primary places and 60,000 secondary places nationally over the next five years. We are unable to determine how many schools will actually need to be built to meet the population growth over the next five years. This is a local matter and will be dependent on the needs of the local community.</p>

	<p pid="a.356W.8/1">Security preparations for the 2012 games are progressing to schedule, including gaining clarity on mutual aid requirements and logistics. We are working closely with the Police Federation and staff associations on all these issues. The number of police officers who will need to be deployed on Olympic safety and security duties varies considerably across the 64 days of the games period, from the opening to the closing of the athletes&#8217; village.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.8/2">Work has been done to provide an estimate of mutual aid officers needed across the country on a peak day. Current planning suggests that the maximum number of officers who will be required on days of peak demand is 10,000. Of these, it is estimated that around 8,000 will be supplied by the police forces of the areas hosting the events, meaning that around 2,000 will need to be provided by other police forces through mutual aid arrangements. We currently estimate that 72,000 mutual aid shifts are required across this period, though this figure may be subject to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.8/3">Funding arrangements for Olympic and Paralympic mutual aid are intended to ensure that lending forces are fully reimbursed for the officers they supply avoiding any diminution of the overall resources available to the lending forces and ensuring that policing can be maintained across the UK as a whole during games-time.</p>

However, for operational reasons the police may decide it is more appropriate to arrest an individual once the schedule 7 examination has been concluded and such arrests are not recorded as being related to schedule 7.</p>

	<p pid="a.357W.12/1">The UK Border Agency constantly strives to provide a high standard of customer service at the border and is committed to expediting the entry of legitimate passengers and trade that help build the UK economy while at the same time maintaining a secure border.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.12/2">As a demonstration of the importance we place on passenger clearance times, our targets and performance against them will be published this year (2011-12) as part of the Government transparency agenda. This will enable members of the public to be fully sighted on average passenger clearance times, based on samples taken across the UK's ports and airports. Our current target is to clear 95% of EEA passengers within 25 minutes of joining the queue and non EEA passengers within 45 minutes. Current year to date performance sits at 98% and performance is closely monitored to ensure that deployment of resource is flexed to deal with increases in traffic and maintain overall passenger clearance times while ensuring the border remains secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.12/3">While we do not measure performance against average waiting times we do record them and the details requested are provided in the following tables:</p>

	<p pid="a.364W.2/1">The Government recognise the value of multi-agency arrangements, including the widely held view that multi-agency working brings real benefits to protecting children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.2/2">The Department of Health published a statement of Government policy on safeguarding vulnerable adults from abuse on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">16 May 2011</phrase>. This includes a statement of principles for use by local authority social services and housing, health, the police and other agencies, in order to develop and assess the effectiveness of their local safeguarding arrangements. One of these principles is partnership&#8212;local solutions through services working with their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.2/3">The Government understand that when local people get involved, communities can do things differently. We need local authorities and local multi-agency partnerships to provide leadership in moving to less risk-averse ways of working, and to concentrate on outcomes instead of focusing on compliance. Local multi-agency partnerships should support and encourage communities to find local solutions. These solutions will be different in different places, reflecting, for example, local demographics and environmental characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.2/4">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has recently led targeted work to identify good practice arrangements being delivered locally, in order to enhance safeguarding through stronger partnership working, including co-located models. ACPO has produced advice to forces to make these good practice models and their benefits available nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.2/5">At the national level, the recently-published Munro Review of Child Protection highlighted a number of examples of good practice, including those where multi-agency teams are co-located in one office. Co-location was considered essential in order for the process to work, being the most effective means of building relationships, trust and understanding between agencies, in order to enhance confidence in sharing information.</p>
	<p pid="a.364W.2/6">The Government are currently considering their response to Professor Munro's report.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.0/1">The Government recognise that late payment has detrimental effects, particularly on cash flow for SMEs, and are determined to do everything they can to transform the culture of late payment. That is why we have a target for central Government Departments to pay 80% of valid invoices within five working days of receipt, and why all new contracts must include a clause providing for 30-day payment from primes to sub-contractors.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.0/2">We are also exploring ways to make performance against these objectives more transparent.</p>

We have issued guidance on working on documents, laptops and other mobile devices in public places and the risk of being overlooked. This includes urging staff to question whether they really need to take information out of the office and to obtain permission from a senior manager if this involves more sensitive information. This guidance is being given greater prominence in a forthcoming upgrade of our intranet pages, which will be promoted in a security awareness campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has not undertaken formal research into the effects of reductions in youth offending teams (YOTs) since May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/2">Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 Local Authorities in England and Wales have the statutory responsibility to establish a youth offending team to deliver youth justice services. Local areas are therefore required to ensure sufficient funding and staffing is available to deliver their youth justice responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.2/3">The YJB will continue to monitor and review YOTs to ensure that local authorities provide the support and resources they need to deliver their statutory responsibilities.</p>
