	<p pid="a.539W.0/1">The International Monetary Fund (Increase in Subscription) Order 2011 authorises the increase in the UK&#8217;s quota contribution limit. This will become effective once two conditions are met. Firstly, member countries having not less than 70% of the total of quotas must have finalised domestic procedures and formally consented to the IMF in writing. Secondly, the proposed amendment of the IMF Articles of Agreement on the reform of the Executive Board must have entered into force. The G20 member countries have agreed to do this by autumn 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.546W.3/2">An academy's main source of funding is the General Annual Grant (GAG). The Academy Funding Agreement regulates the way in which the academy may use this funding and specifies that it may only be spent by an academy towards the normal running cost of that academy. An academy is also free to further its educational objects through funding obtained outside state sources such as through charitable donations.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.3/3">It is right that the funding provided by the state should be used fairly to raise educational standards which will benefit all the pupils in an academy. All academies can of course collaborate with, and learn from, the strong education that the independent sector provides. The Government do not however believe that state funding should be used to advance the education of individual pupils at private schools, but should instead be used to further the academy, and its pupils, as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.546W.6/2">Over 90% of children aged 13 to 16 within England are allocated a unique learner number (ULN). In 2010, a Skills Funding Agency internal audit of the operation of the ULN and the related systems, and a subsequent internal audit, undertaken jointly by this Department and the Department for Education, concluded that the ULN is managed well with a stable operation and appropriate oversight and controls. The audits noted sound internal and external sources of assurance along with positive feedback from the Information Commissioner's Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.546W.6/3">We will continue to look at how the ULN can support more effective data and information sharing across educational settings to improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and provide better learner information to support advice, guidance and access to entitlements.</p>

However, the programmes of study for science and design and technology set out a number of statutory key concepts which schools are required to teach. For science, these include recognising the importance of sustainability in scientific and technological developments; renewable energy sources and emerging technologies; and related ethical, economic and environmental issues. For design and technology, these include the impact of products beyond meeting their original purpose and assessing products in terms of sustainability.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.2/1">In order to improve fairness and transparency in the way free early education funding is distributed all local authorities have been required to implement an early years single funding formula from April 2011. Local authorities, in consultation with their Schools Forums, decide how best to distribute 3-16 funding across their locality. This includes setting funding rates for maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers of free early education. Local authorities are required to report on financial expenditure through section 251 returns. Data on individual local authority spend for 2011-12 are not yet available, but will be published later in the year. The Department has undertaken analysis of the rates paid by the 71 pathfinder local authorities that implemented their early years single funding formula from 2010. This analysis includes a breakdown of medium rates per hour by types of provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.2/2">Further details are available on our website:</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.2/4">The Department does not hold information on whether maintained nursery schools have closed as a result of the implementation of the early years single funding formula. The Department issues statutory guidance to local decision makers on handling school organisation proposals. This guidance includes a presumption against closure of maintained nursery schools, on the basis that they generally offer high quality provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.2/5">The following table provides details of the 18 local authority maintained nursery school closures that have been implemented since 2009 along with the reason for closure.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.5/1">The pupil premium for 2011-12 has been allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals attracts &#163;430 of funding which goes to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting, or is managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/2">Local authorities also attract the looked after child pupil premium for 2011-12 which is being allocated to local authorities for pupils who at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> were looked after continuously for at least six months, and who were aged four to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-31">31 August 2010</phrase> as recorded on the April 2011 local authority return. Each pupil attracts &#163;430 of funding, which goes to the responsible local authority who pass it to maintained schools for pupils who have been in care for six months or more in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/3">The service child premium for 2011-12 is allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils who are registered as service children on the January 2011 School Census.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/4">Each pupil known to be eligible attracts &#163;200 of funding which goes to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/5">In East Sussex in January 2011 there were 9,220 pupils known to be eligible for FSM, 20 Service children and, based on 2010 figures, 330 looked after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/6">In Brighton and Hove there were 5,030 children eligible for FSM, no service children, and, based on 2010 figures, 250 looked after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/7">In West Sussex there were 8,110 children known to be eligible for FSM, 400 service children and, based on 2010 figures, 460 looked after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/8">Figures for looked after children will be updated in September, when data from the March 2011 looked after children return is finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/9">In the Brighton, Kemptown constituency in January 2011 there were 8,411 pupils known to be eligible for FSM and no service children. These are approximate figures as it is not possible to determine the number of parliamentary constituency pupils recorded on the alternative provision census or recorded as looked after as they are both local authority, rather than establishment level, returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/10" class="italic">Note:</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.5/11">The local authority level figures in the above include FTE FSM-eligible pupils, in reception to year 11, or aged four-15 if not following, the National Curriculum, as at the January 2011 School Census and Pupil Referral Unit Census and headcount from four-15 in the Alternative Provision Census (i.e. those pupils funded through the Dedicated Schools Grant via local authorities but educated in non-maintained special schools, further education establishments, etc.) those eligible for the service child premium and those eligible for the looked after child pupil premium. Dual main registrations and sole registrations for five to 15 and all registrations for four year olds are taken. Pupil numbers are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>

And for Syria, we have advised that those who choose to remain in Syria, or to visit against our advice should be aware that it is highly unlikely that our embassy would be able to provide a normal consular service in the event of a further breakdown in law and order and increased violent civil disorder. Evacuation options would be limited because of likely communication and travel restrictions. This advice was only given after careful consideration of the threats and difficulties that would face an official Government-led evacuation.</p>

UN Security Council resolution 1991, which the British Government had a significant part in shaping, instructs the UN Peacekeeping Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (MONUSCO) to act under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the most robust possible mandate. UNSCR 1991 prioritises the protection of civilians. UNSCR 1991 also emphasises the need to act against sexual and gender based violence, and to help end impunity. We regularly encourage MONUSCO to work closely with the DRC security forces to prevent human rights violations by their members, and ensure the detention and prosecution of those responsible.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.5/1">The UK is a world-leader in tackling forced marriage, including child (or early) marriage. It is an appalling and indefensible practice and is recognised in the UK as a form of violence against women and men, domestic abuse, a serious abuse of human rights and, where a minor is involved, child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/2">The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU)&#8212;a joint initiative between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Home Office&#8212;was set up in January 2005 as the Government's one-stop shop for dealing with forced marriage policy, outreach and casework. It operates both inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and overseas, where consular assistance is provided to British nationals.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/3">The FCO promotes human rights for all people, including children, in line with the UK's values and obligations. We do this through our work in the United Nations and the European Union, and we also work bilaterally with other countries to implement the UN convention on the rights of the child (CRC) and its two optional protocols. The UK strongly supports the CRC, which sets the international standard for protecting and promoting the rights of children, and works hard to encourage countries to fulfil their obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/4">British embassies and high commissions monitor and raise human rights issues, including women's and children's rights, in their host countries. FCO staff routinely raise our concerns with host governments and, where appropriate, take action on individual cases and push for changes in unfair practices and laws. In countries where there are significant numbers of forced marriage cases (particularly in South Asia), embassies and high commissions do specific work to highlight the issue of forced and child marriage as a human rights abuse. For example in Pakistan, the high commission has worked with a local non-governmental organisation to deliver a major awareness-raising campaign, runs an outreach programme (including workshops with local government officials, and a women's rights workshop with human rights activists), and participates in media activity to encourage discussion in the community. The FMU, in conjunction with embassies and high commissions, is currently developing plans to expand this work across South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/5">The FCO released our 2010 Human Rights Report in March. The report covers our work on human rights issues in 2010 and looks in-depth at the human rights situation in 26 countries of concern. It also contains sections on women's and children's rights. You can read and comment on the report by visiting our website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.8/1">The UK has a strategic relationship with Pakistan, formalised in the Enhanced Strategic Dialogue. This includes a strand under the National Security Dialogue, which focuses on counter-terrorism and other security issues. Our intensive diplomatic efforts, bilaterally, multilaterally, and in concert with key partners such as the US, are complemented by a programme of counter-terrorism assistance to Pakistan. This includes supporting the development of strong institutions and machinery of Government. As part of this co-operation, we have assisted Pakistan's law enforcement and security forces, for example in improving their ability to counter improvised explosive devices (IEDs). However, due to the sensitive nature of counter terrorism projects, we are unable to provide detailed spend figures for our assistance programme.</p>

The first was for the procurement of two Litening III Laser Designator Pods for use on Typhoon aircraft. Procurement of these pods was brought forward as a UOR due to the emergent need but, are being funded by the core equipment budget as the cost of &#163;3.12 million had already been planned. The second was for the extension of the Digimap system that has been successfully used in Operation Herrick at a cost of &#163;200,000 provided through the reserve.</p>

We therefore see an enduring role for the UK's nuclear forces as an essential part of our capability for deterring nuclear-armed opponents.

Costs from 1999 onwards are the final contract values for support maintenance. There are no further planned support periods after March 2011, so no costs were forecast after this date.</p>

Self-employed earnings are usually taken from the self-assessment return that is submitted to HM Revenue and Customs, or from a tax calculation notice. This is consistent with the policy that, in a similar manner as for employed earners, the basis of the child maintenance liability of a self-employed earner is their taxable earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.5/7">The Commission also has the power to request details of, and statements from, any accounts held by deposit takers in the name of the non-resident parent, including bank and building society accounts.

	<p pid="a.589W.5/8">Ultimately, if a non-resident parent fails to provide their earnings information, and it cannot be obtained through the methods outlined above, they may have both a default maintenance decision imposed by the Commission and a fine imposed by the courts.

	<p pid="a.595W.2/1">The operators of offshore installations have the primary responsibility for management and control of risks to oil and gas workers in the British sector of the North sea. Regulatory oversight of this is a priority area for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). in January 2011, the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee reported that the UK has high offshore regulatory standards and both the European Commission and the US Presidential Commission Report on the Gulf of Mexico incident have stated that the UK regime is a good framework for others to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.2/2">Statistical trends indicate that injury rates and hydrocarbon releases offshore are declining. However, the hostile nature of the working environment and the ageing nature of the UK's offshore installations mean that there is no room for complacency by the industry or the regulator. HSE's offshore inspection and enforcement activities include targeted programmes of work on asset integrity, (which address issues about managing ageing plant and extending the life of offshore infrastructure), improving the offshore safety culture and effective industry leadership. HSE is challenging the industry to do more to tackle hydrocarbon releases.</p>
	<p pid="a.595W.2/3">There is also currently an independently-led, review of the UK offshore oil and gas regulatory regime in the light of the lessons from the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. This is due to report later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Darra Singh</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.2/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking: if he will estimate likely changes in trends in the number of staff employed by Jobcentre Plus in (a) Glasgow (b) Scotland and (c) Great Britain on fixed-term contracts over the next three financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.2/4">What changes in trends in the number of staff employed by Jobcentre Plus in (a) Glasgow (b) Scotland and (c) Great Britain on fixed-term contracts there have been over the last three financial years.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.2/6">In response to Question 1, Jobcentre Plus recruited extra people on fixed term contracts to address the impact of the economic downturn. It was anticipated that increased workloads would be temporary and it was always planned to reduce numbers as the growth in unemployment slowed. Jobcentre Plus continues to keep its workloads and staffing levels under close scrutiny. That includes the need to extend Fixed Term Appointments (FTAs). At this point, Jobcentre Plus does not plan to recruit further FTAs and expects to release the majority of existing FTAs during 2011/12 as they reach the end of their fixed term contracts. This will be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.2/7">In response to Question 2, the following table shows the trend in the numbers of staff employed on FTA contracts in Jobcentre Plus by taking the position at March in each of the last three financial years. This data is taken from our internal systems and the numbers based on the latest information we hold. Some people will have worked in more than one period and will therefore be counted in both. The information is set out on a staff in post basis, i.e. employees are counted as a single unit irrespective of the hours they work.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.2/8">The changes in numbers between years reflect the initial increase in workloads as a result of the economic downturn and the subsequent reductions as workloads declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.2/9">When we report against Glasgow it is on the basis of the operational district.</p>

	<p pid="a.597W.5/1">We have restored the earnings link for the basic state pension and given a triple guarantee that the basic state pension will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, price increases (as measured by the consumer prices index) or 2.5%. The restoration of the earnings link and the triple guarantee will benefit both existing and future pensioners by providing a more generous state pension, giving a solid financial foundation from the state, which is essential as part of the pensions system.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.5/2">We are protecting key support for older people: free eye tests; free prescription charges; free bus passes; free television licences for the over 75s; and winter fuel payments will remain exactly as budgeted for by the previous Government. We have permanently increased the cold weather payment from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.5/3">We are introducing automatic enrolment into workplace pensions from 2012. This is a central element of our strategy to reinvigorate private pension savings and aims to harness inertia and bring about a change in people's behaviour in saving for retirement. We expect this to radically increase the number of people saving into a pension and to lead to between 5 million and 8 million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.5/4">We are looking at options for delivering a simpler and fairer state pension which rewards those who do the right thing and save for their retirement and is sustainable for future generations. Two options for reform of the state pension were published in a Green Paper &quot;A State Pension for the 21st Century&quot;. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-24">24 June</phrase>. We are currently considering the consultation responses and will reply in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.5/5">Living standards are about more than income. A range of policies has also been put in place to improve the lives of people over 60 years of age. The Government provided &#163;1 million in 2010-11 to fund Active at 60 Community Agents to help people who are at most risk of longer-term loneliness and social isolation remain active, independent and positively engaged with society following retirement. In 2010 we introduced Ageing Well, a new programme designed to support local authorities to improve their services for older people.</p>

To ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits, the scheme requires a proportion of the carbon savings be achieved in the homes of 'priority' lower income households (aged 70 and over or on certain means tested benefits). In the first two years of the scheme, between April 2008 and March 2010, 3,861 priority group households in York benefited from subsidised loft and/or cavity wall insulation under the scheme.

	<p pid="a.603W.5/2">There are always redundancies, job losses and separations. For example, seasonally adjusted figures from the Labour Force Survey indicated that there were 144,000 redundancies in the UK in March to May 2011.The number of redundancies has fallen substantially since the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/3">It is not possible to estimate the overall average cost to the public purse because it will depend on the state of the economy, whether the redundant person takes up a benefit and how long they remain on benefit before they leave&#8212;either to go into work or another destination. For example, even though there were 144,000 redundancies, overall employment during the period March to May 2011 rose&#8212;by 50,000&#8212;because the numbers moving into jobs exceeded the numbers that left&#8212;including those made redundant.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.5/4">There is, however, a direct cost of redundancy to the public purse. Businesses are required by law to make statutory redundancy payments. Businesses bear the costs of these redundancy payments except in cases where the business becomes insolvent. In such cases the Insolvency Service bears the costs of the statutory redundancy payments. The redundancy payments made by the service to ex employees of insolvent employers during the period Apr 2009 to March 2010 amounted to &#163;270,012,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.604W.0/1">The estimate of numbers lifted out of poverty are based on an assessment of the impact of universal credit using DWP&#8217;s Policy Simulation Model. This model uses data from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS) and uprates incomes and demographics to the relevant year using projections from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The model is able to assess entitlement to universal credit, because of the wide range of personal characteristics reported to the FRS by respondents.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.0/2">The model allows for the fact that currently not all benefits or tax credits are taken up. In the future it is assumed that those currently taking up some, but not all of their benefit entitlements will take up in full under universal credit; and of those taking up none of their current entitlement, around half will do so under the new system.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.0/3">The impact assessment did not include any impacts from changing child care payment arrangements, as the policy design was not finalised at that time. These impacts will be included in a future iteration of the universal credit impact assessment, once the relevant policy announcements have been made.</p>

We have yet to settle on the precise details of how the transition will work, and the effects on housing benefits&#8217; staff. This approach will ensure an orderly transition and that we have people with relevant skills and experience to support claimants both in work and out of work, as they migrate to the new credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.604W.6/2">We will continue to work with colleagues in HM Revenue and Customs and local authorities to test new ways of working and consider how, in the longer term, we can build on the best capabilities of current organisations to provide a consistently excellent service to claimants and ensure value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.615W.5/1">DEFRA's policy on appraisal requires flood management authorities in all areas to value agricultural land and the damages that could occur to food production as a result of flooding and coastal erosion in line with HM Treasury guidance. Specific guidance was provided by DEFRA in 2008, based on HM Treasury Green Book appraisal principles. This is in line with the approach taken to the valuation of other assets. The guidance allows authorities to recognise the different kinds of agricultural output in flood and erosion risk areas and their different values. For example, it highlights the value of specialist salad crops in the Fens and the fact these are less viable to grow elsewhere.</p>

The evidence used in the regional project process includes data supplied by national contracts, with regionally and locally sourced data, and expert knowledge.

In addition, we have asked the regional projects to reference all evidence used (both scientific and stakeholder evidence) to reach their recommendations and assess the social and economic impact, and the quality control and assurance processes they applied. We have asked the SNCBs to provide us with a clear assessment of the scientific certainty and quality assurance of evidence used.</p>

This includes three mobile species: smelt, European eel and undulate rays.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.2/2">Highly-mobile species are best protected by measures which can apply across their range and spatial protection mechanisms are not always, in isolation, the most effective way of protecting these species.

All naturally occurring wild birds, including seabirds, are protected by the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 2007.

Lighter regulatory controls are also in place for those carrying out small-scale, low-risk recycling and recovery operations of scrap metal and waste electrical and electronic equipment, by providing exemptions from the need for an environmental permit.</p>

	<p pid="a.623W.5/2">The Environment Agency&#8217;s policy and operational rules for Denver Sluice are to maximise the available flow so that it can discharge through the sluices at all times. These flows help to reduce the siltation of the Tidal River downstream of the Denver Sluice. This is line with the Great Ouse Tidal River Strategy recommendations and has been found to be the most efficient, sustainable and cost-effective way of managing the build-up of silt in the Tidal River.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.5/3">Daily flow calculations are recorded for all sluice gates at Denver. These are used for a number of reasons including calculating: the available flow for discharge through Denver sluices, the available flow for transfer to Essex to replenish public water resources in the Abberton reservoir, and the river levels required to maintain healthy fisheries, and to provide navigation. Records also include upstream and downstream river levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.5/3">The Strategy evaluated key technical issues concerning engineering, the complexity of the managed hydrology, climate change, sea level rise and the economic justification (under HM Treasury rules) for any works in the Tidal Ouse system.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/4">The total cost of producing the Strategy was &#163;780,000 which consisted of &#163;140,000 for EA staff costs and &#163;640,000 for supplier costs. The project incurred additional costs due to changes in guidance from when the Strategy was initially scoped (in 2005) and from undertaking more development work following extensive public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/5">The Strategy recommends spending on the system over the next 100 years to continue to manage flood risk of &#163;227,000,000. This is a cash cost based on 2009 prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.5/6">The preparation of the Strategy cost less than 0.35% of the total long-term cost of managing the Tidal River Great Ouse over the next 100 years. The Strategy is a substantial project, leading to the first real appraisal of the sustainability of this tidal fenland system, against the issues of climate change, sea-level rise, siltation and water-level management. The Strategy provides the economic justification for ongoing investment for the Ouse Washes and this means the many projects the Environment Agency undertake around this substantial reservoir (and its many components) are based on a sound appraisal of the need for and value of the assets maintained. Without this Strategy it would be very difficult to justify, technically and economically, continued flood risk management investment on the Tidal Ouse system.</p>

The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at: www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data. 2.PCT/SHA data quality. In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided. See the following table. It should be noted that in 2005-06; Craven, Harrogate and Rural District PCT, Hambleton and Richmondshire PCT, Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale PCT and Selby and York PCT merged to form North Yorkshire and York PCT of residence. 3. SHA/PCT/LA of residence. The SHA, PCT or LA containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another area for treatment. 4. Assessing growth through time. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. 5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis. These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. 6. Data quality. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.630W.3/1">Strict quality assurance operates across the NHS breast screening programme at a cost of &#163;5 million per year. The aim of quality assurance in the programme is to maintain standards and continued improvement in the performance of all aspects of breast screening in order to ensure that women have access to a high quality service wherever they live. In line with the update on &#8216;Healthy Lives, Healthy People&#8217;, breast screening quality assurance will become the responsibility of Public Health England from <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April 2013</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June 2011</phrase>, 85% of the 80 local breast screening units in England had at least one digital mammography machine, and 39% were fully digital. We have advised programmes to move to direct digital as quickly as possible as the independent Advisory Committee on Breast Cancer Screening has said that running both film and digital systems together is inefficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.3/3">We know that cancer patients greatly value the care and support of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). The 2010 Cancer Patient Experience Survey showed that 93% of breast cancer patients reported having a CNS. To support the national health service to develop the CNS work force, &#8216;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8217; sets out our intention to build the evidence base for the benefits and costs savings that CNSs can offer. This follows an independent report we published in December 2010 that showed that, in many scenarios, the costs of additional support roles are likely to be outweighed by the savings that can be achieved. The 2010 Census of Cancer Specialist Nurses in England reported that there were 2,164.2 whole-time equivalents CNSs in the 28 English cancer networks, of which 400.37 worked in breast cancer. A copy of the census has been placed in the Library.</p>

One of these, the &#8216;Consultation on Funding and Commissioning Routes for Public Health&#8217;, set out proposals for future public health commissioning responsibilities. We proposed that local authorities would lead on behavioural and lifestyle campaigns to help prevent cancer and other conditions and campaigns to prompt early diagnosis via awareness of symptoms. &#8216;Improving Outcomes&#8212;a Strategy for Cancer&#8217;, published in January 2011, committed to continuing work to promote earlier diagnosis, including, subject to successful evaluation of pilots, further campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.630W.6/2">It was also proposed in the consultation that Public Health England would be responsible for funding all national screening programmes. The design and quality assurance of screening programmes would be a direct responsibility of Public Health England, as would funding and managing the piloting and rolling out of new programmes and extending current ones. The NHS Commissioning Board would commission established programmes on behalf of Public Health England, as specified and with funding transferred for that purpose. It will be vital to ensure as many people as possible are aware of screening programmes including black, Asian and minority ethnic people and there will need to be work to tackle inequalities in the uptake of screening.</p>

The strategy makes clear that tackling health inequalities is essential to improving outcomes and achieving cancer survival rates that match the best performing countries in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.2/2">Since its establishment in 2008, the National Cancer Equality Initiative (NCEI) has undertaken a range of activities to reduce inequalities, including the publication of the major report &#8220;Reducing cancer inequality: evidence, progress and making it happen&#8221; (March 2010). This set out a series of recommended national and local actions to reduce inequalities in cancer care around: data collection; analysis and publication; targeted interventions; training, development and research; evaluation and monitoring; and embedding equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.2/3">The NCEI is working with Macmillan Cancer Support and Age UK on a &#163;1 million programme to improve cancer care and outcomes for older people. The programme consists of 13 pilot sites across the country to improve intervention rates for people over 70 who have a cancer diagnosis. Pilots will introduce new ways of assessing older people for cancer treatment, offer short-term practical support for older people undergoing cancer treatment and will address any age discrimination in cancer services by identifying and addressing the training needs of all professionals working with older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.2/4">In addition, the NCEI work programme for 2011-12 includes: enabling multi-disciplinary teams to undertake annual patient level equality audits to reflect on treatment, experience and practice issues for their local patients; working with the National Cancer Intelligence Network to produce local profiles for emerging national health service organisations, including equality characteristics where appropriate; and examining the 2010 Cancer Patient Experience Survey results by equality group.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.2/26">It is a decision for each individual NHS trust if it wishes to facilitate the collection of umbilical cord blood. Umbilical cord blood collected for the NHS Cord Blood Bank is part of a strategically agreed programme to increase the number of stem cell units available to transplant centres. It complements the work on adult donation carried out through the United Kingdom bone marrow registries. An important aim of the NHS Cord Blood Bank is to help redress the current inequality experienced by sections of the population, mainly from black or mixed parentage backgrounds, when looking for a suitable adult donor on bone marrow registries. For this reason, collection sites are located in areas with high ethnic diversity and high delivery rates. As a consequence, approximately 40% of donations in the NHS Cord Blood Bank derive from ethnic minority mothers. All the cord blood units stored in the NHS Cord Blood Bank are available to national health service patients across the country.</p>

Projects involving research on umbilical cord blood cells are primarily categorised as adult stem cell research. The MRC's expenditure in all areas of stem cell research is detailed in the following table, and umbilical cord research will be a subset of the adult stem cell expenditure. In its records, the MRC classifies stem cell research as either adult or embryonic. This is because stem cells derived from an embryo are truly pluripotent, which means that each cell has the potential to become any type of cell that makes up the whole organism. Stem cells from other sources, including the umbilical cord, are multipotent so they have the potential to become a range of other cell types but not necessarily all cell types found in the adult.</p>

The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers, Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. 2. Data quality. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where changes impact on figures already published, this is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses. <i>Source</i>: The NHS Information Centre for health and social care Medical and Dental Workforce Census</td> </tr>

No special grant application has been received in relation to this exhibition.</p>

It is equally important to work with developing countries to build government capacity to manage data, share data and apply analysis to planning decisions. Loss of forests often comes about as a result of poor governance, which results in illegal land clearance and illegal logging. To this end the UK Government are also working with a number of key forest nations to bring about improvements to forest governance.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.2/1">DFID sees building long-term resilience into national agricultural systems as key in reducing the effects of potential food crisis in the horn and across the whole of Africa. It is for this reason the UK Government provided a &#163;10 million grant to the African Union&#8217;s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) to boost agricultural productivity and improve resilience to food insecurity in Africa. CAADP is working with the national agricultural systems in Ethiopia and Kenya, among other African countries, to define strategies for halving hunger and achieving increases of 6% in agricultural growth each year through policy reform and better investment. For example, latest figures we have from 2009 show that annual agricultural growth rates were 6% in Ethiopia and 3% in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.2/2">DFID also provides resilience through country-led programmes in Africa. In Ethiopia we support the Productive Safety Net Programme which provides cash and food transfers to around 8 million vulnerable people, while in Kenya we are supporting more than 60,000 of the most vulnerable households by providing regular cash payments through our Hunger Safety Net Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.5/1">I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-31">31 January 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-01-31.613"><i>Official Report,</i> column 613W</phrase>, which outlines the reviews I launched last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.5/2">The Government are determined to ensure that the aid budget is used effectively and delivers value for money for both the British tax payer and the world's poorest people. The Department for International Development's aid reviews will fundamentally change the way aid funds are spent in the future with a much clearer focus on results and value for money. After a comprehensive spending review, there is normally an allocation round which in this case, was replaced by a strategic review. This review is an essential part of Government business and an improvement on the previous arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.5/3"><i>(a)</i> The Bilateral Aid Review is estimated to have cost &#163;137,000. The Multilateral Aid Review is estimated to have cost &#163;72,300; the Humanitarian Emergency Response Review is estimated to have cost &#163;269,220. These costs include visits to countries to gather information about the effectiveness on the ground and consult with key partners, external support and peer reviews where appropriate, and production of the reports. All of these were an essential part of ensuring a rigorous process. Staff across DFID also provided inputs into all three reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.5/4"><i>(b)</i> There was no additional cost to the Department for its operational plans since these form part of the Department's normal business planning arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.8/1">I continue to be concerned about the grave situation in Syria which shows no sign of abating. Protests across the country are still being met by unacceptable violence from the regime. Violent repression will only further undermine the regime&#8217;s legitimacy and raise serious questions about whether it is committed to the reforms it has recently announced. No meaningful political dialogue can take place while there is a brutal military crackdown.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.8/2">The UK has made clear that President Assad is losing legitimacy and must reform or step aside. The UK will continue to work with our international partners, including in the UN, to condemn the repression in Syria and call for the Syrian Government to meet their people&#8217;s legitimate demands. If the regime continues to choose the path of brutal repression, pressure from the international community will only increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.684W.5/1">As a party to the United Nations convention on the law of the sea, the United Kingdom has an obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment. The national contingency plan for marine pollution from shipping and offshore installations (NCP) is one of the measures the UK has taken to meet this obligation and the Department for Transport&#8217;s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is the custodian of this plan. The NCP&#8217;s purpose is to ensure there is a timely and measured response to an oil pollution incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.5/2">The operators of offshore installations bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that they do not pollute the sea. However, offshore installations may face problems that exceed the response capabilities that they can reasonably maintain. Therefore, the MCA may need to use national assets in the response to a marine pollution incident. The NCP sets out the circumstances in which MCA deploys the UK&#8217;s national assets to respond to a marine pollution incident to protect the overriding public interest. It also describes how MCA manages these resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.5/3">As detailed above, operators of an offshore installation or oil handling facility are primarily responsible for ensuring that they do no pollute the sea. All such operators must have an oil pollution emergency plan in place. These plans set out the arrangements for responding to incidents with the potential to cause marine pollution by oil. The plans, which are site specific, are reviewed by DECC, MCA and relevant environmental consultees before approval by DECC. The NCP supports and underpins an operator&#8217;s individual oil pollution emergency plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.8/1">The feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme places obligations on electricity suppliers to make payments to households and others for every kilowatt hour of electricity generated by eligible small scale low carbon energy sources (the generation tariff), and to purchase energy exported to the wider energy market (the export tariff).</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.8/2">For smaller installations with a capacity of 30 kilowatts or less, such as those that might be installed on a domestic property, the FITs scheme provides for the proportion of electricity exported in any given period to be estimated at a level determined by the Secretary of State. With the exception of micro-hydro installations, this is currently set as 50% of the total electricity generated. This deeming of exports allows for the level of payment for exported energy to be determined without the requirement of additional metering. These arrangements do not apply if an export meter already exists or is provided at the generator's expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.8/3">The first comprehensive review of the FITs scheme is currently under way and provides an opportunity to consider the approach to metering in relation to payment of the FITs export tariff, including the approach to deeming. The Government recently concluded a call for evidence on the review's scope and we are intending to consult on more detailed proposals later in the year.</p>

This scheme was specifically aimed at bringing forward the demonstration of new components or technology to support the earlier deployment of large-scale multi-megawatt wind turbines.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.8/4">The Carbon Trust, which receives funding from DECC, has so far provided &#163;3.7 million in funding for offshore wind technology innovation through the Offshore Wind Accelerator (OWA), a collaborative research and development programme with eight energy companies which aims to reduce the cost of energy from offshore wind by 10% by 2020. DECC has committed in the region of &#163;4.0 million to OWA in FY11-12; the eight industry partners have invested &#163;5.9 million to date in OWA.</p>

	<p pid="a.687W.8/6">As announced in the roadmap, we are determined to drive down the costs of offshore wind and are establishing an industry taskforce to set out a path and action plan to reduce the costs of offshore wind, from development, construction and operations to &#163;100/MWh by 2020. This will be supported by up to &#163;30 million over the next four years for offshore wind innovation which, subject to satisfactory value for money assessments, will be used to fund schemes to drive cost reductions in components and technologies for offshore wind systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.692W.8/1">There are no immediate plans to introduce mutual recognition of concessionary bus passes across the UK. Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area so the arrangements differ between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 contains a power to allow, through future regulations, for mutual recognition of bus passes across the UK. Regular discussions have taken place at official level with the devolved Administrations. However, various technical and resource issues would need to be resolved before mutual recognition could be pursued. Individual local authorities on the England-Wales border are free to introduce arrangements between them to enable concessionary travel across the border, and some indeed have.</p>

	<p pid="a.695W.5/1">The Department did not use any consultants in the development of the new Strategic Framework for Road Safety. The Transport Research Laboratory provided updated forecasts and analysis at a cost of &#163;14,091.52. There was a consultation exercise with stakeholders in the form of a series of workshops that were hosted and run, on behalf of the Department, by the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Transport Safety. The total cost of these was &#163;6,360.32, which included the production of several think pieces and summaries following the events. 100 hard copies of the document were printed in-house. Due to the nature of the contract it is not possible to quantify the cost of an individual print job, but this was the least cost approach. The rest of the development work was undertaken by permanent members of staff as a part of their general road safety work. It is not possible to quantify this cost but as an illustration there was approximately one full time member of staff developing the document for nine months, with input from many others throughout the process.</p>

	<p pid="a.703W.5/2">I have had no discussions with railway operators about any proposed fare structure for HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.703W.5/3">The exact level and structure of fares on HS2 (London to West Midlands) would be determined closer to the time of opening of the scheme and would depend on a wide range of factors. The structure of regulation in the rail industry, the structure of franchises and the impact of competition from other rail operators (and indeed from air operators) could all affect the fares structures that might eventually be put in place on high speed trains. For the purposes of the economic case we have assumed that the level of fares on HS2 would be broadly similar to that currently in place on the West Coast Main Line.</p>

	<p pid="a.713W.0/1">The role of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is to conduct investigations into the types of accident or incident that the industry is obliged to notify us about, which are defined in the Schedules to the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.0/2">The event on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-04">4 June 2011</phrase> at Burnham occurred after the signaller at Slough had authorised a train to pass signal DM20 at danger. During the previous day, there had been signal failures caused by vandalism between Taplow and Burnham and work continued during the morning of the 4th to repair the problems which had led to some signals in the area being held at red.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.0/3">Operational procedures exist to cover such situations which may arise, for example because the signal itself is defective. When a signaller permits a driver to pass a signal at danger, the driver is instructed to proceed at caution and be prepared to stop short of any obstruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.0/4">On this occasion, the signaller incorrectly instructed the driver to pass the signal at danger. However, the driver correctly applied the Rule Book procedure and ensured that the train proceeded slowly and was able to stop well short of the train ahead, without the use of emergency braking. Consequently, while the trains where physically in relatively close proximity (circa 100 yards), they were not at risk of collision. Under these circumstances, the event was not notifiable to the RAIB according to the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.713W.0/5">However, it had been identified by the RAIB duty co-ordinator, from the daily log provided by Network Rail, as an incident where further information should be obtained. As a result, the RAIB decided that it was appropriate to leave the investigation to the industry, who themselves have a duty to investigate.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.0/1">Prevention of rail crimes is a matter for the British Transport police (BTP). Cable theft is a crime which hits the railway particularly hard and causes levels of disruption out of all proportion to the value of the material stolen. That is why the BTP is in the forefront of efforts to tackle the problem, working with, Network Rail, the train operators, other police forces, the scrap metal industry and others with an interest. In addition, I recently met with interested parties in the rail industry to discuss this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.0/2">Methods used to deter and catch the thieves include a dedicated BTP task force with increased patrols, intelligence led policing and additional dedicated officers; the use of the Network Rail helicopter, CCTV, forensic marking, trembler alarms and other devices to protect the cable; the introduction of new type of cable that is easier to identify and harder to steal and fast response teams to get trains on the move as quickly as possible following an incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.0/3">Information relating to cost of replacement cables and disruption to services is not held by the Department for Transport but by Network Rail. It is not possible to provide the information by area but the national figures for cable theft (May 2011) are detailed as follows:</p>

Delay per incident is decreasing as Network Rail teams become more efficient at locating and fixing the problem. <sup>(3)</sup> Compensation costs (known as schedule 8 costs) are paid to train and freight operators for the disruption caused by the delay. This is a substantial part of the cost to the industry of cable theft but does not include the cost of staff time to repair and replace the cable, replacement cable itself and the cost of mitigation measures such as security patrols and investment in new technology. The amount of compensation paid depends on the type of services delayed. <sup>(4)</sup> Total cost comprises schedule 8 (compensation to train operators), as well as the average cost of replacement cable; average maintenance cost of attending to the fault and average opportunity cost of diverting this labour from elsewhere.

Provisional arrangements have been made to ensure that any emergency cases are dealt with speedily.</p>

	<p pid="a.734W.9/1">The starting point for our consideration has been to examine, from first principles, which issues should attract public funding in the light of the financial constraints. In reaching our proposals, we have taken into account our domestic, European and international legal obligations, including the European Convention on Human Rights, and have also taken into account the importance of the issue at stake in the case, the litigant's ability to present their own case, the availability of alternative sources of funding and the availability of other routes of resolution. Our impact assessment shows that based on cases funded in 2009-10 we intend to retain approximately 390,000 acts of assistance within scope of the civil legal aid scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.2/1">For cases retained within the scope of the civil legal aid scheme, children and adults will have access to legal aid, subject to the usual tests of financial means and the merits of the case. We have announced our intention to retain legal aid for children for family proceedings. This will primarily be where the judge decides that it is in the best interests of the child for them to be separately represented from the other parties in the case (usually their parents).</p>
	<p pid="a.735W.2/2">For cases that will be excluded from the scope of the civil legal aid scheme, there will be a safety net in the form of our exceptional funding scheme. This will allow funding to be granted in individual excluded cases where failure to provide funding would amount to a breach of the individual's rights to legal aid under the Human Rights Act 1988 or EU law. In considering whether exceptional funding should be granted we will take into account the ability of the client to present their own case, the complexity of the issues, the importance of the issues at stake and all other relevant circumstances. In the vast majority of civil cases, parents will be bringing proceedings on behalf of their children as their litigation friend. Where children are acting without a litigation friend, this would be taken into consideration in deciding whether they had the ability to present their own case.</p>

The ongoing service charge for the Libra application has been &#163;10 million in each of the years 2009-10 and 2010-11, and for the current financial year it is &#163;11.4 million. Maintenance and development costs for the Libra infrastructure are subsumed under a contract which serves Crown and county courts, tribunals and HQ, as well as magistrates courts, and it is not possible to provide separate figures for these. To calculate the monetary value of the Libra project in today's prices for the whole of its life-cycle would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

When people apply for criminal injuries compensation they are asking CICA to assess what happened to them, decide whether they are eligible for compensation and, if so, how much. Injury descriptions, from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme's &#8216;tariff of injuries&#8217;, are used as the primary basis for paying compensation so they are only reliably recorded once CICA have assessed someone as eligible to receive the compensation payable for that injury. Similarly, since payments are based on injuries and not crimes, CICA does not hold figures for how many people apply following a specific crime or type of crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.744W.5/1">Universities and schools have learned a lot from the Aimhigher programme about &#8220;what works&#8221; in raising the aspirations of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Much of this knowledge is now embedded in the sector. However, while there has been some progress in improving access to higher education, overall this has masked a position where institutions and courses that offer the greatest lifetime benefits to their graduates have failed to reflect the wider social mix of our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.744W.5/2">We needed a new and different approach that builds on existing best practice, while developing it further. We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on institutions to widen participation; and greater Government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Last week the Office for Fair Access announced their decisions on Institutions&#8217; Access Agreements for 2012/13. The agreements contain institutions' plans for investment in activities to widen access through programmes such as summer schools, scholarships and fee waivers, estimated to reach more than &#163;600 million annually by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.751W.6/1">The Government do not have any evidence that rural businesses have any issues regarding access to finance beyond those identified for businesses generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/2">The British Bankers Association (BBA) Taskforce has made 17 commitments to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to support economic recovery. These commitments cover bank relationships with SME customers, access to finance and promoting understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/3">One of these was a commitment to enhance the cross-industry lending dataset by broadening the statistics available on lending to deprived areas and national and regional data on the provision of bank support to business start-ups. The first set of data is expected in autumn 2011. This information will help us to identify any regions or specific areas where there is a particular issue with accessing finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/4">The Government are also committed to supporting microfinance, to support loans to SMEs and start-ups in disadvantaged groups and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/5">Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) lend to enterprises that traditional lenders may consider too costly to serve or too risky (this might be for reasons including absence of a track record or lack of security to offer to the lender), but who have viable business plans and will have a positive impact on the local community. We have given the go-ahead (subject to due diligence) for a new &#163;30 million wholesale fund, funded through the regional growth fund, that will provide resources for CDFIs. This will be the largest fund of its kind for the sector ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/6">On a national level, the Government continue to support the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme&#8212;facilitating lending to viable SMEs who lack sufficient collateral or track record to access bank finance on standard commercial terms. To date, over &#163;1.5 billion of loans have been offered to SMEs through the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, which has been extended to 2014-15, with &#163;700 million available this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.6/7">As a result of talks with Government, the UK's five major banks have stated a capacity and willingness to lend &#163;190 billion of new credit to business in 2011, including new businesses. This includes &#163;76 billion of new lending to SMEs, which is a 15% increase on the amount lent in 2010.</p>

In addition, a number of employers were directly involved in a series of consultative events held earlier this year by DWP. Employers in a range of sectors were also involved in the recent test of the approach in the South Yorkshire and Merseyside regions and their input has been used to influence the model that will be implemented in England from August.</p>

The UK's proposals for creating the Green Investment Bank are subject to approval by the European Commission which must investigate the proposals and reach decisions on whether or not they are compatible with the provisions of the EU treaty as it relates to state aid. In the case of the Green Investment Bank, there may be state aid issues around the institution itself (because it is being capitalised with Government funds) as well as around some of the products it might deploy, which might be viewed as subsidies.</p>

	<p pid="a.759W.6/2">The recent HE White Paper noted that the Browne review had raised the possibility that in future when graduates are contributing more to the costs of their higher education at undergraduate level, they may be less likely to participate in postgraduate study and so recommended that trends in participation should be monitored carefully. Professor Sir Adrian Smith's Postgraduate Review Group reconvened in spring 2011 to advise on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.6/3">This group advised that Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) be asked to review participation in postgraduate study, following the changes to undergraduate funding, as part of a longer term assessment and evaluation of the impact of the funding changes. We will also ask HEFCE to consider as part of their review what additional data should be collected about postgraduates. We will revisit the issue of postgraduate funding as the new system beds in.</p>

	<p pid="a.759W.9/1">The White Paper &#8220;Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the system&#8221; (CM 8122) makes clear that we expect information requirements to apply to all providers as part of a single, transparent regulatory framework. The information that the Higher Education Statistics Agency is required to collect will depend on the type of degree awarding status or source of public funding a provider wishes to access. Precise information requirements for individual providers are a matter for the Higher Education Funding Council for England to determine through its regular review of provider agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.9/2">Proportionate information requirements are essential to ensure accountability to students and the public on quality, access, value for money and financial regularity.

	<p pid="a.763W.0/1">The matched funding was intended as a time limited scheme to incentivise universities to improve their fund raising efforts. We are fully funding the &#163;115 million required for the third and final year and expect the total Government contribution of &#163;200 million to have leveraged an additional &#163;400 million in donations to higher education institutions. The 2011 Budget also announced a number of measures that will encourage private giving in the higher education sector, including, a 10% cut in inheritance tax for estates leaving at least 10% to charities. This has been warmly welcomed by the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.763W.0/2">Additionally, higher education institutions' efforts to boost voluntary giving will be supported by a major profile-raising campaign for payroll giving and a philanthropy committee to consider honours for notable philanthropists, both announced in the recent Cabinet Office Giving White Paper.

However, it is possible to provide notional figures for the amount of grant distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for teaching and research apportioned by the number of learners (full-time equivalent) in each year. It should be noted that there have been some significant changes in HEFCE's funding methodology over this period which means that the following table should not be read as a time series. HEFCE funding is one source of income only and the figures provided do not include income from fees. In addition the data do not take account of other sources of public funding, for example from the NHS or the research councils. Crucially it should be borne in mind that institutions have a significant degree of freedom in terms of how its grant is distributed internally. It is for that reason that the figures given are notional and should not be read as the actual level of resource attached to any particular learner.</p>

	<p pid="a.765W.0/1">The Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group (IDMG) on Human Trafficking&#8212;which this Department is not represented on&#8212;co-ordinates work on trafficking across Government. The group brings together Ministers from key Departments to provide oversight and to strengthen our efforts to tackle human trafficking by ensuring that input and expertise from all Departments is shared.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/2">The IDMG last met on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February 2011</phrase>. The group will meet every six months with a meeting of officials in-between. The next meeting of the group will be held in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/3">The Government will shortly be publishing their strategy on human trafficking. The strategy will reiterate the UK's intention to take a comprehensive approach to combating trafficking&#8212;both by focusing on tackling traffickers and maintaining effective care for victims. It will also mark a greater focus on combating the organised crime groups behind this crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/4">The Government's approach will be based on four key principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/5">improved victim care arrangements;</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/6">enhancing our ability to act early, before the harm has reached the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/7">smarter, multi-agency action at the border; and</p>
	<p pid="a.765W.0/8">a more co-ordinated policing effort at home.</p>

	<p pid="a.766W.9/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.9/2" class="italic">Service leavers</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.9/3">The Government have provided endowment funding totalling &#163;5 million for the 'Be the Boss' initiative to provide recent ex-service personnel with funding, training and mentoring support to help them start and grow a business. 'Be the Boss' is delivered by the Royal British Legion and experienced partners across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland:</p>

	<p pid="a.766W.9/5" class="italic">Ethnic minority groups and women</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.9/6">The evidence with regard to entrepreneurial activity among black, Asian and other minority ethnic people is complex. Many minority ethnic groups are more enterprising than white ethnic groups and for other ethnic groups the barriers to enterprise are imperfectly understood. We know, for example that young black males have a higher rate of start-up than white ethnic groups but a much bigger gap between levels of ambition to start an enterprise and actual start-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.9/7">The evidence with regard to women and enterprise is also complex. While it remains the case that significantly fewer businesses are majority-led by women than by men (with only one in seven of all small and medium-sized business employers being women-led) and that rates of enterprise ambition are lower among women than among men (in 2009, 2.9% of women not already engaged in enterprise said they intended to start up in business in the next three years, compared to 6.1% of men), start-up data indicate that in the recent past women have often been starting up in business at a faster rate than men.</p>

The data presented for (b) other Masters excludes any studentships where a Masters has been funded as part of doctoral study. 2. The data presented under (c) other doctoral training were clinically trained students funded as Clinical Research Training Fellows. 3. All of the data presented above excludes studentships at MRC funded Centres. In 2008/09 there were a total of 226 students undergoing doctoral training in MRC funded Centres. This figure includes existing and new students. The MRC does not have data available for any other years. 4. Data for 2010/11 is not yet available. 5. The number of studentship places funded by the MRC is subject to annual review, hence there are no figures given in the second table. At present MRC have no plans to significantly increase or decrease funding for PhD or Research Masters Studentships. <i>Note on BBSRC data:</i> All Masters students are included in &#8220;Other Masters&#8221;. Separate figures are not available for Taught and Research Masters. PhD studentship numbers for the last three years are estimates from data based on returns provided by awarded institutions. <i>Note on EPSRC data:</i> EPSRC only supports Masters level training when it aligns with their broader strategy. For this reason, in 2009 they decided to focus most of their support in this area on activities which employ Masters&#8212;level training as a means of developing highly skilled doctoral&#8212;level researchers, rather than those which view the provision of Masters graduates as an end in itself. As a result, their current support for Masters level training is delivered via the Centres for Doctoral Training, Doctoral Training Accounts and some courses in Mathematical Sciences (e.g. Statistics). Not all of these routes provide students with a formal Masters qualification so it would be difficult to be definitive about numbers over a specific period. <i>Note on ESRC data:</i> ESRC funds a mix of 3 year PhD and 1 year + 3 years Masters + PhD awards. The total amount of these awards is included under section (c) PhD for the previous and next three years. ESRC are unable to disaggregate these figures further in the time available without use of disproportionate resources, however they estimate that 60% of the awards are of the 1+3 type. Under section (b) Other Masters, they have included a strategic initiative where we fund standalone Masters to build research capacity in Demography. <i>Note on NERC data:</i> NERC does not differentiate between MSc and MRes, so all places listed as other masters. <i>Notes:</i> 1. The year presented relates to an academic year i.e. 2008/09 relates to students starting in October 2008. 2. The data does not take in to account any funds leveraged by HEIs to increase the total number of studentship places available. 3. Figures for the next three years are estimates and hence the actual numbers may vary from those given above. If universities choose to support part&#8212;time students and fees&#8212;only students, and/or match research council funding with that from other sources, then more students will be able to be supported; PhD students may also be supported by larger Research Grants from some councils.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.770W.11/1">The Government see an important role for small and specialist institutions like conservatoires. In our December 2010 grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) we asked the Council to treat such institutions as a priority in allocating its teaching grant. We repeated that message in our recent White Paper and the letter we wrote to the Council on its publication. In that letter, we also asked the Council to consult on how best to implement our proposals to free up student number controls, to allow student choice to drive competition, quality and efficiency across the sector. Those proposals have two elements&#8212;the unrestrained recruitment of high achieving students, scoring the equivalent of AAB+ or above at A level; and the creation of a flexible margin of about 20,000 places.</p>
