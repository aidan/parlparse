	<p pid="a.2260W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June 2006</phrase> my right hon. Friends, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced new sustainable operations targets for the Government Estate. The new targets include a specific commitment on energy:</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.0/2" class="indent">Departments to increase their energy efficiency per m<sup>(2)</sup> by 15 per cent. by 2010, relative to 1999-2000 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.0/3" class="indent">Departments to increase their energy efficiency per m<sup>(2)</sup> by 30 per cent. by 2020, relative to 1999-2000 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.0/4">Government Departments are mandated within the new targets to source at least 10 per cent. of electricity from renewables (such as wind, wave, tidal, solar, thermal and photovoltaics (PV's)) by March 2008* and at least 15 per cent. of electricity from Combined Heat and Power (2010). These targets are a continuation of an existing operations targets, originally set in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.0/5">In 2005-06 (the latest data available) the Department sourced 66.47 per cent. of its electricity from renewable sources. 10 per cent. of our electricity was sourced from Good Quality Heat and Power during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.0/6">In order to improve further, the Department has commissioned a report to evaluate its plans for meeting this target across the estate and gain an estimate of their impact in terms of CO<sup>(2)</sup> reductions. We are also seeking specialist advice on additional common and site-specific measures which could be rolled out in order to further improve CO<sup>(2)</sup> reductions, for example setting up Energy Conservation Programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2260W.3/1">The report on the second review of the Government's Road Safety Strategy was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February</phrase>. That includes proposals for a fundamental review of the way the training of new drivers is approached so that it is more relevant to today's conditions and roads. The aim is to produce drivers who can drive safely in the broadest sense, not just know how to control a car, and how that can provide the basis for lifelong learning. There will be a consultation in due course. The review is available on-line at:</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/strategytargetsperformance/2ndreview/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/strategytargetsperformance/2ndreview/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.3/3">The last time the issue of a minimum learning period was considered was in the Department's consultation &quot;Introducing a structured approach to learning to drive&quot; of March 2002&mdash;available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2002/intsal/?version=1">www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2002/intsal/?version=1</a> .</p>
	<p pid="a.2260W.3/5">The decision in 2004 following that consultation was not to require a minimum learning period. Requiring such a period is no guarantee that it would be used as intended. In addition there was evidence that it was taking longer to learn to drive anyway following the strengthening of the driving test. Research has found that learners take on average 11 months of learning before passing the test.</p>

In addition, although the allocation is calculated using the numbers of students recorded on the Higher Education Statistics Agency record as being in receipt of the disabled students' allowance, the funding does not follow individual students. We do not hold information centrally about spend per student in terms of the capital and special initiative funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.2279W.3/1">In 2003, following a feasibility study, it was decided to extend the child care voucher provision for House staff to Members' staff. Provision of vouchers was thought to be the best solution to child care arrangements as it allows parents the choice of where best to have their children cared for. Take up of the scheme is currently 125 House staff and 55 Members' staff. There has been no more recent study of the child care scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.2281W.0/2">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the total impact of aviation on climate change to be 2-4 times that of its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions alone. The Government have consistently called for both the CO2 and non-CO2 impacts of aviation to be addressed to the extent that is possible. For an international industry, an international trading scheme is the best solution and we are therefore pursuing this in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). However, we recognise that the need for consensus among the participating states in ICAO means progress will take time, and until a truly global solution can be found, including aviation CO2 emissions in the EU ETS represents the best multilateral option available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2281W.0/3">We welcome the European Commission's proposal, published in December 2006, for legislation to include aviation in the EU ETS. The Government agrees that non-CO2 effects of aviation would be best dealt with by a separate, tailored instrument and looks forward to the Commission's proposal to address nitrous oxide (NOX) emissions by the end of 2008. We will continue to work with the Commission and other member states during negotiation of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2281W.0/4">The Government have also invested &pound;5 million in the opportunities for meeting the environmental challenge of growth in aviation (OMEGA) project. This will foster knowledge transfer from academic research centres to industry and help the aviation sector respond to the sustainability challenge. We welcome the industry's sustainable aviation strategy as the start of an ongoing process and look forward to deepening and strengthening of targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.2281W.3/1">The Government are incentivising the production and use of biofuels through a 20 pence per litre duty rate cut for biodiesel and bioethanol which has been extended to 2008-09. This has led to a growth in the sales of biofuel, with a total of around 30 million litres of biofuels sold a month in 2006. This represents a market share of over 0.5 per cent. of road fuel for 2006, compared to 0.24 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2281W.3/2">At present, the UK produces biofuels from recycled waste vegetable oil and animal fats. However, a number of companies are either building, or planning to build, biofuel processing plants which will use UK-grown crops (such as oilseed rape, sugar beet and wheat) as a feedstock. A new plant in Scotland will produce 50 million litres of biodiesel a year from animal fats and used cooking oil. A new plant on Teesside will produce up to 250 million litres of biodiesel a year from oilseed rape and other vegetable oils. A plant is being built in Norfolk that will produce biofuels from sugar beet and other feedstocks, and various other plants are at the planning stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.2281W.3/3">The Home-Grown Cereals Authority and the Renewable Energy Association have recently held a series of regional biofuel workshops across England aimed at helping to develop a UK biofuels industry. The workshops covered Government policy, local activities and opportunities for farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2281W.3/4">Farmers can also grow biofuel crops on set-aside land, or claim the &euro;45 per hectare EU energy aid payment in respect of crops grown on non set-aside land, and still claim the EU Single Payment. The development of second generation biofuels should offer opportunities in the future to use feedstocks such as grasses and woody biomass.</p>

	<p pid="a.2283W.3/1">The Department's &quot;Assessment of Energy Efficiency Commitment 2002-05 Carbon, Energy and Cost Savings&quot; (March 2006), estimated the costs to energy suppliers of meeting their energy efficiency obligations at around &pound;360 million or about &pound;3.20 per customer per fuel per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2283W.3/2">We do not anticipate that there are any recurring costs for energy suppliers (other than complying with subsequent obligations). This delivered energy-saving measures to customers with overall cost-effectiveness of about &pound;300 per tonne of carbon saved. On average, the costs will be more than outweighed by the benefits to householders in terms of reduced fuel bills or increased comfort from the installation of energy efficiency measures. The regulator, Ofgem, estimated its administrative costs for the three year programme at &pound;1 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.2284W.2/1">DEFRA has lead responsibility for national preparedness for flooding in England and is working, as part of the Cabinet Office-led Capabilities Programme, to build the capability of all key players. Regionally, the lead planning role falls to the Government Offices working with the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and emergency services. The EA's role involves the forecasting and warning of potential flooding from rivers and the sea, and the police will lead the response during an actual emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2284W.2/2">I understand that Eastbourne is at risk from both rivers and the sea, although coastal flooding poses the greatest threat. In 1996, an inter-agency Coastal Flood Evacuation plan was drawn up to deal with the threat of flooding to the vulnerable coastline at Pevensey Bay, Normans Bay and Eastbourne, covering approximately 15,000 properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.2284W.2/3">Lessons learned from an evacuation of Pevensey in 1999 led to production of the Pevensey Bay Flood Plan in 2000 which covers the areas of Normans Bay, Westham, Langney and parts of Eastbourne. The plan outlines inter-agency responsibilities, activation and notification processes for evacuation and also the means of providing support and advice for the community, especially more vulnerable members.</p>
	<p pid="a.2284W.2/4">All category one responders, as defined by the Civil Contingencies Act, contributed to the Plan, in particular the EA, East Sussex county council and Eastbourne borough council. The Plan is reviewed and exercised every three years with lessons learned (for example, flooding incidents in 1999 and 2000) incorporated as they arise. It also covers river flooding from Langney Haven and can be applied to surface water flooding caused by intense storms, such as those which affected the Eastbourne Arndale shopping centre on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-07">7 August 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.2285W.0/1">A compliance cost assessment, carried out before the groundwater regulations were introduced, estimated that the recurring cost per annum for a typical farmer disposing of used sheep dip to land would be in the range of &pound;124.50 to &pound;871.50. The assessment also estimated the non-recurring cost to be &pound;711.50 to &pound;1,528.50. In practice, the costs have been much lower&mdash;the typical annual cost is currently &pound;137.92 and the typical one-off cost is &pound;113. The cost to the Environment Agency of authorising discharges under the regulations is approximately &pound;1.33 million per annum which is funded by charges to authorisation holders. No costs are available for the more general pollution prevention activity required under the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.0/2">The regulations have helped to raise awareness of the importance of protecting groundwater and have introduced controls over activities most likely to pollute it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.0/3">DEFRA is committed to regulating better and has a target of a 25 per cent. reduction in administrative burdens. The implementation of a more risk-based approach to regulation, in conjunction with tougher penalties combined with improved effectiveness via focus on outcomes and simplification where possible, is fully consistent with this.</p>

	<p pid="a.2286W.6/1">At all stages the Attorney-General was acting in his public interest capacity entirely independently of Government, which is a long-standing and well-established part of his role. His purpose was to protect the administration of justice. In particular, he acted at the request of the Metropolitan Police given their concerns that disclosure of certain information would impede their ongoing inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/2">There is of course a legitimate public interest in freedom of the press. But this must sometimes be balanced against the strong public interest in ensuring that crime is properly investigated and (where a trial takes place) that any trial is fair. That balance must be struck in accordance with the law and, ultimately, by the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/3">The strict liability rule under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 accordingly prevents publications which give rise to a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the course of justice. The rule applies once there has been an arrest. In previous cases the Attorney has acted under the 1981 Act to restrain publications where police investigations are under way and before charges have been brought. For example in 2004 he obtained an injunction to prevent the publication of photographs of suspects arrested in a counter-terrorism investigation, although no charges had been brought at that stage. Also in 2004 the Attorney-General took action against Express Newspapers for publishing the identities of footballers accused of rape. The action was successful and resulted in a fine of &pound;60,000 plus costs. In the event the police investigation itself did not lead to a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/4">In the current honours case the sequence of events was as follows. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">Friday 2 March</phrase>, at the request of and in full cooperation with the police, the Attorney-General sought an injunction against the BBC to prevent the disclosure of certain information. After full argument, in court, Mr. Justice Wilkie granted the injunction. The judge ordered that the terms of the injunction were to be kept confidential. There was no argument (as reported in some places) by the Attorney-General that the BBC should be prevented from reporting the 'fact' that an injunction had been granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/5">Over the weekend, <i> The Sun</i> and <i> The Mail on Sunday</i> approached the Attorney-General's Office in relation to specific material which they proposed to publish about this case. In view of police concerns that publication would impede their investigation, those newspapers agreed voluntarily not to publish that material.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">Monday 5 March</phrase> the terms of the injunction against the BBC were varied to allow the BBC to report certain matters that had appeared in the newspapers over the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/7">Later on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March</phrase> <i> The Guardian</i> approached the Attorney-General's Office about a story it proposed to publish the following day. <i> The Guardian</i> were informed that, in the police's view, publication of the proposed material would again potentially undermine their investigation. However <i> The Guardian</i> refused to undertake not to publish. Accordingly lawyers acting for the Attorney-General's office, at the request of the police, sought an injunction to restrain publication of the material. Mrs. Justice Swift declined to grant such an injunction, on the grounds that during the hearing of the application itself the newspapers were printed and were being distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/8">In the light of <i> The Guardian</i> story on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March</phrase>, the police considered that it was not tenable or appropriate for them to seek to maintain the injunction against the BBC or the undertakings obtained from the other newspapers. Accordingly, at a hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March</phrase> the police and the Attorney-General agreed to the lifting of the original injunction against the BBC.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/9">The police remain concerned that the reporting of certain aspects of this information could undermine the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2286W.6/10">In acting to restrain the disclosure of particular material, and in agreeing to the lifting of the injunction, the Attorney-General should not be taken to have indicated or confirmed the accuracy of any aspect of that material.</p>

In England, the death rate (per 100,000 population standardised to the European standard population) from accidents was 16.5 per 100,000 European standard population in 1997 and 15.9 per 100,000 European standard population in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.2288W.3/1">The number of young people receiving treatment as a result of alcohol misuse is a matter for concern. The Government are determined to reduce the harm caused by alcohol to those under 18 and to young people generally and is committed to educating young people, for example through the Know Your Limits campaign, the Healthy Schools Programme and the Teen Life Check, on the very real harm it causes. It is vital that we make children and young people aware of sensible drinking messages. This will be an important issue for consideration when the alcohol harm reduction strategy is reviewed during 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.2292W.2/1">When the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published their technology appraisal on liquid based cytology (LBC) in October 2003, we estimated that it would take five years for full implementation across the national health service as all staff who take and read cervical screening samples have to be retrained in the new technique.</p>
	<p pid="a.2292W.2/2">By the end of March 2007, 83 per cent. of laboratories in England will have converted to LBC. The rate of inadequate tests (where the cervical sample cannot be read and analysed) in England fell from 9 per cent. in 2004-05 to 7.2 per cent. in 2005-06 as a direct result of the ongoing roll-out of LBC. We would expect these to fall to between one and 2 per cent. with full implementation. This will mean that around 300,000 women a year will not have to go through the anxiety and discomfort of being retested, and the NHS will not have to use resources to undertake these tests.</p>

	<p pid="a.2303W.2/1">This is a local matter. However, I understand that the temporary suspension was due to system process errors that were discovered during a routine audit by the quality assurance service. The audit flagged up that women were not invited for further assessments following their mammogram. All the women affected received a normal mammogram. However, the women had mentioned other possible symptoms during their appointment and guidelines specify that further assessment should take place. All these women have been offered appointments for further assessment either from the unit or via their general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/2">The service was temporarily suspended just before Christmas and the trust, commissioners and staff are working hard to have the new systems and protocols in place so that the breast screening service can starting inviting women back for routine screening in April.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/3">Approximately 3,500 women are normally seen by the service and the trust estimates that approximately 10,000 women would have been affected by the suspension of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/4">The trust with their partner primary care trusts (PCTs) have an action plan in place for the recommencement of screening and to clear the backlog.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/5">The unit is currently developing a full plan for the recommencement of screening services. Once this is complete they will be able to advise on estimates. It will also depend on whether arrangements can be made to screen women at other sites across London and the surrounding area. Women who have been waiting longest will be seen on a priority basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/6">Staff in the breast screening service are supporting an external independent audit, reviewing protocols and taking part in staff training to ensure new procedures are embedded into the service. When the unit does re-open all cases will be audited by the quality assurance service to ensure that systems are working properly and that these will continue until the trust is sure that they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.2303W.2/7">The suspension of the service was not in any way due to financial reasons. The additional financial costs for resuming the service will depend on the outcome and recommendations of the quality assurance review. It is therefore not possible to make an estimate of the costs at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.2307W.6/1">Military personnel operating in Iraq and Afghanistan are subjected to extreme temperatures, both in armoured vehicles and in their day-to-day duties, and commanders on the ground constantly review the necessity of the tasks they face in order to reduce the exposure of troops.</p>
	<p pid="a.2307W.6/2">Various steps are taken to prevent heat related illnesses. Personnel undertake an acclimatisation programme as part of their reception, staging and onward integration (RSOI) training which commences at the beginning of an operational tour and generally lasts for five days. Commanders are provided with heat illness prevention instructions in order to monitor heat stress. Temperature and humidity levels are forecast daily as part of standard operating procedures (SOPs) thereby allowing commanders to schedule workloads accordingly. Wherever operationally feasible air conditioning is used in accommodation, business offices, facilities such as welfare and catering and medical facilities in the main camps in operational theatres, although clearly not possible in all operational areas. Canteen areas have large fridges which are stocked with a plentiful supply of cold water.</p>
	<p pid="a.2307W.6/3">It is also important that air conditioning does not hinder acclimatisation. Research conducted by the Institute of Naval Medicine (INM), which has been reflected in permanent joint headquarters (PJHQ) SOPs, recommends that acclimatisation will be achieved and maintained if personnel are exposed to two hours of heat per day, undertaking some physical activity sufficient to cause sweating.</p>
	<p pid="a.2307W.6/4">Advice given to officers, soldiers, trainers and medics on the treatment of heat and cold injury is contained within JSP 539 (&quot;Climatic Injuries in the Armed Forces: Prevention and Treatment&quot;). Additionally, PJHQ issues advice relevant to individual theatres of operation. A copy of the JSP 539 is in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2307W.6/5">Since 2003, coroners' inquests to date have found that one reservist private, one regular army corporal and one RAF senior aircraftsman have died as a result of heat-related conditions while serving in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.2307W.6/6">In Iraq during the 34 month period from September 2004 to July 2006, 284 service personnel were recorded with a complaint of climatic injury&mdash;all heat related&mdash;of whom 80 needed to be admitted to a field hospital or otherwise bedded down. In Iraq, the temperature and humidity can change very quickly, increasing the likelihood of sudden increased instances of heat illness. In Afghanistan during the four month period from April to July 2006, PJHQ recorded 33 cases of climatic injury&mdash;all likely to be heat related, of whom 16 needed to be bedded down.</p>

	<p pid="a.2317W.8/1">The Foresight Energy Panel ran from 1994-99, and was succeeded by the Energy and Natural Environment Panel (1999-2002). These panels reported in 1996 and 2000 respectively. None of their recommendations refer to the development of low-carbon communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/2">The texts of the two Panels' recommendations are given below for information.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/3" class="italic"> Energy and Natural Environment Foresight Panel, 2000<sup>(<i> 1</i>)</sup> &mdash;Recommendations</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/4">The consultation document and responses to it have collectively begun to highlight key opportunities and challenges; and also to identify some of the main areas for the improved use of &quot;know-how&quot; through R and D. Our consultations suggest that there is a general consensus of view at the very broad-brush level.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/5">Successful innovation and application will be focused and driven forward by the knowledge, enthusiasm and interests of those developing research and the entrepreneurial flair of those who wish to apply it either in public policy or through industrial or private sector activity and involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/6">Our recommendations are designed to provide a positive framework in which this can happen and to overcome some of the difficulties outlined above. In addition we welcome the commitment to continued support for fundamental science and training given in the Government's White Paper &quot;Excellence and Opportunity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/7">We have mapped out our stepping stones for the way ahead. We recognise that there needs to be a strategic framework that should encompass:</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/8" class="indent">Recognition of the role of the regulator in creating the appropriate balanced market to encourage developments and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/9" class="indent">Ensuring that energy and natural environment policies encourage this process in the UK and in wider international protocols and contexts.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/10" class="indent">Engagement with all stakeholders including the public at large in the understanding of the steps that need to be taken and their role within this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/11" class="indent">A process to sponsor the necessary developments to meet the needs to overcome the barriers that have been a problem in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/12">We see the way to begin to realise these aims is to establish a set of &quot;sustainability R and D&quot; programmes with the task of &quot;championing&quot; key areas to ensure a sustainable future, each working throughout the disciplines and sectors and funding high profile programmes that are interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral. These will then form themes around which other work and existing initiatives can be co-ordinated and brigaded so that a critical mass of UK work can be seen, identified with and form a context for dialogue and partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/13">This will create a continuing framework through which firms, universities and research institutes, government, investors, regulators and others can effectively collaborate in key market/development areas. Within this framework interests and &quot;know how&quot; (from all relevant disciplines and sectors) can be brought together on a limited number of major themes, around which others can cluster. It will also provide the framework within which the relevant, existing but rather separate programmes can communicate and more effectively develop a community of interest, common themes and corps of experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/14">We see this being achieved by:</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/15" class="indent">Establishment of a &quot;UK Sustainable Technologies Development Programme&quot; with participation from the Research Councils, the private sector and government.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/16">An appropriate source of funding would be the climate change levy, building on the proposals of the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/17">Government departments, agencies and the Research Councils taking the initiative within this framework by setting up a limited number of major sub-programmes which would:</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/18" class="indent">Have major funding derived from the climate change levy or elsewhere. Fund R and D through research initiatives and joint programmes with private sector participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/19" class="indent">Where relevant, develop and fund joint programmes with universities and firms in other countries where major opportunities for application exist. Engage the regulatory framework in this process to ensure it is aligned with the programmes. (Both UK and, where possible international arrangements).</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/20" class="indent">Co-ordinate existing initiatives to support these major programmes. Provide co-ordination and exchange of results across the funding bodies and programmes through dedicated web sites, newsletters and other networking.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/21">We highlight a number of areas where we consider R and D to be priorities in Annex A, but we particularly recommend sub-programmes with the following themes:</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/22" class="indent">Strategies and technologies for the water stressed world.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/23" class="indent">Low and close-to-zero emission power generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/24" class="indent">Achieving step changes in resource efficiency in products, their production and use.</p>

	<p pid="a.2317W.8/26" class="italic"> Energy Foresight Panel, 1996<sup>(<i> 2</i>)</sup> &mdash;Recommendations</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/27">The nine high priority opportunities for energy products and services are:</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/28" class="indent">High hit-rate exploration techniques for oil and gas, to increase accuracy of field identification through improved acquisition, integration, analysis and interpretation of geophysical data.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/29" class="indent">Increased oil and gas yields from hydrocarbon reservoirs, by more accurate characterisation and improved simulation, better drive and production technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/30" class="indent">Decommissioning of redundant nuclear facilities, involving the safe and economic disposal of redundant facilities, minimising non-recyclable waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/31" class="indent">Photovoltaic power generation at competitive cost, via development of thin film materials suitable for low cost production and installation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/32" class="indent">&quot;Clean Coal&quot; power generation, involving demonstration of new technologies in three main areas&mdash;stack-gas cleaning, coal combustion and gasification.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/33" class="indent">Combined cycle units for gas power generation, requiring improvements in components to increase the combined-cycle efficiency to 60 per cent. with natural gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/34" class="indent">Low emission power units for transport, encompassing a range of technologies based on engine design but including fuel handling and fuel quality sensors.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/35" class="indent">Greater efficiency, energy-intensive industrial processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2317W.8/36" class="indent">Greater energy-efficient buildings from both build and retrofit, including better adaptation to human behaviour as well as a range of new technologies.</p>

	<p pid="a.2320W.2/2">Private equity companies in the UK are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority. This includes a close and continuous supervisory relationship with 14 of the biggest private equity and venture capital managers; risk mitigation programmes; frequent dialogue with market participants on private equity sector issues; and including private equity firms in thematic reviews on market issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.2320W.2/3">In addition the Government welcomes the announcement last week that Sir David Walker will chair an independent working party to develop a voluntary comply-or-explain code to improve the private equity industry's transparency and level of disclosures for large companies in these areas. This initiative has received wide support across the industry, demonstrating a commitment to make this happen, and also a desire to meet the legitimate concerns of interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.2320W.2/4">By increasing the quality and timeliness of disclosures, the code has the potential both to improve the engagement of the private equity industry with stakeholders, and improve its performance. The Government will watch developments very closely.</p>

Further policing powers are derived from the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2000.

	<p pid="a.2331W.0/1">The costs of the coroners service are met by the relevant local authority and, in respect of the majority of coroner's officers, the local police force. It will therefore be for these funding authorities to ensure that their coroner service is adequately resourced for the next three years. However, once the proposed reforms are implemented, the new Chief Coroner will introduce national standards which will address, among other matters, the need for greater consistency in resource provision to coroner areas.</p>

This followed recommendations in two independent reviews, including the Shipman Inquiry. The pilot identified appreciable benefits in the approach, for example in improving the accuracy of the causes of death recorded, but noted that there were significant practical and logistical issues to be overcome for the system to be rolled out more widely. In particular, it identified the strong likelihood that there would be delays in releasing bodies for funerals. The outcome of the pilot contributed to the Government's decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.2333W.7/5" class="indent">The information requested is included in the table below. Robust management information is not available for 2001-02. During 2005-06 the Face-to-Face Service was replaced by the Client Interviewing Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2333W.7/6" class="indent">The number of face-to-face meetings has fallen in recent years both due to a falling client demand for this service and to improve efficiency within the Agency. Demand for the face-to-face service has declined due to a greater reliance by Agency clients on telephony and internet services. Recent improvements to the Agency's telephony, 97% of calls are now answered from the queue, and calls are answered within 27 seconds, and improved internet access, including the ability to apply for Maintenance Direct online, has likely reduced this demand further. Agency people have been redeployed from Face-to-Face roles to focus on essential work such as reducing the number of uncleared cases, improving client service, and increasing compliance among non-resident parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.2333W.7/7" class="indent">The Face-to-Face Service provided by the Agency underwent substantial reforms in its transition to the Client Interview Service in September 2005. The duties of the Face-to-Face Service were reallocated within the Agency in order to promote specialisation and professionalism in the service offered. The client Interview Service now focuses solely on facilitative client service interviews; these include supporting clients with communication difficulties or disabilities, assisting complaint resolution ad resolving conflicts in information supplied by Agency clients. There were around 3,800 such interviews between September 2005 and March 2006. Other elements of the previous Face-to-Face Service, including compliance inspection and court presentations, are now being carried out by experts within the Enforcement directorate.</p>

To preserve the confidentiality of discussion, full minutes of such meetings are not taken. Specific action points are fed back, but these are not published as to do so could harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion.</p>

	<p pid="a.2335W.9/1">The Gender Impact of Pension Reform assumed that women will be automatically enrolled into personal accounts if they are not enrolled into an exempt work-based pension scheme and if they meet the criteria of being aged between 22 and state pension age and earning above approximately &pound;5,000 per year. The numbers were calculated using data on female employment, earnings and pension membership from the Labour Force Survey, the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the Employers' Pension Provision Survey and the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.2335W.9/2">Of the women automatically enrolled into personal accounts, it was assumed that between 20 and 50 per cent. would opt out, with a central opt-out rate of around a third (the same percentages as for men who are automatically enrolled). As set out in some detail in the regulatory impact assessment published alongside the White Paper 'Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system' (May 2006) the assumption on opt-out rates draws on evidence from a number of sources and reflects the inherent uncertainty regarding individuals' responses to personal accounts.</p>
