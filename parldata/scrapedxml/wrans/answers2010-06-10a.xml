This excludes occasions where Chinooks have incurred damage that can be repaired either in theatre or in the UK. A near miss has been taken to be an air proximity hazard, the formal definition of which is an incident in which, in the opinion of a pilot or controller, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speeds have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved was or may have been compromised.</p>

	<p pid="a.206W.8/1">The report published by HS2 Ltd in March 2010 argued that the most cost efficient way of funding the route elements of a high speed rail network would be through the public purse. However, the Government will explore all options for funding the project. In particular, we will explore the possibility that other very substantial elements-such as stations, interchanges and rolling stock-could be funded in part or in whole by the private sector or other third parties. At this early stage, it is not possible to provide breakdowns.</p>

Work on MND is being taken forward in the National Service Framework for Long-Term Conditions (NSF).

	<p pid="a.221W.2/2">The NSF does not look at individual neurological conditions but at elements of service provision that are common to different conditions.

	<p pid="a.227W.2/1">Our counter-narcotics work with Colombia is an integral part of the Government's drugs strategy. The UK Threat Assessment (UKTA) for 2009-10 estimated that around 65% of global cocaine production and distribution originates from Colombia or in the border areas of Venezuela and Ecuador. Peru and Bolivia account for the remaining 30 to 35%. Venezuela and Brazil, as well as Caribbean and West African states, are also identified as trafficking routes to the UK and the rest of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.227W.2/2">In Colombia, the UK Government have supported projects totalling &#163;1.1 million through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and works with other countries in information sharing, raising policing and law-enforcement standards and promoting best practice among Colombian law-enforcement partners. This has contributed to the arrest of high profile drugs traffickers, the dismantling of organised crime networks and the seizure of many tonnes of cocaine destined for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.227W.2/3">In Peru, we work closely with Peruvian partners to support their efforts to tackle the threat that cocaine poses to the UK and Europe. We invest in a range of UNODC implemented capacity building projects focusing on the areas of forensics, law enforcement, and anti-money laundering work, totalling approximately &#163;180,000 in FY 2009-10. The UK has also supported Peru's introduction of its 'FRANCO' helpline and website for young people, which is based on the UK's 'Talk to FRANK' campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.227W.2/4">Venezuela is used as a trafficking route to the UK and the rest of Europe. There is good operational co-operation between Venezuela and UK law enforcement agencies and we have supported several initiatives in information sharing, the sharing of best practice and co-operation on seizures and arrests. This has resulted in disruption to organised crime networks and the seizure of cocaine destined for European/UK markets. The recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Venezuela demonstrates the Government's commitment to counter narcotics work in Venezuela.</p>

	<p pid="a.228W.3/1">Once a police authority has carried out its statutory responsibility of calculating its budget requirement and its basic amount of council tax for a financial year, legislation allows the authority to make substitute calculations provided that it does not increase the level of its budget requirement or basic amount of council tax. Where substitute calculations are made, the authority may issue a new precept. The relevant provisions are sections 43 to 49 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.</p>
	<p pid="a.228W.3/2">Decisions about the level of precept are a matter for individual police authorities.

	<p pid="a.230W.12/1">The &quot;Learning Revolution&quot; White Paper was published by the previous Government. We now have a new Government and a fresh chance to reassess the principles that underpin public policy in order to build a better society founded on social mobility, social justice and social cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.12/2">I have long been a believer in the power of adult and community learning and the contribution it makes to the development of stronger, healthier and more confident communities. These views are shared by my Secretary of State and by the Prime Minister. We want everyone to have the chance to be inspired by learning, so that their lives, their families and their communities can benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.12/3">We want people to rise as high as their talents and ambitions will take them. We will achieve this by reducing bureaucracy, by putting an end to the previous preoccupation with targets and by making adult and community learning universally available, targeting public support for disadvantaged areas and those people who have had least opportunity to learn in the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.231W.6/1">UK Trade and Investment Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO) helps UK defence and security companies succeed internationally. In 2008 the value of new orders for the sale of goods and services by UK defence exporters to overseas Governments was &#163;4.3 billion. Security exports were estimated at &#163;1.4 billion in 2008/09.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.6/2">To qualify for UKTI and UKTI DSO trade services, a business must be able to demonstrate that it has an active UK trading address. There may also be circumstances in which it is judged that there is a benefit to the UK economy in offering UKTI trade services to a foreign owned business overseas. This is most likely to apply in the case of an overseas-based business with concrete plans to establish in the UK. UKTI and UKTI DSO however retain discretion on who can access its services.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.6/3">UKTI DSO maintains close dialogue with the rest of Government to ensure it is aware of nations of concern, including those where human rights considerations may apply. DSO also keeps informed about changes in export control regulation and reminds companies about the requirement for export licences under the Export Control Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.6/4">All applications for export licences for military equipment are assessed by BIS's Export Control Organisation (ECO) against the Consolidated Criteria, which require the Government to assess the recipient country's attitude towards relevant principles established by international human rights instruments. The Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. The ECO is entirely separate from UKTI DSO, and DSO is not involved in assessing licence applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.6/5">The operational cost for UKTI DSO for financial year 2008/09 was &#163;14.6 million.</p>

To this end, an initial review was conducted of those areas of expenditure where the link between project activities and poverty reduction in the developing world was least demonstrated, in this context, four projects within the Development Awareness Fund (DAF), and a festivals outreach project were identified for termination. An estimate of funds saved from the termination of these projects is approximately &#163;590,000. These funds will be redirected to front line poverty reduction in developing countries.</p>
