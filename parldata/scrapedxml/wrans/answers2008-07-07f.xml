	<p pid="f.1146W.2/1">A new food supply contract was let in October 2006. This contract provides for the supply of food to UK armed forces personnel for &quot;in barracks&quot; feeding in UK and Germany (for personnel not fed under the Pay As You Dine programme) and to UK armed forces personnel serving on operations and some overseas exercises. Through this contract, approximately 65 per cent. of food has been sourced from British suppliers. The remaining 35 per cent. of food is sourced from a number of worldwide countries although these vary through the year due to seasonality, availability or market forces.</p>

	<p pid="f.1156W.8/1">Snatch Land Rovers continue to form an important part of the overall vehicle fleet available to our forces in Afghanistan. Commanders on the ground select the optimum vehicle type for a particular task, weighing up the need for force protection, capacity, mobility, fire power and profile. Snatch will therefore tend to be favoured for tasking in relatively low threat areas for tasks requiring high levels of mobility and a high capacity to transport dismounted troops.</p>

	<p pid="f.1174W.8/1">Future Gazelle flying activity has been reviewed in successive departmental planning rounds. Under current planning assumptions the out of service date for the Gazelle is 2012; however there will be a significant reduction in Gazelle flying by 2010. The Gazelle is an older aircraft type with limited capability and is not deployed on combat roles. This decision will therefore have no impact on deployed military capability. Where there is an enduring requirement for the capability currently provided by Gazelle we are exploring arrangements based on leased aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="f.1174W.8/2">The decision to bring forward the Gazelle out of service date will lead to the disbandment of 7 Regiment Army Air Corps (Volunteers) (7 Regt AAC(V)) by <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>. 7 Regt AAC(V) is currently based at Netheravon with a flight each at Shawbury and leuchars.

Low flying is recorded in terms of the number of hours flown rather than the number of sorties, broken down by fixed or rotary winged aircraft rather than fast jets specifically; and the information is held for the low flying area in which the activity is booked. The Angus constituency lies within Low Flying Area 14, which covers the whole of Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde region.

	<p pid="f.1179W.2/1">Available figures indicate that around 360 members of the Territorial Army have been mobilised three or more times since 1999. Given the safeguards built in to the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which limits the time for which reservists may be mobilised, it is very likely that the majority of these soldiers were mobilised for periods of less than the normal operational tour of six months. It is common for medical reservists to be mobilised for operational tours of three months or less, enabling them to be mobilised several times without exceeding the limits placed in the Reserve Forces Act.</p>

	<p pid="f.1202W.13/1">The regional development agencies (RDAs) have been responsible for managing the delivery of the social and economic elements of the Rural Development Programme for England since the programme was formally launched at the beginning of 2008. DEFRA has agreed with RDAs that delivery of the socio-economic measures of the RDPE will take a more strategic approach and will include a significant element of procured or commissioned activity, rather than solely being delivered by an individual application led approach. In addition, some RDPE investment will be through the bottom-up Leader approach. Under Leader Local Action Groups (LAGs) will be allocated individual budgets to fund projects that are part of an agreed Local Development Strategy. The process of agreeing and allocating funds to LAGs is currently under way across regions.</p>

	<p pid="f.1205W.3/1">The right of Governments to issue permits for the killing of whales for scientific purposes is enshrined in Article VIII of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), the parent treaty of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). We doubt that the authors of the ICRW envisaged that parties would seek to conduct research on the scale now practised by Japan, but whether Japan's activities in this regard can be said to constitute an abuse of the rights granted by Article VIII of the ICRW is a matter which only the courts could determine&mdash;were anyone prepared to stand the cost of asking.</p>
	<p pid="f.1205W.3/2">Whether or not 'scientific' whaling is legal, we certainly regard it as undesirable since it undermines the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling and contributes little or nothing to our knowledge of the size and structure of whale populations.</p>
	<p pid="f.1205W.3/3">The UK takes every appropriate opportunity to make its opposition to Japan's 'scientific' whaling operations clear to the Japanese Government. We have participated in a number of high level diplomatic protests in recent years and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-08">8 January</phrase> this year I called in officials from the Japanese embassy in London to express the UK's outrage over Japan's whaling activities. At this year's IWC meeting in June the UK Commissioner to the IWC made it clear that we saw no justification for lethal scientific research on whales and called for Special Permit whaling to be brought within IWC control and phased out as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="f.1213W.0/1">The UK provides debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) under the internationally agreed frameworks. Excellent progress has been made, with 33 countries benefiting from debt relief under HIPC; of these 23 have received 100 per cent. irrevocable debt cancellation, under the multilateral debt relief initiative. To qualify, countries must demonstrate a commitment to macro-economic stability and poverty reduction, and have cleared any arrears to the international financial institutions. The UK exceeds our obligations under the HIPC Initiative, providing 100 per cent. debt relief on bilateral debts.</p>
	<p pid="f.1213W.0/2">The UK supports HIPC countries to achieve debt relief. We have consistently argued for the World Bank and IMF to apply the HIPC criteria flexibly, taking account of a country's circumstances. For instance, whether it is emerging from conflict. We are the second largest donor towards the multilateral costs of HIPC debt relief, enabling countries to receive their debt relief in a timely way. We have contributed our full share to MDRI and made substantial contributions towards clearing arrears of HIPCs, most recently Liberia. Many of the HIPCs that have yet to qualify for debt relief are affected by conflict or poor governance.</p>

Half of our support reaches countries through international agencies including UNAIDS, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank and the European Commission.

	<p pid="f.1221W.0/1">Department of Health (DH) and the Department for International Development discussed this topic extensively in relation to the Government's response to Lord Crisp's report, &quot;Global Health Partnerships: The UK contribution to health in developing countries&quot;. I have had meetings with Lord Crisp, my DH counterpart Dawn Primarolo, and the Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET), a key stakeholder. DFID and DH value long-term sustainable partnerships in the health sector, and consider there are significant opportunities for healthcare professionals to participate in international development.</p>
	<p pid="f.1221W.0/2">As outlined in the Government response to Lord Crisp's report, DH is producing a framework for international development; this will update their &quot;International Humanitarian and Health Work: Toolkit to support good practice&quot; and be a guide for those considering developing country work. DFID and DH also commissioned an independent evaluation of links programmes between UK and developing country health organisations to identify what has worked well and good practice lessons. This will help inform the design of (i) a new funding scheme for links, and (ii) a Links Centre, which will include information for individuals wishing to volunteer for humanitarian work.</p>
	<p pid="f.1221W.0/3">As this work is implemented both departments continue discussions with key stakeholders. For example, officials from both DFID and DH participated in the recent twentieth anniversary national health links conference organised by THET.</p>

	<p pid="f.1224W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is the matter for the chief executive. He will write to my right hon. Friend with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-20">7July 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate his Department has made of the number of Child Support Agency cases in arrears that will go uncollected in the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/5" class="indent">Most child support cases accrue debt once an assessment or calculation has been carried out as the effective date of the assessment or calculation is often backdated and debt accrues from the effective date. It is not possible to provide an estimate of how many of these cases will not have the debt collected in the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/6" class="indent">The Agency takes the collection of outstanding debt very seriously. The focus of the final year of the Operational Improvement Plan continues to be enforcement and compliance, as the Agency strives to increase its debt collection and get more money for more children. Every effort is made to ensure the non-resident parents fulfil their financial responsibility to their children.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/7" class="indent">The Agency collected or arranged more than &pound;1 billion in maintenance in the twelve months to March 2008, of which &pound;126m was arrears. This is almost twice the &pound;68 million of arrears collected in the year to March 2005 before the full introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>
	<p pid="f.1224W.2/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="f.1235W.2/1">Work is the best route out of poverty. For example, children in working households are much less likely to be in poverty than those living in households where no one is working. The Government have made considerable progress in tackling worklessness through national back to work programmes such as new deal as well as local initiatives like the London Childcare Affordability Pilots.</p>

The new deal has helped into work over 5,000 people in the constituency, 1,000 of whom have been helped by the new deal for lone parents. The proportion of children living in families dependent on out of work benefits has fallen by 2.4 percentage points from 45.4 per cent. in 2004 to 43 per cent. in 2007.

This figure does not therefore equate to numbers of asylum applicants. At the end of November 2007, our total conclusions stand at around 52,000 cases. We have made good progress and remain committed and on track to conclude these cases by summer 2011.

	<p pid="f.1248W.2/1">Staffing requirements for all ports, including Heathrow, are calculated using a workforce planning methodology which takes into account information provided by port operators on scheduling, predicted passenger loads and nationalities, and estimates of transaction times. Therefore every shift size is calculated individually.</p>
	<p pid="f.1248W.2/2">If there are a large number of cases being handled by a particular terminal, or a number of flights arrive together unexpectedly, local managers will seek to re-deploy staff from other tasks or from other terminals to meet the additional demand.</p>
	<p pid="f.1248W.2/3">There are some 13,000 different sized shifts per year at Heathrow and so the exact statistics which have been requested could be provided only at a disproportionate cost to the business. It is also possible that this information could prove useful to those people seeking to circumvent our border controls, and so to release it might compromise the security of the UK border.</p>

	<p pid="f.1250W.5/3">In terms of investment for Staffordshire police, the sum of general government support has risen from &pound;110.3 million to &pound;114.3 million, an increase of 3.6 per cent. Staffordshire had 2,271 police officers on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase>, an increase of 60 since 1997. There were also 225 police community support officers (PCSOs) and 1,293 police staff (an increase of 530 since 1997).

	<p pid="f.1254W.9/1">OGC, an independent Office of HM Treasury, together with the Public Sector Construction Client's Forum (PSCCF) and key industry stakeholders, developed and published the Guide to best &quot;Fair Payment&quot; practices on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September 2007</phrase>. The use of Project Bank Accounts (PBA) is one of a number of approaches recommended in that document to facilitate improved payment practice.</p>
	<p pid="f.1254W.9/2">Since the start of January 2008 all new central Government projects have been required to adhere to the OGC guidance and have a Fair Payment charter in place (that payments are made within 30 days). Whether this is achieved through the use of a Project Bank Account, or by other means, will need to be considered by clients on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="f.1254W.9/3">OGC funded the development of training on the use of Project Bank Accounts and promoted their use at a series of roadshows around the country. OGC is encouraging Departments to identify suitable projects where Project Bank Accounts could be used effectively. OGC will be monitoring the take-up of Project Bank Accounts until 2010 and will publish its findings soon after.</p>

	<p pid="f.1259W.2/1">HM Treasury undertook two public consultations, in July 2006 and January 2007, on the implementation of the EU's Third Money Laundering Directive in the UK. These included information on proposed supervisory arrangements for the new Money Laundering Regulations, which came into force in December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="f.1259W.2/2">The Third Money Laundering Directive requires that bodies supervising compliance with a member state's money laundering regime must have adequate powers to do so, including the power to compel the production of any information in order to monitor such compliance and to perform checks. The directive also requires that supervisory bodies must have adequate resources to undertake the task. HM Treasury officials assessed the applications of potential supervisors against these requirements, taking into account a range of criteria, such as a body's experience of standard setting, compliance monitoring, and disciplining members; as well as their membership size, resource capacity, public interest objectives and relationships with other relevant bodies. Both the previous Economic Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase>, and I approved the final supervisory arrangements. The Certified Public Accountants Association (CPAA) did not apply for supervisory status during either consultation period.</p>
	<p pid="f.1259W.2/3">Since their coming into force, HM Treasury have sought to avoid altering the new regulations, or the supervisory regime, in order to allow business adequate time to get used to the new requirements. As a matter of good practice, the Treasury intends to review the supervisory arrangements in 2009, once the regulations have been in force for a reasonable period.</p>
	<p pid="f.1259W.2/4">My officials corresponded with the CPAA during 2007 and 2008, explaining the policy approach taken on supervisory arrangements and the appointment of supervisors. Although the CPAA is not a supervisor for the purposes of the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, they are able, if they so wish, to work with the relevant supervisors to assist their members' compliance with the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="f.1266W.5/1">The availability of VAT reduced rates is governed by the European VAT agreements, signed by successive Governments. The Government are currently making the case at EU level for wider application of reduced VAT rates to energy-saving and energy efficient products. In March 2008 the European Council invited the Commission to examine areas where economic instruments, including VAT rates, can have a role to play to increase the use of energy-efficient goods and energy-saving materials. This work is currently under way and we expect it to be discussed by member states later in the year. Decisions on the scope of any new reduced VAT rate would be a matter for unanimous agreement of all member states.</p>

	<p pid="f.1288W.8/1">Chapter Seven of the &quot;Coronary Heart Disease National Service Framework&quot;, published in March 2000, set out standards for the national health service about the provision of cardiac rehabilitation services. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline 48, &quot;MI; secondary prevention&quot; was revised and issued in May 2007, copies of both publications have been placed in the Library. This provided updated guidance to the NHS on secondary prevention in primary and secondary care for patients following heart attack and emphasised the importance of rehabilitation for these patients.</p>
	<p pid="f.1288W.8/2">Implementation of guidance is a matter for the local NHS, working in partnership with stakeholders and the local community. The Department allocates funding directly to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations, and it is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding to commission and provide services to meet the health care needs of their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="f.1288W.8/3">The Department does not collect information centrally about specific funding for, or numbers of eligible patients to whom cardiac rehabilitation services are offered. However, a new National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation, funded by the British Heart Foundation has been established which covers the numbers of programmes and uptakes of services. This will provide stronger evidence on the quality and effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services and encourage local areas to appraise and improve their service provision. Further details are on the website at:</p>

All three trusts subsequently demonstrated that they had improved and were compliant with the code. To further strengthen this process, from April 2008, specialist teams from the HCC are carrying out annual infection control inspections of all acute trusts against the code. This inspection programme is under way and, to date, the HCC has issued one &quot;improvement notice&quot; as part of this programme.</p>

	<p pid="f.1290W.5/2">Since 2000, the Government have invested significant resources in the national health service so that hospitals are now providing a much higher quality of care, in better facilities, with more staff and better outcomes for patients. As a result, waiting times have reduced significantly, survival rates for cancer and heart disease have greatly improved and the majority of patients tell us they are satisfied with the level of care they receive.</p>
	<p pid="f.1290W.5/3">To build on these successes, the Department published &quot;Developing the NHS Performance Regime&quot; in June 2008, which set out the 'vision' for developing a performance regime to support NHS organisations to succeed and to identify and address under performance where it occurs.</p>
	<p pid="f.1290W.5/4">We continue to work with the NHS across strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to determine local and national priorities to drive better performance in the areas that matter most to patients.

	<p pid="f.1291W.9/6" class="indent">working with key NHS, social care, voluntary and independent sector stakeholders, as well as service users and carers, to identify and address key issues in neurological services and the stakeholders' role in implementation;</p>
	<p pid="f.1291W.9/7" class="indent">ensuring that other key delivery programmes, most especially the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; (copies of which have already been placed in the Library) and the long-term conditions strategy help deliver key NSF objectives; and</p>
	<p pid="f.1291W.9/8" class="indent">work with the Care Services Improvement Partnership to promote implementation of the NSF through a co-ordinated work programme, including regional workshops, a web-based getting started pack and self-assessment tool for services.</p>

	<p pid="f.1292W.2/1">The Government are committed to engaging patients and the public in the design and delivery of their local health services by making services more responsive and by giving people more opportunities to comment on and influence the care they receive.</p>
	<p pid="f.1292W.2/2">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, contained important measures designed to strengthen the patient and public involvement system in England, including the introduction of local involvement networks (LINks) and the updated duty on National Health Service bodies to involve users of health services.</p>
	<p pid="f.1292W.2/3">LINks, together with the new duty on NHS bodies to involve, and to report on consultations, will play a vital role in encouraging and enabling a greater range of people to influence the commissioning and provision of health care bringing meaningful engagement to the whole system, from commissioning to front-line care.</p>
	<p pid="f.1292W.2/4">The Department is also in the process of reviewing the NHS complaints system to create a single, more simple system covering all NHS and adult social care services. The new approach will mean that the experience of making a complaint is easier and will ensure that lessons are routinely learned from complaints, feeding into service improvement.</p>
	<p pid="f.1292W.2/5">The national patient survey programme collects feedback on the quality of service delivery from the point of view of patients and service users. Since its inception, over 20 surveys have been conducted across seven different settings, and well over 1 million patients have taken part. Surveys are conducted by the Healthcare Commission.</p>

	<p pid="f.1293W.2/2">In the case of clinical services, the prices service providers receive through their contracts are set through negotiation and agreement with the service commissioner, taking into account the actual costs of providing those services. This applies to both NHS bodies and private providers. Any clinical services provided under the rules of the payment by results system will be subject to the standard national tariff uplift.</p>
	<p pid="f.1293W.2/3">In contracts for cleaning and similar services, there is normally no automatic price increase, although this is a matter for negotiation.

	<p pid="f.1293W.2/4">The exception is private finance initiative (PFI) contracts, where there is an annual adjustment to the service payment to allow for inflation, in accordance with HM Treasury policy. For cleaning and similar services in PFI, the adjustment reflects changes in employment costs rather than inflation.</p>

	<p pid="f.1299W.8/1">From a health economic perspective, organ transplantation, in almost all cases, is a cost-effective use of resources. This is particularly the case for end stage renal failure. In 2005-06 England spent &pound;932 million on renal services, of which 46 per cent. was on dialysis. For each annual cohort of renal patients that receive a transplant, the cost saving, over a 30-year period, is likely to amount to at least &pound;100 million.</p>

	<p pid="f.1300W.0/1">In December 2006, the Government re-issued Good Practice Guidance on Managing the Introduction of New Healthcare Interventions and links to NICE technology appraisal guidance to the local national health service, which states that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is unavailable but that decisions should be made on the basis of the available evidence. The guidance also suggests alternative sources of information for NHS organisations to consult in the absence of NICE guidance. Copies of the guidance have already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="f.1300W.0/2">The draft NHS constitution makes clear the patient's right to expect local decisions on funding for drugs for which NICE guidance is not available to be made rationally following proper consideration of the evidence. Where the local NHS decides not to fund a treatment, the patient and clinician can expect an explanation. To underpin this, the Government will require primary care trusts to put in place clear and transparent arrangements both for local decision-making on funding of new drugs and for considering exceptional funding requests, and to publish information on those arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="f.1302W.3/1">It is not possible accurately to predict the cost of a particular by-election or provide a breakdown in advance since they are unique events which often involve extra costs for elements specific to that election (such as additional security or media management costs). However, average costs for the conduct of past by-elections have been around &pound;70,000 to &pound;80,000.</p>
	<p pid="f.1302W.3/2">In addition, candidates at parliamentary elections are entitled to send, free of charge for postage, one election communication either to each elector in the constituency or to each household. The Government pay the delivery costs. The cost to the Government of a candidate sending one communication to each elector in the Haltemprice and Howden constituency will be around &pound;18,960. The cost of a candidate sending one communication to each household in the constituency will be around &pound;3,930. I understand that, to date, the Royal Mail estimates the total cost of this service at the Haltemprice and Howden by-election at around &pound;112,600.</p>

	<p pid="f.1303W.8/1">In the last five years the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has commissioned five independent inquiries and sponsored the Hutton inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/2">The creation of the MoJ in May 2007 transferred the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) from the Home Office to the MoJ. The Home Office commissioned five independent inquiries in relation to NOMS in the preceding five years. The former Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) sponsored the Hutton inquiry. Details as follows:</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/3" class="italic"> Inquiry into the death of <i> p</i><i> olice </i><i> c</i> onstable Gerald Walker</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/4">The inquiry into the death of police constable Gerald Walker was published in March 2004. This inquiry, by HM Inspectorate of Probation, commissioned by the Home Secretary. The inquiry addressed events leading to the death of PC Gerald Walker, included consideration of policies and procedures relating to post release licences and related issues of criminal justice inter-agency working and communication. The inquiry cost &pound;40,000. The steps taken following the inquiry included improvements to police&mdash;probation practice and the introduction of a Joint National Protocol between police and the Probation Service.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/5" class="italic"> Zahid Mubarek Inquiry</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/6">The Zahid Mubarek inquiry was announced in April 2004, following the House of Lords ruling that an independent public investigation be held into the murder of Zahid Mubarek by his racist cellmate in Feltham Young Offender Institution in 2000. Mr. Justice Keith, chair of the inquiry, was tasked with looking into the events leading up to the murder and to make recommendations on the prevention of such attacks in the future. The report of the Zahid Mubarek inquiry was published in June 2006 and included 88 recommendations related to the prevention of any future deaths in circumstances similar to that of Mr. Mubarek. The Government welcomed the report and published an initial response. A full response to each recommendation was given within two months. Many of these reflected policies and procedures already put in place at HM Prison Service establishments. The inquiry cost &pound;4.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/7" class="italic"> Inquiry into the supervision of Peter Williams by Nottingham City Youth Offending Team</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/8">The Inquiry into the supervision of Peter Williams by Nottingham City Youth Offending Team was published in September 2005 by HM Inspectorate of Probation. This inquiry was commissioned by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to inquire into the supervision of Peter Williams who had been convicted, in 2005, of murder while on licence. The inquiry also assessed the local area implementation of relevant policies, the governance of the local Youth Offending Team (YOT) and any wider issues. The inquiry cost &pound;30,000. The steps taken following the inquiry required the YJB and the local YOT to take improvement action on enforcement, electronic monitoring, intensive supervision and training.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/9" class="italic"> Independent <i> r</i><i> eview of a </i><i> s</i><i> erious </i><i> f</i><i> urther </i><i> o</i> ffence case of Damien Hanson and Elliot White</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/10">An independent review of a serious further offence case of Damien Hanson and Elliot White was published in February 2006 by HM Inspectorate of Probation. The inquiry was commissioned by the Home Secretary to inquire into the decisions and management of London probation area relating to the sentences being served by Hanson and White at the time when they committed the offences. The offenders had been convicted of murder in 2005. The inquiry cost &pound;40,000. The steps taken following the inquiry were that the Probation Circulars 49/05, 15/06 and 22/06 were issued requiring areas to undertake a comprehensive review of their risk assessment and management of offenders, and to take improvement actions including training.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/11" class="italic"> The Case of Approved Premises in Avon and Somerset</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/12">The case of approved premises in Avon and Somerset. This inquiry was published in March 2007 by HM Inspectorate of Probation. The inquiry was commissioned by the Home Secretary to investigate allegations made by the BBC Panorama programme and to make any recommendations necessary to improve the management of dangerous offenders. The inquiry cost &pound;100,000. The steps taken following the review were that the probation area and the approved premises were required to address recommendations regarding resourcing, training, drug testing, and liaison with police.</p>
	<p pid="f.1303W.8/13">Costs to HMI Probation were met from within their allocated budget. The cost figures aforementioned are derived using an approach, which absorbs all the support administration and related additional costs of each piece of work into an average cost per hour. This provides cost figures as a 'calculated proportion of the allocated budget'.</p>

	<p pid="f.1303W.8/15">The Hutton inquiry was commissioned on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-18">18 July 2003</phrase>, and sponsored by the then Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, Lord Falconer of Thoroton. Its terms of reference were</p>

	<p pid="f.1303W.8/17">Lord Hutton completed his report in January 2004. The costs incurred by the inquiry itself were &pound;1.68 million for the financial year 2003-04. These were the costs to the then, Department for Constitutional Affairs, as the sponsor Department for the inquiry. The Government accepted Lord Hutton's report in full.</p>

	<p pid="f.1306W.5/1">Domestic violence is not a specific offence. Offenders who commit domestic violence are charged with a generic offence of assault. It would not be possible to identify the number of prisoners convicted of domestic violence related offences without examining individual case files which would incur disproportionate cost. Similarly, it is also not possible to identify prisoners convicted of domestic violence related offences who have gone on to reoffend or who have been recalled to custody.</p>
	<p pid="f.1306W.5/2">Prisoners released under the ECL scheme are not subject to individualised risk assessment; the assessment of eligibility is against the criteria of the scheme. Prisoners serving a sentence for a serious violent offence are excluded from ECL. All prisoners released on ECL would have been released at their statutory release date a maximum of 18 days later. It is for this reason that ECL operates according to precise fixed criteria. All release arrangements that would otherwise have taken place 18 days later are brought forward to the ECL release date and any licence conditions that would apply at the statutory release date are included on the ECL licence.</p>
	<p pid="f.1306W.5/3">Prisons are instructed that they should take appropriate action in response to any information they have received that a prisoner poses a risk of domestic violence or to a specific victim on release. That information should be provided to the police and, where appropriate, submitted to the multi-agency public protection panel, in line with routine risk management arrangements. In such cases, release on ECL should not take place until measures to address the risk have been put in place.</p>
	<p pid="f.1306W.5/4">The full policy on ECL is set out in prison service instruction 42/2007. This may be found on the prison service's website:</p>

	<p pid="f.1308W.2/1">The electronic monitoring contractors are only required to report to the police breaches of curfew for those subject to court bail conditions under the Bail Act 1976. According to data provided by the contractors the number of breaches reported to the police in such cases, in the previous three financial years, is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="f.1308W.2/4"> <td></td> <td colspan="2"><i> Cases of deliberate tag tampers (including removals)</i></td> <td colspan="2"><i> Cases breached for other reasons</i></td> <td><i> Bail curfew orders</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="f.1308W.2/5"> <td><i> Financial year</i></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> <td><i> Percentage</i></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> <td><i> Percentage</i></td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="f.1308W.2/6"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>681</td> <td>8</td> <td>3,747</td> <td>44</td> <td>8,548</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="f.1308W.2/7"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>1,991</td> <td>11</td> <td>9,578</td> <td>52</td> <td>18,327</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="f.1308W.2/8"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>1,97l</td> <td>8</td> <td>14,205</td> <td>57</td> <td>24,936</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="f.1308W.2/11">There has been a large increase in the number of bailed cases in the last three years, particularly since September 2005 when courts were encouraged to make greater use of curfew as a condition of adult bail (curfew as a bail condition for juveniles has been available since 2002). The large increase in the number of reported breaches reflects this.</p>
	<p pid="f.1308W.2/12">While there has been a rise in the percentage of cases breached for other reasons, such as late back at the start of the curfew, the number of cases breached for tag tampers, as a percentage of bail curfews, fell from 11 per cent. in 2006-07 to 8 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="f.1308W.2/13">The figures include multiple breaches/tag tampers committed by tagged persons on bail and reported to the police. The system is designed to ensure that any attempt to remove a tag within the curfew address automatically registers as a tamper at the electronic monitoring service provider's control centre.</p>
	<p pid="f.1308W.2/14">Data on the number of cases resulting in a return to court are not available centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost through collating information from each police force.</p>

	<p pid="f.1323W.8/1">The Energy Minister initiated a review into the resilience of electricity substations to flooding following the floods of summer 2007. The review was carried out under the framework of the energy emergencies executive, a joint BERR/Ofgem/industry body, and led by the Energy Networks Association (ENA) with support from BERR, Ofgem, electricity network owners and the Environment Agency. The first phase of this work, completed in March 2008, established a framework for the assessment of flood risk, societal impact of a loss of electricity supplies during a flood incident and options for protecting electricity substations from flooding.</p>
	<p pid="f.1323W.8/2">The review has now commenced work on the second phase, which includes application of the framework on a site by site basis to all the major electricity substations identified as being located in a flood plain. This work is due to be completed by the end of December 2008.</p>

On the Department's part we agreed to pay bereavement awards to all widows who fulfilled the criteria set in England and Wales (under Scottish law they would not all have received this); and for their part the Scottish solicitors agreed to impose a limitation date of 1949 (rather than it being open-ended).</p>

	<p pid="f.1331W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="f.1331W.5/2">The UK Development programme with China consists of two elements. Firstly, work in China to help China achieve the Millennium Development Goals in basic education, water supply and sanitation and combating HIV and AIDS and TB. Secondly, work with China to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals globally by sharing experience and lesson learning with respect to China's engagement in Africa and with its near neighbours; and on climate change, sustainable development and learning from China's experience on poverty reduction. The bilateral programme to China is expected to end in March 2011. We expect engagement with China on international development issues to continue beyond March 2011, but the modalities for this still need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="f.1331W.5/3">The UK has provided funds for the immediate relief effort in response to the earthquake in Sichuan. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May</phrase>, three days after the earthquake struck, we provided &pound;1 million to the Chinese Association for NGO co-operation. The money was used to buy food, water, blankets and 2,400 tents. Between 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-30">30 May</phrase>, four flights arrived in Chengdu from Dubai carrying a further 5,332 tents. The total value of the tents, including transport costs, was &pound;1.2 million. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June</phrase>, we agreed a contribution of &pound;350,000 to the International Labour Organisation for training to help survivors of the earthquake re-launch or start their own businesses for the first time. The programme aims to re-establish 1,000 businesses and start 700 new ones in the next year. The DFID total contribution to date is therefore &pound;2.55 million.</p>
	<p pid="f.1331W.5/4">We are currently considering establishing a facility to provide technical assistance for the reconstruction effort. It will have an initial ceiling of &pound;1 million. The main focus of the expertise will be on areas where we already have a comparative advantage, such as health, education, water and sanitation, participatory, socially inclusive planning and community-based poverty reduction in remote villages. The facility is expected to be operational by mid-July.</p>

	<p pid="f.1337W.2/1">Under article 14 of the Rome Statute, a State Party can refer to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation, a situation in a third State in which one or more crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction appear to have been committed. The effect of article 13 of the Rome Statute is that such a referral can only be made where the third State is a party to the Rome Statute. The UN Security Council (UNSC), acting under chapter VII of the UN charter, can also refer a situation to the ICC Prosecutor. The UK has made no unilateral referrals, but we played a leading role in the UNSC's adoption of UNSC resolution 1593 (March 2005) which referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC.</p>

I raised the issue with the Iranian ambassador to London soon after the arrests. We remain extremely worried by their on-going detention, the lack of access to legal representation and their families and the institutional persecution of members of the Baha'i faith in Iran more broadly. We will continue to stress our concerns about this and have recommended that the EU formally raises this issue once again in its next meeting with the Iranian authorities in Tehran.</p>

	<p pid="f.1346W.2/1">No formal assessment of the effectiveness of the BDAG has been carried out by the Department. The work of the group, has, however, been instrumental in bringing about revisions to Building Regulations Approved Document &quot;B&quot;, several British Standards, and Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) operational procedures and guidance. Work continues to inform a number of British Standards Reviews and amendments to FRS Generic Risk Assessments and operational practice and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="f.1346W.2/2">The work also informed the evaluation procedures used by the Integrated Clothing Project Garment Trials Working Group. Beyond the FRS the work of the group was, and continues to be, used to inform other emergency service responders' equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE) and operational practice decisions. The BDAG work has also been used in setting up Home Office funded research programmes evaluating improved monitoring and cooling equipment for all emergency service responders. Using BDAG as a starting point at least one FRS has engaged with university researchers to carry out a programme to identify cooling and post-incident recovery best practice for FRS personnel.</p>
	<p pid="f.1346W.2/3">Within the last 12 months three reports have been finalised which are in process of being published on the Department website. These reports cover two further studies on the physiological impact on firefighters of operational activities and a review of the incident ground communication provision of fire and rescue services. Draft reports have been received on the modelling of fires in under-ventilated compartments and it is intended that these reports be consolidated and published on the Department website once finalised. A further internal report has been prepared into an assessment of alternative methods of advancing hose from a bridgehead during high-rise firefighting. This report has been used to inform preparation of a revision to the generic risk assessment for high-rise firefighting.</p>
	<p pid="f.1346W.2/4">The group continues to manage several projects:</p>

	<p pid="f.1347W.5/2">In general, sandwich bars would be able to open in retail premises without the need for planning permission as both of these uses fall within Class Al: Shops of the Use Classes Order. Most other types of catering outlets, such as cafes, restaurants and hot food take-away premises fall into different use classes, and are likely to require planning permission to open in premises which have been in Class Al use.</p>
	<p pid="f.1347W.5/3">It is for local planning authorities to determine in the first instance whether a material change of use has occurred or would occur, and also whether planning permission is required.

	<p pid="f.1349W.8/1">While the Department undertook various major refurbishment projects in excess of &pound;0.5 million during this period, it was not considered appropriate to apply the BREEAM assessment method to these. This was due largely to projects consisting of repairs to and replacements of existing assets. Where opportunities existed, sustainability considerations were rigorously applied. For example, a project involving re-planning office floors and trialling flexible desking included the procurement of chairs manufactured from materials which were 47 per cent. recycled and 98 per cent. recyclable.</p>

	<p pid="f.1358W.2/1">Housing associations have a statutory duty to assist local authorities in meeting housing need and to provide good quality, responsive services; these are requirements of the Housing Corporation's Regulatory Code and guidance. The Regulatory Code expects associations to be responsive to the individual characteristics and circumstances of residents and provide vulnerable and marginalised residents with appropriate responsive housing services. Where associations fail to meet these requirements, the Housing Corporation has powers to take a range of actions. These may include reassessing an association's risk rating, which could have an impact on its relationships with stakeholders, including local authorities and lenders. If an association is a grant recipient, its fitness to develop might also be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="f.1358W.2/2">Associations are actively encouraged to sign up to the Respect Standard for Housing Management and to be active participants in Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, to ensure that victims and witnesses of crime, and other vulnerable residents, receive the support they need.</p>
	<p pid="f.1358W.2/3">Most social landlords are now members of choice based lettings (CBL) schemes. CBL schemes work to deliver good outcomes for vulnerable tenants, for example by giving priority to those with an urgent need to move. Outcomes in CBL schemes are transparent, so that delivery performance for vulnerable groups can be benchmarked. The Audit Commission also looks at delivery for victims of crime and nuisance, as part of housing management inspections.</p>
	<p pid="f.1358W.2/4">The Housing and Regeneration Bill, currently in the other place, establishes a new Tenant Services Authority, with tenants at the heart of its remit. The authority will have significant new powers, to ensure that landlords who fail to deliver a good service to their tenants are dealt with in an effective and proportionate matter.</p>

	<p pid="f.1363W.5/2">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="f.1363W.5/3"><i> (a)</i> and <i> (b)</i> (i) The revenue funding figures per pupil in 2005-06 in cash terms for Devon local authority are as follows:</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="f.1363W.5/10">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with 2005-06 figures quoted above because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="f.1363W.5/11">The 2005-06 figures quoted in the first table are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS, which comprises a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through CLG's (formerly DCLG) Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="f.1363W.5/12">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06&mdash;this is the basis for the 2005-06 baseline figure quoted as follows; as aforementioned this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding a primary/secondary split is not available. The figures are for all funded pupils aged 3 to 19 and are in cash terms.</p>
	<p pid="f.1363W.5/13"><i> (a)</i> and <i> (b)</i> (ii) &amp; (iii) The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2005-06 to 2008- 09 allocated to Devon local authority are provided in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="f.1380W.8/1">The number of women aged 19-59 and men aged 19-64 in England who hold at least a level 4 qualification increased by nearly 1.9 million between quarter 4, 1997 and quarter 4, 2007. The proportion increased by 8.6 percentage points from 22.3 per cent. to 30.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="f.1380W.8/2">The supply of graduates has been rising steadily and we know employer demand for graduates remains high. Most large employers (81 per cent.&mdash;LSC survey on recruitment and training among large employers, 2008) see a level 4 qualification or above as a good indicator for skills. We want to ensure that graduates have both the specialist and broader skills which employers value and that their employment rates remain high.</p>
	<p pid="f.1380W.8/3">Through &quot;Higher Education at Work - High Skills: High Value&quot; we are consulting on our high-level skills strategy and will consider carefully the responses to help us take forward our plans to improve graduate employability and to raise the skills and capability of those already in work.</p>
	<p pid="f.1380W.8/4">DIUS uses the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor, the Annual Local Area Labour Force Survey (ALALFS) to provide estimates about numbers and proportions of the population with a degree or equivalent qualification for English local authorities. These local estimates are available at:</p>

	<p pid="f.1380W.8/6">Series are available via this link back to 2001/02 for both the working-age population (i.e. women aged 16-59 and men aged 16-64 (16-59/64)) and the 19-59/64 population which is now the focus for DIUS reporting. Data for earlier years for the 16-59/64 population are also published by the Office for National Statistics via the NOMIS website at:</p>
	<p pid="f.1380W.8/7" class="indent">https://<a href="http://www.nomisweb.co.uk">www.nomisweb.co.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="f.1380W.8/8">However, it should be noted that all these local estimates are currently undergoing revision following the reweighting of all underlying datasets to reflect more up-to-date population estimates from ONS. The DIUS series will be revised in August. The updating of the NOMIS series will be completed in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="f.1381W.2/1">Universities are increasingly accepting foundation degrees as a suitable entry qualification for honours degrees. Over half (54 per cent.) of the students who qualified with a foundation degree in 2004-05 immediately progressed to an honours degree in 2005-06 and other foundation degree graduates may progress to a honours degree later in their careers.</p>
	<p pid="f.1381W.2/2">As well as providing a progression route to honours degrees, foundation degrees are a valuable qualification in their own right and offer flexible work-focused qualifications designed with employers to meet their skill needs at that level.</p>

	<p pid="f.1383W.0/1">The Government recognise the importance of modern foreign language skills to employers to improve their competitiveness in the global economy. The approach taken by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in the light of the decline in adult participation rates in these subjects recognises the key role providers have in reversing this trend by stimulating demand and revitalising the curriculum to equip more adults and young people with modern language skills. To this end each local area is expected to have a core adult learning offer that reflects and responds to the spectrum of individual adult and employer needs.</p>
	<p pid="f.1383W.0/2">In addition, the LSC also funds a range of learning opportunities for individual adults within its safeguarded budget for personal and community development (lifelong) learning. Courses to develop foreign language capability are also funded through this budget.</p>

The British Council is involved in a range of activities to support higher education links between the UK and Israel with around &pound;450,000 spent in 2007-08 on these activities.</p>

	<p pid="f.1385W.2/1">The Student Loans Company's (SLC) best estimate of the number of borrowers it has continued to collect repayments from although their loan has been paid off for each year since 2001 is shown in the following table. The estimated 20,900 borrowers with income contingent repayment (ICR) loans who made overpayments in 2006-07 represented just 1.9 per cent. of the total number of borrowers who were eligible to make repayments had their earning passed the &pound;15,000 earnings threshold. Over-repayments from borrowers with mortgage style loans are not included because any over-repayments once their loan has been cleared will only arise where the borrower has failed to cancel repayment arrangements with their bank.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.2/2">There are a variety of circumstances why borrowers overpay but this mainly occurs when loans come to the end of repayment. The number of over-repayments has increased over the period covered by the answer as the number of borrowers with ICR loans entering into repayment has grown. ICR loans were introduced in 1998, so in the early years covered by the answer, relatively few borrowers were making repayments. For student loan borrowers with ICR loans, repayments are predominately made through the tax system. Due to the time lag in the SLC receiving information from HM Revenue and Customs, it is possible for borrowers to overpay before the SLC becomes aware that their repayments should stop.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.2/3">Where the pattern of payments shows that repayment will be completed during the coming year, the SLC invites borrowers to get in touch to discuss when repayments should stop. Borrowers are then able to make manual repayments. If they do not respond promptly to the SLC, or ignore the invitation, they will probably overpay.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.2/4">The SLC has recently introduced a new website facility specifically for repaying customers. This will give borrowers the ability to view their most current statement and it will also give them the chance to calculate their balance based on what they can see in their payslips.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.2/5">The SLC is working on further improving the loan end process and has been asked to put in place arrangements which will reduce the number of borrowers over-repaying at the end of repayment. Those arrangements, which are likely to be voluntary, are expected to be in place towards the end of next year.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.2/6">Any borrower who has repaid should contact the SLC immediately to obtain a full refund with interest. All refunds include interest at the same (retail price index) rate that was charged on the loan.</p>

	<p pid="f.1404W.6/1">We have not made a specific assessment of the effects of dyscalculia on school examination results. However, we are aware that in 2005 the Qualifications and Curriculum Agency published a review of research in relation to dyscalculia, which notes that tests and definitions of dyscalculia vary.</p>

This indicates that whereas 68.7 per cent. of children who did not have identified special educational needs (SEN) obtained five A*-C grades at GCSE, only 23.1 per cent. of children on the school-based stages of SEN support reached that level of attainment&mdash;and only around 9.2 per cent. of those with statements. We intend to publish attainment figures by type of need as an additional table to this Statistical First Release during the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-07">7 July 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="f.1404W.6/3">In 2006, 22 per cent. of children at School Action Plus who have a specific learning difficulty as their primary type of need (dyscalculia, dyslexia or dyspraxia) achieved the equivalent of five A*-C grades at GCSE, as did 14 per cent. of children who had a statement for these needs. This compared to 65.9 per cent. of children who did not have identified SEN.</p>
	<p pid="f.1404W.6/4">In the Children's Plan, which we published in December last year, we recognised that more needs to be done to improve outcomes and provision for children with SEN. In a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-06">6 May 2008</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families announced that Sir Jim Rose had been asked, in the light of evidence, to make recommendations on the identification and teaching of children with dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="f.1404W.6/5">In developing his recommendations, Sir Jim Rose will be considering evidence of practice in improving outcomes for children with dyslexia, including those who are experiencing difficulties associated with dyscalculia.

	<p pid="f.1408W.2/2">International GCSEs are not accredited qualifications and so the Department does not hold information on the pupils that are entered for them. Crucially, the IGCSE does not meet the requirements of the statutory national curriculum and so no maintained schools should be entering their pupils for this qualification.</p>
	<p pid="f.1408W.2/3">The Cambridge Pre-U examination is a new qualification for which teaching starts in September 2008. The first qualifications of this nature will be awarded in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="f.1411W.6/1">The majority of the many domestic and non-domestic buildings in England are likely to contain asbestos. In this schools are no different. Our best estimate is that some asbestos-containing materials can be found in around 70 per cent. of school buildings.</p>
	<p pid="f.1411W.6/2">Health and Safety Executive guidance is clear that if asbestos is unlikely to be disturbed or damaged, it is usually safer to leave it in place and manage it. Routine condition surveys are rigorous enough to identify damaged material that could contain asbestos, and this would then trigger further action such as intrusive surveys and the repair or removal of any asbestos-containing materials.</p>
	<p pid="f.1411W.6/3">Detailed information about the incidence of asbestos in schools is not collected centrally. Local authorities are responsible for school buildings under their management. The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 place a duty on those with legal responsibilities for maintenance of buildings to manage the risk from asbestos. This includes assessing whether there is asbestos in buildings and, depending on its condition, removing it or managing it.</p>
	<p pid="f.1411W.6/4">The HSE provides advice and guidance on the management of asbestos in schools.</p>

	<p pid="f.1416W.3/1">We estimate that as at the end of April 2008, the changes to the criteria for High Performing Specialist Schools (HPSS) introduced this year impact on six existing HPSS. These schools still have the opportunity to maintain the status if their 2008 results are above the necessary threshold.</p>
	<p pid="f.1416W.3/2">We maintained the fundamental aspects of the 2007 criteria but raised minimum requirements for GCSE 5+ A* - C including English and mathematics. The reasons for these changes were: to reflect the introduction of the National Challenge, ensure that the top third of re-designated schools qualify for the HPSS programme and make the best use of available resources.</p>

	<p pid="f.1419W.6/16">The figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with the 2000-01 to 2005-06 figures quoted because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. This change does not affect the comparability of the other non-DSG grants identified above, although there are some year-on-year changes in terms of what grants were provided.</p>
	<p pid="f.1419W.6/17">The 2000-01 to 2005-06 figures quoted above are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS), which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage from EFS, which comprises a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement, but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="f.1419W.6/18">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department has isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06. This is the basis for the 2005-06 baseline figure quoted; as described this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. The grants associated with the 2005-06 DSG baseline are the same as those given with the EFS figure above: Standards Fund, Budget Support Grant, Transitional Support Grant, School Standards Grant and LSC funding.</p>
	<p pid="f.1419W.6/19">Revenue funding from the DSG, Standards Fund, School Standards Grant, Schools Standards Grant (Personalisation) and the Learning and Skills Council for years 2006-07 to 2007-08 for Westminster local authority are provided in the following table along with the comparable figures based on the 2005-06 DSG baseline. The figures are for all funded pupils aged 3-19 and are in real terms.</p>

However, there is no centrally held data about how much this amounts to.</p>
