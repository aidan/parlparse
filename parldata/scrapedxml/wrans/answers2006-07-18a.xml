	<p pid="a.259W.3/1">After decades of conflict, the lack of investment in basic infrastructure, poor governance and drought, much of Afghanistan's productivity has been lost or re-directed towards poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. As 70 per cent. of the population are rural, agriculture provides the best opportunity for alternative income generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/2">Helmand province was once one of the most agriculturally advanced and productive areas in Afghanistan. It might have the potential to be so again. For examples, the DFID-funded Research into Alternative Livelihoods Programme (RALF) is looking at the export potential of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms egg plants and okra in Helmand and has made contacts with raisin importers, organic and fair trade. The programme is also evaluating at least 10 different small scale agri-processing industries such as tomato paste production.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/3">Growth in small and medium enterprises and construction has the potential to bring new employment opportunities in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. DFID supports the Micro Finance Investment Support Facility Programme, which provides much needed credit for investment in agriculture, manufacturing, retail and service industries. To date, the programme has brought financial services for some 161,000 people in around half of the provinces of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/4">The development of Afghanistan's natural resources could also provide alternative jobs. Afghanistan possesses energy and mineral resources, many of which are underdeveloped, such as coal, gas, oil, precious metals and semi-precious stones. DFID is funding the British Geological Survey to strengthen the Afghan Geological Survey to develop and promote the mining sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.6/1">DFID has provided over &pound;1.1 million for land mine clearance work in Angola since 2003. A further &pound;400,000 will be spent this year to support land mine clearance activities in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/2">DFID is currently funding the work of two mine action NGOs operating in Angola&mdash;the Halo Trust and the Mine Awareness Group. Most of this work is taking place in areas where humanitarian operations are ongoing in order to allow UN Agencies like the World Food Programme to access populations in need, and to do so safely.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/3">DFID's aid programme in Angola is focused on providing support to meet urgent humanitarian needs. Funding for transport infrastructure has been made in the context of support provided for humanitarian programming. DFID provided &pound;1.15 million to the WFP last year to support the construction of bridges to enable quicker humanitarian access to populations in need. This support has also reduced costs because aid can now travel by road instead of only by means of air transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/4">Support for infrastructure development in southern Africa has been identified as a priority area in DFID's Southern Africa regional plan. Angola will benefit from this work, which is currently at the design stage.</p>

The project is in two districts of Malawi and will deliver 550 boreholes, household sanitation, and training, and help build capacity in the districts. DFID is contributing &pound;620,000 over five years, which is 25 per cent. of the overall funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.5/2">DFID has agreed to co-finance a project in 13 districts of Malawi if the NGO consortium involved can secure European Union Water Facility funding. The consortium of six NGOs is led by Concern Universal and also includes Oxfam, Emmanuel International and World Vision. This project will work with local government and is expected to deliver over 3,000 functioning boreholes and safe sanitation for 250,000 people. DFID has agreed to contribute &pound;860,000 over five years which is 25 per cent. of the overall funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.5/3">DFID is funding WaterAid to complete a nationwide digital map showing who has and does not have access to a safe water supply. This tool will help the Government and others to concentrate their efforts on supplying water to those who have no access at present. DFID is spending &pound;65,000 on this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.260W.5/4">As part of support to primary education, DFID has been funding improvements to primary school water supply and sanitation for the past nine years. In 2005, DFID spent approximately &pound;1,000,000 on primary school water supply and sanitation in Malawi. Apart from their health benefits, the availability of latrines and their sensitive siting is one of a number of factors that can help keep girls at school.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.2/1">DFID has a rising aid programme in Somalia. Subject to political and other developments within Somalia, this year we plan to disburse approximately &pound;15.5 million, of which around 40 per cent. is likely to be spent in Somaliland. This is planned to rise further next year, again with a substantial portion benefiting Somaliland&mdash;either as support for specific Somaliland activities or as part of a Somalia-wide programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.2/2">Our programmes in Somalia are focused around three objectives agreed:</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.2/3" class="indent">i. To help achieve a just and viable political settlement in Somalia. Programmes include a Dialogue for Peace project and Democratisation project through WSP International.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.2/4" class="indent">ii. To work with others to establish the basis for effective development assistance, with an initial focus on improving governance and service delivery. Programmes include a partnership agreement with UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for support to primary education and a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Rule of Law Programme supporting re-establishment and strengthening of police services and justice systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.2/5" class="indent">iii. To ensure timely provision of humanitarian relief. For example, we provided approximately &pound;13 million in response to the recent drought in the Horn of Africa, specifically for relief in Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.2/6">We do not provide bilateral aid directly to any Somali authority; however, projects under the objectives above, undertaken by the UN and NGOs, involve collaboration with local and regional authorities and the Transitional Federal Government in their delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.8/1">No formal assessment has been made of the merits or otherwise of introducing regulations to require all new bicycles to be fitted with operational lights and all purchasers to be provided with safety helmets.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.8/2">Existing regulations require the use of lights on pedal cycles between sunset and sunrise: non-compliance is an offence. Requiring the fitment of operational lights at point of sale would not ensure that the lights were thereafter maintained in working order, nor would it ensure that riders turned them on. However, such regulation would deprive cyclists of choice, as there are several legally acceptable varieties of cycle lights, ranging from dynamo to battery-operated and steady to flashing, from which cyclists are currently free to choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.8/3">Our policy on cycle helmets is to persuade cyclists to protect themselves by using them, but providing helmets with each new bicycle would not guarantee that they would be used. The Government will keep their policies in this&mdash;as in all areas&mdash;under review in the light of discussion in Parliament and elsewhere.</p>

A decision on programme entry for this scheme and funding from the Department will only be taken once we have resolved a number of appraisal issues. Should the scheme be approved for programme entry, our response of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-06">6 July</phrase> to the North West region on Regional Funding Allocations confirms that we would expect to provide funding for this scheme during the period 2009-10 to 2015-16 but only subject to it securing all necessary statutory approvals.</p>

Coaches are clearly high occupancy vehicles but they are speed restricted which could therefore impede the flow of traffic in the HOV lane. A key consideration is whether the proposed HOV lane is on the outside of the motorway (as proposed for M1 junction 7 to 10) or the inside of the motorway (as proposed for M62/M606).</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.2/1">The portal provides the user with two choices for assessing the costs of car travel.

	<p pid="a.275W.2/2">Transport Direct's purpose is to give users an impartial series of travel options and to enable them to select choices that meet their needs. Market research strongly indicates that motorists are overwhelmingly interested in seeing information about the 'point of use' of costs of their car. Therefore the default is to display the fuel costs and other direct costs. Showing full costs as the default would result in this functionality not being used by the majority of motorists, thus negating any potential effect on their travel choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.2/3">Users do have the option to select an estimate of the total running costs. This is based on advice and information provided by the major motoring organisations and provides a figure which reflects the total cost of motoring, on a per mile basis.
