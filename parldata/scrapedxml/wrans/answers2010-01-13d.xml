Since the service was launched approximately three years ago the range of devices has changed and all those issued in the past are also supported by PICT. The full range of PDAs currently available from PICT can be viewed and ordered in the Commons Members Centre in Portcullis House. Device details and order forms can also be found on the intranet. During 2009 PICT upgraded the Parliamentary infrastructure and as a result will shortly be extending the mobile service further to allow Members to connect their own active synch compatible devices (windows mobile, symbian and iphone) and Blackberry devices securely to Parliamentary Outlook accounts.</p>

	<p pid="d.963W.3/1">DEFRA has not carried out any formal research on the potential for mob-grazing (an extra intensive version of rotational grazing) to permanently sequester carbon in soil. However, an initial assessment from a UK perspective suggests that mob-grazing has limited potential to increase soil carbon and may increase soil compaction and erosion, resulting in a subsequent loss of soil quality and soil carbon. As a result of the density of livestock, mob-grazing practices would also be likely to lead to nutrient 'hotspots' which could lead to increased nitrous oxide emissions (a more powerful greenhouse gas) or increased nitrate leaching into water courses.</p>

This is because of the animal and public health risk associated with such disposal. There is therefore no point at this stage in carrying out such an environmental or economic assessment. However, we are aware that there is ongoing research into the possibility of using anaerobic digestions as a pre-treatment and method of temporary storage of fallen stock prior to disposal by rendering or incineration. The regulation has a provision to approve such new methods of disposal subject to evidence from research that it does not present a risk to animal and public health.</p>

	<p pid="d.963W.9/3">While we do not have any studies specifically relating current badger populations to cattle TB incidence, DEFRA is funding a number of research projects that further analyse the extensive dataset collected during the Randomised Badger Culling Trial carried out in the South West of England between1998 and 2005. This trial looked at the impact of two badger culling methods on cattle herd TB incidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.963W.9/4">No trial areas were located in East Sussex because it is predominantly a relatively low TB incidence county with a well recognised small endemic area of infection on the coast between Brighton and Eastbourne. The latest figures show that of the 16,390 reactors slaughtered in 2009 up to <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-31">31 August</phrase> in England, 18 were from herds located in East Sussex.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-01-13d.309674.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-01-13d.964W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="964W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100113/text/100113w0002.htm#10011367002347">
	<p pid="d.964W.5/1">In June 2009 the Government published their response to Sir Michael Pitt's independent review of the summer 2007 floods. The Government supported all of the 92 Pitt recommendations, including those that suggested better ways of managing surface water flooding caused by excessive rainfall.</p>
	<p pid="d.964W.5/2">The Flood and Water Management Bill was presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November 2009</phrase>. The Bill implements the Pitt recommendations that require urgent legislation, and strengthens the legislative framework to reduce impacts of future floods. It gives local authorities lead responsibility for managing local flood risk, with the support of the relevant organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.964W.5/3">It also contains proposals on unitary and county local authorities being responsible for approving sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) for all new builds and redevelopments, and for adopting and maintaining SUDS serving more than one property. SUDS can significantly reduce localised flash-flooding, reduce flooding downstream and slow down the rate at which areas begin to flood. They can also improve water quality. The Bill proposes to amend the automatic right to connect the surface water drainage systems of any new developments to the sewerage system, making it conditional on SUDS National Standards having been applied. For back gardens, local authorities already have powers to prevent the laying of impermeable surfaces where it poses a local problem, via Article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.</p>
	<p pid="d.964W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December 2008</phrase>, the Government announced that the transfer of all private sewers and lateral drains linked to the public sewerage system would take place from 2011. Around 180,000 km of private sewers and lateral drains connect into the public network, but benefit from no effective operational regime. This will remove the burden of maintenance and repair from householders and will ensure better planning and more integrated management of the wider sewerage network.</p>
	<p pid="d.964W.5/5">In the West Midlands, the Environment Agency has supplied its Medium Term Plan for flood risk management to Severn Trent Water. This will allow an early assessment of potential impacts on the sewerage system to be made. It will also create opportunities to identify potential sites for combined schemes, where both river and sewer flooding occur. The Environment Agency and Severn Trent are currently co-operating on planning schemes at Alcester, Broom and Pershore in the West Midlands. These are all locations which were affected by the 2007 summer floods. These schemes are planned to reduce flood risk to 193 properties (100 at Alcester, 61 at Pershore and 32 at Broom).</p>
	<p pid="d.964W.5/6">Water companies are investing considerable sums in capital works to minimise the risk of sewer flooding. For the Periodic Review 2009, the Environment Agency commented on and contributed to the funding bid by Severn Trent to improve the resilience of its assets. In both the East and West Midlands, Severn Trent has been working with the Environment Agency to assist lead local authorities in establishing successful partnerships to manage local flood risk.</p>

	<p pid="d.978W.6/1">North Korea has one of the worst human rights records in the world. Although North Korea denies access to human rights organisations, including the UN, information from a variety of sources, much of it from North Korean defectors, paints a picture of serious and widespread abuse, namely:</p>
	<p pid="d.978W.6/2" class="indent">political prison camps and labour rehabilitation camps;</p>
	<p pid="d.978W.6/3" class="indent">regular use of the death penalty (including extra-judicial and public executions);</p>
	<p pid="d.978W.6/4" class="indent">routine use of torture and inhumane treatment;</p>
	<p pid="d.978W.6/5" class="indent">severe restrictions of freedom of speech, movement, assembly, and information.</p>
	<p pid="d.978W.6/6">We raised these issues most recently in December 2009 at the UN Universal Periodic Review of the human rights situation in North Korea (in Geneva). We pressed North Korea to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea access to their country to make a full assessment of the human rights situation. The EU has also offered to restart a bilateral dialogue on human rights but North Korea refuses to do so until the EU stops proposing resolutions against North Korea.</p>

	<p pid="d.979W.3/1">As with all other crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), Coventry was allocated &#163;25,000 a year from 2003-04 as a contribution towards funding an ASB co-ordinator post. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supports the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs).</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/2">Other budgets also contribute towards the wider cross-Government strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour. The Government are committed to diverting young people from crime and antisocial behaviour as demonstrated by our investment of around &#163;2 billion on prevention, including activity such as sure start children's centres, parenting support and positive activities. Last year we launched the Youth Crime Action Plan, a cross-government programme of action to tackle youth crime and antisocial behaviour and reduce re-offending. It set out a triple track approach of enforcement where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge to children and families where it is needed and better and earlier prevention. This builds on major progress we have made in the last decade in tackling youth offending. Backed by &#163;100 million of new investment it has led to significant action over the past year and a half, which has made a real difference to young people, families and communities. The number of young people entering the criminal justice system for the first time is falling. The number in England fell from 94,481 in 2007-08 to 74,033 in 2008-09-a 21.6 per cent. decrease.</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/3">Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example the introduction of community support officers, but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/4">While I have not had discussions with the community safety team in Coventry I am pleased to hear that Coventry community safety partnership has an overarching strategy and action plan to tackle and reduce antisocial behaviour (ASB) in the city, which has been developed and is delivered through a range of agencies who are members of a Coventry ASB strategic group. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-13">13 October 2009</phrase> I wrote out to all CDRPs challenging them to develop and publicise a set of minimum standards for ASB and communicate that effectively to the public, including:</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/5" class="indent">reducing perceptions of ASB year on year;</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/6" class="indent">regular updates for every community on what is being done to tackle antisocial behaviour-including an expectation to publicise ASBOs to the local community;</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/7" class="indent">offer support and practical help to victims of ASB;</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/8" class="indent">provide residents with a right of complaint when effective action is not taken by local agencies through existing channels; and</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/9" class="indent">taking reports of ASB seriously by recording and investigating all cases and committing to keeping victims informed of action taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.979W.3/10">I am particularly pleased that Coventry community safety partnership has already been proactive in devising the minimum standards and that in September 2009 produced a synopsis for the Home Office, which showed how they already deal with and publicise many, varied aspects of ASB and related crime in terms of response times, reporting outcomes to callers, use of enforcement activity and use of council weblinks by which to report and get feedback on information.</p>

	<p pid="d.993W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence is continually looking at ways of monitoring and mitigating the risk in operational areas, including the development of improved hearing protection which does not hamper the operational effectiveness of combat personnel.</p>
	<p pid="d.993W.3/2">The Surgeon General (SG) has set up a multi-disciplinary Defence Hearing Working Group (DHWG) to address the impact of current operations on the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in serving personnel, set in the wider context of the Health and Safety-led MOD Hearing Conservation Programme, changing legislation and emerging technology. Compared with civilians who may suffer hearing loss due to industrial noise exposure, the relationship between troops' exposure to noise on military operations and hearing impairment is a complex one. Since January 2009, MOD has been working with the charity Deafness Research UK to develop a number of lines of research that will not only provide a more robust means of diagnosis but will also ensure that personnel have the most effective possible protection from hearing loss. Deafness Research UK hosted a highly successful symposium in December 2009, bringing together experts from the field of hearing impairment with members of the Defence Hearing Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="d.993W.3/3">Regarding protective systems, on the present deployment in Afghanistan, some 3,000 sets of an improved hearing protection system known as personalised interfaced hearing protection (PIHP) are in use by front-line troops. This innovative system has been designed to protect against impulse and continuous noise, to be comfortable to wear for prolonged periods, to be compatible with personal radios, not to interfere with equipment designed to counter improvised explosive devices, and to allow the user to keep situational awareness.</p>
	<p pid="d.993W.3/4">Data held centrally does not allow a comprehensive summary of how many Service personnel are recorded as having experienced hearing loss as a consequence of their duty in each year since 1990. The DHWG work now in progress includes improved data capture to allow the effects of current operations on the hearing of personnel to be assessed op a proper basis. However, patients who have attended or been admitted to our field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan within the 'ear/nose/ throat' (ENT) medical classification can be identified. These data are shown in Table 1 and include UK Service personnel, other NATO forces, civilians (both UK and nationals) and detainees. Note that this information is not limited to those with complaints related to hearing damage, but includes all ENT patients.</p>

	<p pid="d.996W.6/1">The MOD takes any attacks on its information networks and associated media storage devices very seriously and has robust procedures in place to mitigate against and investigate such occurrences. Furthermore new processes, instructions and technological aids are continually being implemented to mitigate human errors and raise the awareness of every individual in the Department with regards to cyber security.</p>
	<p pid="d.996W.6/2">If malicious software is detected on either a network or a memory stick its origin is researched to gain insight for its subsequent containment, and mitigation practices are introduced. However no specific instances of deliberate attack, successful or otherwise, would ever be publicly divulged so as to protect the integrity of the networks from widespread scrutiny and invoke further malicious attempts. All related security issues are investigated thoroughly by a number of related MOD cyber organisations and the MOD has established significant relationships with other agencies to assist in security issues, mitigation and risk management. These include working with Centre for the Protection of the National Infrastructure (CPNI), the CESG (as the National Technical Authority), Other Government Departments and foreign allies. The MOD has also established ongoing strong relationships with the Office of Cyber Security (OCS) and Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) to help maintain awareness of threats and vulnerabilities. These engagements together ensure our cyber defences are as robust as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.996W.6/3">On the technical front there are ongoing developments across Government on cyber to increase the protection of the infrastructure from attack. These include revised policies on the use of portable media and enhancements to the MOD's Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) Computer Network Defence (CND) architecture and also the introduction of measures that ensure only MOD-procured memory sticks can link with the DII network.</p>

	<p pid="d.1000W.8/1">The home condition report (HCR) remains authorised for inclusion in the home information pack (HIP) on a voluntary basis and certificated home inspectors are accredited to produce domestic energy performance certificates (EPCs) which are a required component of the home information pack. No such assessment of the job opportunities of home inspectors has been made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1000W.8/2">Communities and Local Government does not hold information on the number of people who have paid fees to train as home inspectors, or the number of people who have undertaken or are undertaking such training. The most recent figure supplied to us by the national EPC and HCR register operator, shows that there are 971 certificated home inspectors as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-04">4 January 2010</phrase>. This figure may include duplicate numbers of those home inspectors who have registered with more than one certification scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1000W.8/3">Although since the decision in July 2006 to make the HCR an authorised rather than required document, we continued to promote the benefits of including an HCR within a HIP. However, take-up has been disappointing with only 327 reports lodged on the central register since <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August 2007</phrase> and it is clear that the product as it stands is not seen as the right one either by consumers or industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1000W.8/4">We still believe that consumers should be better informed about any property they are looking to buy before making what is undoubtedly one of the biggest purchases of their lives and that they want information about the condition of homes before they commit to buying them. As a result Margaret Beckett established the Working Group on condition information in the home buying and selling process to explore options for ensuring consumers receive appropriate information about a property's condition before they commit to buy, by building on existing products such as the HCR, and creating opportunities for all practitioners including home inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="d.1003W.6/2">The Equality Measurement Framework will in large part use existing information sources from national surveys and administrative data sets, such as statistics from the British Crime Survey, Census, Crown Prosecution Service, Health and Safety Executive, Labour Force Survey and Office for National Statistics Opinions Survey.</p>
	<p pid="d.1003W.6/3">The Commission will also be asking data providers to consider developing these sources in ways that will allow more analysis which would be utilised by the Equality Measurement Framework.

	<p pid="d.1026W.8/1">'High Quality for All: NHS Next Stage Review Final Report' (2008) committed primary care trusts to work in partnership with local authorities to commission comprehensive well-being and prevention services particularly covering obesity, alcohol harm, drug addiction, smoking, sexual health and mental health. A copy has already been placed in the Library. The Department has also sponsored guidance to improve commissioning of preventive services which was published by the Royal Society of Public Health in December 2009, and this is part of a programme of work to improve commissioning of health and well-being services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1026W.8/2">Community pharmacies already play a key role providing local services such as stopping smoking, weight management and supporting drug misusers. A range of other initiatives and approaches are also being introduced to encourage the take up of preventive services and to offer support, such as the Lets Get Moving initiative which screens for physical inactivity. Other screening programmes include those for breast, cervical and bowel cancer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1027W.2/1">Improving stroke care is a national priority for the national health service and is a tier one vital sign in the NHS Operating Framework. Data collected on primary care trusts performance against the vital sign show improvements in the delivery of patient care for stroke patients. Now almost 60 per cent. of people spend 90 per cent. of their time in a stroke unit; a marked improvement since publication of the National Stroke Strategy. The most recent Royal College of Physicians' &quot;National Sentinel Stroke Audit&quot; conducted in 2008 shows a consistent improvement in performance across nine key indicators; for example there are increasing numbers of hospitals with acute stroke beds with 96 per cent. of hospitals in England now offering specialist acute stroke care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1027W.2/2">Since the strategy was published in December 2007, 28 stroke networks have been set up across England to work with commissioners and providers to improve services, and thereby, patient outcomes. Evaluation of the first part of the ACT F.A.S.T campaign has shown this to be one of the most effective public awareness campaigns having reached 82 per cent. of the population. The campaign has led to an increase of 55 per cent. in stroke-related 999 calls.</p>
	<p pid="d.1027W.2/3">We intend to commission an independent evaluation of the implementation of the National Stroke Strategy later this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.1043W.9/1">The Government strives to strike the right balance between maintaining the most secure and effective border controls in the world, and ensuring that the visa fees structure does not inhibit the UK's ability to attract those migrants and visitors that make a valued contribution. The Home Office reviews fees and charges annually to reflect changes to operating costs and to its strategic approach. Fees are set following a full discussion with departments, including DCMS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1043W.9/2">As part of that process, my officials attend regular meetings of the cross-Whitehall Fees Committee, chaired by the Home Office, which last met in December. The Minister for identity at the Home Office and I also met in December to discuss the impact of visa processes on UK tourism. This followed our discussion at a meeting of the ministerial group on tourism in November. We will continue to work together to ensure a proper balance between effective border controls and a vibrant visitor economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1048W.8/1">Scientific publications on the subject, for example, Kiehl and Trenberth (1997, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) report that carbon dioxide contributes around 27 per cent. to the globally averaged greenhouse gas effect, water vapour around 60 per cent., and methane about 3 per cent. The amount of water vapour present, and hence its contribution to the greenhouse gas effect, depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. It therefore acts to amplify the contribution of the other greenhouse gases.</p>

With the exception of nuclear power the department has not produced any of the requested estimates. With respect to per unit life cycle emissions, the 2008 White Paper on nuclear power estimated that the life-cycle emissions from nuclear power were in the range of 7-22gCO2/kWh of electricity generated. The white paper references two papers which have produced estimates of life cycle emissions per kWh. Nuclear Energy and the Kyoto Protocol (2002) OECD Nuclear Energy Agency; Assessing the difference: Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Electricity Generation Chains (2000) IAEA Bulletin. We summarise the information provided by these papers as follows for other technologies and our estimates for nuclear.</p>

	<p pid="d.1050W.6/1">The Government consider the Approved Mileage Allowance Payment (AMAP) rates to be a fair reflection of the costs of business motoring for the vast majority of drivers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1050W.6/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) conducted a review of the interaction between Approved Mileage Allowance Payments (AMAPs) and Employee Car Ownership Schemes during 2007. The resulting report was published alongside the 2008 pre-Budget report and is available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.1050W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2008/comp-car-tax-805.pdf">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2008/comp-car-tax-805.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1050W.6/4">As part of this review, the Department canvassed the views of over 30 other Government Departments. However, the review did not cover the impact of approved mileage allowance payment rates on voluntary drivers because these rates are primarily for employees.</p>
	<p pid="d.1050W.6/5">HMRC accept that volunteer drivers who use their own cars and are reimbursed at or below the AMAPs rates do not make a taxable profit. Alternatively, volunteer drivers can be reimbursed the full cost of motoring provided they are able to demonstrate what those costs were. Fuel is one of the factors taken into account in setting AMAP rates, as are other costs of running a private car.</p>
	<p pid="d.1050W.6/6">All taxes are kept under review with any decisions, including public consultations, announced by the Chancellor as part of the Budget process.</p>

	<p pid="d.1063W.3/2">Over 20,000 two-year-olds already have access to free places and we will continue to make progress on the long-term ambition to provide free part-time nursery places for all two-year-olds whose parents want them. The reforms the Government are making to tax relief for Childcare Vouchers will allow us to go further. Two-year-old places will continue to be rolled out stage-by-stage in each of the next three financial years.</p>
