	<p pid="a.523W.3/1">0.8 per cent. of electricity used on the Government Estate when the target was set, around 23 GWh/yr, was Good Quality CHP electricity. Departments are required to put in place strategies for delivering the CHP and other targets in accordance with the Energy chapter of the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. We project that this will amount to 350&ndash;400 GWh/yr for Good Quality CHP in 2010. This assumes the 2010 target of increasing energy efficiency by 15 per cent. is achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.523W.6/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme estimates that the 60 million television sets in the UK consume approximately 3 million Kwh per day while they are in standby mode&mdash;approximately 8 per cent. of their total average daily energy consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.6/2">In order to try to reduce the overall energy consumed by televisions the Market Transformation Programme (<a href="http://www.mtprog.com">www.mtprog.com</a>) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the &quot;standby&quot; power consumption of televisions through the adoption of design improvements, an EU-wide voluntary code of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.6/3">The EU-wide voluntary agreement on televisions has been particularly successful in reducing the average energy consumed by televisions in standby mode with the majority of new televisions sold in the UK soon to consume around 1 watt of power in standby mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 watts consumed by older models. We expect this agreement to be extended to cover additional consumer electronics shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.6/4">In addition, the Government&quot;s initiative on sustainable procurement, announced last autumn, includes a requirement for Government Departments which purchase televisions to specify televisions with standby power requirements of less that 1 watt.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.2/1">We have no plans to introduce a general policy to cover all feral animals. The management of wildlife, whether feral or not, is dealt with on a species by species basis, as and when control is required, with action being taken by a range of different bodies, and by individual landowners and occupiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.2/2">One of the key recommendations arising from the Working Group report on the Review of Non-Native Species Policy (2003) was that policies should be established with respect to the management and control of invasive non-native species currently present or newly arrived in the wild. To this end research has been commissioned by English Nature to establish an environmental audit of non-native species within England (replicating a similar audit of species in Scotland by Scottish Natural Heritage), and by Defra to develop a standard methodology for carrying out risk assessments on species, pathways and receptor habitats. The results of this research will inform Government policy on the control of non-native species in the wild.</p>

	<p pid="a.532W.2/1">The report of the decennial national child dental health survey 2003 shows that dental decay in 8, 12 and 15-year-old children has decreased since 1983 to its lowest recorded level. 12-year-old children in England have the best oral health of that age group in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/2">The targets set in 1994 were that 12-year-olds should have no more than an average of 1.0 teeth with decay experience, 70 per cent. of five-year-olds should have no decay experience and that five-year-olds should have no more than an average of 1.0 teeth with decay experience. The 2003 survey found that 12-year-olds in England had an average of 0.7 teeth with obvious decay experience, 59 per cent. of five-year-olds in England had no primary teeth with obvious decay experience and the average number of primary teeth with obvious decay in five-year-olds was 1.5. Therefore the target for 12-year-olds was achieved with a substantial margin, but those for five-year-olds were not met.</p>
	<p pid="a.532W.2/3">The fluoridation of water offers the best prospect for improving the oral health of children. The 2003 Water Act transferred responsibility for deciding whether an area&quot;s water supply should be fluoridated from the water company to the strategic health authority (SHA)&mdash;provided that the local population is in favour.

	<p pid="a.534W.0/2">The Government of Iraq has said that it is committed over the medium term to enhancing the effectiveness of social safety nets in Iraq by moving from a food ration system, which handed out virtually free food to the entire population of Iraq, to a cash distribution system targeted at the poor and unemployed. The aim will be to help domestic agriculture, encourage private trade and remove price distortions, at the same time as ensuring that families in need are properly safeguarded. The details have yet to be determined, and are expected to be followed up by the Iraqi Transitional Government after the forthcoming elections. DFID supports the reform in principle. DFID staff and advisers will continue to maintain contact with the Iraqi authorities, and with interested international organisations including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Food Programme, to ensure that the interests of poor and vulnerable families in Iraq are protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.2/1">Since 2001, the EC has suspended normal development assistance in Zimbabwe and has redirected its assistance to those sectors that directly support the population. The main areas of intervention under the European Development Fund (EDF) are in humanitarian assistance, health, education and community development sectors. Humanitarian assistance focuses on food security and targets support to rural vulnerable households, through seed and fertiliser packs and small-scale irrigation schemes. The health programme contributes to the availability of safe blood and the supply of essential drugs. The education programme provides school improvement grants and the community development support is mainly for micro projects, involving small grants to communities along similar lines to the UK Government's small grant scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.536W.0/3">A joint letter from myself and the National Director for Languages was sent earlier this year to all Chief Education Officers reminding them of the statutory requirements at Key Stage 4 and asking them to monitor the situation and promote modern foreign languages within their authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.0/4">While we anticipate a temporary decline in the number of pupils choosing to follow a course in modern foreign languages at Key Stage 4, the introduction of an entitlement to study languages at Key Stage 2 together with the implementation of the Key Stage 3 Modern Foreign Languages Framework&mdash;which has already had a positive impact on attitudes and achievement&mdash;will engage and enthuse more pupils to continue to learn languages from age 14 into adulthood. By providing opportunities other than the traditional GCSEs and A-levels, we are giving more accreditation opportunities which we hope will motivate more learners to study languages at Key Stage 4.</p>

	<p pid="a.541W.2/1">Since 2001 the Home Office has held three focus groups with young people to discuss the ways in which crime impacts on them and how to reduce crime against young people. The Home Office was a partner in the Children and Young People's Unit's (now part of the Department for Education and Skills) major conference &quot;Safely on our Streets&quot; where young people voiced their opinions on four topic areas; alcohol, transport, victims of crime and mobile phone theft.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/2">The Home Office has also held events to tackle specific types of crime against young people. The Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet, established in 2001, meets on a quarterly basis with additional meetings of the taskforce subgroups and working parties taking place in a regular basis. A series of discussion forums have been held with young people about reducing the likelihood of them being victims of mobile phone theft. In August 2004 Ministers from the Home Office and Department for Education and Skill wrote to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) encouraging them to hold workshops on youth robbery. Half have already done so, the other half are planning to. A conference on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October 2004</phrase> also included a workshop on youth robbery.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/3">In addition to the discussion forums, conferences and focus groups held on crime reduction, other events have been organised to tackle antisocial behaviour and youth crime. For example an International Seminar on Youth Crime held in October 2002, examined the reduction of crime committed both by young people and against young people. Preparations for this included a meeting with the youth crime focus group and the organisation of a focus group in Huntercombe Youth Offenders Institute.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.0/2">The hearing of Mr. Roberts' case before a Parole Board panel has not yet taken place as a result of a series of judicial challenges over the non-disclosure of sensitive information in the parole dossier.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.0/3">The first of those challenges was resolved on the basis of a consent order agreed by all parties that the question of non-disclosure to Mr. Roberts was a matter for the Parole Board. It was also agreed that the material in question should be disclosed to a Specially Appointed Advocate (SAA) who would act on the prisoner's behalf at a Directions hearing before the legal chairman of the Parole Board panel that was to hear Mr. Roberts' case. In May 2003, the chairman subsequently directed that the sensitive material should be disclosed only to the SAA.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.0/4">Those decisions were then challenged on various grounds before the High Court in December 2003, at which Mr. Roberts was represented by the SAA in closed session. The Court of Appeal heard the case in July 2004. In dismissing the challenges on both occasions, the courts considered that the Parole Board had the inherent power and discretion under Section 32(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and the Parole Board Rules to adopt the necessary procedures to enable it to perform its risk assessment task. In Mr. Roberts' case, the courts held that the Parole Board's adoption of the SAA process, as a wholly exceptional measure in the circumstances of that case, was proportionate, correct and fair to Mr. Roberts.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.5/1">The changes made to the Tariff Scheme in 2001 included an increase of about 10 per cent. in tariff bands 7&ndash;23 inclusive, higher awards in sex cases, higher awards for serious multiple injuries, some re-ordering and re-wording of several injury descriptions (including many of those for physical and sexual abuse), and the addition of a number of new injury descriptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.5/2">All successful applicants submitting claims after these changes came into force, including prisoners who were victims of historical sex abuse, would have benefited from these improvements.

	<p pid="a.553W.7/1">In September 2004 the Department received representations from Peter Caton, Campaign Co-ordinator of the Stand Up Sit Down campaign asking the Government to consider their proposals for the reintroduction of standing at Premier League and First Division football matches.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.7/2">The Department has also received a number of letters from Members of Parliament following representations they have received from their constituents asking the Government to consider the Stand Up Sit Down proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.7/3">Having carefully considered the Stand Up Sit Down solutions, it is clear that these measures would run against the Government's current policy that football grounds in the top two divisions shall be all-seated. There is also a concern that the proposal would seek to introduce standing accommodation without the safeguards that are currently required on standing terraces in the lower divisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.7/4">The all-seater policy has been in place since 1991, following Lord Justice Taylor's report into the Hillsborough disaster. Lord Taylor summarised his position by saying that there is no cure-all solution that will achieve complete safety and solve all problems to do with crowd behaviour and control. However he was satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.7/5">Following a pre-election commitment, the Government reviewed the all-seater policy in consultation with the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) in 1997. That review concurred with Lord Taylor's conclusion that seated accommodation is demonstrably safer than standing accommodation, regardless of how the stadium is configured.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.7/6">The FLA's figures for injuries at UK stadia over recent seasons consistently show that spectators are approximately twice as likely to be injured at grounds where standing is permitted, compared to all-seater stadia.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.2/1">Postal services on the parliamentary estate have never been subject to a formal competitive tender and it was recognised that this was in breach of EU directives, and could attract legal challenge from other suppliers and from the EU Commission itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.2/2">Royal Mail advised the House in October 2003 that, following their own internal review of mail services supplied to Parliament, they were seeking to increase costs by over 200 per cent. just to maintain the status quo. Parliament has a duty to protect the public purse and justifying such a significant price increase while seeking an exemption from the competitive process was not sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.2/3">Given these facts it was decided that a tendering exercise was essential to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and to comply with EU regulations. It was necessary to advertise the mail service in OJEU and this was done in February 2004. Four firms (including Royal Mail) have been shortlisted to receive invitations to tender early in 2005.</p>

As a result, this answer has been prepared using the Portable Appliance Testing records for 2004 which includes all moveable items but excludes items of plant.

	<p pid="a.568W.2/2">The special measures provisions are contained in Part II Chapter I of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. They enable appropriate assistance to be provided across the range of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/3">Because of the special nature of sexual offences and the sensitive nature of the evidence that is given, victims of sexual offences are automatically eligible for special measures. This is also the case for young witnesses. Other witnesses will be eligible for assistance if the court considers that the quality of their evidence may be diminished on the grounds of a mental disorder, learning disability or physical disability or disorder, or because of their fear or distress about testifying. In the latter case the court must take into account a range of factors including the domestic circumstances of the witness, any behaviour towards the witness on the part of the accused, and the nature and alleged circumstances of the offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/4">Domestic violence victims will be eligible for assistance if they meet these requirements. We would expect courts to be sensitive to the needs of victims of domestic violence and grant special measures where it would be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.2/5">The roll-out of special measures is ongoing and work is underway as part of the &quot;No Witness No Justice&quot; initiative. This will give a single point of contact to the witness and will provide a tailored needs assessment not only for their requirements at trial, but also for the period from charge to trial. The Government believes that it would be best to complete the implementation of these measures and then review their effectiveness before considering whether any changes to the legislation are needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.3/1">These three complementary anti-armour weapons have fundamentally different characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.3/2">Brimstone is an air launched anti-armour missile system with a range of over 10,000 m. It will be carried by fast jet aircraft and operates autonomously after firing to search a given area for vehicles. In contrast, both the Next Generation Light And Armour Weapon (NLAW) and Light Forces Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (LF ATGW) are man-portable ground based systems. NLAW is a short-range lightweight unguided weapon that will have broad applications across the services with a simple, but highly capable and versatile anti-armour capability. The LF ATGW, based on the US Javelin system, is a more sophisticated guided weapon with a range of some 2,500 m. Javelin will equip Light Forces, Mechanised and Armoured Infantry, and Formation Reconnaissance units.</p>

	<p pid="a.577W.8/1">The aim of the proposed REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) is to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment from hazardous substances across the EU, while also ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market, and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the industries affected by it. These aims will be achieved by improving the information available to users of substances, including consumers, and public authorities on the potential risks posed by substances.</p>

	<p pid="a.577W.8/3">The continuing negotiations on REACH will seek to remove barriers to agreement among member states by improving the proposals further. The Government are seeking to reach political agreement under the UK Presidency of the EU during the second half of this year.</p>
