Costs that the Department would have incurred anyway, such as wages and salaries, are not included and are met from the core Defence budget.

In 2007-08 these activities were carried out by the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Ministry of Defence under the auspices of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, which is not part of the Defence budget.

	<p pid="a.203W.5/2">Public service pension upratings are linked by primary legislation to those for additional state pensions, such as the state second pension, and the uprating in April 2010 will take account of the rate of inflation over the year to September 2009. As announced at the pre-Budget report 2008, legislation governing uprating for additional state pensions means that in the event of a negative Retail Price Index (RPI), benefit rates will be protected at least in nominal terms (i.e. not reduced on account of deflation), thereby providing an increase in support in real terms. The RPI change for September 2009 was minus 1.4 per cent., therefore benefits will remain at current levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.203W.8/1">The deferral of the Operational Utility Vehicle System (OUVS) competition will give the MOD the opportunity to consider the latest products from industry, including those from the companies that withdrew from the original OUVS competition. This will allow the MOD to determine the best method of delivering an operational utility vehicle capability for the future. During the period of the two year deferral, the Tactical Support Vehicles purchased as Urgent Operational Requirements will fulfil the OUVS role in Afghanistan. The Department will conduct a thorough review of the commercial and acquisition strategy for OUVS during 2010. This will consider production and delivery schedules, and the capability requirement informed by our operational experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.213W.8/1">A number of steps have been taken to reduce levels of unemployment among disabled people since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/2">In July 2001 the new deal for disabled people was launched. This is a programme of advice and practical support, which helps people move from disability and health-related benefits into paid employment. The programme is delivered through a network of 'Job Brokers' offering different services, which can be tailored to a customer's individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/3">April 2008 saw the introduction of Pathways to Work in Surrey and Sussex, which includes the Lewes constituency. This programme helps claimants of incapacity benefits or employment and support allowance get work by offering individual support and access to a wide range of help, including work-focused interviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/4">The public consultation 'Helping people achieve their full potential: Improving Specialist Disability Employment Services' was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase> to help shape the future of specialist disability employment provision. The new programme, Work Choice, which replaces existing specialist disability employment programmes, will be introduced in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/5">Employment and support allowance replaced incapacity benefits for new customers nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>. Employment and support allowance has a greater work-focus than its predecessors. It also has a more modern and robust medical assessment, which helps to identify the help that people need to ensure they can fulfil their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/6">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme that helps disabled people overcome work-related obstacles. It is flexible, easy to access and shows high levels of satisfaction from disabled people and their employers. The Access to Work base budget has been increased from &#163;15 million in 1994-95 to &#163;81 million in 2009-10 and will continue to grow to &#163;138 million by 2013-14. We are also working to improve the programme to ensure it helps people with mental health conditions more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/7">The refreshed jobseeker's allowance regime and flexible new deal went live in Surrey and Sussex in October 2009. This is designed to offer personalised and more intensive support to customers, including those with disabilities, to help overcome barriers to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/8">More generally, all jobseekers have full access to Jobcentre Plus vacancy services to enhance their employment opportunities. We recognise that some disabled customers may have a more limited availability and scope to find and carry out certain types of work. Therefore, at the start of their claim customers are asked to tell their adviser about any disabilities that might have such an impact, and can restrict their work search activity and availability for work if those restrictions are reasonable, given their condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/9">Customers with a disability can volunteer to be fast-tracked to the six month stage of jobseeker's allowance, subject to the Jobcentre Plus personal advisers' agreement. This allows disabled people to access additional intensive support earlier in their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.8/10">Disability employment advisers are available to provide specialist support to people facing employment barriers because of a disability. They can advise customers about a range of specialised support available, and provide advice on job retention if a person is concerned about losing their job because of their disability. They are supported by work psychologists and various external disability specialists.</p>

	<p pid="a.218W.3/2"><i> </i>Changes in the number of farmers is just one element of the structural changes that have taken place in the sector. The long-term trend in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds. The following table provides the fuller picture on the structural changes in the sector and shows how the decline in the number of dairy farms and dairy farmers has been offset by an increase in average herd size and milk yields.</p>
	<p pid="a.218W.3/3">The number of principal farmers on dairy holdings is not yet available for 2009. The decrease in the numbers of dairy farmers in England between 1997 and 2008 (-34 per cent.) is less than the fall in the number of holdings with dairy cows between 2008 and 2009 (-48 per cent.). This reflects a rise in the average number of farmers per farm over the period as the average farm size has increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.218W.3/4">However, the numbers of dairy cows has decreased by less (-30 per cent.), reflecting a rise in the average herd size, and (at the UK level) milk yields have increased by 22 per cent. over the period, so that total UK milk production has fallen by 8 per cent. between 1997 and 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.219W.2/1">We worked closely with Dairy Farmers of Britain (DFoB) Members Council, the Receivers (PricewaterhouseCoopers) and others towards our common goal of minimising the impacts of those affected, particularly farmer members of DFoB including those in Staffordshire, following DFoB's entry into administration last June.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/2">We ensured that all available assistance was given to those facing difficulties. This included advice from DFoB Members Council, the Receiver, National Farmers Union and Regional Development Agencies. For example, Business Link's Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme and HMRC's Business Payment Support Service, which might enable those affected to defer certain tax and national insurance payments. The Secretary of State also wrote to both the British Bankers' Association and the Agricultural Industries Confederation to ask their members to consider any short term cash flow problems faced by farmers sympathetically. In the succeeding weeks, 97 per cent. of the 1,813 active DFoB members found new contracts and buyers for their milk.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/3">Dairy farmers, including those in Staffordshire, are eligible for payments under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). The Rural Payments Agency has made continued progress in making more timely SPS payments and this has helped farmers' cash flow, with around &#163;1.5 billion (just under 78 per cent.) paid by the end of December under the 2009 scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/4">In addition, dairy farmers are eligible for funding under DEFRA's &#163;600 million Rural Development Programme for England 2007-13. This includes over &#163;107 million which is being targeted specifically at the livestock sector to help it meet the particular challenges that it faces. Through this, Advantage West Midlands are able to assist farmers through capital investments to increase competitiveness or diversification into other activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.221W.0/2">No estimate has been made of the cost to the agricultural industry of the cross compliance cattle and sheep inspections. However, with regard to these inspections, farmers need not do anything more than they are already required to do by the pre-existing cattle and sheep legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.221W.0/3">Farmers are not charged for the costs of an inspection but may incur some costs in terms of time spent with inspectors. Significant non-compliance with EU cross compliance requirements may result in additional inspections and/or the reduction or exclusion of their single payment scheme claim. For individual farmers, the costs of these will vary depending on the degree of non-compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.223W.5/1">The EU Commission is responsible for the negotiation, monitoring and control of the Partnership Agreement. This includes monitoring of the situation via analysis of customs import data as well as market intelligence and prices gathered from member states, particularly Spain and France who are most affected by such imports. We understand that Commission officials regularly meet with the Moroccan authorities and representatives of their horticulture sector to ensure compliance with the Agreement. It should be noted that there is no limit on the amount of tomatoes that Morocco can import into the EU. The agreement includes a quota which can be imported at a preferential rate of import duty, but imports outside are subject to the normal rates of import duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.223W.9/1">Chlorpromazine belongs to a class of drugs called antipsychotics which are mainly used to treat mental health conditions including schizophrenia and other psychoses.</p>
	<p pid="a.223W.9/2">The safety, efficacy and quality of each medicine, including chlorpromazine hydrochloride is thoroughly evaluated as part of the licensing procedure by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and monitored throughout the lifecycle of the medicine. Prescribing guidance for healthcare professionals to optimise the safe use of antipsychotics is contained within the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the medicines and is also available in the British National Formulary distributed to doctors and pharmacists; this information is reflected in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) that should accompany the medicine. Guidance on the use of antipsychotics has also been issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.223W.9/3">Since the marketing of chlorpromazine, the MHRA in conjunction with its independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines and its predecessors, has kept the safety of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics under close review. In recent years, emerging safety data has been considered on a number of occasions by the MHRA at a European level with particular focus on the effects of antipsychotics on the heart, the risk of stroke in the elderly and the risk of venous thromboembolic events. As a result of these reviews, the SmPC and the PIL for antipsychotics have been updated accordingly to reflect the findings of these reviews. The MHRA has also informed healthcare professionals and patients of the outcome of these reviews and the updated prescribing guidance through the regular drug safety bulletin, Drug Safety Update, and information posted on the MHRA website.</p>

Medical practitioners and coroners are not supposed to record all of the diseases or conditions present at or before death, and whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgement.</p>

	<p pid="a.246W.2/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/2" class="italic"> Away <i> d</i> ays</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/3">Away days are held mainly for team building, team training or business development activities. Such events are held off-site where suitable on-site accommodation is unavailable and where the conduct of the event is facilitated by holding it away from day to day business operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/4">The Ministry's accounting systems do not separately quantify expenditure on away days. Costs are subsumed within other categories of expenditure depending on their nature and purpose, for example conferences/events or training. It would incur disproportionate costs to scrutinise all the individual transactions which might potentially include away day costs across the Ministry and its executive agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/5">All spending on away days is completed in line with the finance policy manual, which is in line with HM Treasury Guidance on Managing Public Money, and states the following for away days and team building events:</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/6" class="indent">&quot;These occasional events are organised to develop working relationships and achieve Departmental objectives. They are acceptable as long as the event can be justified as good value for money and can demonstrate development achievements. Costs should be reasonable and comparable to the status of the event&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/7">Wherever possible, taking, into account room availability, size and flexibility, managers are expected to use Ministry or other public sector buildings for team events and away days rather than using external venues.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/8" class="italic"> Conferences</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/9">The Ministry's accounting system records a wider category of expenditure-'conferences and events'-for headquarters, Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS) and the Tribunals Service. The National Offender Management Service's (NOMS) accounting system records 'conferences and exhibitions' but their procurement system is able to isolate costs that relate to attendance at conferences. Expenditure on this basis since the inception of the Ministry of Justice for headquarters and its four executive agencies (NOMS, HMCS, Tribunals Service and the Office of the Public Guardian) is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.246W.2/12"> <td><i> Financial period</i></td> <td><i> &#163;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.246W.2/13"> <td>2008-09</td> <td>5,875,035</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.246W.2/14"> <td>2007-08</td> <td>4,256,611</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/17">The amounts above exclude expenditure by the 42 local probation boards and trusts within NOMS as this information is held locally and could be collated only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/18">As part of the Ministry's ongoing efforts to improve value for money and secure efficiencies, an exercise is currently underway to examine the individual transactions that make up the preceding totals. Work completed to date indicates that some of the expenditure relates more properly to away days or training events rather than conferences. The number of individual conferences attended cannot therefore be determined at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/19">The increasingly cross-cutting nature of government policy makes conferences an effective mechanism for bringing together stakeholders in the Government, private and voluntary sectors to promote a joined-up approach to the delivery of front line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.2/20">Bookings for conferences arid related expenditure must be made through designated contractors employed by the Ministry of Justice to identify venues and accommodation that offers best value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) endeavours to send as much of its food waste as possible for environmentally friendly treatment, such as composting or anaerobic digestion, rather than to landfill. The MOJ does not currently record food waste generated separately from general waste throughout the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/2">The total figure for food waste generated by the MOJ's headquarters from 2007 to 2009-10 is estimated to be 341 tonnes. This is based on a waste audit carried out by waste and recycling contractors in August 2009. The National Archives estimates that the food waste it generates each year is approximately three tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.2/12">HM Prison Service carried out two surveys as part of a business case to evaluate requirements for in-vessel composting and de-watering technology with the overall aim of providing an effective solution to sites with food waste disposal issues and upholding the philosophy of &quot;waste to resource&quot;, which means taking waste and processing it into a useful, useable product and adding value to it. In 2006, based on 32 prisons, on average 1.45 kg of food per prison place were wasted per week. In 2007, based on 51 prisons, the figure was 1.34 kg of food waste per prison place per week.</p>

	<p pid="a.247W.2/21">The use of de-watering and in-vessel composting technology has been introduced at around 35 prisons to process food waste into compost. The compost is used on prison gardens and horticultural activities thereby reducing the requirement for bought-in compost and contributing towards the HM Prison Service strategy for phasing out peat-based products.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/22">Additionally, a small scale anaerobic digestion plant has been installed in Guy Marsh Prison with the objective of processing biodegradable wastes, including food waste, into biogas.</p>

	<p pid="a.252W.5/1">New prison officers are required to complete a one year foundation training programme, leading to a level 3 National Vocational Qualification in Custodial Care. Training begins with an eight week Prison Officer Entry Level Training course. The training covers the practical skills needed to be a prison officer and includes areas such as interpersonal skills, diversity and self harm/suicide awareness.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.5/2">All staff in regular contact with prisoners are required to undertake the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) Foundation course. This is a three-hour course which covers the risks associated with self-harm and suicide, and the ACCT process and documentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.5/3">In addition, the Women Awareness Staff Programme, designed to raise awareness of as many aspects of working with women prisoners as possible, has been accredited and is now being delivered across the women's estate. The course includes modules on, security; self-harm and abuse. It is the intention that all staff and volunteers working in the women's prison estate will undertake the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.253W.2/1">The number of probation service staff whose primary task is offender facing work in England is 67.9 per cent., in Wales 63.2 per cent. and in Dyfed-Powys 65.6 per cent. Our statistics record staff undertaking duties involving face to face contact with offenders as: qualified probation officers (PO), probation service officers (PSO), trainee probation officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/2">Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face to face contact with offenders. In December 2008, the NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one week period, based on a small sample of PO and PSO staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24 per cent. of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41 per cent. was involved in computer activity and 35 per cent. of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc. The equivalent figures in the same survey for Dyfed-Powys were 21 per cent., 45 per cent. and 34 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/3">The reporting of the results against only three main headings means that much of the detail is open to interpretation. For example, time spent on computer activity is productive time, in that it involves the production of reports and assessments on individual cases. The recording of risk assessments, which is an integral part of this work, is vital to ongoing case management, and the proper recording of case information is essential to the provision of statistical information which can be deployed to develop NOMS's offender management strategy. Even if only about three-quarters of this time were included as work on cases this gives a picture of more like 54 per cent. of time being spent on work with individual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/4">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is taking action to increase the amount of time staff spend in face-to face contact with offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/5">NOMS will achieve this by:</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/6" class="indent">allocating resources to the assessment and management of offenders according to the level of risk;</p>
	<p pid="a.253W.2/7" class="indent">the creation of probation trusts;</p>

Between 1999 and 2003, &#163;170 million of Home Office capital funding under the Crime Reduction Programme was made available to local authorities for investment in public space CCTV. Around 680 CCTV town centre schemes were set up with this funding.

The effect of extending the coverage and changing the counting rules in 1998 was to artificially increase total recorded crime nationally by 14 per cent.

The basis for that implied power, whether in respect of an extradition request from the USA or from any other of the UK's many extradition partners, is section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. It follows that the new issue must be evidence that extradition would breach the person's convention rights. In deciding that question, the Secretary of State considers thoroughly all of the issues raised taking account of legal advice available to him and recognising that his decision in such cases is susceptible to challenge by judicial review.</p>

	<p pid="a.273W.9/1">The Congolese Army (FARDC) have carried out operations in Equateur province against insurgents based in the south near Dongo. The UN peacekeeping mission (MONUC) has supplied logistical support to the FARDC in this. MONUC assistance has been on a conditional basis. The insurgents are still active and have carried out attacks against FARDC in early January 2010. Our assessment is that despite recent successes of the FARDC in reclaiming villages from the insurgents this situation is not over yet. The area is unsafe and we continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.273W.9/2">Difficult terrain and security concerns have prevented the humanitarian agencies getting access, although some are starting to deploy now, such as the World Food Programme. The UN humanitarian pooled fund is available to agencies which begin work there, last year DflD contributed &#163;35 million to the pooled fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.2/1">10 countries, including the UK, US and China-and the UN peacekeeping mission (MONUC)-are involved in training the Congolese army. Several countries from MONUC assist with training the more notable ones being Pakistan and India. MONUC are also just about to use Tanzanian troops which will train 12 Congolese Army (FARDC) Infantry battalions in the next year. This is part-funded by the UK who provided &#163;400,000 for Barrack Infrastructure Repairs for the training camps.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/2">We estimate that seven official languages are used in training. We recognise that language differences can hinder co-ordination; to respond to this the UK runs a 'peacekeeping English' course to ensure that the FARDC and MONUC can communicate effectively when working together. So far the UK has trained over 1,000 trainers, who can then go on to disseminate English teaching throughout the FARDC. We have also trained over 40 interpreters.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.2/22">There has also been significant investment to deliver new social housing in Nottingham through the National Affordable Housing Programme. Since 2004 Nottingham has received &#163; 13.3 million to deliver new homes for rent or low cost home ownership including &#163;7 million so far through the current 2008-11 programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.2/23">The HCA has also funded Nottingham city council to develop a Local Housing Company to deliver an extra 5,000 new homes over the next five years and in 2009, Nottingham city council was successful in a &#163;200 million PFI bid to the HCA to transform the meadows neighbourhood. Both initiatives will provide a mix of social and private affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.5/1">The Government have a continuing commitment to the protection of green belt and its crucial characteristics of openness and permanence. Among the policies set out in PPG2 (Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, &quot;Green Belts&quot;) to guide decision-makers is a presumption against allowing inappropriate development on green belt land.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.5/2">Only in exceptional circumstances may green belt boundaries be altered. Any proposal for significant change in green belt area has to be made during the preparation of regional strategy. Any essential adjustment of the boundary of a green belt is for the local planning authority to propose as part of the local plan process. The Secretary of State monitors emerging regional strategies and local plans to ensure they are consistent with national policy. Government offices make representations to the independent examinations of draft RSSs and LDFs if the approach proposed is not consistent with PPG2. There are no plans to change the policy set out in PPG2.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.5/3">With regard to Coventry, the draft regional spatial strategy has been examined, including the need and justification for green belt adjustments around Coventry. The panel supported the case made in the draft RSS for green belt adjustments. The Secretary of State is currently preparing his proposed changes to the RSS which will be consulted on in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.5/4">The Coventry core strategy is currently at examination. The inspector appointed to examine the plan held hearing sessions on green belt matters, and considered evidence to justify the need, or otherwise to release land from the green belt. The hearing sessions ended on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-04">4 December</phrase> and the inspector's report into the soundness of the document is expected in April 2010.</p>

This means that they are now not taken into account in the disabled facilities grant means test. All local authorities require applicants to confirm whether they are in receipt of these as Communities and Local Government reimburse local authorities on an actual basis when a grant has been paid to qualifying former service personnel.

	<p pid="a.290W.5/1">Local Government has a target to achieve at least 3 per cent. efficiency savings per year over the first two years of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07) period (2008-09 and 2009-10) and 4 per cent. savings in 2010-11. Overall, we expect local authorities to achieve &#163;5.5 billion cumulative savings by the end of 2010-11, of which we expect &#163;3.2 billion to be delivered by 2009-10. Local authorities have recently forecast that they will deliver &#163;3.1 billion cumulative savings by the end of 2009-10. There are no expectations with respect to non-cashable efficiencies in the CSR07 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.290W.5/2">No target has been set for efficiency savings to be delivered in 2011-12. The 2009 pre-Budget report set out the potential for local government to make &#163;800 million savings by 2012-13, of which: &#163;550 million could come from more efficient waste collection and disposal, reducing the burden of inspection, assessment and reporting requirements from across government, and measures to reduce duplication and inefficiency between different tiers of local government; and &#163;250 million from reducing variations in spend on residential care. The pre-Budget report also stated that local government would make a significant contribution towards the &#163;8 billion of operational efficiency programme savings identified for delivery by 2012-13.</p>

	<p pid="a.293W.2/1">Valuation officers are responsible for deciding whether a hereditament should be assessed on a local rating list or on the central rating list. The criteria for allocating a hereditament to the central list are contained in the Central Rating List (England) Regulations 2005 SI 2005 No 551. Relevant non-domestic hereditaments which do not fall to be shown on the central rating list are assessed by valuation officers on local rating lists.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/2">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and no more by ensuring the share of the national rates bill paid by any one business reflects changes over time in the value of their property relative to others. The 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.293W.2/3">Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation. The Government intend to put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on the minority with bill increases. This is on top of the wider support available to help ease business pressures including discounted rate bills for small businesses and deferring tax payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.301W.11/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that those who are entitled to the national minimum wage (NMW) receive it. We have introduced a new, stronger, enforcement regime to deter non-compliance and since April 2009 HMRC have helped around 14,000 workers recoup over &#163;3.5 million of wage arrears. We are also working to increase wider awareness of the NMW for workers and employers through publicity and guidance on the Business Link website.</p>
	<p pid="a.301W.11/2">The NMW is a key part of the Government's vulnerable worker strategy. Last year, the Government launched a &#163;6 million, three-year information campaign to make sure that vulnerable workers are aware of their rights and of how to report abuses. As part of this, the Pay and Work Rights Helpline (0800 917 2368) simplifies and streamlines access to the workplace enforcement bodies, making it easier for vulnerable workers to report bad treatment at work.</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.3/1">Healthy eating is an important part of good physical and mental health and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Ensuring that children, young people and their families have the information, advice and support they need to make healthier choices in what they eat is a long-standing priority for the Government. Our approach is not just about giving advice, but also about providing healthy food in schools and other settings. We have made significant progress in the past 12 months to build on the work to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/2">Statutory nutritional standards for lunches provided in schools came into force for maintained primary schools in September 2008 and for maintained secondary and special schools in September 2009: this means that lunches provided in all maintained schools must now meet these standards. Food served in other parts of the school day or from vending machines must also meet statutory food-based standards. The proportion of children having school lunches has started to rise and parents can be confident that their children are eating a healthy, nutritious meal at school. The School Food Trust, as the Department's delivery partner, is working with schools and local authorities to promote and encourage take up of school meals, and we continue to ensure that pupils aged four to six receive a piece of fruit or vegetable every day through the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme. Cookery classes are already part of the curriculum in primary schools and pupils in key stage 3 can now take up the offer of the Licence to Cook programme: all pupils now get the chance to learn to cook healthy meals. The highly successful cookbook Real Meals-Simple cooking that tastes great, produced by this Department and made available to all year 7 pupils, was updated and re-launched in December 2009. This new edition contained a wider range of recipes, and accompanied by the Real Meals-cold food cookbook, also produced by the DCSF, which provides recipes for picnics and days out. All recipes were produced by the British Nutrition Foundation and meet the required nutrient standards. In addition, 99 per cent. of schools are now participating in the Healthy Schools Programme and healthy eating is a core criterion for achieving healthy school status.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/3">We are also helping parents gain the skills they need to prepare and cook healthy meals at home. In January 2010 we began piloting the &quot;train-the-trainer programme&quot; Cook4Life 'Cooking with Families' in the North West and South West regions. This pilot will give Sure Start Children's Centre staff the skills to enable them to run cookery courses in their centres which will help parents learn food preparation and cookery skills for use at home. We have also funded the Health, Exercise and Nutrition for the Really Young (HENRY) programme to disseminate good practice in Sure Start Children's Centres on healthy eating and exercise, which is being well received.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/4">In January 2009 we launched the social marketing campaign Change4Life to encourage us all to eat well, move more and live longer. Over 415,000 families have joined the campaign and receive information and advice tailored to their needs. Change4Life is primarily aimed at families with children aged between five and 11. To support families with younger children, in October 2009 we published a Change4Life Early Years toolkit for practitioners working with younger children. Start4Life, launched in January 2010, provides authoritative and up to date advice to pregnant women and parents of babies and children up to two years old on breastfeeding, introducing infants to solid food and active play so that babies can have the best start in life.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/5">We have also revised the Birth to Five, the NHS guide to becoming a parent and finding practical help and support on various issues, including diet and nutrition for children, which is given to all mothers. There is also an online version which features interactive tools and videos for new parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/6">Health visitors and other community nurses and practitioners play a vital role in helping to ensure that children and young people benefit from good nutrition. Through the Healthy Child Programme for the first five years of life health visitors and others promote exclusive breastfeeding, the introduction to solid foods and the development of good eating habits, such as the importance of eating fruit and vegetables as promoted through the Five a Day campaign from infancy onwards. In October 2009 new guidance for the important review which takes place after a child's second birthday as part of the programme was published. Also in October 2009 the Secretaries of State for Children, Schools and Families and Health launched the Healthy Child Programme for five to 19 year olds to stakeholders. This programme also emphasises the importance of healthy eating.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.3/7">We are also helping families make healthier choices in the food they buy in shops and restaurants through the work the Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) are taking forward with industry to implement the Healthy Food Code of Good Practice as set out in Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: One Year On. In addition, we are continuing to work with the Association of Convenience Stores to roll out a project across England to promote fruit and vegetables in stores in deprived areas, using the Change4Life brand.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.0/1">The Government have not issued guidance to local authorities on the area to be provided per child for outdoor play. The Government's planning policy on open space, which includes the provision of land for outdoor play, is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 17, 'Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation'. This states that local planning authorities should set their own local standards for the provision of different types of open space, taking account of factors such as the demographic profile and extent of existing buildings, residential and commercial development in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/2">The Government published 'Aiming High for Young People: Ten Year Strategy for Positive Activities', in 2007. Backed by over &#163;900 million of investment, it sets out plans to help all young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to take part in enjoyable and purposeful activities in their free time. As part of the strategy, myplace is delivering &#163;270 million of Government capital investment in world class youth facilities as part of a 10-year commitment to deliver new and improved youth facilities in every constituency by 2018. Aiming high supports local authorities in their duty to secure access to positive activities for all young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/3">An extensive consultation, 'Fair Play', was undertaken by the DCSF in April 2008 with children, young people and parents on play facilities. The national Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, set out the Government's commitment to invest &#163;235 million to deliver 3,500 new or refurbished outdoor play areas, plus 30 staffed adventure playgrounds, by 2011. This funding is allocated to every top tier local authority in England and intended to support play for all ages, but with a particular focus on eight to 13s. All local authorities are required to develop a strong understanding of local levels of need for outdoor play facilities as part of their decision-making on how this capital investment will be spent, and are supported in this process by the Government's national delivery partner, Play England. The views of local children, families and residents are a vital part of these considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.0/4">Non statutory guidance; 'Embedding the Play Strategy', will be issued to local authorities in February 2010 to help children's trusts and local strategic partnerships plan their local play offers and improvement programmes. This guidance recommends ways for local partners to determine how much and what kind of outdoor play provision they might need.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/2">No estimates of the revenue from petrol stations' business rates or that of any other category of hereditament have been made. Business rates bills contain not only transitional relief but all other reliefs, some determined at the billing authorities' discretion. It is therefore, not possible to estimate the bill of a hereditament, and, consequently, that of any category of hereditaments.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/3">For the purpose of modelling the 2010 Transitional Relief scheme, the Notional Chargeable Amount (NCA) was calculated. The NCA for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition but before all other reliefs. Details on the methodology and assumptions used can be found on page 49 of the 'The transitional arrangements for the non-domestic rating revaluation 2010 in England' consultation document. These include an assumption of zero inflation, which does not reflect the latest information available. There is also an adjustment for appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/4">A copy of the consultation document is available at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/nndrrevaluation2010">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/nndrrevaluation2010</a></p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/6">The five-yearly business rates revaluations make sure each business pays its fair contribution and the 2010 revaluation will not raise a single extra penny for Government. Over a million properties will see their business rate liabilities come down as a result of revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.2/7">In the last five years, alongside rising petrol prices and increasing turnover, the rents paid on many petrol filling stations has grown. It is only fair to all ratepayers this is reflected in rate bills. The Government have put in place a &#163;2 billion relief scheme to limit the impact on business properties facing increases, which means that in 2010-11 no petrol station will see its rates liability rise as a result of revaluation by more than 3.5 per cent. for small properties and 11 per cent. for large properties.</p>

	<p pid="a.319W.2/1">It is not possible to identify tax reliefs at the level of detail requested. However, an estimated 95 per cent. of UK businesses who invest in plant or machinery (including in computers and internet-related equipment) will have their expenditure wholly relieved from tax by the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA), which provides 100 per cent. relief for such investment up to an amount of &#163;50,000 each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.319W.5/1">No change is being made to legislation. From the outset the exemption for the rail industry from the long life assets regime for capital allowances has been time-limited. Thus, expenditure incurred after <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> on railway assets which have a life of greater than 25 years will be subject to the standard long life assets' rate of 10 per cent.</p>
