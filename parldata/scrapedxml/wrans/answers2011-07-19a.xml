The only exceptions to the recruitment freeze are for the graduate fast stream, and truly exceptional business-critical and frontline appointments. External recruitment is only allowed once every effort has been made to fill a role internally, from staff in the redeployment pool, or from elsewhere in the civil service. The recruitment freeze and targeted voluntary exit schemes helped reduce the headcount (paid civil servants) of the Home Office and its Executive agencies from 31,459 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June 2010</phrase> to 28,162 on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June 2011</phrase>.

This must take place prior to the Department being allowed to consider whether to issue notice of compulsory redundancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.12/1">As part of the work to strengthen the response to organised crime, the key law enforcement agencies&#8212;the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), UK Border Agency and the police&#8212;are pooling their intelligence on organised criminal groups. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, run by the City of London police, is also a key contributor. A good example of joint working against organised criminal groups engaged in fraud is the work of the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force (OCTF) where HMRC, SOCA, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, have been active in tackling organised criminal gangs involved in fuels duty fraud. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has specialist fraud investigation teams which focus specifically on identifying and disrupting organised fraud attacks on the benefits system. Investigations are undertaken in partnership with other agencies such as local authorities, the police and HMRC. There is also a specialist Financial Investigation Unit, which carries out financial investigations to track proceeds of crime and seeks to recover assets where benefit fraud has been committed against DWP. In the last financial year, DWP teams prosecuted 1,076 cases of organised fraud and identified criminal assets totalling &#163;8.74 million of which around &#163;3.5 million was recovered by confiscation orders.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.2/1">At the time of contract award, the anticipated contract value was between &#163;80 to &#163;100 million over a 10-year period. The contract duration extended to 11 years at a total cost of approximately &#163;365 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.2/2">The increase in costs over the term of the Siemens contract can be attributed to numerous factors including additional demand for passports, enhancements of the IT infrastructure and business processes to accommodate changes in policy, response to changes in security threats and customer service improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.5/1">The deployment of officers patrolling on their own, rather than in pairs, maximises visibility and increases engagement with the public, by potentially doubling the policing visibility within a given neighbourhood. However, the deployment patterns of police officers are a matter for individual chief constables, working with their police authorities. No assessment has been made by the Home Office of the effects of single police patrol on the level of crime or antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.5/2">The deployment of officers patrolling on their own, rather than in pairs, maximises visibility and increases engagement with the public, by potentially doubling the policing visibility within a given neighbourhood. However, the deployment patterns of police officers are a matter for individual chief constables, working with their police authorities. No assessment has been made by the Home Office of the effects of single police patrol on the level of crime or antisocial behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.6/1">The length of time expected for completion of the initial policing learning programme, including the diploma in policing, is two years. This is the time usually expected for completion by a student police officer recruited as a warranted officer and paid as such throughout the training period, the completion of which is marked by a pay increment.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.6/2">A special constable may complete the full initial learning programme and the length of time which this will take will depend on local arrangements, the number of hours the individual is able to volunteer, and their rate of progress. The Metropolitan police are making arrangements for special constables to complete training and will be best placed to provide the detailed information concerning special constables in the Metropolitan police area.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.6/3">A police community support officer (PCSO) is not able to complete the full training as a regular police constable because PCSOs do not have police powers and cannot be assessed using the necessary powers. A PCSO may complete the pre-join knowledge course and may achieve competence in four of the ten assessed modules which form part of the diploma. The length of time that this requires varies but is often completed within 12 months. If the PCSO goes on to be recruited as a regular officer and completed training this should not require more than 12 months to complete. A PCSO may also be a special constable also but the time for completion again depends on their availability for the work based assessment using police powers, and on progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.805W.0/1">The Data Protection Act regulates the processing of personal data. Personal data means data that relate to a living individual regardless of their nationality, immigration status or where they are located in the world. The agency's guidance is applicable to both in-country applications, overseas applications and to those who are in detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.0/2">The current guidance was put in place in 2003 and has been updated as and when necessary since then, according to inquiries from colleagues across the agency which have necessitated clarification. Amendments were also made as a result of the Freedom of Information Act in 2005 making reference to that Act and its provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.0/3">The information management team recently produced an information fact sheet for Members of Parliament acting on behalf of their constituents in response to feedback from Members of Parliament. The fact sheet, which was sent to all Members on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>, was produced to clarify our current guidance. The fact sheet sets out how we will approach requests for information from MPs in a number of common scenarios.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.0/4">The agency's guidance is publicly accessible via the UK Border Agency website&#8212;it is contained within chapter 24 &#8216;Disclosure of Information&#8217; via the &#8216;Policy and Law pages&#8217; (&#8216;Immigration Directorate Instructions&#8217;). This guidance is currently being rewritten to give agency staff a clearer steer on data protection and disclosing information and also highlight the particular role and work of Members of Parliament when representing constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.0/5">We do not hold records for the number of versions there have been since 2003, although there have not been major alterations to it since its inception.</p>
	<p pid="a.805W.0/6">There has been no additional cost to the public purse, over and above the day-to-day operational costs of the UK Border Agency's information management team who oversee Data Protection Policy guidance. The team updates guidance as part of their role and responds to inquiries on data protection policy from colleagues across the agency on a day-to-day basis (including the agency's MPs' Liaison Unit).</p>

	<p pid="a.807W.3/1">All naturally occurring wild birds, including seabirds, are protected by the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 2007. This legislation transposes the EC Wild Birds Directive and, in particular, prohibits the deliberate killing or taking of wild birds and provides for the classification of special protection areas (SPAs) for birds in both English and UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.807W.3/2">To date, 107 SPAs with marine components have been classified. Of these, three are wholly marine (Carmarthen Bay SPA, Liverpool Bay SPA, and the Outer Thames SPA). Of the 97 SPAs established for breeding seabird colonies, 31 have been extended into the marine environment by up to 4 km. Under the 2010 Habitats Regulations, any plans or projects that are likely to have a significant effect upon one or more of these SPAs are subject to appropriate assessment by competent authorities, including where those activities occur outside the SPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.807W.3/3">SPAs, together with Special Areas of Conservation (designated under the Habitats Directive) and Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), will be the main elements of our contribution to the ecologically coherent network. Marine Special Area of Conservation designation should be completed by the end of 2012, and we are aiming to complete further work on the identification of additional seabird colony extensions and other seabird SPAs by the end of 2015. In January 2012 recommendations for MCZs, formal advice from the Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies and the associated impact assessments will be sent to Ministers. We will give this careful consideration, before making a decision on sites to take forward to public consultation in early summer 2012, and designation by end 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.820W.9/47">Earlier this year, HMRC commissioned some research into the initial operation of the scheme.

After taking extensive advice, the agency concluded that the 'intentions to maximum' policy was not a contractual obligation and therefore pay increases relating to this policy could not be paid during the pay freeze. No equality impact assessment was carried out as it could have no impact on the implementation of the pay freeze, which is mandatory and affects all staff in the agency.

	<p pid="a.827W.6/1">We are encouraging local authorities and civil society to collaborate more, including greater involvement for voluntary groups in the design and running of public services. In this context, we recently consulted on light touch statutory guidance on the best value duty setting out some reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with voluntary and community groups and small businesses when facing difficult funding decisions. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June</phrase> and we expect to provide a government response and publish final guidance this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.6/2">Under the Local Government Act 1999, there is a duty to consult local representatives which supports the duty of best value. This will be backed up by the additional support for voluntary and community groups in the Best Value guidance. In addition, the new duties contained in the Localism Bill (i.e. the community rights to challenge and buy) aim to have a greater impact on links between councils and communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.827W.9/1">The Freedom of Information Act applies to a wide range of public authorities; its provisions are not specific to local authorities. The Act provides for exemptions from the duty to provide information, in specific circumstances, so full disclosure may not be required.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.2/1">A service concession agreement that was originally agreed by the previous Administration with the custodial tenancy deposit protection scheme contained a guarantee that the Government would meet any shortfall arising if approved fees were not covered by the interest on deposits held.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.2/2">As a result of the low interest rates that emerged due to the financial turmoil in 2008 and 2009, this agreement left the Government&#8212;i.e. taxpayers&#8212;liable for a shortfall under that guarantee which was estimated to reach over &#163;30 million by the end of the contract in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.2/3">In May 2010, the coalition Government inherited this unacceptable situation and looming liabilities. Following extensive negotiations in summer 2010, the guarantee and all associated liabilities were removed as part of a revised agreement which also incorporated a payment of &#163;12.7 million and a four-year extension of the original agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.2/4">The new agreement has been designed not only to remove future and current liabilities for Government and secure the best deal for taxpayers, but also to safeguard the ongoing viability of the custodial model of tenancy deposit protection and safeguard the interests of tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.828W.2/5">Hon. Members and the broader public will rightly wish to scrutinise the poor decisions of the last Administration. The new agreement was made in the form of a letter amending the original, flawed agreement. Redacted copies of both documents will be deposited in the Library of the House in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.837W.0/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the original estimate, at current prices, was of the cost to the public purse of the computer system supplied by EDS Systems for the Child Support Agency's payment system; what the final cost, at current prices, was at the time of completion; and whether additional costs have been incurred since completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/5">The question has been assumed to relate to the CS2 child maintenance system, which was built by EDS and went live in 2003. &#8220;The cost to the public purse of the computer system&#8221; has been assumed to mean the cost of developing the system, rather than the cost of developing and running the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/6">The original outline estimate given by EDS (now Hewlett Packard) in 1999 for the cost of the build of the new CS2 system was &#163;94m. This estimate is disclosed in the National Audit Office's (NAO) June 2006 report &#8220;Implementation of the child support reforms&#8221;. At today's prices, based on the Retail Price Index at December 1999 and June 2011, the &#163;94m translates to &#163;132.2m.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/7">The actual cost of developing the CS2 system was &#163;225m. At today's prices, based on the RPI at April 2003, when the system went live, and June 2011, the &#163;225m translates to &#163;292.1m.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/8">During the Operational Improvement Plan (OIP), which ran between April 2006 and April 2009, a further &#163;107m was invested in development to the CS2 system. This amount was disclosed in the NAO's December 2009 report on the performance of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission. At today's prices, based on the RPI for April 2009, when the OIP closed, and June 2011, the &#163;107m translates to &#163;119m.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.0/9">Following the closure of the OIP, two further remedial releases were made on the CS2 system. The cost of release 17, in 2009, was &#163;4.2m. Release 18, in 2010, cost &#163;5.4m. At today's prices, based on the RPI for December 2009 and December 2010 respectively and the RPI for June 2011, these translate to a total cost of &#163;10.1 m.</p>

Disability living allowance, which has a mobility component, is intended to focus additional help with the extra cost of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled earlier in life and who as a consequence have less opportunity to work, earn and save compared to non-disabled people. The mobility component remains in payment beyond age 65, to reflect the ongoing disadvantage that people in these circumstances continue to have compared with people who develop mobility problems after age 65.</p>

Support is tailored to the individual needs of each jobseeker, including help with work-related training and job-search support.

	<p pid="a.845W.5/1">The benefit cap will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.845W.5/2">There is a range of help local authorities can offer to households at risk of becoming homeless including the provision of discretionary housing payments. We have already made an additional &#163;190 million available over the spending review period for this purpose as a result of the changes we have made to housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.845W.5/3">The Government published their impact assessment of the benefit cap in February alongside the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.845W.5/4">This made it clear that the assessment sought is not possible to estimate because this would have to be based on behavioural changes</p>

	<p pid="a.847W.5/1">This information is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/2">Modelled tax and benefit reforms announced since Budget 2010 may have a small reduction in overall child poverty in 2011-12 and 2012-13; however, given the uncertainty around these types of estimates, this change may be on the edge of statistical significance. This analysis has not been carried out separately for those in rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/3">The most recent estimates of rural child poverty are presented as follows. Due to different definitions of rurality in Scotland compared to England and Wales, and the fact that no information is collected on the family resources survey covering rurality in Northern Ireland, it has not been possible to present figures for the United Kingdom as a whole. This also means that the figures supplied for Scotland are not comparable with the other figures presented. For Wales and Scotland, three years of data have had to be combined due to small sample size.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/4">The latest data available from the households below average incomes for 2009-10, shows that in England, before housing costs, the proportion of children in relative poverty is 15% in rural areas compared to 20% in urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.847W.5/8" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/9">1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2009-10 family resources survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/10">2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/11">3. Figures have been presented on a before housing costs basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/12">4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/13">5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/14">6. Proportions of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/15">7. Three survey years have been combined for Scotland and Wales because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.5/16">8. Due to different definitions of rurality in Scotland compared to England and Wales, and the fact that no information is collected on the family resources survey covering rurality in Northern Ireland, it has not been possible to present figures for the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>

We have yet to settle on the precise details of how the transition will work, and the effects on housing benefits staff. This approach will ensure an orderly transition and that we have people with relevant skills and experience to support claimants both in work and out of work, as they migrate to the new credit.</p>

This work will also confirm whether and how TUPE will apply for those staff affected in all organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.854W.8/1">It is still too early to say how many staff, and what skills and experience will be required for universal credit. Decisions about TUPE and redundancy cannot be made until there is much more definition around the specific roles required to deliver the new universal credit. Although it is anticipated that fewer staff will be required compared to the legacy benefits, it is too early to say which staff and organisations will be affected. The impact on local authority staff will be affected by the design of the council tax benefit replacement, and decisions about the delivery model for universal credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.855W.2/1">Departmental modelling estimates that, in steady-state universal credit, approximately 20% of households with a carer who would have received means-tested support under a continuation of the current system of benefits and tax credits, would not be eligible for an earnings disregard in universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.855W.2/2">Universal credit modelling is conducted using the Department's' Policy Simulation Model. This is a static microsimulation model based on 2008-09 Family Resources Survey data and, as such, estimates should be treated as indicative only. Estimates have been adjusted to take account of the current imperfect take-up of benefits and the improved take-up rate under universal credit. Carer households are defined as where an adult is providing informal care for 35 or more hours a week.</p>

The provisions are longstanding and I can confirm that no legal advice on the development of the provisions has been given in recent years. However, we are satisfied that there is no legal difficulty with any disparity between differing terms of service in the three services or between different age groups. Individuals join a single service of their choosing, not the armed forces generally, and each service has different operational requirements. Depending upon which service a recruit has chosen they must abide by its requirements in relation to terms of engagement.</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.14/2">The final costs and savings from redundancies will depend on a number of factors, including the level of natural wastage, salary, rank/grade and length of service of personnel selected. Estimates of the levels of savings can only be provided for the next four years, as planning data beyond those years does not give the sufficient level of detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.14/3">The current assessment is that around 11,000 service personnel will be made redundant, from the total drawdown of around 17,000, at a cost of around &#163;600-700 million. The service redundancy programme will take place over four years, although the majority will leave the service in 2012 and 2013. The estimated savings from service personnel pay costs from as a result of all reductions (including natural wastage) is &#163;2.4 billion over financial years 2011-12 to 2014-15, though there will be enduring savings thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.14/4">The current estimate of the cost of reducing the number of civil servants is around &#163;580 million over three years to achieve a proportion of the 25,000 civil service personnel reductions detailed in the Strategic Defence and Security Review. The estimated savings from civilian pay costs as a result of these reductions (including early release and natural wastage) is &#163;0.9 billion over financial years 2011-12 to 2014-15, with enduring savings thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.2/1">BBC Hindi provides services via shortwave, FM, online and to mobile devices. The cost of BBC Hindi, excluding the costs of transmission and UK-based accommodation, technology and studio operations, was &#163;1.7 million in 2010-11. It is not possible to give figures, for the excluded costs as they are used by more than one BBC World Service and an accurate break down of the cost to BBC Hindi is not available. However, according to the BBC World Service's evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, savings associated with changes to BBC Hindi announced in January would be about &#163;680,000 in production costs. Additionally, there would be &#163;190,000 savings in distribution costs.</p>

Staff attend events which support FCO objectives&#8212;for example, meetings with senior political and military figures from host countries and events hosted for political and business delegations (including those in support of UK Trade and Industry). Hospitality is undertaken for business reasons, and any expenditure on business hospitality is kept under rigorous scrutiny to ensure value for money and effectiveness and is incurred in accordance with the principles of Managing Public Money and the Treasury handbook on Regularity, Propriety and Value for Money.</p>

The UK has also participated fully in the EU-Indonesia Human Rights dialogues. At the most recent dialogue which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-09">9 March 2011</phrase> in Brussels, the EU raised continuing concerns at the situation in the Papuan provinces and underscored the need for accountability.</p>

We welcome the organisation of a Papuan Peace Conference in Jayapura from 5 to <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-07">7 July</phrase> and have long encouraged all parties to engage in meaningful dialogue to resolve their differences. Our priority for the provinces of Papua and West Papua is to encourage full implementation of special autonomy for these provinces and to press for increased focus on meaningful economic and social development to address the widespread poverty in the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.888W.0/6">The official, internationally agreed definitions of labour market status have been applied in this answer. Consequently, &#8220;unemployed and seeking work&#8221; is treated as &#8220;unemployed&#8221; and &#8220;unemployed and inactive&#8221; is treated as &#8220;economically inactive&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.0/7">Statistics published in the monthly Labour Market Statistical Bulletin previously described as working age (men aged 16-64 and women aged 16-59) have now been replaced with statistics based on those aged 16-64 for both men and women. Consequently, the estimates provided are on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.0/8">As with any sample survey, estimates from the APS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.894W.0/1">The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill includes provisions to implement fundamental reforms to how no win no fee conditional fee agreements operate across all categories of civil litigation, for both claimants and defendants. Under our proposals, claimants in libel cases would still be able to bring claims under no win no fee agreements. The Bill is now before the public bill committee for scrutiny. The Government are not minded to delay the reforms to no win no fee agreements in respect of libel cases, which are intended to make the costs of civil litigation more proportionate.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.5/1">The Government are committed to encouraging the public to resolve their issues out of court without recourse to public funds, using simpler, more informal remedies where they are appropriate. In this context, my Department is working to develop proposals to promote wider use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) across the courts and tribunals system.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.5/2">Insofar as employment tribunals are concerned, and given the unique position of ACAS in the employment dispute resolution system, ADR is already embedded as a central feature of the process. The Pre Claim Conciliation scheme run by ACAS allows parties to engage in ADR before claims are even lodged with a tribunal. The Government&#8217;s consultation paper &#8220;Resolving Workplace Disputes&#8221; sets out how we intend to build on our experience in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.5/3">However, it is generally accepted that there will be cases which reach the tribunal but have little or no prospect of success. Identifying these cases at an early stage helps tribunals to allocate resources more effectively. There are already wide-ranging powers for employment judges to case manage proceedings from an early stage. These include holding interim hearings to consider the relevant issues involved. Tribunals have the power to make deposit orders where a claim/response has little reasonable prospect of success; and ultimately to strike out any claim/response which has no reasonable prospect of success. Again, the &#8220;Resolving Workplace Disputes&#8221; consultation considers how these powers could be made more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.5/4">In the tribunals system more widely, we have considered early neutral evaluation (ENE) techniques, alongside others. Given the findings from pilot exercises, there was no clear case for onward consideration of ENE specifically. However, we have been able to apply lessons learned to good effect and we are considering how increased use of ADR could be further encouraged across the civil, family and administrative justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.0/1">While Employment Tribunals collate, and HMCTS regularly publishes, data on awards made, no data are collected on whether those awards are satisfied in individual cases. This is largely because of the difficulties in collecting any reliable data, particularly in the scenario where judgment creditors receive payment but then (understandably) fail to report that fact to the tribunal after the end of their case. In any event, once an award has been given, it falls to the claimant to enforce that award using the civil courts should they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.0/2">In order to assist with the commencement of the enforcement process, the Ministry of Justice introduced, in April 2010, the ACAS and Employment Tribunal Fast Track. The Fast Track enables the claimant to have a High Court Enforcement Officer (HCEO) appointed to their case as soon as the respondent has defaulted in payment of the award. The HCEO will then take forward the enforcement process on behalf of the claimant.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.0/3">In the first year, 1,495 unpaid employment tribunal awards have been issued using the Fast Track, resulting in 42.5% of those unpaid awards being fully recovered.</p>

The normal pension age (NPA) for Prison Service staff is in line with the relevant provisions of the principal civil service pension scheme (PCSPS). Lord Hutton's final report on the proposed reform of public service pensions recommended that a pension age of 60 might be more appropriate for employees in uniformed services to recognise the unique nature of their job. Consultation will take place on what form this takes and whom it covers as part of the reform process.</p>

	<p pid="a.899W.9/18">In 2010, the Parole Board directed the release of seven foreign national prisoners serving a life sentence for murder. Of these, one has been returned to custody, two are residing in the UK and being supervised on life licence by the probation service, and four have been deported. As with any other life sentence prisoner, a foreign national prisoner serving a life sentence for murder is eligible for release on parole only once he has completed the minimum period of imprisonment specified by the court and only where the Parole Board determines that it is no longer necessary, on the grounds of public protection, for him to be detained in custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.900W.5/2">To determine which places could be closed there has been a rigorous economic and operational evaluation process of every establishment in the prison estate. This evaluation considered factors such as operating costs, outstanding maintenance issues and the geographic and strategic function that establishments provide to the rest of the Prison Service to identify prisons that can close during this financial year. The selection of which places to close is not based on performance of establishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.5/3">These two sites provide the best option from those identified through our evaluation process to close the available gap between population and capacity. HMP Brockhill is in need of costly remedial work and there are options for the redeployment of staff. Having made the decision on HMP Brockhill, HMP Latchmere House was the best establishment to close given the size of the gap that remains, it occupies a valuable site whose sale will make a significant contribution to the savings target, and its staff can be redeployed at other establishments in the region.</p>

It followed a rigorous economic evaluation of every establishment in the prison estate based on age and economic factors, including operating costs, outstanding maintenance issues and land value. This gave a ranked economic assessment of the prison estate which was then used as the basis for an operational assessment which considered the geographic and strategic function that each prison provides to the rest of the Prison Service and the possible staffing implications of closure. The process of selection and decision making was therefore not based on a single piece of analysis which can be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.0/2">The guidance issued to <i>(a)</i> staff and <i>(b)</i> special advisers in the Department for Education on the use of private email accounts for communications relating to their official duties is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/3"><i>(a)</i> for Departmental staff: &#8220;<i>Never</i> use non-DfE email services (such as your own personal internet email account on Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL, MobileMe, etc) to carry out Departmental business.&#8221; An extract from this guidance for DfE staff, covering the salient points, is shown in Annex A.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/4"><i>(b)</i> for Ministers and special advisers: &#8220;<i>DON</i> <i>&#8217;</i> <i>T</i> use unofficial devices (such as your own/constituency PC/Laptop/PDA) or unofficial services (such as internet email accounts like Hotmail or Gmail) to access or hold DfE information. Only official devices and services have been tested and risk assessed to ensure they are secure enough for routine HMG business.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/5">Special Advisers are bound by the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers, paragraph 6 of which says that</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/6">&#8220;Special Advisers should not use official resources for party political activity&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/7" class="italic">Annex A</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/8" class="italic">Essential steps to protect information in DfE</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/9">Use only official DfE ICT systems, services and devices to access or store DfE information</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/10">Official DfE ICT (Information and Communications Technology), computing and telephony services, systems and devices, have been configured, risk assessed, and tested to ensure they are secure enough for Departmental business. Official DfE mobile devices (Laptops and BlackBerry&#8217;s) have HM Government approved strong encryption enabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/11">You should therefore:</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/12"><i>Never</i> use non-DfE devices (such as your own laptop, PC, Mac, PDA or memory stick) to access or store DfE Information.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/13"><i>Never </i>use non-DfE email services (such as your own personal internet email account on Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL, MobileMe, etc.) to carry out Departmental business.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/14"><i>Never</i> set your &#8216;Out of Office&#8217; message or email forwarding rules to direct official email to your personal internet email account.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/15">If you have a compelling requirement to conduct DfE business when away from the office, but do not already have the appropriate DfE remote working tools to support this, talk to your line manager about making the business case.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/16" class="italic">Why is this so important?</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/17">The loss or compromise of personal or otherwise sensitive information that has not been adequately protected can have serious consequences including:</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/18">Financial loss, disruption to the work of the Department, or distress to citizens or staff;</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/19">Damage to DfE&#8217;s reputation which could in turn lead to loss of public confidence in the services of our Department or of Government as a whole;</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/20">Breach of the Data Protection Act, which could lead to public censure of the Department by the Information Commissioner, whose statutory powers also include the right to impose fines on the Department of up to &#163;500,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/21">Use of unapproved ICT systems, services and devices could also put in jeopardy the Department&#8217;s continued right to use the Government Secure Intranet (GSI) which we rely on for secure intra-government email and data sharing.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.0/22">As well as breaching security rules the use of unapproved ICT systems, services and devices to conduct Government business also creates Information Management issues. For example: information not held on DfE ICT systems would not be searched when responding to a Freedom of Information (FoI) Request.</p>

As regulator of the examination awarding bodies concerned, it is for the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) to work with the awarding bodies to investigate any issues concerning A level examination marking standards. Ofqual have not advised Education Ministers of any representations on this matter during the last six months. No forecast of A level marking errors has been prepared for Ministers. While it is not feasible to eliminate all incidences of error from the initial marking process, Ministers expect that awarding bodies will always operate procedures to minimise marking errors, and that all suspected errors that are subsequently reported to them by schools will then be dealt with through the established inquiry and appeals mechanisms.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.2/1">The Department for Education has recently consulted on proposals in a Special Educational Needs and Disability Green Paper which include arrangements to give parents greater control over the choice of education provision for their children. The Secretary of State has no plans to change the current arrangements for supporting parents of children with special educational needs who choose to home educate. In 2010 the Department for Children, Schools and Families issued guidance to local authorities on their duties and powers in relation to home educated children with special educational needs. That guidance highlighted local authorities' powers to make provision for these children, to help parents ensure that home education is suitable for the child's needs. For home educated children with statements of special educational needs, local authorities are under a duty to ensure that the provision the parents are making is suitable and meets each child's special educational needs. The local authority must review statements at least annually.</p>

	<p pid="a.911W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April 2011</phrase> I chaired a roundtable meeting of senior representatives from organisations with wide-ranging knowledge and experience of child sexual exploitation. We recognised that much excellent work is being done around the country, especially by voluntary and community organisations who have a key role in reaching out to and engaging the most vulnerable children and young people. However, we identified a number of further actions that needed to be taken by the Government, working with national and local partners, to safeguard children and young people from this appalling form of child abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.911W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-17">17 May</phrase> at an event organised by Barnardo's, I confirmed the Government's commitment to working with national and local partners to develop an action plan to tackle child sexual exploitation. Work on this action plan is under way, building on existing guidance and our developing understanding of this dreadful abuse, including through local agencies' work around the country. The action plan, which will be published in the autumn, will address issues of raising awareness and understanding; effective prevention and detection; the challenge of securing prosecutions; and the need to improve support for victims</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.2/2">Local authorities may purchase places in independent schools, and the negotiation of fee levels for pupils placed in independent schools by local authorities is a matter for the local authority concerned. Independent schools can apply to become free schools and receive state funding, which would give them equivalent funding to other publicly-funded schools of a similar character in the same local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.2/3">The majority of placements in independent schools are made to meet the specific needs of children with special education needs. The fees in these schools are therefore often much higher than the average cost of providing a place in a maintained school in the authority concerned. We have no plans to limit the ability of local authorities to pay fees to secure specialist provision they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.912W.5/1">We have introduced the Pupil Premium to provide additional funding to schools to help raise the attainment of deprived pupils. Eligibility for the Pupil Premium is based on known eligibility for Free School Meals (FSM) as the link between FSM eligibility and educational underachievement is strong. We aim to extend the coverage of the Pupil Premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for FSM.</p>
	<p pid="a.912W.5/2">We know that not all pupils eligible for FSM are registered. However, whether a school provides school meals more generally should not be a significant factor in this registration as a school or local authority must provide a meal for FSM pupils where valid requests for such meals are made. We have made it clear that we want all children eligible for free school meals to be registered so that Pupil Premium funding can be targeted correctly, and so they can choose to take a free meal to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/1">In the NHS Information Centre's publication, &#8220;Statistics on Alcohol: England 2011&#8221;, the series on admissions with an alcohol related condition goes back to 2002-03 as that is the earliest year for which estimates have been generated.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/2">Estimates of the number of admissions with an alcohol related condition based on the current methodology were first generated in 2008. At that time, estimates were generated for the latest year for which hospital admissions data were available (2006-07) and retrospectively for the years 2002-03 to 2005-06. Estimates were not generated for years before 2002-03 primarily because the maximum number of diagnoses collected centrally for a hospital episode increased from seven to fourteen between 2001-02 and 2002-03, creating the possibility of a discontinuity in the series that might affect comparability.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/3">The estimates for 2002-03 to 2006-07 were revised slightly in summer 2010. The revisions resulted from the inclusion of chronic hepatitis (K73) and psoriasis (L40), that had been previously been excluded unintentionally.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/4">At a national level, the revisions ranged in scale from an increase of 543 admissions (0.07%) in 2005-06 to an increase of 2,946 (0.37%) in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/5">With regard to paragraph 4.4.1, 74% of the estimated 1,057,000 admissions with a diagnosis of disease attributable to alcohol in 2009-10 did not involve a primary diagnosis attributable to alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/6">With regard to paragraph 4.4.4, in the 2008 edition of the NHS Information Centre's publication, &#8220;Statistics on Alcohol: England&#8221;, the following three ICD-10 codes were included in the figure for admissions with a diagnosis of diseases wholly-attributable to alcohol:</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/7">F10: Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/8">K70: Alcoholic liver disease</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/9">T51: Toxic effect of alcohol</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/10">In the 2011 edition, the following additional ICD-10 codes were included:</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/11">E24.4: Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/12">G31.2: Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/13">G62.1: Alcoholic polyneuropathy</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.2/18">X45: Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/19">and the following ICD-10 codes were no longer included:</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/20">T51.2: Toxic effect of 2-Propanol</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/21">T51.3: Toxic effect of fusel oil</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/22">T51.8: Toxic effect of other alcohols</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.2/23">The changes have been applied to data from 2002-03. The changes were made to offer figures based on a more comprehensive set of diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol, in line with the review undertaken by the North West Public Health Observatory published in &#8220;Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.917W.2/1">There is no central requirement for patients admitted to national health service hospitals to be asked if they have consumed any alcohol that day, although that may happen locally in some settings and such information may be recorded on some local systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.917W.2/2">The estimates of admissions with a diagnosis of diseases attributable to alcohol in 2009-10 in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-06-20.56"><i>Official Report</i>, column 56W</phrase>, on alcoholic drinks: misuse were based on the method developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). The method makes use of the internationally applied concept of attributable fractions. In the case of alcohol-related admissions, an attributable fraction represents the estimated percentage of admissions that can be attributed to alcohol consumption. The NWPHO estimated fractions for the 47 conditions for which there was sufficient epidemiological evidence that the risk of morbidity is significantly affected by alcohol consumption. In some cases, such as alcoholic liver disease, the conditions are wholly attributable to alcohol, in which case the attributable fraction is one or 100%. In the case of partially attributable conditions, the fractions often vary by age and sex. The list includes chronic conditions such as some cancers, acute conditions such as ethanol poisoning, and external causes such as road accidents. For most conditions, NWPHO estimated the attributable fraction for a condition by combining information from epidemiological studies on the risk of different levels of alcohol consumption, with information on alcohol consumption among adults in England from the 2005 General Household Survey. Information on the primary and secondary diagnoses recorded for each admission is then used in combination with the fractions to estimate the number of admissions involving an alcohol-related condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.923W.2/1">The Department operates standard contractual payment terms of 30-days and any payments that are delayed beyond that date may be subject to interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998. The Act states that suppliers who are not paid within 30-days of the receipt of the invoice by the party billed are entitled to claim interest on the delayed payment at a rate of 8% above the Bank of England base reference rate. Penalty payments may be due where a small or medium sized business obtains a ruling that any contract terms that were applied were grossly unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.923W.2/2">Details of the penalty and interest charges paid by the Department in each financial year since 1997-98 are given in the following table.

	<p pid="a.941W.5/2">The Department is in regular contact with all parties, including Southern Cross and its landlords and is monitoring the transfer of the company&#8217;s homes to alternative providers of care closely. It is for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), as the regulator, to approve and register alternative providers of care in Southern Cross homes. The CQC is committed to processing applications efficiently to help ensure continuity of care for residents of Southern Cross homes, but has made it clear that it will not change the regulatory bar or reduce the rigour of the registration process.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/3">The Government&#8217;s overriding concern is the welfare and safety of the 31,000 residents in Southern Cross care homes. We have made it clear that, whatever the outcome of the restructuring process, no one will find themselves homeless or without care.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/4">It is for Southern Cross and its landlords to support local managers during the transfer of the company&#8217;s care homes to new management. The statement issued by Southern Cross on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-11">11 July</phrase> makes it clear that the company, its landlords and lenders appreciate their responsibilities to residents and staff of the company&#8217;s homes. All parties have given a clear commitment that the continuity of care will be paramount during the transfer process. Southern Cross has undertaken in a letter to care home staff that they will transfer to new operators with their existing terms and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/5">Local authorities are already working to ensure that they can assist in the transfer of arrangements in respect of homes in their areas. The Department has been working with the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the Local Government Association to support that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/6">I have today issued a written ministerial statement updating the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-23">23 June 2011</phrase>, the Government announced their consultation on reforms to the ATOL scheme, with the objective of providing greater clarity for consumers and also to put the scheme's finances back on a self-sustaining basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.3/2">The Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF) meets the costs of refunds and repatriation assistance provided to the consumers of insolvent ATOL licensed businesses. It is financed through a mix of income from ATOL Protection Contributions (APC&#8212;currently &#163;2.50 per booking), bank facilities and an insurance policy. Underpinning this, the Government have provided a guarantee for part of the bank facilities, currently up to &#163;42 million. These arrangements provide access to &#163;70 million which should be sufficient to meet all demands placed on the fund. The insurance policy has an annual limit of &#163;300 million, with an excess of &#163;50 million, available in the event of the failure of one or more major ATOL licensed businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.3/3">There are no plans to increase the APC, which would require prior consultation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and approval by the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.3/4">The latest published accounts of the ATTF show that it was in deficit of &#163;42.3 million as of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. The CAA believes that the ATTF should return to surplus within three years of the proposed reforms being introduced. The actual timing depends on factors such as the cost of future insolvencies of ATOL licensed businesses and the actual income from APC payments, both of which are difficult to predict with certainty. The proposed reforms should allow the Government guarantee to be withdrawn and the fund to return to a fully financially self-sustaining basis without the need for taxpayer support.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.5/1">Following the Humber Bridge Board's toll application to the Department to increase toll charges on the Humber bridge, a public inquiry was convened to consider the board's proposals and representations against an increase, in accordance with the statutory process under the Humber Bridge Act 1971. The independent inspector's report from that inquiry recommended an increase in toll charges in line with the board's proposals. I agreed with the inspector's recommendations. No cost benefit analysis or impact assessment was undertaken by the Department into the Humber Bridge Board's proposals.</p>

The letter confirmed that Directive 96/53/EC only permits longer semi-trailers if the criteria for one of the exemptions set out in Article 4.4 are fulfilled. The Government's view, previously communicated to the Commission, is that our proposals for longer semi-trailers fulfil the criteria for exemption in Article 4.4 (b), because their loading length (15.65 metres) can also be achieved by existing rigid/drawbar combinations. The Commission's letter did not address this point.</p>

The Department cannot make public its cost-benefit ratio valuations of the Intercity Express programme until the procurement has reached financial close, as to do so may worsen the Department's commercial position in the ongoing negotiations with Agility Trains, the preferred bidding consortium.</p>

I have renamed apprenticeship levels so that there is a clearer pathway from intermediate to advanced and on to higher apprenticeships.

	<p pid="a.977W.2/1">The conduct and activities of debt consolidation firms who provide loans by way of a second charge on a consumer's home is monitored by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The OFT issued updated Guidance for this industry in 2009 and continues to keep this sector under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.2/2">In addition, in 2010 the OFT also published new guidance on irresponsible lending which specifically sets out the information the OFT would expect a lender to provide a person who is considering taking out a loan to consolidate existing debts. The guidance states that when applicable the consumer should be informed that consolidating debts may involve paying higher interest rates and increase both the overall amount repayable and the repayment period.</p>
	<p pid="a.977W.2/3">The OFT would also consider it likely to be an example of irresponsible lending for any lender to grant a debt consolidation loan to a consumer where it is known, or reasonably suspected, that the credit is likely to be unsustainable. Failure to comply with the irresponsible lending guidance could call into question that company's fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. The OFT continues to keep this sector under review and if necessary will not hesitate to take enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="a.981W.2/1">Eureka Eurostars is a programme for research performing SMEs and involves funding from 32 countries as well as funding from the European Commission. In the UK, the Technology Strategy Board is responsible for its delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/2">The Department provides an overall budget provision to the Technology Strategy Board and within that overall provision the Technology Strategy Board decides how much to allocate to Eureka Eurostars. The Technology Strategy Board has a range of calls on its budget and all of the programmes it operates are heavily oversubscribed. The current Eureka Eurostars budget is &#163;3 million per annum which attracts 25% funding from the European Commission making a total annual budget of &#163;3.75 million. The funding is evenly spread over the two Eureka Eurostars calls held annually in March and September.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/3">For the bidding round of Eureka Eurostars which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-24">24 March 2011</phrase>, a total of 402 consortia bids were received involving 1,301 businesses and academia from 36 different countries. There was an overall rise of 17% in the number of applications compared to the previous bidding round.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/4">Of the 402 consortia bids, 85 involved UK participants. The number of companies in each consortium ranged from one to 11 with some projects also involving academia. The maximum number of UK companies in any one consortium was two and, in total, the 85 bids involved 97 UK companies and 151 partners from other Eurostars member countries. Looking at the total project cost, the bids involving UK organisations ranged from &#8364;199,000 to &#8364;6.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/5">The Technology Strategy Board is planning on supporting seven consortia bids which involve nine UK companies. In addition, there is one bid which contains a UK university which is funding its own participation. There were a further 23 consortia bids containing 24 UK companies above the quality threshold which, if UK and in some instances funding from other Eurostars countries had been available, could have also been funded. Of the 23 consortia bids which could not be funded, 22 of the bids contained one UK company and one bid contained two UK companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/6">The total project costs for all 402 applications was &#8364;550 million. The total project costs for the 30 projects involving UK companies which were above the quality threshold, and therefore scored high enough to be considered suitable for funding, was &#8364;39.9 million. The UK grant funding requested by the UK companies in the 30 consortia bids was &#8364;7.45 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.2/7">The ranking of individual bids is not made publically available as it could impact on the commercial standing of the companies involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.985W.9/2">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills does not directly provide universities or research institutes with funding for rare earth and minerals research. However, the Department provides funding to the Research Councils, HEFCE and the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), which provide a range of support to researchers and scientists.</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.9/3">As part of the evidence I gave to the Science and Technology Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-02">2 March 2011</phrase> concerning strategically important metals I explained how the Government has a responsibility through our excellent science and research base, and that if there are specific areas where more research is required then industry could advise the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.9/4">NERC has an active mineral research programme. The British Geological Survey (BGS), a NERC Centre, has monitored global metal production and trade for almost 100 years. Through its &#8216;Metals and Minerals for Environmental Technology&#8217; project, BGS carries out research in the UK and overseas, in conjunction with academia and industry, on the Earth processes and properties that produce mineral deposits, on novel resources for environmental technology (initially focusing on rare earths) and on new mineral exploration technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.9/5">The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's (EPSRC) current portfolio of investment in metallurgical, ceramic and photonic materials research, all make use of rare earth metals and minerals. The EPSRC also funds research and has a key strategic interest in the area of materials efficiency and materials scarcity.</p>
	<p pid="a.985W.9/6">The Technology Strategy Board's forthcoming Supply Chain Innovation Collaborative R&amp;D competition will help companies develop products and technologies that can mitigate materials security risks.

	<p pid="a.987W.6/1">The most recent assessment made by the Government was of the evidence submitted to Lord Justice Jackson in response to his &#8216;Review of Civil Litigation Costs&#8217; which was published in January 2010. In addition, further research and evidence was commissioned by and submitted to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in order to inform the Government response to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/2">The Government's actions on this have included introducing simpler more streamlined procedures in the Patents County Court (PCC): from October 2010, the introduction of a fixed scale of recoverable costs capped at a maximum of &#163;50,000, and from June 2011, a limit on damages of &#163;500,000 which may be awarded by the court in relation to patents and designs disputes. A similar limit for a wide range of other intellectual property (IP) rights including copyright and trade marks is expected in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/3">These limits will ensure that lower value/less complex claims, typically those brought by small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs, automatically fall within the jurisdiction of the PCC, which in turn reduces the financial risk for claimants of going to court.</p>
	<p pid="a.987W.6/4">The Hargreaves review recommended that a small claims track should be introduced in the PCC, to improve access to justice for firms with lower-value IP infringement cases. The Government will consider this as part of their response to the review.</p>

The contact details of final year students are provided by the institution to the organisation administering the NSS, so all eligible students are able to give their views about the quality of their teaching and learning experience. The NSS forms a vital part of the information set for prospective students.</p>

	<p pid="a.999W.0/1">Projections of fuel poverty are made at a national level only.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.0/2">The recent changes in domestic energy prices, if mirrored across all suppliers, will lead to a small increase in the number of households in fuel poverty in 2011 and a larger impact in 2012, as the majority of the price changes will feed through to annual fuel bills in 2012. Latest projections of fuel poverty indicate that there will be around four million fuel poor households in England in 2010, and around 4.1 million in 2011. Projections for 2012 will be made and published in the Fuel Poverty Statistics Report next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.999W.0/3">Nevertheless, the true effect will only be known when we have full information on price changes from all suppliers and data from the 2011 and 2012 English Housing Survey (EHS). The EHS provides vital information for calculating the level of fuel poverty, including the mix of domestic fuels used by households, the income of those living in the households and the energy efficiency of the housing stock.</p>

	<p pid="a.1000W.5/1">Projections of fuel poverty are made at a National, all household level only, and are representative of prices from all suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.5/2">The recent changes in domestic energy prices, if mirrored across all suppliers, will lead to a small increase in the number of households in fuel poverty in 2011 and a larger impact in 2012, as the majority of the price changes will feed through to annual fuel bills in 2012. Latest projections of fuel poverty indicate that there will be around 4 million fuel poor households in England in 2010, and around 4.1 million in 2011. Projections for 2012 will be made and published in the Fuel Poverty Statistics Report next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000W.5/3">Nevertheless, the true effect will only be known when we have full information on price changes from all suppliers and data from the 2011 and 2012 English Housing Survey (EHS). The EHS provides vital information for calculating the level of fuel poverty, including the mix of domestic fuels used by households, the income of those living in the households and the energy efficiency of the housing stock.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001W.2/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for regulating health and safety in the offshore oil and gas sector. In 2009-10 there were 187 hydrocarbon releases (liquid and gas) from offshore installations reported to HSE. Of these, two were classified as major, 83 as significant and 102 as minor. Provisional data from 2010-11 indicates that there were 168 releases, of which six were classified as major, 67 as significant and 95 as minor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/3">Hydrocarbon releases are potential major hazard precursor events and a key indicator of how well the offshore industry is managing major hazard risks and asset integrity. HSE takes them very seriously and investigates all releases classified as significant and major to establish the root cause, assess compliance with legislation and ensure that the operator takes any necessary remedial action. Reducing the frequency of hydrocarbon releases is therefore a key priority for HSE, but this is not a new issue. The number of releases has reduced significantly since data was first collected in 1996/7. In that year there were 226 releases, of which 19 were major, 129 significant and 78 minor. However further reductions have proved harder to deliver in recent years. HSE has continued to challenge the Industry to do better and fully supports the industry target, agreed this year, to reduce hydrocarbon releases by 50% over the next three years. HSE expects all operators to draw up and implement plans to achieve that reduction.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002W.9/1">At the start of the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme in April 2010, tariffs were set with the aim of providing solar PV installations with an approximate 5% internal rate of return. Based on modelling assumptions at the time, annual net income from FITs (taking into account income from the generation tariff, export tariff and electricity bill savings; and annual maintenance costs) was expected on average to pay back on (1) upfront capital costs in around thirteen years; and (2) planning and installation costs in three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002W.9/2">The recent fast track review of the FITs scheme found evidence that solar PV capital costs had fallen by around 30% from levels originally assumed. Based on this latest information, the above payback period estimates would still be expected to hold under the fast track review tariff for 50 kW to 150 kW installations, but would be longer for installations between 150 kW and 5 MW and stand alone installations. However, leaving tariffs unchanged would significantly reduce the estimated payback periods for all installations above 50 kW and stand alone installations to (1) around nine years for upfront capital costs; and (2) two years for planning and installation costs.</p>
