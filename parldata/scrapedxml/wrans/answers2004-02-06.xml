	<p pid=".1080W.8/1">Since April 2002 72 hospitals, clinics and women's healthcare centres have been rebuilt. The Ministry of Health has established a Child and Adolescent Health Department and a Department of Women and Reproductive Health to tackle high infant and maternal mortality rates.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/2">The World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development and the European Community are helping the Afghan Ministry of Health, through NGOs, to provide a basic healthcare service to the entire population. The package consists of services for (i) maternal and newborn health; (ii) child health and immunisation; (iii) nutrition; (iv) communicable disease; (v) mental health; (vi) disability; and (vii) supply of essential drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/3">Immunisation is having a real impact. 12 million children have been immunised against polio and 16 million against measles since 2002, saving 30,000 lives. Cholera and diarrhoeal diseases are being tackled through health education, water chlorination and the construction of wells throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/4">Recruiting, training and deploying health care workers (especially women) is a real challenge, especially in rural areas. The absence of female health workers is being addressed by the World Health Organisation, which is running a variety of health courses to boost the number of skilled birth attendants, nurses and midwives.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/5">Despite the substantial investment in the provision of basic health care in Afghanistan, the effective delivery of services across the whole of the country will take many months. But efforts to improve the health of people in Afghanistan will need to continue for many years and will require the support of the international community over the long term.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.2/1">The Home Secretary has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's response to major emergencies at both national and regional levels. He chairs the Civil Contingencies Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/2">At the national level, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office, under the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, Sir David Omand, has the task of driving, monitoring and co-ordinating the range of departmental work necessary to develop the UK's resilience and contingency planning ability. The core frameworks through which the CCS co-ordinates the contingencies planning of Government Departments are the Capabilities Programme, announced by the Home Secretary in a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-03">3 March 2003</phrase>, and the Lead Government Department list, announced in answer to a Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-23">23 July 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/3">At the regional level, the Government has established a new civil protection tier designed to provide a strong bridge between civil contingency planning at national and local levels. This activity is co-ordinated through the Government Offices for the Regions and the Regional Co-ordination Unit in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

Officials then wrote to all Children's Fund partnerships on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-19">19 December 2003</phrase>. We advised partnerships that where our decisions at the mid-year review had compromised their ability to meet contractual obligations, we would revisit them. Furthermore, we set aside some money to assist where there was a likelihood of staff redundancy or premature closure of services. The Children's Fund regional teams discussed this in detail with partnerships during January, identifying where we should restore funds taken back in the mid year review. This process was completed at the end of January.</p>

	<p pid=".1089W.3/1">[holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-03">3 February 2004</phrase>): Historically, the Department has not collected data annually on the average time per week spent by pupils on physical education and school sport. Data collected during the autumn term 2002 suggested that about a third of schools at Key Stages 1, 3 and 4 and two fifths at Key Stage 2 offered their pupils two hours of high quality PE and school sport each week within and beyond the curriculum.</p>

	<p pid=".1097W.0/1">The Smart scheme in England has now been replaced by Grant for Research and Development. All potential applicants for the grants are urged to discuss their plans with their local Business Link operator before making an application and grant recipients are strongly encouraged to maintain a dialogue with Business Link throughout the period of the project and beyond. Business Link acts as a gateway to most of the services the Government offers to small and medium-sized businesses in England and Business Link Advisers can offer information and advice on all aspects of setting up and running a business. Business Link provides advice to over 300,000 small businesses every year at start up and growth stages with the quality and reach of that advice increasing all the time.</p>

	<p pid=".1098W.5/1">Existing electricity trading arrangements incentives market participants to deliver secure supplies and to manage the effects of intermittent generation, along with other risks, in so doing. Our proposals for BETTA will ensure that market participants in all parts of Great Britain face a uniform set of trading arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".1098W.5/2">Analysis carried out as part of the White Paper process shows that the electricity system could cope with an increasing reliance on renewable generation, including wind. The White Paper analysis also highlights that as the proportion of intermittent generation increases, so does the cost of maintaining stable supplies. These costs need to be managed and new ways found to minimise them. We are already funding research into this through the DTIs Renewable Energy programme and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's SUPERGEN programme. In addition, as part of our current capital grant programme we allocated in 2002 an additional &pound;4 million to facilitate the demonstration of new control, storage and metering technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".1099W.7/1">The UK's vision for Bosnia is a sovereign, independent and united country, with a democratic and accountable government, a free market economy and tolerance of minority rights. We expect it to fulfil its obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. We wish to see Bosnia on an irreversible track towards European and Euro Atlantic integration. Getting there will require an evolution in the presences of the international community, including the EU and NATO. NATO Foreign Ministers agreed in December 2003 that the Alliance should start work with the EU on planning a possible EU mission under Berlin Plus arrangements. The Brussels European Council also in December 2003 endorsed this. Against this background, NATO and EU officials are taking forward planning on a possible EU mission, without prejudice to any formal decision at the June Istanbul summit to terminate SFOR.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.7/2">The UK fully supports this process and wants to see NATO successfully terminate its SFOR mission in Bosnia, probably at the end of 2004, while maintaining a limited military operational presence in the country. This would be a significant step in Bosnia's development towards a self-sustaining future. We want to see an EU-led presence, which is robust, credible and able to provide a safe and secure environment allowing the EU to take forward its objectives in Bosnia. The UK has offered to take the first lead of this EU-led mission.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.7/3">The UK wishes to see the residual NATO presence run defence outreach activities such as defence reform and Partnership for Peace programmes. We also believe it should retain some operational activities, such as hunting for indicted war criminals and counter-terrorist operations.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.7/4">Bosnia provides an opportunity for NATO and the EU to put their commitment to co-operation into practice in the first major Berlin Plus operation. Effective consultation at all levels will be crucial. The EU will need to develop a joined-up approach, linking its economic, civil, development and military instruments. The UK looks forward to supporting these efforts.</p>

	<p pid=".1100W.2/1">The Conclusions of the 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-12-13">13 December 2003</phrase> European Council welcomed the Presidency paper on &quot;European Defence: NATO/EU consultation, planning and operations.&quot; This sets out how the European Union's collective crisis management capacity can be strengthened, particularly in the field of planning. The European Council invited the Secretary General/High Representative, Javier Solana, to propose measures for the improvement of the preparation of European Union operations having recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, and for the establishment of a cell with civil and military components. The European Council concluded that these measures should enter into force as early as possible in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.2/2">We look forward to the Secretary General/High Representative's initial report, which will be a basis for discussion among EU member states and with NATO and will lead to further, more detailed work. The Government supports the strengthening of NATO/EU planning links and of ESDP planning capacity, particularly in the civilian/military area. The Presidency paper reflects UK priorities and we will remain in touch with the Council bodies and other member states as work to implement it is taken forward.</p>

	<p pid=".1101W.6/1">The Government expects initial implementation of the Strategy to concentrate on the four priority areas tasked by the European Council when it adopted the European Security Strategy at its December meeting: effective multilateralism with the UN at its core, the fight against terrorism, a strategy towards the region of the Middle East and a comprehensive policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government are committed to the full implementation of the Strategy to help bring coherence and greater robustness to the EU's external policies.</p>
	<p pid=".1101W.6/2">The UK's security posture is already in line with the analysis behind the European Security Strategy. As outlined in the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter, we have already taken steps to ensure our forces are configured to respond to the new global threats of the post September 11th world by making our armed forces more flexible, with improved global reach. The UK has long argued for improved European defence capabilities, coherence in bringing together the EU's existing tools, both civilian and military, and a strong transatlantic link. The European Security Strategy sets out the framework to achieve this.</p>

Crews are also trained to operate their vehicles whilst wearing this equipment. In addition to the NBC IPE issued to each Challenger 2 crew member during Operation Telic, further individual protection was provided through the issue of a prophylactic drug (Nerve Agent Pre-treatment System (NAPS)). NAPS is to be taken orally, when ordered to do so, during preparations for operations. Further protection against the-effects of nerve agents was provided in the form of atropine injectors. Atropine is self-administered following exposure to nerve agent poisoning.</p>

NBC filters were available in theatre but, owing to difficulties with asset tracking, were not issued to front line units in time to be fitted during the war-fighting phase of the operation. By the time NBC filters were issued to front line units, the NBC threat was deemed to have reduced significantly owing to the attrition of possible means of delivery.</p>

	<p pid=".1106W.2/2">Frontline commands, theatre commanders or Directors of Equipment Capability (DECs) can each generate requests for Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR). These are passed to the Permanent Joint Headquarters for endorsement. DECs, in co-operation with Integrated Project Teams in the Defence Procurement Agency or Defence Logistics Organisation, investigate if it is possible to fulfil the requirement through the purchase of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment. Where this is so a business case is drafted. This is then passed through an accelerated approvals process, which allows procurement action to be taken in the minimum amount of time. In most cases, the approvals process can be carried out in around a week (and in some cases as little as 24 hours). The need to ensure coherence of UORs with operational plans and priorities, to explore alternative ways of meeting the requirement or to confirm that a feasible solution can be delivered within acceptable timescales can in some instances add to the length of time needed to approve individual business cases.</p>

	<p pid=".1107W.3/1">As soon as the outbreak of avian influenza in Thailand, the only affected country with which we have regular commercial trade, was notified we put in place a prohibition on imports of poultry meat and uncooked poultry meat products from Thailand derived from animals slaughtered after <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>. Details were sent to all Border Inspection Posts, local authorities, the State Veterinary Service, Meat Hygiene Service and to HM Customs. All the enforcement bodies concerned deal with such safeguard measures on a regular basis and are familiar with the procedures and vigilance necessary for dealing with affected products. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-28">28 January</phrase> a further prohibition on imports of live birds from affected countries was issued in line with action agreed by member states in the EU and guidance issued to The State Veterinary Service and HM Customs. Prior to this precautionary measure live captive birds, such as falcons and finches, could be imported from the region on the basis of strict controls, including 30-day post import quarantine and testing for avian influenza.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/2">We are not aware of any food having been condemned as a result of avian influenza. Currently 31 consignments amounting to 489 tonnes of Thai poultry meat are detained at Border Inspection Posts, awaiting the required additional health certification.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/3">The World Health Organisation are investigating a 'possible' human-to-human transmission of the disease in two sisters in Vietnam, but it is too early to say for definite whether or not this is the case. Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is in any case rare and there have been no known cases of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. The most likely source of infection resulting in human deaths from avian influenza remains in those known to have had direct contact with infected poultry.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/4">Controls on production of poultry meat for export from Thailand, in place before the outbreak was confirmed, mean that the risk of infected meat being imported is very low. The normal tests for avian influenza are used to detect the disease in live animals, not meat. Testing of foods for microbial pathogens is seldom helpful in protecting public health because, if present at all, they are likely to be present in very small numbers and are not distributed evenly throughout foods. This means tests would be unlikely to detect the virus unless the level of sampling was impractically high and very expensive.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/5">Defra has had no discussions with the World Health Organisation on this but the global strategy recommended by WHO includes the following:</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/6" class="indent">the rapid elimination of H5N1 infection in bird populations by culling;</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/7" class="indent">protection of those who are working with, and culling, chickens to protect their health and to reduce the risk of human infection;</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/8" class="indent">improve surveillance of human respiratory disease and rapid case detection; and</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/9" class="indent">development and production of a vaccine. This is a highly complicated process and four months is considered a minimum period before vaccine could be available. Additional issues of capacity and distribution would need to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/10">The WHO has said that, on the basis of presently available data, it does not conclude that any processed poultry products (whole refrigerated or frozen carcasses and products derived from them) and eggs in, or arriving from, areas currently experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) in poultry flocks, pose a risk to public health.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/11">In the twentieth century there were four major influenza pandemics in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977. There is evidence suggesting that the 1957 and 1968 pandemics resulted from a major change to the previously circulating human virus by incorporation of genes from an avian influenza virus. Direct spread of the assumed progenitor avian virus to humans was not reproduced experimentally and it is thought that pigs, which are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses, may have played a role in supporting both viruses to allow gene re-assortment to take place.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/12">Most avian flu viruses do not affect man, or cause very mild illness, such as mild influenza-like illness or conjunctivitis. Occasionally strains of avian flu emerge which are particularly nasty. The human cases in Asia have been severe respiratory infections with a high mortality.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.3/13">The Food Standards Agency have advised that there is no risk of acquiring the Avian influenza virus through eating poultry meat. They consider the risk of infection through handling poultry meat is very low. There are no substantiated reports of people becoming infected through these routes.</p>

	<p pid=".1109W.2/1">The test, which is generally used, for the detection of TB in translocated badgers is a test for antibodies (the Brock Test). This is generally accepted to have a low sensitivity (the ability to detect diseased animals). However it is difficult to give accurate values for the sensitivity because euthanased animals are not always subject to laboratory culture.</p>
	<p pid=".1109W.2/2">Where a badger translocation is carried out under licence (from Defra or English Nature) each individual badger is tested three times. If any of the three results are positive, the badger is euthanased. Any other badger that has been in contact with the positive testing badger is also euthanased, regardless of the results of its own tests</p>
	<p pid=".1109W.2/3">Where an orphaned or previously injured badger is translocated by an animal centre or similar body they follow a voluntary code of practice (drawn up by the RSPCA, National Federation of Badgers Groups and Secret World Wildlife Rescue). Any animal to be relocated is tested three times and, if it tests positive, is euthanased. This protocol does not advise in the destruction of badgers who have had contact with a test positive badger. It should be emphasised that this voluntary protocol was not devised or approved by Defra.</p>

	<p pid=".1110W.5/1">The absolute number of new TB incidents disclosed every month is closely correlated to the rate of testing. Hence, the majority of incidents are detected in the winter months (October through March), when most herds are tested.</p>
	<p pid=".1110W.5/2">However, if the data are adjusted to take into account the seasonality of TB testing, there does not appear to be a clear seasonal pattern in the rate of new TB incidents disclosed each month (i.e. it is not possible to conclude that the herd incidence of bovine TB in certain months of the year is consistently higher than in other months).</p>
	<p pid=".1110W.5/3">Because of the difficulty in studying seasonality of TB infection, there are few reports investigating this aspect of the disease. However, the results of one such investigation was reported in a paper by Wilesmith et al (1982) <sup>1</sup> . They examined seasonal variations in the risk of acquiring infection between 1971 and 1976 for a Dorset cattle herd during an extensive TB herd breakdown. The data indicated that the April/May period presented the time of greatest risk. This correlated with possible exposure to re-infection at the start of the grazing season, exposure lasting for a relatively short time. However, re-exposure to infection was not necessarily the same as re-exposure to pasture, since some stock were out-wintered.</p>

	<p pid=".1111W.3/1">As <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> is transmitted over time there is evidence that hyper variable regions of its genome change, although most of the genome remains stable. Changes can be identified using molecular biological techniques. Hyper variable regions may change in both intra and interspecies transmission. There is no reason to believe that, except for very rare adaptive changes, the rate of mutation will increase as a strain moves between species.</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.3/2">The rate at which mutations occur depends on the region of the genome. Hence, single nucleotides have an average rate of change of about 10 <sup>-</sup> <sup>9</sup> per nucleotide per generation. However, tandem repeats that show variable numbers (variable numbers of tandem repeats, or VNTRs), show a greater rate of change. Spoligotype changes are intermediate in rate between VNTR and single nucleotide mutations.</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.3/3">We use two main techniques to detect genetic variation in <i>M. bovis</i>. The first of these, spoligotyping, exploits a polymorphic region direct repeat (DR) locus in the genome that is composed of multiple 36bp DR copies interspersed by unique spacers, with strains varying in the presence or absence of spacers. The VNTR method targets 6 alleles (A-F) that vary in the length of internal repeat units, permitting strains to be differentiated on the number of repeats at each target; i.e. 7&ndash;5-5&ndash;4-3&ndash;3-3 would have 7 copies of allele A, 5 of B, etc. High throughput facilities for both of these techniques exist at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), allowing the molecular typing of about 4,000 to 5,000 strains per year. Our current models of the population structure of <i>M. bovis</i> suggest that the VNTR loci evolve faster than the DR repeat locus. Thus spoligotyping provides a global picture of the population structure and epidemiology of <i>M. bovis</i> in Great Britain, while VNTR typing has proved useful as a fine scale method for detecting local changes in the <i>M. bovis</i> population.</p>
	<p pid=".1111W.3/4">The evolution of the members of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex has led to specific host preferences; hence <i>M. tuberculosis</i> appears human restricted, while <i>M. bovis</i> consists of a series of clones with a wider mammalian host range. The process of host adaptation probably involves a number of discreet mutations, which would all need to revert to reverse the host adaptation. Back-mutation i.e. the reversion of mutations, occurs very infrequently. The rate for a specific single nucleotide reversion would be about 10 <sup>-</sup> <sup>9</sup> X 10 <sup>-</sup> <sup>9</sup> ( or 10 <sup>-</sup> <sup>1</sup> <sup>8</sup> ) per nucleotide per generation. Indeed, if some of these mutation events were deletions they could not revert without the re introduction of the DNA. These questions are being investigated using laboratory based molecular biological techniques at the VLA.</p>

	<p pid=".1113W.2/1">Robust conclusions about such questions are difficult to make because the ecology of the North sea is complex and variable, and cod can eat a broad spectrum of food items. The current low level of cod abundance suggests that over the North Sea as a whole cod are unlikely to be food limited, although one cannot exclude the possibility of periodic local effects. As top predators, there are relatively few species with which large cod are likely to be in direct competition.</p>

	<p pid=".1120W.3/1">Under section 1(1) of the Official Secrets Act 1989 it is an offence for a member or ex-member of the security and intelligence services to disclose without lawful authority any information relating to security or intelligence obtained through their official position. This could include unauthorised disclosure to his or her legal representative. In cases where other Official Secrets Act provisions apply, the question of whether a person must seek authorisation to disclose will depend on whether the disclosure is likely to or will cause damage as set out in the relevant provisions of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1120W.3/2">There is no specific provision in the Act authorising disclosure of information to a legal representative as this would defeat the objective of the Act. However, the authorising entity&mdash;usually the employer organisation&mdash;will not unreasonably withhold authorisation to disclose to a legal representative information relevant to any criminal charge. The authorisation process itself is subject to judicial review.</p>

This new funding would mean that, for the first time, Government (through the Department, the Higher Education Funding Council and the research councils) would match the current investment of the voluntary sector.

	<p pid=".1127W.2/1">Fluoride is ingested throughout life as a normal component of food and water. Many of the numerous published studies of the effects of fluoride in animal tests and in human populations shed light on the effects of lifetime ingestion of fluoride. They include studies on diseases which are commoner at older ages, such as cancer and hip fractures. There are no known adverse effects on health outcomes from the usual range of fluoride intakes in the United Kingdom. There is however growing evidence from a number of studies that the protection from tooth decay derived from the fluoridation of water continues into old age.</p>

	<p pid=".1128W.5/1">A centre of excellence was established within the Department of Health in June 2003 to integrate the essential functions which underpin the successful delivery of all types of acquisition-based programmes and projects. As cost benefits will not accrue until improvements start to take effect, it is too early to measure cost savings. All centres of excellence are currently developing future plans, and as part of this process, measurement of savings will be defined.</p>

	<p pid=".1131W.2/1">Generally methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia rates will be higher in trusts that care for more vulnerable patients and that undertake more invasive and high-risk specialist care. A high rate does not necessarily mean that these trusts are poor performers in either infection control or other performance measures but indicate a need for further investigation. For example large teaching hospitals may import infections when patients are transferred in for specialist care.</p>
	<p pid=".1131W.2/2">A proportion of bacteraemias in all types of hospital are preventable and the aim is to lower MRSA bacteraemias overall. It is important that all trusts examine their MRSA bacteraemias to assess how much is preventable and to take appropriate control measures.</p>
	<p pid=".1131W.2/3">The mandatory surveillance system includes all bacteraemia reports and not a representative sample.
