	<p pid="c.1058W.8/2">As part of its strategy for making its collections accessible in digital format, the National Archives works with a variety of partners who make their material accessible online, nearly all of whose services are available at a variety of subscription rates to individual users. However, commercial academic partners who produce themed collections of primary historical sources from the National Archives collection currently only sell their editions to university and public libraries. The National Archives is actively encouraging these publishers to make such collections as &#8220;State Papers Online&#8221; available via individual subscriptions. These services can also be viewed at many public libraries which also purchase collections from these academic publishers, and the services are free of charge within their reading rooms. In addition, all the records which are available online from National Archives are available free of charge in the reading rooms at Kew.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.8/3">The National Archives' internally-funded service through which original records can be downloaded online, &#8220;Documents Online&#8221;, is currently only available on a pay-per-view basis to individuals and by annual subscription to institutions such as university and public libraries. However, a project is under way to provide an individual subscription model, work on which is currently expected to be finished in 2012.</p>

The current level of Administered Incentive Pricing for the 900 MHz spectrum is &#163;25 million per annum and for the 1800 MHz spectrum is &#163;40 million per annum. In December 2010 I directed Ofcom to revise the annual licence fees applying to the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz spectrum after completion of the auction of the 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz spectrum, so that they reflect the full market value of the spectrum, having particular regard to the sums bid for licences in the auction.

	<p pid="c.1066W.9/65">The Road Traffic Accident protocol involving the claims portal was implemented in April 2010. The Ministry of Justice does not hold figures centrally which specifically relate to personal injury claims or trials, or to the funding arrangements for personal injury claimants whether by conditional fee agreements or after the event insurance. Personal injury cases including those at stage 3 of the Road Traffic Accident protocol are logged onto the administrative computer systems. However these cannot be accurately distinguished from other types of cases brought for either an unspecified amount of money (where not under the protocol) or under Part 8 (where under the protocol). While appeals are recorded on IT systems, information about how they are supported whether by conditional fee agreements or after the event insurance is not held electronically.</p>

	<p pid="c.1069W.0/1">The provision of courts in England and Wales is not determined by constituency or local authority area boundaries. Many courts, and any specialist domestic violence courts (SDVCs) they might house, serve a number of constituencies and local authority areas and many of these are served by more than one court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/2">There are, at present, no plans to open any new specialist domestic violence court systems (SDVCs). As at the end of March 2011 there were 143 SDVC systems housed across 176 magistrates courts in England and Wales. Following the closure of those courts announced in December last year, there will be an SDVC at over 150 courts out of a total of 236 magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/3">The court estate reform programme will mean the closure of 23 magistrates courts which house an SDVC. However, the closure of a courthouse is not the same as the closure of an SDVC system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/4">In the case of the following seven court closures, it is proposed that the work of the existing SDVC will be moved to another courthouse that is part of an accredited SDVC system:</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/5">Acton magistrates court&#8212;work moves to the SDVC systems at Uxbridge magistrates court and Feltham magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/6">Barry magistrates court&#8212;work moves to the SDVC system at Cardiff magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/7">Hemel Hempstead magistrates court&#8212;work moves to the SDVC system at St Albans magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/8">Knowsley magistrates court work moves to the SDVC system at Liverpool magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/9">Salford magistrates court work moves to the SDVC system at Manchester magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/10">Rochdale magistrates court work moves to the SDVC system at Bury magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/11">Tamworth magistrates court work moves to the SDVC system at Burton magistrates court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/12">In the case of the following 12 court closures, the closing courthouse is only one within a system and so the system remains operational at other courthouses:</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/13">Aberdare magistrates court&#8212;the Rhondda Cynon Taff SDVC system will continue at Pontypridd magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/14">Daventry magistrates court&#8212;the Northamptonshire SDVC system will continue at Corby, Kettering and Northampton magistrates courts;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/15">Goole magistrates court&#8212;the East Riding SDVC system will continue at Beverley and Bridlington magistrates courts;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/16">Dewsbury magistrates court&#8212;the Kirklees SDVC system will continue at Huddersfield magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/17">Lewes magistrates court&#8212;the East Sussex SDVC system will continue at Hastings and Eastbourne magistrates courts;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/18">Pontefract magistrates court&#8212;the Wakefield SDVC system will continue at Wakefield magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/19">Rugby magistrates court&#8212;the Warwickshire SDVC system will continue at Nuneaton and Stratford upon Avon magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/20">Selby magistrates court&#8212;the York and Selby SDVC system will continue at York magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/21">Towcester magistrates court&#8212;the Northamptonshire SDVC system will continue at Corby, Kettering and Northampton magistrates courts;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/22">West Bromwich magistrates court&#8212;the Sandwell SDVC system will continue at Warley magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/23">Whitehaven magistrates court&#8212;the West Cumbria SDVC system will continue at Workington magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/24">Haringey magistrates court&#8212;the Haringey/Tottenham SDVC system will continue at Enfield magistrates court (to be renamed Tottenham magistrates court as of <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/25">In the following remaining four cases, closure of the courthouse will involve the transfer of the SDVC work to a court that is currently not part of an accredited SDVC system:</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/26">Andover magistrates court to Basingstoke magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/27">Alton magistrates court to Andover magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/28">Bridgwater magistrates court to Taunton magistrates court;</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/29">Grays magistrates court to Basildon magistrates court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/30">The Ministry and the SDVC National Steering Group will give consideration to whether these courts should become part of an accredited system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1069W.0/31">Guidance has been issued by the National Steering Group to all SDVC partnerships to assist them in adapting to the changes presented by the closure of a courthouse within the SDVC system. This is designed to ensure that all partners have been involved in the transfer process, that all operational activities are transferred to the desired location and any challenges this presents are addressed at an early stage. This will ensure a smooth transition to the revised court estate, while maintaining the high level of support for victims of domestic abuse.</p>

	<p pid="c.1074W.2/1">Service personnel diagnosed as HIV positive are managed according to their medical condition, their treatment needs and their specific role within HM armed forces. All cases are dealt with on an individual basis and so it is not possible to predict the potential effect of a diagnosis of HIV.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/2">Service policy does not discriminate against individuals with HIV infection or AIDS. Personnel diagnosed as HIV positive are therefore managed in accordance with normal downgrading and subsequent employability arrangements. However, those with AIDS are normally recommended for medical discharge.</p>

The board inspect the centre at least twice a year and report their findings to Ministers. They inspect, among other things, the condition of the premises and the treatment, health and welfare of detainees. The arrangements are very similar to those in place for civilian detention facilities in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1077W.0/2">The Ministry of Defence provides secretariat and administrative support for the Independent Monitoring Board. The board receives no direct funding from the Ministry of Defence, though travel expenses incurred by and recruitment costs of its members are funded by the Military Corrective Training Centre. Travel expenses amount to less than &#163;3,000 per annum. Recruitment costs occur as and when vacancies arise and in 2010-11 amounted to some &#163;2,500.</p>

	<p pid="c.1079W.6/1">The Advisory Group on Military Medicine (AGOMM) was approved by the Cabinet Office as a non-departmental public body in August 2008, continuing the work previously undertaken by the Advisory Group on Medical Countermeasures (AGMC). Its purpose is to provide: independent statements on the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines and medical devices that may be deployed and employed by the armed forces; specific advice on medical products that are unlicensed or Ministry of Defence intends to use for a purpose other than its licensed use; peer review research, development and acquisition programmes that will deliver future operational medical capability; provide independent advice on policy, doctrine, training and practice issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.6/2">As an advisory non-departmental public body it will advise Ministers, but not employ staff or incur expenditure on its own account. The Surgeon General will be a member of the Executive Committee and will provide the secretariat functions for the committee from existing full time HQ Surgeon General Staff. In addition, the committee may draw on the pool of expertise found within the Ministry of Defence and other Government Departments for specific tasks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1079W.6/3">The total cost to the Department for work undertaken by AGOMM during the financial year 2010-11 was &#163;5,063.73. This was broken down as follows: daily rate staff costs of &#163;2,562.00, travel and subsistence costs of &#163;2,501.73. It should be noted that AGOMM is scheduled to meet at least twice a year, but only met once in 2010-11. Work is currently under way to finalise the tasking arrangements for the financial year 2011-12. If AGOMM does meet twice in 2011-12 then an approximate doubling of expenditure shown for 2010-11 is expected.</p>

	<p pid="c.1081W.5/1">13 regional Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committees (VAPCs) were established in 2010 as a 12 month pilot to build on the role of the War Pensions Committees. Their purpose is to provide advice, assistance and support to the service and ex-service community on pensions and compensation. They also provide advice and raise awareness to other public bodies and the local communities on the needs of veterans. The Ministry of Defence provides the secretariat functions for the VAPCs, this equates to 1.25 permanent staff. The annual budget for 2011-12 is &#163;41,000 and the main items of expenditure are travel and subsistence. Members are volunteers and receive out of pocket expenses.</p>

	<p pid="c.1082W.0/1">The Science Advisory Committee on the Medical Implications of Less Lethal Weapons (SACMILL) was approved as a non-departmental public body in June 2009 and will be established soon. It is expected to be established later this year and it will continue the work previously undertaken by the Defence Science Advisory Council Subcommittee on the Medical Implications of Less Lethal Weapons (DOMILL).</p>
	<p pid="c.1082W.0/2">SACMILL&#8217;s purpose will be to provide: advice on the biophysical, biomechanical, pathological and clinical aspects of generic classes of Less Lethal Weapons; independent statements on the medical implications of use of specific Less Lethal Weapons; advice on the risk of injury from specific Less Lethal Weapons systems striking specific areas of the body in a format that will assist those responsible for developing policy and, separately, guidance to users, as well as operational users themselves in making tactical decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1082W.0/3">As an advisory non-departmental public body it will advise Ministers, but not employ staff or incur expenditure on its own account. The Surgeon General will be a member of the Executive Committee and will provide the secretariat functions for the committee from existing full-time HQ Surgeon General Staff. In addition, the committee may draw on the pool of expertise found within the Ministry of Defence and other Government Departments for specific tasks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1082W.0/4">The total cost to the Department for DOMILL legacy work undertaken during the financial year 2010-11 was &#163;39,355.56, principally for travel and subsistence costs. Work is currently under way to finalise the tasking arrangements for the financial year 2011-12; a similar level of expenditure as the previous year is expected.</p>

The Office of Manpower Economics (within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) provides the secretariat function. The 2011-12 Ministry of Defence budget for AFPRB activity is &#163;88,920; the main items of expenditure are AFPRB member salaries (&#163;66,750) and the production of the AFPRB Report (&#163;8,572).

	<p pid="c.1090W.2/3">Regular detailed scrutiny of submarine reactor plant safety is conducted by expert personnel from within the Ministry of Defence, including the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator and the Health and Safety Executive's Office of Nuclear Regulation and by independent nuclear safety assessors to ensure safety is benchmarked against national and internationally accepted standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.2/4">For reasons of security, I do not intend to go into further detail about specific aspects of nuclear submarine reactor plant design, or what specific assessments have, or will be undertaken for future reactor plant designs. However, all such considerations are subject to a rigorous assessment against principles that are consistent with those applied across all UK nuclear reactor programmes, of which safety is a paramount consideration. These principles are embodied within the Health and Safety Executive's Safety Assessment Principles, which were adopted by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator during 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.1092W.8/1">The Government have been clear that a 4.9% increase in EU spending in 2012, proposed by the Commission, is unacceptable. The letter signed by the UK, France, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands in December last year clearly states that growth in EU spending in 2012 must be curbed. The Government will work with other member states to deliver the best possible outcome for UK taxpayers in future negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1095W.9/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is aware of the allegations in respect of these projects and has written to the CDM Executive Board to request a robust investigation. Of the two projects mentioned in recent representations by Biofuelswatch, the UK Government have issued only a Letter of Authorisation (LoA) in respect of the participation of EDF Trading Ltd in the Aguan Biogas Recovery project (CDM reference number 3197). The Lean Biogas Recovery project was not authorised by the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.9/2">When assessing the Aguan project the standard procedures for dealing with applications seeking UK authorisation of companies participation in CDM projects were followed. These require the applicant to submit documentation including a letter of approval from the Honduran Government stating that the project contributes to sustainable development alongside a declaration that all documentation is correct. On the basis of these assurances, a letter of authorisation was issued to EDF Trading Ltd based on these assurances on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-03">3 June 2009</phrase>, prior to the events recounted in the allegations. We understand that EDF energy has since withdrawn from participation in the project.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.9/3">The final assessment of whether any CDM project is compliant with CDM rules lies with the CDM Executive Board, which is currently reviewing the status of the Aguan project.</p>

	<p pid="c.1096W.2/1">The allegations of human rights abuses in connection with these two projects were first brought to the attention of the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-04">4 February 2011</phrase>, when a letter of protest was received from a coalition of NGOs led by Biofuelwatch. This was followed in early April by a mass e-mail campaign.</p>
	<p pid="c.1096W.2/2">The allegations are plainly deplorable. Consequently the Secretary of State wrote to number of relevant organisations and responsible bodies, expressing his concern and requesting further information. These organisations included the Honduran authorities, the CDM Executive Board and the UK authorised project participant, EDF Trading Ltd. The Secretary of State also asked the Executive Board to assess whether the project meets CDM rules and to deal with the human rights allegations in so far as they are able.</p>
	<p pid="c.1096W.2/3">EDF Trading Ltd has recently announced that it is terminating its involvement in the two projects. Of the two projects EDF had received only a UK Letter of Authorisation (LoA) for one: the Aguan Biogas Recovery Project. Since the UK LoA was valid for use only by EDF, the termination of their involvement in the project effectively renders the letter defunct.</p>

	<p pid="c.1118W.14/1">The Government have no single policy on the use of police custody suites to detain individuals suffering from mental ill health or who are drunk and disorderly, as each case is considered individually and will be an operational matter for the police to assess. However, the National Policing Improvement Agency and the Association of Chief Police Officers published &#8220;Guidance on the Safer Detention and Handling of Persons in Police Custody in 2006&#8221; which examined under what circumstances detention in police custody is appropriate and safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.14/2">The police have specific powers under the Mental Health Act 1983 to remove someone suffering from mental ill health and in need of immediate care to a place of safety when necessary. A place of safety could be residential accommodation, a hospital, a police station, a specialist care home or other appropriate accommodation. However, guidance stipulates that a police station should only be used in exceptional circumstances and local protocols should exist to specify more appropriate locations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.14/3">For those under the influence of alcohol who have been identified as being a high medical risk, hospital should always be the first option.

	<p pid="c.1135W.6/2">The Home Office's Olympic and Paralympic safety and security strategy, run by the police, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic games (LOCOG), the Olympic Delivery Authority and other partners, provides a framework for projects to safeguard and secure London 2012. The police and security services already invest significant resource into planning for security and other major risks to the UK, and have considerable expertise in dealing with both threats and incidents. Our approach to the games is intelligence-led and risk-based, giving us the flexibility to respond to any changes between now and 2012. Regular threat assessments inform our risk management process. Threat levels may change rapidly, and by basing the plans against a SEVERE threat level we maximise our flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.6/3">Last year the Minister for Security and Counter-Terrorism, my noble Friend Baroness Neville-Jones, conducted an audit and review of Olympic security planning, and that concluded that that work is well placed. There is of course more work to be done, but an effective foundation has already been established. We have protected the Olympic security budget, which is in addition to core funding for the police and counter-terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="c.1138W.2/1">There are two sources of statistics on crime in England and Wales: police recorded crime and the British Crime Survey (BCS). Police recorded crime is based on offences reported to and recorded by the police. The BCS is a sample survey restricted to the population resident in households but includes crimes not reported to the police. While both sources provide estimates of the number of offences experienced by victims they cover, neither source can be used to provide counts of the characteristics (e.g. age) of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1138W.2/2">Information on offenders dealt with by the criminal justice system is available from the Ministry of Justice. Latest figures including trends for juvenile offenders dealt with by formal police cautions, reprimands or warning, or criminal court proceedings in England and Wales appear in the annual statistical bulletin &#8216;Criminal Statistics: England and Wales 2009&#8217; or &#8216;Youth Justice Board annual workload statistics 2009-10&#8217;.

Byway of comparison, the costs of administering the EMA scheme nationally are also around 5% of the total expenditure.</p>

For example, in India we are promoting solar lighting in remote rural areas through the Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihoods Programme. Under this pilot, tribal woman are trained to fabricate and maintain solar lighting for homes, schools and streets. A feasibility study has been prepared for scale-up in 400 non-electrified Indian villages. Additionally, we are also about to start a five-year partnership with the Energy and Resources Institute which is focused on scaling up access to energy in Indian rural areas, including solar lighting.</p>

	<p pid="c.1150W.2/2">Pakistan is one of this Government's most important foreign policy, defence and development priorities. A stable, prosperous and democratic Pakistan, at ease with its regional neighbours and equipped with the will and capacity to tackle violent extremism, is of direct and critical importance to the security of the UK and its interests.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/3">Pakistan is currently dealing with major domestic challenges, including how to: tackle a large militant insurgency in its border regions; achieve democratic and economic reform; and recover from the aftermath of last year's devastating floods. In addition, the Government of Pakistan are now grappling with the aftermath of the death of Osama Bin Laden. We will work with Pakistan's coalition Government in facing these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/4">Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan is pivotal to UK interests there. We are working with Pakistan to achieve our shared goals of lasting stability and security in Afghanistan. As the Prime Minister said in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-03">3 May 2011</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/5">&#8220;The death of Bin Laden provides a new opportunity for Afghanistan and Pakistan to work together to achieve stability on both sides of the border&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/6">Pakistan's relationship with India is also crucial for stability in the region. We welcome recent contact and discussions between India and Pakistan, including during the cricket World Cup semi-finals in Mohali. The pace, scope and substance of dialogue is for the two countries to decide.</p>
	<p pid="c.1150W.2/7">Pakistan is a partner in tackling militancy, terrorism and extremism. We pay tribute to the sacrifices of ordinary Pakistanis and the members of the Pakistani armed forces, and the courage they have shown in tackling violent extremism. This is a shared fight, in which Pakistan is on the front line. We offer Pakistan our full support.</p>

Departmental officials working on public health commissioning, funding and outcomes policies met with colleagues from the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, and the British Dietetic Association who together represented the Allied Health Professionals Federation. Following this meeting, responses were submitted by a number of allied health professional representative bodies to the consultation on the public health White Paper and associated documents. This consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> and we will take the views expressed by these and all other stakeholders into consideration. Government's response to the consultation will be published in the summer of this year. The Government are committed to developing a public health work force strategy for consultation in autumn 2011 and have established a working group to advise and support this process. The Chair of the National Allied Health Professional Advisory Board is a member of the Public Health Workforce Strategy Group.</p>

Despite this, some people consider they react badly to consuming the sweetener. The FSA has therefore commissioned a pilot study focusing on people who have self-reported bad reactions to the sweetener in order to understand why this is the case. Participants in the study will be at least 18 but the results should be applicable to people of any age.</p>

	<p pid="c.1153W.5/1">I and departmental officials work very closely with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) on the application of the Working Time Directive to the United Kingdom Healthcare sector, meeting as appropriate. This directive is once again being considered by the European Commission and both Departments agree that we should pursue discussions in Europe with the intention of maintaining the individual&#8217;s right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week while seeking greater flexibility particularly in the areas of on-call time and compensatory rest. This strategy is in-keeping with the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to work to limit the application of the Working Time Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1153W.5/2">The Department engaged with the national health service European Office as they formulated their response to the European Commission&#8217;s second stage Social Partner consultation on Working Time and, also, when the NHS European Office provided their contribution to wider social partner responses (such as those of the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation and of Enterprises of General Economic Interest and the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers&#8217; Association).</p>
	<p pid="c.1153W.5/3">The NHS European Office are members of the Working Time Directive stakeholder group co-chaired by the Department and BIS. This group has convened to review the proposals put forward by the European Commission as part of its second stage consultation on Working Time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1153W.5/4">Ensuring service rotas are compliant and assessing the effects implementation of the directive is having on patients and staff is the responsibility of individual NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1153W.5/5">In response to concerns about the directive, Medical Education England (MEE) commissioned an independent review chaired by Professor Sir John Temple. The review&#8217;s findings concluded that high quality training can be delivered in 48 hours but traditional models of training and service delivery waste training opportunities and will need to change. Additionally, it demonstrates that far more can be done to improve medical training by changing working practices and taking advantage of the increase in consultants working in the NHS.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)</phrase>, has asked MEE to take the lead in implementing changes to improve training practices in line with the aspirations in Sir John Temple&#8217;s report &#8216;Time for Training&#8217; (2010). In response, MEE is taking forward a detailed implementation plan, &#8216;Better Training, Better Care&#8217;.</p>

In October 2008, new codes were introduced which provided more detail with respect to disabling conditions. The &quot;Learning Difficulty&quot; group was separated out into six categories, one of which is &quot;Autism&quot;. 6. Codes for existing DLA claimants were not updated, so therefore the number of cases with new codes is extremely small compared to the total numbers in receipt of DLA.

	<p pid="c.1163W.2/11">From 2013 we will introduce a new benefit, personal independence payment, to replace disability living allowance for people of working age. Key to personal independence payment will be a more objective assessment of individual need. We have been developing our proposals for the new assessment in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health, social care and disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1163W.2/12">The assessment will take account of needs arising from physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. We believe it is right for the assessment to look at disabled people as individuals and not simply label them by their health condition or impairment. Therefore the assessment is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need, rather than basing eligibility on any medical condition. Before finalising the assessment criteria we will be testing them and assessing their impact.</p>

	<p pid="c.1168W.11/1">The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) policy is to develop its staff in the skills required to support a range of customers and to respect their individual needs. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances while treating customers as individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/2">The learning programme for Jobcentre Plus focuses on raising awareness of the customer's personal circumstances and also recognises that disabilities and health conditions can affect individuals in different ways and will change over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/3">All Jobcentre Plus staff receive foundation learning which covers excellent customer service, diversity and customer needs. These deal with the wide range of circumstances that our customers may have, some less obvious than others, and stress how important it is to look for signs where the customer does not give us this information directly and to offer appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/4">In particular for Advisers the learning has placed a greater emphasis on the need for personalisation and flexibility to enable advisers to build strong relationships with customers. It includes Adviser Skills learning with a core series of Adviser Skills workshops, periods of supported workplace consolidation and knowledge and procedural learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/5">The key messages throughout this learning focuses on providing a personalised, flexible service to the customer and treating them as individuals. The learning provides an understanding of why this approach is important; what it means to the customer; what it looks like and how it works in practice. It further supports the adviser to identify the range of customers and the level of individual support they would need to provide and identify where more specialist help may be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/6">This specialist help can come from our Disability Employment Advisers who have extensive and specialist learning in addition to the detail provided above.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/7">In addition an extensive learning programme has been developed to support the implementation of IB Reassessment. Training is being provided for Jobcentre Plus staff across Contact Centres, Benefit Centres and Jobcentres. In recognition of the varied needs of the IB reassessment customer group and the impact that the change will have on customers, the learning includes behavioural/cultural topics as well as the technical aspects required for the processing of benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/8">PDCS deals with pension age customers and customers with disabilities, and includes the Local Service visiting function, a function which has recently been extended to include visits to vulnerable customers on behalf of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/9">In common with Jobcentre Plus, all PDCS staff are given foundation training in customer service, diversity and communications according to learning requirements as part of their induction. Ongoing training and development is provided throughout their career, as part of their ongoing performance and development, or on change of job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/10">PDCS staff have access to training in Excellent Customer Service and training on understanding the needs of customers who have disabilities. There is also a training package on communication barriers and the assistance that can be arranged to resolve communication problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/11">Local Service visiting staff are given awareness training on the needs of older people, include training in health and vulnerability, which covers strokes in particular. The learning package highlights empathy, diversity/equality and managing emotional responses. It also covers support services available to customers, while emphasising the need for an empowering approach to combat the negative spiral which can increase dependency. This learning package is currently being broadened to cover the needs of all age groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1168W.11/12">To support future plans for business restructuring within the Local Service function, a learning intervention is currently being developed for telephony staff, which will cover understanding customers' needs, vulnerability and communication issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.1179W.6/1">In earlier enterprise zones business rate relief lasted for 10 years. This sometimes meant that, over time, rate reductions were passed on' to landlords in the form of increased rents..</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.6/2">In the new generation of enterprise zones we are limiting business rate relief to 5 years. As the average lease is (around) 6.5 years&#8212;this will reduce the ability of landowners to pass on business rate reductions into higher rents when leases are re-negotiated.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.2/3">registered providers will be able to let a property at an affordable rent (inclusive of service charges, where applicable) of up to 80% of the gross market rent where it is part of a development agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency. It would be open to providers to offer a rent at less than 80% of market rates if that best suited local circumstances. A provider&#8217;s calculation of market rent would need to be based on a residential lettings estimate for a property of the appropriate size, condition and area. Valuations should be in accordance with a Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognised method.</p>

It is anticipated that 388,490 adult apprenticeship places will be funded across England in the 2010/11 academic year. Individual colleges and training organisations have been given the freedom and flexibility to work directly with their local partners, to determine the actual mix of provision that best meets the needs of their communities.

	<p pid="c.1188W.0/1">The apprenticeships programme is demand led. Government provides funding and forecasts the overall number of places that may be afforded. We rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local demand, taking advantage of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system. Funding of places for adult apprentices, those aged 19 and over, is not further split by age and we do not directly control the level of supply of places for those aged 19 to 25.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.0/2">The coalition Government are committed to increasing freedoms for further education colleges and training providers, so that they are able to provide tailored solutions to meet the needs within their communities. &#8220;Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221; and &#8220;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221; set out these principles. The National Apprenticeship Service, working with the Skills Funding Agency and local authorities, regularly review the take up of apprenticeships by both employers and individuals (across all age groups) to ensure that demand for apprenticeships is being met by supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.0/3">Across the programme, supply of apprenticeship places is at an all time high. Overall, with the new measures announced in this year&#8217;s Budget, this Government will deliver at least 250,000 more apprenticeships over the next four years, compared to the previous Government&#8217;s plans. In the 2009/10 academic year, 19 to 24-year-olds started 113,800 apprenticeship frameworks, a 34.3% increase on 2008/09.</p>

An independent evaluation by Adroit Economics in 2010 found the London Business and IP Centre delivered an increase in gross value added of &#163;1.29 for every &#163;1 invested.

	<p pid="c.1204W.11/1">I and my officials work very closely with the Department of Health on the application of the Working Time Directive to the UK Healthcare sector, meeting as appropriate. This directive is once again being considered by the European Commission and both Departments agree that we should pursue discussions in Europe with the intention of maintaining the individual&#8217;s right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week while seeking greater flexibility particularly in the areas of on-call time and compensatory rest. This strategy is in-keeping with the commitment in the coalition agreement to work to limit the application of the Working Time Directive.</p>
