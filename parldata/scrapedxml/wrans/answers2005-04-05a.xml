	<p pid="a.1307W.3/1">HM Customs and Excise analysis indicates that the price elasticity of demand for changes in Air Passenger Duty (APD) duty rates is low, and air travel has proven relatively unresponsive to changes in price. My right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced a freeze on air passenger duty for the year ahead in his recent Budget report. The Chancellor takes into account a range of social, economic and environmental considerations, including the effects of APD on passenger numbers, when setting levels of taxation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1308W.6/1">As required by the Code for Fiscal Stability&quot;, the Treasury publishes illustrative long- term fiscal projections as part of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (EFSR). The long-term macroeconomic assumptions are stated in Annex A of the EFSR. Regarding long-term employment rates, Annex A of the 2005 EFSR states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.6/2" class="indent">By assumption, employment is driven entirely by demographic trends. Specifically, with the overall employment rate assumed to remain constant from 2009&ndash;10 onwards, changes in employment levels reflect changes in the working-age population&quot; (Budget 2005, page 178).</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.6/3">No specific assumptions regarding the future evolution of male and female employment rates are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1308W.6/4">In addition to the illustrative long-term fiscal projections, the Treasury also publishes the Long-term Public Finance Report (LTPFR) alongside the pre-Budget report. The baseline results of the 2004 LTPFR are also based on the assumption of an unchanged total employment rate beyond the medium term. In addition, the 2004 LTPFR (pages 33&ndash;37) presents results based on an alternative approach to projecting employment trends.</p>

	<p pid="a.1313W.2/1">The Government are committed to an accessible public transport system in which disabled people have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society. We have already introduced regulations under part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to make all new trains, buses and coaches accessible and have announced our proposals for taxis. However, although associated infrastructure is covered, transport services are currently exempt from part 3 of the DDA which covers access to goods, services and facilities. The Government consider that to be an untenable position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313W.2/2">Measures have been included in the Disability Discrimination Bill currently being considered by Parliament to allow for the removal of that exemption through regulations. We have completed consultation on draft regulations which would cover public transport&mdash;trains (including light rail, underground and trams), buses, coaches, taxis and private hire&mdash;vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used in leisure and tourism transport services. Subject to the passage of the Bill, we intend to lift the exemption for those services in December 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1323W.3/2">For Syria, the conflict gave rise to the movement of numbers of Iraqis across Syria's borders. There is evidence that some Syrian extremists have travelled to Iraq to take part in the insurgency.

A stable and prosperous Iraq is in the best interests of Iran as well as the wider region. We have encouraged Iran to play a constructive role and to support Iraqi efforts to preserve security. We have made clear our concern at the alleged links between elements of the Iranian regime and armed groups in Iraq who have sought to undermine the rule of law.</p>

However a sale, not in the class above, made to a member of the public, even if in wholesale quantities, will become a licensable activity under the 2003 Act when it is fully operational.

	<p pid="a.1333W.7/1">It is for individual schools to decide how best to make provision for children with autism. The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice advises schools and local education authorities (LEAs) that children's needs should be assessed individually and that provision should address the particular needs of the individual child. It gives advice to schools on making provision for children with SEN, including those with autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333W.7/2">The Department for Education and Skills, together with the Department of Health, has issued good practice guidance on making provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders which aims to raise awareness of autism. Nine of the 11 SEN regional partnerships have working groups focusing on improving provision for children with autism in their areas, using the good practice guidance. The regional partnerships have also been producing other autism guidance, including guidance on delivering the curriculum for children with autism in secondary schools, a transition toolkit for children with autism moving from primary to secondary school, and guidance for learning support assistants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333W.7/3">Over recent years many LEAs have used available funding to support in-service training on autism. As part of the Government's SEN strategy, published last year, the Department is working with the Teacher Training Agency to develop proposals for improving training in relation to SEN, including autism. An inclusion development programme is also being developed to strengthen the evidence base about what works in educating children with autism and build a consensus about how to implement good practice most effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1336W.8/1">The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 amended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to cover the provision of education. The 2001 Act required local authorities (LAs) and schools not to discriminate against disabled people in their access to education for reasons relating to their disability. It also required LAs and schools to plan to increase progressively, and over time, access to schools by disabled pupils and prospective pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.8/2">The Government's SEN Strategy: Removing Barriers to achievement&quot; is providing support to help schools and LAs implement these duties through the development of guidance and practical tools. These tools explain how they can make reasonable adjustments to their policies and practice to prevent discrimination, and how they can review and revise their accessibility strategies and plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336W.8/3">The Department is also making available &pound;300 million through the Schools Access Initiative between <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> to cover the first accessibility planning period. This funding is intended to support projects to improve the accessibility of mainstream schools to disabled pupils. It is for LAs to decide the schools at which projects are to be undertaken. We are encouraging schools and LAs to consider access as part of all capital building plans, including through the Building Schools for the Future programme and the recently announced 15 year capital investment programme for Primary Schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.1337W.6/2">The Department does not issue guidance or general advice to local authorities in respect of meals on wheels. This is a matter for local decision and commissioning, taking into account local circumstances and demography.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.6/3">The Department has just launched the food in schools toolkit to provide guidance and support for schools and those working with schools, including local education authorities (LEAs), in implementing a 'whole school approach' to healthy eating and drinking. In addition, the Department issues guidance to LEA maintained schools on implementing the school fruit and vegetable scheme. Funding for the scheme for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;46 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337W.6/4">The welfare food scheme (WFS) currently provides tokens for either seven pints of liquid cow's milk or 900grams of infant formula per week to pregnant women and children under five years old in families on qualifying benefits. Healthy Start&quot; will replace the existing WFS and will be phased in from summer 2005. We expect that Healthy Start&quot; expenditure should continue at a similar level to the WFS. The budget is demand-led and current welfare food expenditure is approximately &pound;140 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1338W.8/1">Children's services authorities are in the process of appointing the directors of children's services (DCS) and lead members for children's services required under the Children Act 2004. About 60 authorities report that they have a DCS in place or have appointed one; almost as many have designated a lead member. The director and lead member will improve children's services authority accountability for the placement of all looked after children by being, respectively, professionally and politically responsible on behalf of the authority for the safety and welfare of such children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.8/2">Although all members of the authority have a shared responsibility for corporate parenting, the lead member will take the lead in ensuring that looked after children have their interests protected, their opportunities maximised, their educational achievement enhanced and their care shaped to meet their needs. Draft statutory guidance, on which we have consulted and which will be published shortly, states explicitly that the lead member should take the local political lead in all corporate parenting issues. The 2004 Act also introduces a new duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievement of looked after children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.8/3">The Department is currently conducting a review of local authority practice in placing looked after children in other local authority areas, with a view to both reducing their dependence on such placements and improving support for children who are placed out of authority. In the meantime, we have written to local authorities to remind them of the importance of ensuring that looked after children are placed out-of-authority only where their assessed needs clearly justify it, and to review their current practice to ensure that they are meeting their existing statutory responsibilities; taking steps to prevent, wherever possible, children being placed away from home (e.g. by developing an adequate supply of good quality local foster and residential care places); and securing good outcomes for children who are placed out-of-authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1338W.8/4">We have also asked the Commission for Social Care Inspection to offer advice on how best they can monitor and assess local authority practice in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.2/1">The National Literacy Strategy, now the Primary National Strategy, places a clear and early emphasis on synthetic phonics instruction, reinforced by complementary reading strategies such as context, grammatical knowledge and word recognition. This is in line with the best available international research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.2/2">We have produced structured teaching materials for teachers on synthetic phonics entitled Progression in Phonics&quot; published in 1999, and Playing with Sounds&quot;: a supplement to Progression in Phonics&quot; published in 2004. Copies of these have been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.2/3">The approach to the teaching of synthetic phonics advocated by the Primary National Strategy is that children should be taught as quickly as possible to identify, segment and blend phonemes in speech and writing, and that this should be taught directly, and not left to inference or invention. We recommend that synthetic phonics should be taught as a separate set of skills and knowledge within the broader structure of the literacy hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.2/4">The Playing with Sounds programme is designed to support the learning and teaching of synthetic phonics for children from the ages of three to six. It begins with developing children's awareness and discrimination of sounds and supports their progression through segmentation and blending, to an ability to read and spell regular polysyllabic words. The pace at which children are introduced to phonic knowledge through the Playing with Sounds programme is quicker than that set out in the original National Literacy Strategy framework and supports the achievement of the foundation stage early learning goals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1339W.5/1">The National Literacy Strategy is based on the best international research available and supports the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum. It advocates a model of teaching reading which has come to be known by the Searchlights&quot; metaphor. The model characterises reading as the ability to coordinate and orchestrate four basic cues. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/2" class="indent">Fast automatic phonic decoding</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/3" class="indent">The recognition of word and word parts</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/4" class="indent">Predictions from knowledge of syntax to make sense of strings of words</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/5" class="indent">Predictions from context to aid comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/6">The Searchlight model is designed to enable the reader to cross-refer between cues, which support each other. The ability to use this range of cues together makes it less critical if one of them fails on any given occasion. However, we promote phonics as the first and foremost strategy that children employ as they encounter new words.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339W.5/7">Phonic decoding and instant recognition of high frequency irregular words are the cues employed at the level of word recognition; grammatical knowledge and understanding of context operate at the level of phrases, sentences and text as a whole. Therefore both aspects of the reading process, decoding and comprehension, are represented in the approach and complement each other.</p>

Written guidance for local authorities and delivery partners emphasises the importance of parental involvement in the planning and implementation of children's centres. Parental involvement must be discussed with local authorities in planning discussions. A new Framework for Inspection of Children's Services will ensure that inspections assess how services involve children and parents. We are developing a mechanism for assessing the extent to which parents are involved in the design and delivery of children's centres services. And we will implement this when a greater number of parents have a children's centre planned in their area.</p>

When Defra is officially notified of a new disease incident in an EU member state, a country on the border of the EU or one of the UK's third country trading partners, we carry out a qualitative risk analysis.

As soon as Defra was notified of the outbreak in Thailand, safeguard measures were put in place to ban imports of fresh poultry meat. Cooked poultry meat that has not been heat treated to at least 70C has also been banned. Imports of live poultry from the affected countries are not permitted.</p>

Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 is not comparable with other years.</p>

Further work is needed on the model before we can draw conclusions on policy options. As scientific information is generated from the RBCT and other studies (e.g. Republic of Ireland Four Area Trial), it will be used to inform the assumptions used in the model and so reduce the uncertainty surrounding the results. The model will help inform policy decisions and areas for future research. It is at present not possible to reliably identify infected badgers except by post-mortem examination and laboratory culture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1350W.5/1">There is no link between increase in human tuberculosis (TB) and the spread of bovine TB among cattle in the United Kingdom (UK). Human TB is most often caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (which is usually acquired from another human) and not by <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, the cause of bovine TB, which nowadays is rarely transmitted to man.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350W.5/2">Between 20 and 50 (typically 40) people have been diagnosed with bovine TB in the UK annually since 1990, representing 1 per cent. to 1.5 per cent. of culture-confirmed cases of TB in humans. Their geographical distribution does not mirror that of bovine TB in the cattle population. Most cases are attributed to (i)reactivation of old infection contracted prior to widespread pasteurisation of milk, or (ii) infection contracted abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.1351W.8/1">Farmers are obliged to register land they intend to use as part of a claim to the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). Such registrations extend the process established under the Integrated Agricultural Control System, through which more than &pound;1.7 million land parcels were registered. Demand for land registrations is unprecedented, with requests from farmers intending to apply for SPS and those seeking to enter into agreements for the Environmental Stewardship Scheme. In the past six months the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has received nearly 25,000 registrations, when it normally expects to receive around 9,000 requests annually. The RPA has increased processing capacity but there is inevitably a current backlog of claims awaiting completion. At the current rate of progress most registrations will be processed by the end of June but some requests, particularly those received close to the <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase> deadline for submitting an SPS application ,might not be processed until August. The RPA is giving priority to those registrations that affect an outstanding scheme payment. Once the current round of applications has been dealt with, it is expected that the situation will stabilise and subsequent applications will be dealt with more quickly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1352W.5/1">No such assessment has been made. However, we understand that the RSPB is content with the existing arrangement of the feeding of Category 2 and 3 material (i.e. butchers' waste) to wild necrophagous birds and that a derogation to permit the use of ruminant fallen stock as feed material is not, therefore, necessary. Accordingly, the UK has exercised the derogation that permits member states to authorise the feeding of animal by-products which do not contain SRM to birds of prey.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352W.5/2">Even when burial was permitted carcases were required to be buried in such a way that carnivorous animals (including necrophagous birds) could not gain access to them. Therefore the effect of the ban on burial is minimal as carcases should not have been left uncovered where birds could have gained access to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1352W.8/1">The Department has not made such an assessment. However, the National Fallen Stock Company has analysed the coverage provided by the National Fallen Stock Scheme and concluded there is a reasonable choice of collection services available to farmers in most areas. The Company has said that under most circumstances it would expect carcases to be collected within 48 hours following notification and since the Scheme began the Company has only received just over 200 complaints about delays in collection out of around 60,000 pick ups nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1352W.8/2">However, within this encouraging assessment, the Company has acknowledged that there are particular problems with service provision in North Wales and some other localised areas including the Isle of Wight where the only Scheme collector has left the Scheme. The Company is taking action to address these difficulties with the co-operation of the fallen stock collection industry and other relevant parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1359W.2/2">Since 2003 investigations have been under way into the impact of the discharge made by Munton's plc into the short sea outfall pipe at Sewerby. These have shown that there are no discharges of human sewage into the outfall, which is owned by the East Riding of Yorkshire council. The indicator organisms found in the discharge are present in the raw materials (grain) brought to the site and the malting process carried out there provides the humid, dark conditions which encourage multiplication.</p>
	<p pid="a.1359W.2/3">Following discussions between the company, the Environment Agency and the council, it has been agreed that additional treatment, by way of a reed bed system, should be provided to reduce bacterial concentrations and provide storage to balance flows. Discharge of effluent would also be limited to when there is sufficient dilution at the outlet to prevent visual nuisance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1360W.0/1">Following is a list of 84 countries which we understand still impose a ban on the import of British beef. The situation in a further 27 countries has still to be confirmed. In addition there is continuing dialogue between the EU and Egypt on recently revised Egyptian import conditions. The reasons cited for the bans are animal and public health related.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.0/2">However, we consider that these bans are not justified in the light of science and the BSE controls applied in the UK. Currently, beef exports can only take place under the stringent conditions of the Date-based Export Scheme, which complies fully with EU and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1360W.0/3">We are currently working with the European Commission for recognition that, like most other EU member states, the UK is now a moderate (rather than high) risk country according to current OIE rules. We are also working with the Commission with a view to lifting the ban on the export of beef from UK cattle born after July 1996 as soon as possible after the over-30-month rule is replaced by testing and these cattle can be sold for human consumption in the UK.</p>

In addition, UK overseas posts have standing instructions to report any misuse of UK-origin defence equipment. Evidence of misuse would be taken into account when the Government assesses any subsequent licence applications for the end-user. We may also, if appropriate, revoke related licences, and consider whether to prosecute if the Government believed that a criminal offence had been committed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1370W.3/2">The United States authorities pay for the Ministry of Defence Police Agency against bills raised on the Agency's behalf by the MOD Liaison Office at RAF Mildenhall. These bills are raised on a weekly basis and in arrears. At the end of each month, Mildenhall transfer the income from payments made by the US to the MOD Police Agency. Bills are based on the salaries of Agency personnel, both police and civilian, deployed to Menwith Hill and any other costs that are appropriate in accordance with the 1989 Memorandum of Understanding between the United States European Command (EUCOM), represented by the Headquarters Third Air Force, and the United Kingdom MOD concerning the role and responsibilities of MOD police deployed at bases occupied by United States Forces in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.1371W.6/2">In recommending a transition period of 20 years, the Government took into consideration the views of the ACP countries, the ACP submission in the current WTO negotiations on Article 24 of the GATT, which suggested a minimum of 18 years for developing countries, and the transition period agreed in other recent regional trade agreements. The Government believe that each ACP regional group should make its own decisions on the timing, pace, sequencing, and product coverage of market opening in line with individual countries' national development plans and poverty reduction strategies. Regional groups should have the flexibility to move towards more open markets along a non-linear path if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/1">Reliable figures cannot be produced for Kingston upon Hull due to small sample size.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/2">The DTI estimates that around 100,000 people in Yorkshire and the Humber stood to benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage in October 1999. It is estimated that around 130,000 people in Yorkshire and the Humber stood to benefit from the October 2004 uprating of the national minimum wage. The DTI has based the October 1999 estimate on the Office for National Statistics' central estimate of low pay; the 2004 estimate is based on data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1380W.6/1">The Financial Assistance Scheme is intended to provide those hardest hit by pension scheme wind-ups with assistance funded by the taxpayer. To ensure that the resources provided by the taxpayer are used most effectively, and to keep administration simple and cost-effective, the Financial Assistance Scheme will adopt a single simple set of rules, based on the most common features of occupational pension schemes, rather than attempting to replicate each particular feature of each individual eligible scheme. According to the Occupational Pension Schemes 2000 survey by the Government Actuary's Department, around 2/3 of active members of private sector defined benefit schemes have a retirement age of 65.</p>

	<p pid="a.1381W.0/1">National statistics on take-up of major DWP benefits are published annually by the Department in Income Related Benefits: Estimates of Take-up&quot;. These are based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the relevant year and take account of both entitled non-recipients and non-entitled recipients.

	<p pid="a.1381W.0/3">Guarantee element take-up estimates thus formed can be roughly validated by comparison with existing minimum income guarantee entitlement and take-up estimates. However, in the case of savings credit this is not possible. It is thought that take-up for those on both guarantee and savings credit is to the order of 80 per cent. Similarly it is thought that around half of individuals entitled to savings credit only are taking up their entitlement, although there is no way of validating these results.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.0/4">The savings element of pension credit is a relatively new entitlement, introduced in October 2003. Weekly entitlement can be up to &pound;15.51 for single pensioners and &pound;20.22 for couples. It is already in payment to over half a million households. The average award was &pound;9.81 as at November 2004, the latest date for which this figure is available.</p>

The original price quoted was &pound;13,630 but because of poor printing quality we were able to negotiate this down. In 2004, 20,270 cards were purchased at a cost of &pound;14,380.47. In both years all cards were sold in aid of Victim Support with 10p per card being donated. The cards are used by the Department's senior managers and sent to external contacts. The information on staff preparation, time and numbers, as well as postage costs is delegated locally and not held centrally. To obtain this information would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1389W.0/2">Chip and PIN is a major finance and retail industry anti-fraud initiative. The introduction of Chip and PIN has been managed by the Chip and PIN Programme Management Organisation, and actively supported by Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.0/3">Following a successful public trial, national roll out of the scheme began in October 2003 with the aim that by 2005 a majority of plastic card transactions should be Chip and PIN. The Chip and PIN programme announced in January that it reached all its 2004 targets for the roll out with customer research demonstrating that 71 per cent. of cardholders expect their next transaction to be Chip and PIN and 45 per cent. now using it for all or most of their card payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.0/4">It is currently too early to assess the effects of Chip and PIN in preventing credit card fraud. The impact of Chip and PIN on card fraud is expected to be seen early in 2005 and hence will first be reflected in the APACS mid-year card fraud figures to June 2005, which will be available in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1389W.3/2">The Government works with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of initiatives. A key factor in dealing with online fraud is prevention and education and the Government takes an active role in educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed through the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud and the Home Office has also created, and maintains the 'e-tailing mini site', which forms part of the crime reduction website. The mini site provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.3/3">The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group which aims to tackle 'Card Not Present' (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS) and Card Security Code (CSC), which inform merchants' decisions on whether to proceed with an order. AVS/CSC can provide immediate results, with APACS reporting that some merchants have reduced their fraud levels by up to 80 per cent. Card schemes MasterCard and Visa have also introduced the 3D Secure system, known as MasterCard Secure Code or Verified by Visa, which requires password verification for internet transactions. The work of the CNP Steering Group has also led to the production of a manual (Spot and Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack) which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.3/4">Government are also involved in the development of Project Endurance, an initiative which will launch a computer and internet security public awareness campaign this year. The project is an alliance of public and private sector, which brings together a number of UK Government departments and law enforcement organisations with a number of high-profile private sector companies. This campaign is to be targeted at micro businesses and consumers, primarily aimed at helping these users gain confidence in using the internet, and protect themselves and their computer while online.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.3/5">The Association for Payment Clearing Services (a banking industry body) considers that the recently announced increase in card not present fraud shows growth only in proportion to the increasing number of businesses now offering non face-to-face transactions, in particular over the internet.</p>

	<p pid="a.1390W.2/2">The Government commissioned an independent report&mdash;Death Certification and Investigation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the report of a Fundamental Review&quot; [Cm 5831] which was presented to Parliament in 2003.

We are concluding detailed work currently and will put forward firm plans, including the handling of coroners' investigations into deaths abroad, as soon as we can.</p>

	<p pid="a.1393W.11/1">Excluding air weapons, in 1995, there were 5,866 recorded firearms offences. In 2003&ndash;04, the total number of recorded offences was 10,338. This figure includes incidents in which a firearm is fired, used as a blunt instrument against a person, or used in a threat, and includes handguns, shotguns and rifles, as well as imitations, and other firearms (e.g. stun guns, CS gas). However, it is important to remember that these figures may be affected by changes in reporting and recording and, in particular, figures for some offences may have been inflated by the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. In 1995, 70 homicides were committed using a firearm; in 2003&ndash;04, the total was 68 homicides.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/2">Figures for knife crime are not collected separately from statistics for offences of violence against the person. However, in 1995, there were 243 homicides using a sharp instrument (including knives, broken bottles, etc). In 2003&ndash;04, there were 237 homicides using a sharp instrument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/3">We are fully committed to taking action to reduce levels of gun and knife crime. Our strategy on both fronts includes working with police, other statutory agencies, the voluntary sector, and also with the community, who have a major role to play in dealing with these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/4">We have tightened firearms legislation by banning the sale, manufacture and import of guns that use self-contained gas cartridge systems (e.g. Brococks) and have made it an arrestable offence to carry an imitation or air gun in public without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. We have also introduced a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for anyone convicted of unlawful possession of an illegal firearm. We are conducting a comprehensive review of the firearms legislation, which includes a careful look at whether there are areas of the legislation which need to be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/5">We have provided &pound;2.25 million from recycled criminal assets in 2004&ndash;05 to support gun crime work in England and Wales, including &pound;250,000 for the second round of the Connected Fund, which supports small community groups involved in a wide variety of local projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/6">On knife crime, we recently announced a package of proposals, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/7" class="indent">raising the minimum age for purchasing a knife to 18. This would bring the sale of knives into line with the sale of fireworks and alcohol;</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.11/8" class="indent">adding new categories of knife now being used in crime to the list of banned offensive weapons;</p>

	<p pid="a.1396W.11/1">The Home Office has not made a formal assessment of the National Neighbourhood Watch Association's (NNWA) work. The NNWA does, however, play a role as a voice for many volunteers within the Neighbourhood Watch movement. The NNWA is a registered charity which is independent of Government and as such is responsible for assessing its own capabilities and strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1396W.11/2">I understand that the NNWA has recently managed to secure core funding from a private sector sponsor which should secure the organisation's financial position. The Government did, however, grant the NNWA &pound;25,000 during March 2005 to cover the organisation's essential running costs pending the start of this new sponsorship arrangement. We have no plans to provide further funding to the NNWA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1396W.11/3">The main support to local Neighbourhood Watch schemes is in the form of partnership working from the police, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, and the community safety departments of local authorities. We have asked police services to ensure these arrangements are robust. We have also provided a website to encourage the sharing of good practice, <a href="http://www.neighbourhoodwatch.uk.com">www.neighbourhoodwatch.uk.com</a> and we are in the process of setting up a telephone advice line. In addition the Government have made sure that public liability insurance cover is available for all Neighbourhood Watch groups in England and Wales, including those groups which are not affiliated to the NNWA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1396W.11/4">Home Office support for local groups includes the printing and distribution of Neighbourhood Watch publications worth &pound;100,000 pa. Additionally a new quarterly newsletter, called 'Community link' has been published to help spread good practice and new ideas among grassroots Neighbourhood Watch volunteers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1398W.8/2">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary have estimated that the average salary, training and development costs of a probationary police constable up to independent patrol (which is normally 31 weeks after joining a force) in 2003&ndash;04 were &pound;27,048.

	<p pid="a.1399W.2/1">The Home Office reviews the performance of police forces on the basis of their sanction detection rate. The sanction detection rate is the percentage of crimes for which someone is charged, summonsed, receives a caution or other formal sanction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.2/2">The trend in police performance in sanction detections is now improving. Trends have, however, varied over the last two decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.2/3">Between 1988 and 1996, there was a gradual decline in the sanction detection rate from 27 per cent. to 17.35 per cent. The rate then rose between 1996 and 1999 reaching 22 per cent. Since then, the rate has been affected by two changes which make comparisons more difficult to make: more stringent counting rules in relation to detections have taken place and a new National Crime Recording Standard was introduced inflating the number of offences against which the rate was calculated. The sanction detection rate fell after 1999 but then stabilised at around 19 per cent. between 2001&ndash;02 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.2/4">The Government have made clear their desire to raise performance in this area. It has set a goal of achieving a sanction detection rate of 25 per cent. by 2007&ndash;08. To achieve that improvement, a major drive has been under way to both raise rates and also to address unacceptable variations in detections performance between forces. This includes ensuring that forces prioritise and maximise investigative outcomes and that officers and other police staff have the best training and the right skills to improve the proportion of offences brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.2/5">Provisional data for 2004&ndash;05 indicate that improvements are now being achieved and the sanction detection rate has improved in each of the last 10 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.1403W.3/1">It would incur a disproportionate cost to approach all country offices, to identify and list all projects in Africa directly or indirectly funded by DFID to support economic diversification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.3/2">DFID's general approach to promoting economic growth covers: creating and maintaining a conducive investment environment for all types of businesses&mdash;large and small, foreign and domestic, urban and rural; promoting trade and business linkages; providing broad access to assets and markets, especially for poor people and reducing insecurity and vulnerability, for instance through social protection schemes. Many DFID programmes in African countries incorporate projects which address one or more of these and therefore contribute to diversifying economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.3/3">In the case of Malawi, the greatest impediment to economic diversification and growth in recent years has been macroeconomic instability and the very high interest rates resulting from the previous Government's poor economic management. This led to a collapse in investment. Economic management has improved markedly since the May 2004 elections. In recognition of this, DFID is providing poverty reduction budget support (&pound;15 million in 2004&ndash;05) to the new Government to enable it to stabilise the economy and bring interest rates down while continuing to provide essential services. There has been encouraging progress since the elections and there are good prospects for a new International Monetary Fund programme during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.3/4">In addition to budget support, DFID supported several specific growth-related projects in Malawi. These include the Financial Services Project, which is jointly funded, by DFID (&pound;3 million) and the US Agency for International Development (US$2.1 million). It uses the Opportunity International Bank of Malawi to expand financial services to poor Malawians and small and medium-sized enterprises. Another financial services project is run by Concern Universal, and aims to develop methods of providing loans to poor Malawians on a fully sustainable basis. The project works only in rural Malawi, and seeks to support micro and small enterprises, and to provide new opportunities for trading and agro-processing businesses. DFID is also fully funding the reconstruction of the Rivirivi railway bridge, which was washed away by floods in 2003. This will facilitate the resumption of rail services between Lilongwe and Nacala port in Mozambique, providing a major boost to economic diversification.</p>

	<p pid="a.1404W.2/1">The food security situation in Darfur is precarious. Of immediate concern are the increasing signs of food shortages among the general population, expected after the failure of the 2004 harvest season.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/2">In February 2005 the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed food for 1.6 million beneficiaries from a target of 2 million in Darfur (80 per cent.). The shortfall was due to security, access and logistics difficulties, though it is a significant improvement on the January distribution figures of 1.2 million from a 1.8 million target (66 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/3">Nutrition levels continue to be a concern across Darfur and the picture is mixed. According to UNICEF there is growing evidence that the nutritional situation in select parts of Darfur is improving. The agency stated that admissions to therapeutic feeding centres have stabilised and decreased in most locations, indicating a potential decrease in the global acute malnutrition rate. However, in South Darfur, feeding centres run by Action Contra la Faim and Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) in Kalma Camp are operating at maximum capacity and the WFP has advised its partners to continue blanket supplementary feeding to improve children's nutrition. Meanwhile, World Vision continues to report high admission rates in Mershing, Manawashi and Duma feeding centres. In North Darfur an MSF rapid health and nutrition assessment of 330 children in Dali camp indicated that 10.7 per cent. were moderately malnourished and 0.9 per cent. severely malnourished.</p>
	<p pid="a.1404W.2/4">The UN is beginning to pre-position food stocks ready for the rainy season. Jan Pronk, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative to Sudan, has commented that although humanitarian access is still only 75 per cent., for the first time the humanitarian situation appears containable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1412W.2/1">In the recent soil survey of the Crossbill Quarry site no asbestos fibres were detected in 38 out of 40 samples. Of the other two, only chrysotile (white asbestos) fibres were detected. These fibres are of a type used in insulation materials such as heating pipes, calorifers, hot water tanks and cavity walls.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412W.2/2">The analysis of water samples collected by my Department's staff recently from, and in the vicinity of, the Crossbill Quarry site were analysed for the presence of asbestos by Brunel University, Uxbridge. The analysis determined that there were amphibole asbestos fibres present. Amphibole is the generic term used to describe five different types of asbestos fibres (excluding chrysotile) and would not be uncommon in landfill sites used for the disposal of builders' rubble. The levels of asbestos fibres in the water were considerably less than the limit set by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412W.2/3">However, while the fibre types have been identified in both the soil and water samples, it is not possible to be conclusive about the exact source of the asbestos in these samples.</p>

	<p pid="a.1429W.8/1">The Department has set out a framework for the national health service for continuous improvement in the overall quality of care people receive, including children, in Standards for Better Health&quot;. Underpinning this is clinical governance, including clinical audit, which provides healthcare organisations, including primary care trusts, with a systematic means of ensuring compliance with their statutory duties. The Healthcare Commission has recently completed an extensive public consultation on a new system for assessing and performance rating NHS trusts in 2005&ndash;06 against these standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1429W.8/2">The national service framework for children, young people and maternity services requires each health economy to develop a managed local children's clinical network to review and meet the needs of the local population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1429W.8/3">As set out in National Standards, Local Action&quot;, strategic health authorities (SHAs) are responsible for developing healthcare improvement plans in their local areas and making sure that local health services, including children's services, commissioned by primary care trusts are of a high standard and are performing well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1429W.8/4">The Better Metrics&quot; project offers primary care trusts a range of clinical measurements of performance for local target setting, which is available on the website of the office of the SHAs at <a href="http://www.osha.nhs.uk">www.osha.nhs.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="a.1444W.2/1">In December 1997, the Department launched the CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) telephone helpline in Manchester in response to the high rate of suicide and depression among young men aged 15 to 35 years old. The Department provides core funding for CALM, with local funding provided by local health and social care agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/2">The CALM initiative is aimed at raising awareness of depression amongst 15 to 35-year-old men and encouraging them to seek help. As part of this work, CALM provides a specialist national freephone mental health helpline for young men with feelings of depression that offers confidential information, advice, referrals and telephone counselling from specially trained professional advisers. While the campaign is targeted at young men, all callers will receive the same basic service, regardless of gender, age, culture or sexual orientation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/3">CALM's services are focused on Manchester, Merseyside and Bedfordshire and callers to the helpline from these areas will receive, in addition to the help and support already mentioned for all callers, information about local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/4">CALM's helpline is available from 5 pm to 3 am seven days a week, 365 days a year. When the service is closed, callers receive a message that provides details of opening hours and the telephone number for the Samaritans, should the caller wish to speak with someone urgently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.2/5">The CALM helpline receives an average of 8,000 'interactive' calls every year, often long and in-depth. The average call time is 18 minutes. The helpline also receives many thousands of silent calls where the caller was not willing to talk.</p>

The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) staphylococcal reference laboratory has confirmed 100 cases over the last three years&mdash;an extremely small proportion of the isolates they receive (less than 0.005 per cent.). The Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance (SACAR) and the HPA are monitoring reports of CA-MRSA and recommend continued vigilance, but that there is no immediate cause for concern.

	<p pid="a.1451W.9/1">Patients in national health service hospitals have requested personal use of a telephone to remain in contact with family and friends. This is provided through the patient power system and over 75,000 beds in NHS trusts have this service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/2">There are four companies licensed to provide these services and they are responsible for all aspects of installation, managing and running the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/3">Contracts are entered into by individual trusts, which will set out in the contract an agreed schedule of charges, including the cost of incoming calls to patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/4">Three suppliers, covering 69,000 beds, include a message notifying callers at the outset of the call what the cost will be. The fourth, which provides a service to the remaining 6,000 beds, will shortly be including a similar message at all its sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/5">Bedside televisions and telephones are an additional service to patients. It is still possible for friends and relatives to contact a hospital through its main switchboard and then be transferred to a nurses' station to enquire about their relative's health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/6">NHS Estates commissioned the British Market Research Bureau to carry out a survey to conduct research into patient and staff satisfaction with the bedside communication and entertainment systems. Over 300 patients and nearly 100 staff were interviewed at six NHS hospitals between October and November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/7" class="indent">88 per cent. of patients said that they were satisfied with the services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/8" class="indent">95 per cent. of patients chose to pay for services offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/9" class="indent">Patients said the most important reason for using the system was to make phone calls without having to ask a member of staff for help or go to a public pay phone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1451W.9/10">The patient bedside entertainment system provides a vital direct link with the outside world for NHS patients. The results of the recent survey confirm that the service is useful in improving the patient's stay in hospital.</p>

A FRANK information pack for practitioners, Communicating the health risks of cannabis use&quot;, was developed and approved by both Departments and published in 2004. Included is material that focuses specifically on young non-users, light users and those contemplating use. It also includes materials aimed at heavy chronic users. They draw attention to the important mental health risks of cannabis, including the risk that use can trigger serious mental health problems and that there is concern that people who use cannabis a lot when they are young may be vulnerable to mental health problems later in life. These will continue to be updated in the light of emerging evidence. Materials aimed specifically at cannabis users with mental health problems, their carers and the professionals who work with them are currently in development by the Home Office and the Department following consultation with key stakeholders.</p>
