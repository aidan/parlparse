	<p pid="c.473W.2/2">The two franchise extensions will have a theoretical opportunity cost caused by foregoing the higher premium/lower subsidy expected if the franchises were re-competed instead of extended. This is difficult to quantify, because assumptions need to be made about the likely prices from new bidders versus the cost of extending with incumbents. The opportunity cost arising from the delay to replacing franchises was estimated to be &#163;6 million for Essex Tameside and &#163;18 million for Greater Anglia. However, we believe that including the two franchises in the reformed system, on which we will be consulting shortly, will yield benefits for passengers and facilitate investment in the railways which will outweigh these costs.</p>

The current issue relating to the import of food of non-animal origin is the application of official controls to certain high risk products from certain third countries, for the purpose of public health protection. The list of countries and products requiring control is reviewed by the Commission quarterly. Where any food of non-animal origin, presents a major public health issue, then the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is used by member states. For other imported products not of animal origin, where routine official controls detect any problems, these will be reported to the Commission. Food exported from the United Kingdom should meet the requirements of European food law.</p>

	<p pid="c.494W.8/1">Detailed information about the safety of nuclear waste disposal is already publicly available and the Government are committed to maintaining this position and making such information as openly available and accessible as possible. The Department is currently considering how it can provide increased visibility of the programme to implement geological disposal of higher activity radioactive waste including the possibility of a published timeline and milestones.</p>
	<p pid="c.494W.8/2">Following nearly three years of extensive consideration, the independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) gathered and published sufficient evidence to include geological disposal of higher activity waste as the key element of their package of recommendations to Government in 2006. Geological disposal is internationally recognised as the preferred approach to deal with higher activity waste and is being adopted in many countries as well as being supported by a number of UK learned societies including the Royal Society, the Geological Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry. Detailed information from CoRWM's consideration of the options is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.494W.8/4">In setting out how geological disposal will be implemented, the Department has set up a dedicated website:</p>
	<p pid="c.494W.8/5" class="indent"><a href="http://mrws.decc.gov.uk/">http://mrws.decc.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.494W.8/6">which provides, or links to, information at various levels of detail and which is intended to be accessible and helpful to people from nontechnical backgrounds through to experts. This includes links to waste management organisations in other countries who are tackling similar issues and to international expert bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.494W.8/7">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has been given responsibility for implementing geological disposal and will shortly be publishing &quot;Geological Disposal: Steps towards implementation&quot; setting out the preparatory work already undertaken, as well as explaining how the outputs of its work programme are designed to achieve a safe, secure, sustainable and publicly acceptable outcome. This will be available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.494W.8/9">A geological disposal facility will be regulated by the Statutory Regulators who are working together to make sure that any future facility meets the required high standards for environmental protection, safety, security, waste management and radioactive waste transportation. Information on this is available from their joint website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.6/1">Where street robbery is a problem at a local level, it is the responsibility of the Community Safety Partnership (CSP), which includes the local police force, to tackle this. Local agencies have been given the autonomy to respond as appropriate, prioritising their resources to target those issues of most importance locally. Where robbery has been a problem, areas have analysed victim and perpetrator profiles as well as locations, and developed responses to specific issues such as youth on youth robberies or robberies associated with the night time economy. Other success factors include improved joint tasking and working between the police and key partners, CCTV and targeted crime prevention advice, such as poster campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.6/2">Mobile phones are commonly taken during robberies and other personal thefts. The National Mobile Phone Crime Unit, part funded by the Home Office, tackles mobile phone theft through working with the mobile phone industry on phone security and disabling stolen phones. They also provide a resource for local police forces by providing expert training and advice on individual cases, and through the provision of the National Mobile Phone Register where police can quickly check if a phone is stolen.</p>

It is important that higher education institutions offer the widest variety of good quality courses to students, including a range of modern European languages.

We understand that the Turkish authorities agree this to be correct. I explained this to the British nationals who I met on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June</phrase>. We have also been informed by the Israeli authorities that the return of magnetic and media equipment is under consideration by the Israeli defence forces.

	<p pid="c.518W.2/1">Directive 2004/24/EC on traditional herbal medicinal products was implemented in the United Kingdom in October 2005. The directive takes full effect when the transitional period for compliance expires on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-30">30 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/2">The effect of the directive in the UK is to bring a sector that was previously largely unregulated into systematic medicines regulation. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in its impact assessment recognised that some businesses, including small and medium-sized manufacturers, were likely to be significantly affected, and that the impact would vary widely depending on the standards to which the businesses were currently operating. The assessment also suggested that some restructuring in the herbal sector was likely. This view has not changed.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/3">The MHRA has so far received 143 applications to register products under the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme. Of these applications 61 have been granted, and the remainder are under assessment. The agency is aware that many companies have made detailed preparations to comply with the requirements of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/4">The Better Regulation Executive review of MHRA implementation of Hampton principles reported in 2009 that the agency had given extensive help to industry in preparing to meet the requirements of the directive. MHRA will continue to provide such support, which includes the opportunity for companies to have dialogue with the agency as to how they can most effectively progress their intended applications under the THR scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/5">Companies are not required to notify the MHRA of unlicensed products marketed under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968, therefore no estimates are available of how many products will need to be withdrawn from the UK market following the expiry of the transitional period. As now there will continue to be many herbal products that potentially can be placed on the market either as medicinal products or under other product regulatory regimes depending on their presentation.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/6">Historically, unlicensed herbal medicines have been made to widely varying standards and have not necessarily been accompanied by reliable information about safe usage. Products registered under the THR scheme are manufactured to high standards and come with authorised information for the consumer. We do not believe it would be feasible to make reliable predictions as to the combined impact of actual changes in the regulatory regime and possible future changes in the herbal medicines market on the number of visits to general practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.518W.2/7">The process for determining whether or not a product is a medicine already includes the option of a review by the Independent Review Panel for Borderline Products.

	<p pid="c.522W.9/13">DFID does not support abortion as a method of family planning. We believe the best way to eliminate unsafe abortion is to provide access to family planning information, services and supplies and to ensure that women have more control over the circumstances in which they have sex. In countries where abortion is legal, DFID will support programmes that make abortion safe and accessible. In countries where it is illegal and women are dying due to unsafe abortion, DFID will help make the consequences of unsafe abortion more widely understood and will consider supporting processes of legal and policy reform.</p>

We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount individual authorities lose. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for local authorities to decide. We have ensured that councils are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the &#163;29 billion they receive through Formula Grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

In general, environmental goods and services include those which contribute to the achievement of national and international environmental priorities including the mitigation of climate change, and the implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements. More specifically, the European Union, together with partners, has produced a list of goods to fulfil the Doha Declaration objective on environmental goods-JOB(09)/132.

	<p pid="c.539W.2/1">UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) provides a range of support services to British companies wishing to trade with Israel, through commercial teams based in both the UK and the British embassy in Tel Aviv. UKTI support focuses, in particular, on business opportunities in high technology sectors, including biotechnology, health care, aerospace, information and communication technology, the environmental industries and financial and legal services.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/2">UKTI supports the work of the Israel British Business Council (IBBC) and also manages a broad range of activities aimed at boosting bilateral trade and investment, including trade missions to Israel, inward missions by Israeli firms to trade fairs in the UK and promotional events aimed at encouraging Israeli companies to list in London and do business which brings benefits to Britain.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/3">Examples of recent UKTI initiatives aimed at boosting business between Israel and the UK include a visit to Israel in May 2009 by the former Minister for Trade, Lord Davies; a British trade mission to the WATEC water and environment trade fair and conference in Tel Aviv in November 2009; a visit to Israel by UKTI's deputy chief executive in December 2009; and the promotion of business opportunities in Israel to over 450 UK companies in London, Manchester and the West Midlands through UKTI's &quot;Partner Middle East&quot; road shows in February 2010. Other activities of this nature will follow over the coming 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/4">Information on annual expenditure on promoting trade with Israel is unavailable due to the difficulty of disaggregating these figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/5">There have been no recent representations on increasing business between the UK and Israel.</p>
