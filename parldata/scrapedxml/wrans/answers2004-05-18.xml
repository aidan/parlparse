In most cases these directives require transposition by the devolved Administrations as well as at Westminster and in some cases also in Gibraltar.</p>
	<p pid=".827W.6/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs plays a leading role in the United Kingdom's EU policy on the environment, agriculture, fisheries, animal and plant health. Between 8 June 2001 and 31 December 2003, 42 EU directives were not fully transposed across the whole of the UK by the transposition deadline. Of these, 88 per cent. have now been transposed.</p>

However, land used to grow soft fruit will be eligible in those member states and regions which adopt the flat rate or 'hybrid' payment models. Our current understanding is that Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Luxembourg, in addition to England, Northern Ireland, are likely to adopt such models. We expect that no payments will be made in respect of land used for fruit production in the remaining member states, nor in Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.3/1">The Government's approach to cutting fast food litter, with the voluntary code we have promoted resulting in a 20 per cent. cut in fast food litter in pilot areas compared with a general worsening by 12 per cent. across the country between 2002 and 2003. The challenge now is for all concerned to put the lessons into practice.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.3/2">In October 2003 Defra launched a consultation exercise in order to establish a Voluntary Code of Practice for the Fast Food Industry, following 18 months of research with industry representatives. Defra commissioned ENCAMS (formerly Tidy Britain Group) to develop the voluntary code. In February we published the Local Environmental Quality Survey for England 2002&ndash;03 (LEQSE) carried out by ENCAMS which showed fast food litter had increased by 12 per cent. over the last year, and that it had become more widespread. However, with practical application of the code's recommendations, a good practice example project led to a 20 per cent. reduction in fast food littering.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.3/3">The aim of the proposed voluntary code of practice is to reduce fast food litter and waste that becomes litter in the local environment by outlining best practice and recommendations for action to be taken by all fast food retailers working with local authorities and seeking to involve the local public. It will allow all parties to work together in a mutually supportive partnership, to find local solutions to local problems.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.3/4">In addition the Government are involved in studies regarding the health effects of waste management processes, although these have not been concerned with small scale local issues such as commercial waste from food outlets. These are dealt with effectively by way of local authority Environmental Health Officers.</p>

	<p pid=".829W.0/1">The Government have taken a number of measures to control the manufacture, storage and use of AN fertiliser in the general climate of heightened security.

	<p pid=".829W.0/2">The Government have been working with the fertiliser industry to improve controls in the storage and supply chain of AN. We have endorsed industry guidelines which advise producers and sellers of AN fertiliser to:</p>

We have also endorsed industry guidance, produced in collaboration with farmers unions and the police, on 'Security of Fertiliser Storage on Farm'.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.0/8">To supplement the voluntary measures, Defra has introduced regulations to control the supply of both home produced and imported AN. The regulations require AN fertiliser, with a high nitrogen content, including mixtures, to have satisfied a Detonation Resistance Test and all sellers have to maintain records of sales.</p>
	<p pid=".829W.0/9">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has issued a self-help checklist to all those known to be handling or storing significant quantities of AN. The checklist has been distributed widely. It is aimed at spreading good practice and offering HSE as a source of further advice. Additionally, HSE has lowered the notification threshold under the Notification of Installations Handling Hazardous Substances Regulations 1982 from 500 to 150 tonnes and widened the range of products to be included in the notifications.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.3/1">The Pig Industry Development Scheme (PIDS) was initiated in March 2001 to establish an industry fund to help provide advice, services, facilities and financial assistance to British pig producers to assist with the prevention of exotic pig diseases such as Classical Swine Fever, and/or to help minimise their impact. Collection of this industry levy was delayed due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak of that year. In April 2001 the then MAFF and the Meat and Livestock Commission concluded a loan agreement to enable early payment of the industry top-up to producers.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.3/2">Under the terms of the loan agreement, repayment, including interest, was due on 31 July 2003. However problems associated with the unforseen decline in pig slaughterings delayed the collection of the levy from pig producers to repay the loan. By mutual agreement the loan deadline was extended to 31 December 2003 and repayment was made by that date, including the interest to that date.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.3/3">The PIDS levy on slaughterings was reduced to zero in August 2003; however the scheme is to remain open for the foreseeable future with the facility to increase the levy if required.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.9/1">As Defra's Final Report into the 2003 Ring Rot Outbreak in the UK makes clear, it has not been possible to trace the origin of infection which resulted in the ring rot outbreak in Wales. However, Appendix VI of the Report (see <a href="http://defra.gov.uk/planth/ring/repfinal/app6.pdf">http://defra.gov.uk/planth/ring/repfinal/app6.pdf</a>) outlines the itinerary for the Provento seed potatoes which were supplied to the Welsh farm, from which the crop was grown which resulted in the outbreak. This Appendix was prepared by the Dutch Plant Protection Service who gave permission for it to be published as part of Defra's Report.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.9/2">In essence, the Dutch report indicates that the seed potatoes were exported from the Netherlands to Honduras on 26 September 2002. The consignment was refused entry to Honduras because it did not meet their requirements on the absence of soil (not because of a concern with the potatoes) and was returned to the Netherlands on 5 December 2002. Following re-sorting and re-bagging, to remove potatoes which had sprouted, the seed potatoes were split into different lots which were then sent directly to various destinations (Wales, Portugal, Iraq, Honduras and Ukraine) between the period 5 December 2002 and 1 May 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".832W.8/1">Two Tree Island is split into two areas, eastern and western. The eastern part of Two Tree Island consists of a small tidal island with the adjoining saltmarsh (86 acres) and a large area of inter-tidal mudflats (271 acres). It is part of Leigh National Nature Reserve.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.8/2">The mudflats are noted for their dense, vigorous growth of eel grass species, which, together with a large resource of invertebrates, support nationally and internationally important numbers of dark-bellied Brent geese and waders, such as grey plover and knot. Waders such as curlew, dunlin, and redshank, occur in significant numbers outside the breeding season. The nearby Leigh cockle sheds bring winter flocks of turnstone close inshore and attract some of the rarer gull species.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.8/3">The saltmarshes are the most important on the north side of the Thames Estuary. They are of considerable botanical interest being noted for the five glasswort species that occur there. Sea aster, with small cord-grass, common cord-grass and glasswort species are found on the lower marshes, while sea purslane dominates the upper marshes. In addition the area also supports other saltmarsh plants such as golden samphire, sea wormwood, common and lax-flowered sea lavenders.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.8/4">At its western tip a range of birds can be seen such as redshank and heron. The island itself consists mainly of grassland and scrub, with the former rubbish tip supporting a number of interesting alien plants and 'escapes'. A wide variety of birds can be seen at its western tip, including kestrels and short-eared owls during the winter, hunting for field voles. Grass snakes and lizards are seen. Insects of note include the marbled white butterfly, Roesel's bush cricket, the house cricket and the lesser marsh grasshopper.</p>

	<p pid=".840W.3/1">Vehicle activated signs are used predominately where there are concerns about inappropriate speed. They are not designed to deal with excessive speed. Research into the effectiveness of vehicle activated signs at a range of locations was carried out by TRL Ltd. on behalf of the Department for Transport in 2002. Results of this work concluded that across all sites there was a 31 per cent. reduction in accidents following installation. In addition where vehicle activated signs were used to remind the driver of the speed limit in force, speed reductions of between three and nine mph were achieved. Where installed to warn drivers of a potential hazard, reductions of up to seven mph were achieved. Guidance on the use of vehicle activated signs is available in the Libraries of the House (Ref: Traffic Advisory Leaflet 1/03&mdash;Vehicle Activated Signs).</p>

	<p pid=".843W.5/1">The information requested is not held centrally, and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Only 2 per cent. of households are overcrowded nationally; this means that annual estimates, derived from sample surveys such as the Survey of English Housing or the Family Resources Survey, of such a small target population are subject to considerable sampling error.

	<p pid=".843W.8/1">The Key Worker Living (KWL) programme which started on 1 April 2004 is helping teachers in London into home ownership and intermediate rented accommodation. It also offers teachers who are existing home owners help to buy a larger home to meet their household needs. The programme superseded the Starter Home Initiative which came to an end on 31 March.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/2">The assistance available under KWL is:</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> equity loans of up to &pound;50,000 to buy a home on the open market or a newly-built property provided by a registered social landlord;</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> equity loans of up to &pound;100,000 for school teachers in London with the potential to become leaders of London's education sector in the future;</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> shared ownership of newly-built properties where a share of the property is purchased and a reduced rent is paid on the remaining share;</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/6" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> intermediate renting of newly-built properties where the rent is set at a level below market rents.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not changed the eligibility criteria for the scheme: school teachers in London with seven or more points are eligible for up to &pound;100,000 equity loan assistance; school teachers and Further Education teachers are also eligible for up to &pound;50,000 equity loan assistance. Points are awarded under the scheme for:</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/8" class="indent">being an advanced skills teacher, a Commissioner's teacher, on the fast track teaching programme or past the Threshold;</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/9" class="indent">teaching in a shortage subject or in a challenging school;</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/10" class="indent">having management or leadership responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/11">The eligibility criteria and the points system for the KWL programme were devised following discussions with the key worker sponsor Departments including Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/12">A key aim of KWL is to retain more experienced teachers in London. Since the scheme was launched we have received over 1,600 applications in London. As the KWL budget is limited, school teachers in London with four points or more are being prioritised for assistance, and those with less than four points are being placed on the waiting list for assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.8/13">Officials of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are keeping the situation under review and expectations are that some teachers on the waiting list will receive assistance as the scheme progresses.</p>

Current commitments for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 total &pound;952 million, subject in some cases to Almos achieving at least a 2* rating from the Housing Inspectorate. Further allocations are subject to the outcome of the 2004 Spending Review. Expenditure on setting up Almos is a matter for the local authorities concerned. Under the Almo option the local authority remains the owner and landlord of the housing stock : no transfer of ownership occurs. Almo funding for work towards the Government's Decent Homes target is allocated on the basis of local authorities' bids, which are assessed against the criteria set out in the Almo Guidance published in March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.0/1">Where tenants have rejected transfer and arm's length management organisations prior to local authorities being required to have an option appraisal signed off by Government Offices they will be asked to undertake an option appraisal. Guidance on option appraisal makes it clear that local authorities should engage with their tenants from the very beginning of the option appraisal process. The decision on which option to pursue should therefore incorporate the views of tenants before any ballot is held. Effective tenant engagement is a key criterion of the option appraisal assessment process and appraisals will not be signed off unless this has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.0/2">The Community Housing Task Force (CHTF) is the main resource available to assist councils and their tenants in delivering option appraisals. Tenants may also seek advice from their Independent Tenant Adviser (ITA). Further training and capacity building for tenants to help them with options appraisal is funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and provided via the Tenant Participation Advisory Service (TPAS), PEP and the National Tenants Resource Centre (NTRC).</p>
	<p pid=".846W.0/3">If tenants subsequently reject all options that deliver extra resources and the option appraisal process has been effectively undertaken then the wishes of the tenants will be respected and they will not be forced into accepting the options available.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.3/1">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit (NRU) has recently received the report from a study on joint working between sport and neighbourhood renewal agencies. The research aims were to identify existing arrangements for joint working, to highlight barriers to further integration, and to provide suggestions for overcoming these in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.3/2">The report finds that at both the regional and local levels, joint working is generally underdeveloped. Where joint working does occur, projects are rarely focused on the achievement of well-defined outcomes or targeted towards influencing mainstream services. There is incomplete data on sporting participation in deprived areas and amongst specific groups. There are also few explicit targets for raising participation and a lack of incentives for joint working. Nevertheless, there are some noteworthy examples of joint strategic working between local authority health and education Departments and sport&mdash;in ways that will impact on deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.3/3">In response to these findings, the NRU has produced a short practitioner guide for local and regional decision-makers and frontline workers in both sports and regeneration organisations. It explains the importance of linking sport and renewal activities, provides practical advice on how to do this, and shows where to find further resources and help.</p>

	<p pid=".848W.6/1">The initial view of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is that the introduction of home information packs (HIPs) is unlikely to have a significant effect on property prices. This is supported by evidence from other countries that have introduced similar measures and by a survey carried out by the UK's largest estate agency group which suggested there would be little impact on the number of properties sold if HIPs were introduced. We will continue to keep this assessment under review during our discussions with stakeholders and consumer representatives on the final contents of the HIP.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.3/1">Drug testing technology and its reliability is kept under constant review by the Home Office due to its applicability to roadside impairment testing and its relevance in the workplace. The extent and definition of 'reliability' in these different settings is by nature of the criminal law different in each case.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.3/2">Recently there has been research on the reliability of different methods of drug testing carried out by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) for the specific purpose of testing persons in custody suites to see if they have used drugs. The research used saliva as a point-of-contact using the Cozart RapiScan TM electronic test strip reader, one of few commercially available on-site testing kits for oral fluid (saliva). Overall, the results of this study revealed that saliva based testings are not reliable enough to evidence impairment for the purposes of charge for driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.3/3">In the workplace, the requirements of the criminal law do not have to be met and it is up to employers to decide what margin of proof is required to consider action against specific employees. Saliva, urine, hair analysis or blood tests may all be sufficiently reliable. The Home Office does provides guidance on the various types of tests available to any companies who seek advice, which suggests that some tests are more reliable than others.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.3/4">In the July 2004, an independent inquiry report on drugs testing in the workplace will review some of the complex and wide reaching issues surrounding drug testing in the workplace including the reliability of different testing devices. The report will be the first attempt to give a full picture of drug testing in the workplace and will include recommendations to government, employers and other relevant bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.6/1">The power to close premises has been widely welcomed and applauded by both the police who use it and the communities to whom its use has provided immediate relief from the blight of drug supply and use, and associated antisocial behaviour. This power provides a genuinely effective tool to tackle nightmare premises such as 'crack houses'. The power has been used at least 19 times in our Anti Social Behaviour Trailblazer sites alone since January and indications from discussions with the police and courts suggest that the power may have been used over 100 times in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.6/2">However, the numbers of closure notices issued by the   police are not recorded centrally as this data requirement would be an additional burden upon frontline police forces. We wish instead to record the number of closure orders issued by magistrates courts under section 2 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act. As this data becomes available this will allow for us to count how the power is being used nationally.</p>

In the last three months, in my capacity as Green Minister, I have also participated in a number of meetings, judged an energy efficiency switch off campaign competition for the department and continued to support the Framework Project established to tackle the environmental targets for the Government Estate, which I launched at a departmental workshop in December last year.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 13 May 2004</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/2">The general principles which govern the allocation of funds received from the confiscation of criminal assets under proceeds of crime legislation, are:</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> to build asset recovery capacity in front line law enforcement and prosecuting agencies as a contribution to crime reduction;</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> to incentivise law enforcement agencies to do more asset recovery and;</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> to recycle a proportion of the proceeds of crime into community based crime reduction projects.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/6">The Recovered Assets Incentive Fund was set up last financial year to incentivise asset recovery by asset recovery agencies including law enforcement and prosecuting authorities. &pound;15.5 million a year for three years has been allocated to the fund. The funds have been fully committed to projects, agreed by the Association of Chief Police Officers and others that will increase the confiscation of criminal assets.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/7">Of &pound;46.5 million that will be available under the fund over three years, up to &pound;12 million a year has been allocated to set up four new multi-agency Regional Asset Recovery Teams (RARTs) to disrupt organised crime groups, confiscate more criminal assets and to tackle money laundering. A successful pilot in the West Midlands has been rolled out to the North West, North East, Wales and London. The teams have been operational since February and comprise staff from the police, National Crime Squad, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, National Criminal Intelligence Service, Crown Prosecution Service, Assets Recovery Agency and the Inland Revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/8">An additional &pound;7 million a year for three years has been made available separately from the Recovered Assets Incentive Fund for community based crime reduction projects.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/9">Last year &pound;4 million was allocated to the Adventure Capital Fund to regenerate communities across England. &pound;3 million was allocated to regional government offices, of which &pound;1.5 million funded anti-gun crime initiatives and &pound;1.5 million funded capacity building in crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Of the &pound;7 million available this year, &pound;3 million has been committed to funding a community justice centre pilot scheme in Liverpool; &pound;2 million to fund support services for victims of sexual offences in England and Wales; and &pound;2 million to fund new and existing projects to tackle gun crime in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/10">On 24 February I announced a new police incentivisation scheme to be introduced in 2004&ndash;05 that will enable police forces in England and Wales, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to receive a share of the criminal assets they recover locally, in the following year. Separate arrangements exist in Scotland. The scheme has the full support of the Association of Chief Police Officers in England and Wales. Police forces will benefit by receiving a third of all the recovered assets above &pound;40 million in 2004&ndash;05, increasing to half for 2005&ndash;06. The maximum benefit available to the police will be &pound;43 million in 2004&ndash;05 rising to &pound;65 million in   2005&ndash;06. The Government will be using the first &pound;40 million to help fund existing commitments in the asset recovery field.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.2/11">There will be no restrictions on how the police should spend this money so there may be scope in the future for them to devote some of the funds to community-based projects aimed at crime reduction. We are currently considering how we might be able to extend the scheme to 2006&ndash;07 and beyond.</p>

This included intimidation and harassment of residents, drug paraphernalia and other dangerous items lying around, as well as high numbers of people entering and leaving the premises. CCTV footage showed up to 100 visitors in a 24-hour period. The ActionLine advised Swansea on the process and sent through a detailed example of how a similar problem had been tackled elsewhere. Safer Swansea Partnership secured a closure order&mdash;the first one in Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.3/1">Tackling global climate change is a high priority for the Government and for the Department for International Development.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.3/2">The Government are working hard to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force and is effective. The Government's focus has been on securing full compliance with the obligations under the Protocol's first commitment period; these do not of course apply to   developing countries. However, DFID is also considering how the UK should engage in a future debate about wider commitments. This includes looking at ways in which developing countries can become more engaged in the debate on global greenhouse gas mitigation on terms that will allow them to follow clean development paths whilst meeting their development and poverty reduction objectives. The Department for International Development will be working closely with our partners in tackling these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".872W.2/1">Our Embassy in Bogota reports regularly on internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia, and discusses the situation with the Colombian authorities and NGOs. Given the nature of the issue, it is very difficult to put a completely accurate figure on the number of IDPs in recent years. Colombian government provided and unofficial statistics differ slightly. According to government statistics 327,606 were displaced in 2001 and 379,289 in 2002. The economic and security implications are loss of income through unemployment, lack of access to education and health care and increased vulnerability. This terrible situation has arisen as a direct result of the armed conflict in Colombia. 2003 showed a marked decline in numbers as the security forces made some headway against the illegally armed groups; according to government statistics 172,851 were displaced in 2003. But the situation is still critical and more needs to be done to address the issue.</p>

	<p pid=".882W.6/4" class="indent">The General Register Office does not routinely collect information on administrative delays to birth registration.

For example, the interval may be longer than it would otherwise have been if the father is not immediately available to attend the register office along with the mother, or if the parents are undecided on the child's name. If parents express concern about a delay in the registration because of non-availability of a registrar, that concern would be addressed by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".882W.6/6" class="indent">A fundamental review of civil registration is being undertaken currently which, if the necessary changes in law are implemented, will extend the means available to the public for registering events.

Reforms are being introduced by means of an Order under the Regulatory Reform Act. An Order is due to be presented later this session.</p>
	<p pid=".882W.6/7" class="indent">The average interval between occurrence and registration of births to women usually resident in London was 24.1 days in 2003. The equivalent figure for England and Wales was 17.9 days. Civil registration is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and further information is available from the General Register Offices of these countries.</p>

	<p pid=".884W.9/1">Recent figures show that there were 5.2 million households in 2002&ndash;03 who paid more net council tax than income tax; in 1997&ndash;98 there were 4.8 million. The majority of these are pensioner households 65 per cent. of whom pay no income tax or only pay income tax at 10 per cent., and all of whom benefit from higher age related income tax allowances. The Government have increased the aged personal allowances by at least 7.7 per cent. in real terms since 1997. No pensioner aged 65 or over will pay income tax on income of less that &pound;131 a week in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".884W.9/2">Council tax benefit (CTB) exists to help those on low incomes with their council tax bills. However, many of those eligible for CTB do not claim their entitlement. The Government have therefore been running a campaign alongside local councils to boost take-up. A tailored claim form has been introduced for pensioners; the restriction on the amount of CTB for those people living in Band F, G or H properties was removed in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".884W.9/3">Council tax consumes a greater proportion of the incomes of older pensioners&mdash;who have little or no opportunity to increase their incomes&mdash;than it does for other households. Alongside CTB the Government believe it is right to help older pensioners with their council tax so that pensioner households with someone aged over 70 will this year receive a &pound;100 payment to help with their council tax bills. This is in addition to the winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for all over 60s households, &pound;300 for over 80s households. Furthermore the Government have introduced the pension credit, increased the basic state pension by the higher of 2.5 per cent. or price inflation, introduced free TV licences for households with someone aged over 75 or over&mdash;and the free eye test, free prescriptions and concessionary travel for those aged over 60.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.0/2">The fees charged are a matter for the FSA. Application fees for insurance intermediaries have been set following consultation with the industry and are based on the volume of business undertaken. Up to 50 per cent. discount is offered for an early application together with further discount if the application is made    electronically. Smaller intermediaries seeking authorisation could pay a fee of only &pound;500 if they take advantage of the early application deadline of 31 May 2004. If a firm is already authorised by the FSA for other regulated activities, the application fee it would pay for IMD activities is halved. The periodic annual fee which will be charged by the FSA for ongoing supervision of authorised intermediaries following the commencement of regulation has not yet been set and will be the subject of a forthcoming consultation this summer, but the FSA has indicated that the minimum periodic fee for a full year of mortgage/general insurance regulation will be in the region of &pound;750.</p>

The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 strengthened police powers to deal with smaller, intimidatory protests and office occupations by extremists.

A National Forum on policing and prosecution of animal rights cases has been set up to work on improving both operational policing and legislative measures. We are also considering as a matter of urgency what further legislation may be necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.12/1"><i>(a)</i> The DTI has no plans to reintroduce licensing arrangements for the private recruitment industry and there is no general support for such a proposal. Licensing schemes, particularly those where a fee is demanded, are burdensome for business and that burden falls especially heavily on small enterprises: The licensing arrangements required by the Employment Agencies Act 1973, which were repealed in 1995 proved not to be effective and were replaced by a new power, introduced under the 1973 Act, to prohibit unsuitable persons from running employment agencies and employment businesses for up to 10 years. The Government does not hesitate to make use of this power where this is warranted.</p>
	<p pid=".894W.12/2"><i>(b)</i> The proposed Temporary Agency Worker Directive is still under negotiation in the Council of Ministers, though no formal discussions have taken place since the June 2003 Employment Council. From the point where final agreement is achieved on the proposal, implementation is likely to take two to three years.</p>

	<p pid=".895W.2/1">The Government recently introduced the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003. These include a new requirement that an employment agency can only charge a fee, for providing work-finding services for people in certain occupations in the entertainment, modelling and sports sectors, out of the work-seekers' earnings in any such employment that the agency has found for them. This requirement has outlawed the practice of unscrupulous agencies, which took money from workers in the entertainment and modelling sectors but offered little or no work.</p>

	<p pid=".902W.3/1">In July 2003, we announced in our Skills Strategy White Paper &quot;21st Century Skills&quot; an increase in the financial support to help adults in further education with the costs of learning through a new adult learning grant. The grant is available on a pilot basis in 10 local Learning and Skills Council areas. We plan to double the size of the current pilot from September by making the adult learning grant available across the South-East and North-East regions. We are also considering how other existing funds for supporting adult learners in further education and training can best support the priorities of the Skills Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".902W.3/2">Proposals for improving the package of financial support for undergraduates were announced in January at Commons Second Reading of the Higher Education Bill. This includes introduction of a non-repayable grant of up to &pound;2,700 each year for students from lower income backgrounds. We are improving the package of support for part-time students, many of whom are mature. In 2004&ndash;05 part time students on low incomes will be able to get a grant of up to &pound;575 for fees and a grant of up to &pound;250 for course costs. We will continue to provide additional, targeted financial support for vulnerable students, through Higher Education institutions, to ensure that more of them are able to access and remain in higher education.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.6/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/18">1. The financial data are taken from Sefton LEAs' Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/19">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/20">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/21">4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year and pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/22">5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/23">6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.6/24">7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

	<p pid=".909W.8/2">The adoption of lead body arrangements is one option for Connexions Partnerships in looking to become more tax efficient. While we do not envisage any legal/structural problems with a dual or multiple lead body structure, we have advised Partnerships considering this option that there would need to be clear agreements about roles and responsibilities. We would also wish to be reassured that this would not result in greater overall spend on core administration costs and/or possible duplication of head office functions. We have advised Government Offices to assess individual Partnership plans on their own local merits. Guidance on the different delivery models is being produced jointly with HM Customs and Excise and will be issued to Partnerships shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".912W.2/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/18">1. The financial data are taken from Manchester LEA's Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/19">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/20">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/21">4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/22">5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/23">6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".912W.2/24">7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.2/2">Prior to 2002 national level analyses by pupil characteristic were not possible. In January 2002 the Annual Schools' Census (ASC) introduced a major change in that maintained primary, secondary and special schools reported data at an individual pupil level for the first time. The introduction of the Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) in 2002 meant that for the first time pupil characteristic information could be    matched to pupil attainment data, allowing comparisons of the performance of different groups of pupils.</p>

	<p pid=".919W.6/1">The overall school and LEA funding system recognises the higher costs of recruiting and retaining staff in some areas by giving these LEAs, including inner London LEAs like Greenwich, additional resource through an Area Cost Adjustment.</p>

	<p pid=".919W.6/3">Teachers are able to apply for this new scheme which builds on the foundations laid by the Starter Homes Initiative which since September 2001 has been helping key workers to buy homes in areas where high house prices undermine recruitment and retention.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.6/4">We have identified the need to assist those potential future leaders who wish to remain in London but may have otherwise chosen to leave as a result of prohibitive housing costs. Over the next two years we will be aiming to assist 1,000 of these teachers by offering equity loans of up to &pound;100,000 to help them purchase property within travelling distance of their schools. In addition, there will also be another strand to the scheme which will make available equity loans of up to &pound;50,000 to qualifying experienced teachers. Finally, newly qualified teachers will not be excluded and will be eligible to receive support through the Shared Ownership and Intermediate Renting strands of the new scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".923W.2/1">The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC decides on allocations at individual college and regional level. Information about these allocations is not collected by the Department. This is a matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Gentleman with this information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid=".923W.2/2">The LSC's equal opportunities remit was established by the Learning and Skills Act 2000. The Council is required to publish an annual report on the arrangements it has made during the year, how effective they were and the plans for the following year. A copy of the report must be sent to the Secretary of State. The last such report was published in November 2003 and a copy of the Department's response is available via the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid=".924W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 14 May 2004</p>
	<p pid=".924W.0/2">We have not set any targets for the number of SMEs to be engaged in Apprenticeships. The &quot;Learning and Training at Work&quot; survey assesses employer involvement in apprenticeships by firm size and sector. The last survey in 2002 revealed that 5 per cent. of employers were involved in Advanced Modern Apprenticeships and 4 per cent. were involved in Foundation Modern Apprenticeships. This equates to around 36,000 employers of which two-thirds are SMEs. The Department and Learning and Skills Council are considering the most effective way to collect data on employer involvement in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".924W.0/3">It is crucial, however, to the success of Apprenticeships and in meeting the high demand from young people, that more employers, including SMEs, are involved. Therefore on 10 May 2004, a television advertising campaign started directed at engaging with more employers and there will be direct marketing to employers of all sizes. The Modern Apprenticeship Task Force, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, has increasing employer engagement as its primary function and good progress is being made. The taskforce is due to report in autumn 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.3/17">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/18">1. The financial data are taken from Lancashire LEA's Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;00 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Figures up to and including 1997&ndash;98 figures are for Lancashire LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&ndash;99 onwards parts of Lancashire LEA became Blackpool and Blackburn LEAs. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;00. 1999&ndash;00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/19">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/20">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/21">4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/22">5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/23">6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.3/24">7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.</p>

The penalty for a contractor failing to deliver school facilities by the target date, which is specified in the contract, is therefore the servicing of a substantial loan while receiving no payment from the school authority.

	<p pid=".945W.17/1">In a survey of speech and language therapists conducted by the Department, at 30 September 2003 there was only one long-term vacancy. However, the Department has completed a workforce planning report on the speech and language therapy workforce and its findings indicate that there is a projected shortfall over the next five years. The Department is considering how best to deal with this shortfall, including initiatives to address recruitment and retention issues. As an interim measure, additional funding was provided to increase by 10 the number of student places for speech and language therapy with effect from the 2001/02 academic year and by a further five places from 2002/03. These increased intake levels are being maintained and there are 140 students in training during the current academic year.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.8/1">I recently held separate meetings with the employers and union representatives. At these meetings I made it clear to both sides that the Department has the money in its budget at present to enable backdating to September 2003, providing early agreement is reached to an SDPM Scheme. This is in line with the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry on teachers' pay and would give the 12,500 teachers who are already on the first point of the Upper Pay Scale an extra &pound;1,062 each a year. I also stressed that movement on the Upper Pay Scale has to be accompanied by a performance management scheme, as has been the case in England and Wales since 2000.I also made it quite clear that the money is not available for backdating beyond the Inquiry's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.8/2">The teacher unions and the employers have been in talks with the Labour Relations Agency, and they are keen to reach an early and realistic resolution. At the most recent LRA meeting the teachers' unions agreed to work together with Management Side to consider and agree a School Development and Performance Management Scheme which is acceptable to both sides.</p>

In 2002&ndash;03, the total budget was &pound;195.7 million and this increased to &pound;243.6 million in 2003&ndash;04.

	<p pid=".951W.2/1">There has been an increase in the use of contraceptive injections administered in family planning clinics among girls aged under 16, in the last five years. There is currently very low uptake of non-user dependent methods of contraception in women of all ages. Increasing and improving access to all methods of contraception are aims of both the teenage pregnancy strategy and the sexual health and HIV strategy, to reduce rates of unintended pregnancies.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/2">Decisions about the most suitable type of contraception are for individuals to make in consultation with health professionals. Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16, working within an established legal framework, provided they are satisfied that the young person is competent to fully understand the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/3" class="indent">      The data requested on methods of contraception used by teenage girls, are published in table 2 of the statistical bulletin &quot;NHS Contraceptive Services, England: 2002&ndash;03&quot; and in the equivalent table in earlier bulletins, available in the Library and at:</p>

	<p pid=".951W.2/10">The first and only available contraceptive implant product was withdrawn from use by the licence holder in 1998&ndash;99, before being replaced by another product which was licensed in 1999, hence low usage in women of all ages at that time.</p>

	<p pid=".963W.2/2">The Government takes the issue of tackling obesity in children very seriously. Prevention is the best long-term approach, by improving diet and promoting physical activity. A variety of initiatives are in place, including the promotion of breastfeeding; reform of the welfare food scheme; action within schools, such as the food in schools programme; the 5 A DAY programme including the national school fruit scheme and action to address sugar, fat and salt levels in the diet. Significant investment is being made to transform physical education, school sport and club links over the next three years.</p>
