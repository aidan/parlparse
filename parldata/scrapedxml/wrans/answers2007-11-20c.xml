Guidance contained within the Army General Administrative Instruction Chapter 70 suggests 60 working days from receipt by the board for it to make a determination. However, from <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>, new procedures will come into effect as a result of the Armed Forces Act 2006. From that point most complaints will be referred to service complaint panels rather than service boards. The suggested timings for the panels to make their decisions will be the same as for the Army board at present.</p>
	<p pid="c.663W.0/2">In addition, the new Service Complaints Commissioner will provide an alternative way for service personnel to make certain types of complaints. The Commissioner will set her own reporting timelines for monitoring progress when she passes complaints to the services for action.</p>

The directive is still in the early stages of the co-decision procedure and so it is too early to say what the final position will be on the scope of the directive, or when the directive's provisions will be applied to UK airports. This will depend on when the directive is adopted at EU level and the date that it is subsequently transposed into UK law. Four UK airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester) are currently designated for the purposes of price control. The two concurrent public consultations on the designated status of Manchester and Stansted airports closed on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>.

Approximately &euro;1.6 billion (&pound;1.1 billion) is committed spend on the design and development of the system. The Commission estimates these costs might be offset by a revenue stream from chargeable Galileo services.

In addition to the requirements for adequate records to be maintained by project and personal licence holders these include the requirement of a health record maintained under the supervision of the Named Veterinary Surgeon or other suitably qualified person. The Named Veterinary Surgeon's records have to be maintained to the proper professional standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.675W.6/2">A number of record formats have evolved to satisfy Home Office requirements and meet local needs. Observation schedules and record keeping are expected to make proper provision for the checking of animals and recording of significant findings outside normal working hours, where necessary. The records must be made available to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate on request. Failure to maintain records in an acceptable format is in breach of the terms and conditions of authorities issued under the 1986 Act.</p>

Those airports are London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London Stansted, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow International, Glasgow Prestwick, Birmingham and Manchester. At non-designated airports, they either have a dedicated police presence or the police attend when there is an operational need to do so.

	<p pid="c.681W.2/1">Provision of cells by the police is a matter for the Commissioner of the Metropolitan police and the respective chief constables. However, I understand that in all cases local police stations are used and there are no cells in the airport terminals.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.2/2">The Border and Immigration Agency has for the last five years used four holding rooms at Heathrow and one each at Luton, Stansted and London City airports. At Gatwick South Terminal there was one room in 2002. A second room was added in 2003. At the North Terminal there is one room plus a &quot;family&quot; room that can be used as a holding room. People who are detained for short periods under the Immigration Acts or are being removed from the United Kingdom are held in these holding rooms.</p>

	<p pid="c.681W.5/2">The Respect Task Force worked across Government and set out an ambitious programme of work to build a modern culture of respect, setting out its objectives in the Respect Action Plan published in January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.5/3">Through the Respect programme, we introduced new approaches to tackle the root causes of antisocial behaviour. Key commitments in the Government's Respect Action Plan have now been met and mainstreamed locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.5/4">Independent evaluation of the Government's strategy show that it is working well. The National Audit Office study (2006) showed that the powers available were successful at stopping antisocial behaviour. Public perceptions of antisocial behaviour being a problem locally are down as shown in the British Crime Survey and the Local Government User Satisfaction Survey 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="c.681W.5/5">The Government are committed to building on the excellent progress made across the country, working with local authorities and the police to tackle the problems on the ground but also to deal with the root causes through early intervention and prevention.</p>

The comparatively small number of cases that are not assigned a broad offence category include those that are administratively finalised, for example, those in which the defendant has died or cannot be traced before the case is concluded.</p>

	<p pid="c.692W.5/1">Northern Ireland court proceedings and sentencing data sources do not include victim information in relation to the commission of an offence.

	<p pid="c.705W.0/4" class="indent">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main summary indicator of economic activity in the UK. Because data collection, estimation and reporting are not structured according to demographic groups, the national accounts framework does not however make it possible to identify the direct contribution of immigrants to the measured levels of economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.0/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics for labour supply indicators for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.705W.0/6" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>

	<p pid="c.708W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on employment for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.2/5" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers comes from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="c.708W.2/6" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>

	<p pid="c.712W.5/1">The Government introduced statutory controls in the UK on unsolicited spam e-mails under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>. They provide a first line of defence against the kind of unsolicited e-mails that many people object to where they have no knowledge of the advertiser or the products being marketed. The regulations require that unsolicited spam e-mails must not be sent to an individual subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the European Union (EU).</p>
	<p pid="c.712W.5/2">The Information Commissioner's Office has responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations controls in the UK on unsolicited spam e-mails and considers complaints about breaches. A breach of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence subject to a fine of up to &pound;5,000 in a magistrate's court.</p>

	<p pid="c.716W.2/17">Although the number of registrations and de-registrations in both areas has fluctuated over the period, the total number of VAT registered businesses in Suffolk has increased from 22,520 at the start of 2002 to 24,360 at the start of 2007, an increase of 1,840 (8 per cent.). The total number of VAT registered businesses in the East of England has increased from 179,500 at the start of 2002 to 196,480 at the start of 2007, an increase of 16,980 (9 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.2/18">VAT registration and de-registration data provide the only accurate indicator of the level of business start-up and closure activity at the county level.</p>
	<p pid="c.716W.2/19">However, VAT registrations do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which was &pound;60,000 at the start of 2006. Only 1.9 million out of 4.5 million UK enterprises (43 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2006.</p>

The following table shows the number of open inquests, and the percentage this represents of total deaths of service personnel in the conflicts, at the end of each month. Each fatality must be investigated thoroughly, and that inevitably takes time. The figures show that coroners, helped by additional resources made available by the Government, have been reducing the proportion of inquests which are pending. 130 inquests have been held, half of them this year, for service personnel who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, and two further fatalities have been taken into consideration in inquest proceedings. As at <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, there had been 253 service fatalities, either repatriated to England and Wales or who died as a result of injuries, since the conflicts began. We have kept both Houses informed of progress with service inquests and will continue to report each quarter.</p>

	<p pid="c.720W.0/1">The information is not held centrally. However, an inquest is opened to take identification evidence and to enable release of the body to the family and is generally opened within a few days of the death. There will be a longer interval between the death and the opening where there is the possibility of a homicide offence. In these circumstances, the inquest will only be opened when the police are satisfied that the body will not be needed for the purposes of an investigation. In the case of overseas military inquests, there will also be a slightly longer interval between the death and the opening of the inquest because it usually takes between a week and 10 days before the body is returned to the UK.</p>

If a young person drops out of education or training altogether, the focus will be on providing help, support and guidance to help them re-engage in learning as soon as possible. There will then be a series of administrative procedures that would be followed before a court process would be reached, where a fine could be imposed. It is difficult to assess exact numbers, but we would expect only a few young people would reach this stage.</p>

The UK takes its international law obligations very seriously and as a general rule will only sign and ratify an instrument when we can ensure our full compliance with it and commit to its implementation. The UK position with regard to ILO 169 was set out in a 1989 Department for Education and Employment White Paper (&quot;Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries&quot; Command Paper Number: CM 1078). As the White Paper noted, ILO 169 was essentially an update of the 1957 ILO Convention 107. The White Paper explained that Convention 107 could not be applied to the UK as there are no indigenous, tribal or semi-tribal people there, and so had not been ratified by the UK. The same arguments applied to ILO 169 as it did not alter the scope of Convention 107. This position still stands.</p>

Internee cases are reviewed on a monthly basis. Individuals have the right to provide written representation at the monthly reviews of their internment and have regular access to lawyers. A joint Iraqi/Coalition review board sits quarterly to assess the cases of all UK-held internees and make recommendations. A separate joint Iraqi/Coalition internment committee reviews detention cases after 18 months to decide whether continued internment is necessary.</p>

It is not legally binding, rather an informal framework for judges in both judiciaries to help return abducted children to their normal place of residence. The Government fully support the aims of the Protocol. Paragraph 7 of the Protocol &quot;recommended that the respective governments of the UK and Pakistan give urgent consideration to identifying or establishing an administrative service to facilitate or oversee the resolution of child abduction cases&quot;. For the UK we have a dedicated child abduction section within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We continue to seek ways to enhance the practical application of the Protocol. To this end we are supporting a conference to be held in Islamabad next year bringing together senior members of both the UK and Pakistan judiciaries, as well as UK and Pakistani officials, and non-governmental representatives.</p>

Such co-operation is essential if a sustainable long-term solution is to be found.</p>

These include the level of diversity of our trading partners, trends in world commodity markets, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations' analysis of trends in global food production and demand as well as the level of self sufficiency for the EU as a whole (which is currently over 90 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.749W.6/5">We recognise too that our food chain relies on various forms of energy and that energy security is a primary concern. The Government's Energy White Paper (May 2007), specifically considers how our energy security can be maintained and enhanced in an uncertain world.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.5/2">My Department does not have responsibility for statutory obligations on local authorities for facilities on beaches, nor does it produce guidance on the development of management plans for beaches. DEFRA has however recently updated guidance on Shoreline Management Plans and is currently funding a review of all such plans around the coast. Shoreline Management Plans provide a large-scale assessment of the flood and erosion risks associated with coastal processes and present a long-term policy framework to reduce these risks to people and the developed, historic and natural environment in a sustainable manner. Guidance may also be provided by other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.5/3">Under section 89 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 local authorities have a duty to keep their relevant land clear of litter and refuse, which includes parts of the beach above the high water mark. There are other controls in place to deal with litter and waste in marine environments below the high water mark, but local authorities are advised to monitor and clean these areas as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.5/4">In addition, there are a number of voluntary schemes in the UK including the Blue Flag Scheme, the Seaside Awards and the Good Beach Guide. The Blue Flag Scheme is administered by ENCAMS in the UK and its criteria for 2008 includes standards for environmental education and information, water quality, environmental management, and safety and services.</p>

	<p pid="c.752W.2/1">Advice on the scientific aspects of the disease is provided by DEFRA's Expert Group on Bluetongue. Current advice is that over a winter period large numbers of midges are killed at low temperatures. However, some of the northern species of midges do survive, and may potentially breed. Although the virus is present in midges for only a limited time, animals, particularly infected cattle, may retain the virus in their body for 60 days or more. This means that the bluetongue virus can be sustained over the winter period.</p>
	<p pid="c.752W.2/2">Last year, Europe had a mild winter. This supported midge activity, and low levels of disease circulation were possible throughout the winter. A similar situation is possible in the UK this winter. DEFRA (in conjunction with scientists from the Institute for Animal Health at Pirbright, the European Union, and the World Community Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue), will continue to monitor and review the situation in light of the latest information and research from affected countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.753W.3/1">It is a priority for DEFRA Ministers and officials to work closely with, and listen to, farmers and the leaders of industry during the bluetongue outbreak. DEFRA works closely with a wide range of farming industry stakeholders on a daily basis to ensure effective communication with farmers. Stakeholders have been kept in touch with the latest developments by email updates and regular telephone conferences. One of the major issues currently being discussed is the scope of the future control measures that we need, including the question of whether to extend the existing zones to cover a wider area. This will depend on the epidemiological situation and an assessment of the implications of our current measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.3/2">All registered keepers of livestock within the bluetongue protection and surveillance zones were contacted within 24 hours of the zones being declared. Since the start of the bluetongue outbreak on <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase>, approximately 200,000 information messages have been sent to livestock keepers subject to movement restrictions. These include approximately 140,000 voicemail messages, text messages, e-mails and facsimiles. In addition, approximately 50,000 information packs have been sent to registered livestock keepers. Animal Health has also launched a public voice-recorded information line, which is intended to serve an audience who are unable to access the DEFRA website. Currently, the DEFRA Helpline is also available seven days a week for all queries relating to bluetongue.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.3/3">DEFRA officials are keen to receive any specific proposals from stakeholders and livestock keepers about how communication methods could be further improved in the event of a disease outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="c.754W.5/1">Assessments have been made, on the livestock industry as a whole, of the impact of current disease control measures. These assessments are informing DEFRA's cost/benefit analysis of those measures. Separate assessments of the effect on the pedigree sheep and cattle markets in Shropshire or Montford Bridge have not been made as these would be subject to considerable margins of error.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.5/2">In agreement with a core group of industry stakeholders, DEFRA remains committed to a disease control approach which aims to contain disease within the current control and protection zones, in line with 'Phase 1' of the UK Bluetongue Control Strategy. This takes into account the epidemiological situation, the time of year (coming towards the end of the vector season), and the cost benefit analysis of disease control measures and their likely economic impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.5/3">This assessment remains under constant review, and recognises that efforts to contain disease may become disproportionate to the costs to industry, and therefore the strategy may have to change. However, using the above assessment, this point has not yet been reached.</p>

	<p pid="c.756W.8/2">Following recent tragic incidents involving dog attacks on children this year, we have undertaken a review of the dangerous dogs legislation. Officials consulted all chief police officers in England and Wales to find out their views on how effective the dangerous dogs legislation is, what could be done to improve enforcement and whether any parts of the law need to be changed. Officials discussed the results of this consultation with the Association of Chief Constables (ACPO).</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.8/3">In the light of this consultation, we believe that the priority is for existing law to be more effectively enforced rather than introducing new legislation. Officials will work closely with the police service, local authorities and animal welfare organisations to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.8/4">All dogs, not just those types banned under the dangerous dogs legislation, may present a risk to the public if they are not properly looked after. There is already robust law in place to deal with the problem of dogs that are out of control in public places. But there is a limit to how far laws, however well written they may be, can tackle the small minority of dog owners who are either irresponsible or, for other reasons, find it difficult to look after their animals properly. I therefore welcome the work being done by those animal welfare organisations that go out and offer practical advice and help to those who are having difficulties. I believe this is the best way of effectively fostering a more responsible attitude to dog ownership in this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.756W.8/5">I know that some feel that the law relating to dog attacks in the home should be strengthened. I am not convinced that changing the existing law would help those who either enforce the law or administer justice, or reduce the number of attacks that take place in domestic places. This is an area that we will keep under close review and, if necessary, make changes to the law if we think that this will reduce these very distressing incidents that occur within a family context.</p>

	<p pid="c.758W.8/2">Diabrotica virgifera, the western corn rootworm (WCR), is a serious pest that is listed in EC plant health legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.758W.8/3">Investigations into the origins of the populations of WCR found in the south-east of England are very difficult because the means by which it was introduced are unclear. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that WCR is spread by aircraft since outbreaks have been closely associated with airports throughout Europe. However, to date, no studies have been carried out on the presence of potentially invasive insects on aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="c.758W.8/4">A study is being carried out to assess the feasibility of using DMA genetic markers to identify entry pathways of invasive pests such as WCR. The results are due to be published soon. However, they indicate that the cases in the UK have been introduced from at least two sources, linked to populations in the USA and eastern Europe. Other published studies have also suggested at least three independent introductions of this pest into Europe from North America during the past two decades.</p>
	<p pid="c.758W.8/5">Crop rotation is the most effective means of controlling WCR and enforced rotation of maize crops is required under statutory notice in infected areas of the UK, in line with the EU legislation. A range of alternative management options for the control or eradication of WCR have been used in areas where the pest occurs, including foliar insecticide treatments for use against adult beetles. Unfortunately, there are no effective methods of spraying such insecticides in the UK, since aerial application is not possible around airports and high clearance sprayers are not generally available. Insecticide seed treatments may exert a limited degree of control against larvae in the soil but will not eradicate the pest. Since the pathway for entry of WCR remains unidentified and hence uncontrolled, the possibility of further introductions remains high. Public consultation has been completed to determine future policy regarding this pest, taking account of EU legislation and recent survey results, and the outcome will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.768W.5/1">The Government are working closely with the devolved administrations to co-ordinate the disease control response throughout Great Britain. Officials in the Welsh Assembly Government are actively involved in policy decisions for foot and mouth disease (FMD), bluetongue and now avian influenza, and in reviewing the disease control strategies.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/2">Certain functions under the Animal Health Act 1981, including disease control functions, were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales under the Transfer of Functions Order 2004 (SI 2004/3044) and are now the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government. The transfer of functions was not accompanied by an apportioned transfer of budgets. These are retained by DEFRA, which meets the costs of animal disease control, welfare and surveillance on behalf of Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/3">Where animals are slaughtered and property seized due directly to FMD, DEFRA meets the cost of compensatory payments, including those in respect of Wales. This does not extend to the offer of financial support for consequential loss.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/4">The EU Commission and member states have agreed a new Decision which will allow the relaxation of current FMD export restrictions on meat and meat products. This Decision is expected to come into force in the middle of November. The current FMD restrictions will be amended and the FMD Restricted Zone in England will be lifted when this occurs. This will allow farmers in Wales to send animals for slaughter for the export market. The implementation of this decision has been developed in close consultation with officials in the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/5">The UK remains committed to an approach to the control of bluetongue which aims to contain the disease within the current restricted area, in line with 'Phase 1' of the UK Bluetongue Disease Control Strategy. This takes into account the epidemiological situation, the time of year (coming towards the end of the vector season), and the cost benefit analysis of disease control measures and their likely economic impacts. Decision-making about the placing of the surveillance zone boundaries has been shared with Welsh Assembly Government and with a core group of stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/6">This assessment remains under constant review with stakeholders as the bluetongue disease situation develops, and recognises that efforts to contain the disease may become disproportionate to the costs to industry, and therefore the strategy may have to change. However, using the above assessment, this point has not yet been reached.</p>
	<p pid="c.768W.5/7">We are very conscious that we must balance the need to reduce the pressure on the industry with the overriding objective of controlling the spread of bluetongue. We will continue to work with the devolved administrations in reviewing and implementing our bluetongue control policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.775W.0/1">There are major challenges facing the marine environment, its resources and its biodiversity. Without a sound information-base we cannot robustly face these challenges. We therefore welcome a research strategy which will strengthen the marine science-base overall. EU Framework research programmes have supported a considerable body of science across Europe and beyond, and this adds to the evidence emerging from national programmes. However, marine science has been somewhat of a neglected area and an increased focus on marine research may give it an enhanced priority.</p>

	<p pid="c.775W.3/1">Maritime research is intrinsically international in character. Much of the Department's research activities are undertaken by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS).</p>
	<p pid="c.775W.3/2">Co-ordination of much applied marine resource, environment and ecosystem is undertaken under the auspices of the inter-governmental International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES). The membership of ICES is of 20 countries around the North Atlantic, including several non-EU countries. International Working Groups meet on issues such as monitoring of fisheries, harmful algal blooms, marine contaminants and oceanography, as well as provide commissioned advice. In 2007, the UK and ICES jointly sponsored meetings on marine indicators and on changes in marine acidification. Working Groups also meet under the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR).</p>
	<p pid="c.775W.3/3">The EU Framework programmes also enable a considerable body of collaborative work to be undertaken. Currently, CEFAS has 26 such projects of which 12 are fisheries-related, seven concern marine environmental issues and seven relate to fish health and welfare. They involve all other member states except Luxemburg. The programmes also involve institutes from another 20 countries. Further countries are involved through other non-EU projects.</p>

	<p pid="c.780W.8/1">All Communities' staff below the senior civil service have the right to work flexi-time. However, there is no central recording of take-up.

Central monitoring of these working patterns is not expected to be introduced until the new year at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid="c.789W.5/1">There are extensive requirements governing decision-making processes for bringing a child into care, which is ultimately a decision for the courts. The processes are the same for all children and are set out in the Court Orders volume of the Children Act 1989 guidance. Local authorities must undertake a thorough assessment of the parents' capacity to meet the child's developmental needs in the context of the wider family and environmental factors. The plan which follows the assessment must then be submitted to the court and will be subject to judicial scrutiny as part of the consideration as to whether the harm thresholds set out in legislation have been met.</p>
	<p pid="c.789W.5/2">The Department has recently consulted on a revised version of the Court orders guidance which will shortly be reissued. Both the revised guidance and the policy direction of the &quot;Care Matters&quot; Green and White papers emphasise the need to engage families, including wider family, at the earliest stages of decision-making and ensure that they are fully informed about local authority concerns.</p>

This duty is regardless of the age of the child. The legislation is accompanied by extensive guidance which sets out how the legislation is to be delivered in practice.

	<p pid="c.790W.5/1">The attainment of looked after children has improved. However, outcomes for this group of children and young people are not good enough. In June 2007 we published our White Paper &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot;, which set out the range of ways in which we will improve the education of looked after children. These include: putting the designated teacher on a statutory footing to improve the expertise in school and ensure a stronger focus on their learning needs; introducing a &pound;500 annual allowance for looked after children at risk of falling behind at school; appointing 'virtual school heads' to oversee their education; reducing mobility of school placements, particularly in the crucial years before GCSEs; and a bursary of a minimum of &pound;2,000 for all care leavers who go on to university.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/2">We are personalising the learning of looked after children to ensure that they receive greater support where they are falling behind. This includes providing greater access to one to one tuition. For example:</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/3" class="indent">The &pound;500 allowance for looked after children at risk of falling behind at school will be used to support a wide range of additional learning activities that meet the needs of the child, including one to one tuition;</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/4" class="indent">We are currently piloting better approaches to personalised learning, including one to one tuition, through our &quot;Making Good Progress&quot; pilot. The pilot is providing up to a total of 20 hours of one to one tuition in English and maths for 43,000 pupils, focused on pupils who are behind national expectations, are falling behind, or looked after children who would particularly benefit from individual support; and</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/5" class="indent">HSBC have provided &pound;1 million to fund one to one tuition for looked after children. This provision will be managed by new 'virtual school heads' who will oversee the education of looked after children in a local area.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/6">From next year we will roll out the &quot;Every Child a Reader&quot; programme nationally, building on the highly successful pilot led by the KPMG Foundation, so that by 2011 30,000 six-year-olds who have difficulty reading will be getting one-to-one tuition. We will also provide support for writing in primary schools through the &quot;Every Child a Writer&quot; programme, helping teachers to ensure that they use the best teaching methods, including one-to-one coaching, in the areas of writing which primary children find hardest to master.</p>
	<p pid="c.790W.5/7">By 2011 we will extend one to one support to 300,000 children in English (and a further 300,000 in maths). This will ensure that many more children receive the support they need to reach their potential. The more intensive support offered through &quot;Every Child a Reader&quot; is in addition to this. Both will be of great benefit to looked after children.</p>

	<p pid="c.803W.2/2">The following tables sets out the number of statutory proposals to expand that were published and approved in each local authority from September 1999 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-09">9 November 2007</phrase>. Information prior to the introduction of the local decision making regime in September 1999 is not sufficiently reliable. There were no expansions in the local authority areas not listed in the table. Decisions on expansion proposals are taken by the local authority or by the schools adjudicator. Before <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May 2007</phrase>, decisions were taken by the School Organisation Committee rather than the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.803W.2/3">The Government are not involved in deciding expansion proposals, but do make available capital funding to encourage successful and popular schools to expand. The Government have allocated &pound;35 million to enable 16 popular and successful schools to expand since June 2003.</p>

	<p pid="c.816W.5/1">Continuing professional development plays an important role in improving the knowledge, understanding and skills of teachers and other staff in schools. Training in special educational needs (SEN) and disability is a national CPD priority, and schools may use their School Development Grant to secure appropriate training geared to identified needs, either in relation to individual members of staff or the school's work force as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.5/2">We have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with schools and local authorities to embed effective anti-bullying practice on the ground. We have flagged up with them that the bullying of children with SEN and disability is a key priority and asked them to work with local authorities and schools to identify any training needs in this area. We have also commissioned the Council for Disabled Children to provide specific guidance for schools on tackling the bullying of children with SEN and disabilities, and will publish this next spring. This will include information and material which local authorities and schools will be able to draw on for training purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.5/3">In addition, the Department has funded a number of programmes which help develop children's and young people's pro-social skills and tackle poor behaviour, including bullying, such as the Living for Sport programme and the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource, as well as delivering targeted support to the most vulnerable children and young people through the Targeted Youth Support programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.5/4">All local authorities and schools must have regard to the SEN code of practice which provides advice on carrying out statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs. Schools' responsibilities include ensuring that teachers and other staff receive appropriate professional development to support them in performing their responsibilities effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.816W.5/5">To help teachers and other staff in building their confidence in working to raise the attainment, attendance and emotional well-being of children with SEN and disabilities the Department launched, on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, the Inclusion Development programme. The opening round focuses on training in relation to children's communication difficulties, including dyslexia.</p>

Both organisations welcome applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are subject to peer review and judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposals made.</p>
	<p pid="c.819W.5/2">The research concerned with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis that the MRC and the NIHR are currently funding has been subject to these transparent and rigorous processes.</p>

	<p pid="c.826W.11/3">Information on acute admissions is not collected in the format requested. At the end of June 2007, there were 155 national health service trusts reporting emergency admissions via type 1 (major) A&amp;E departments. This does not include planned admissions in acute specialities.

	<p pid="c.826W.11/4">Only in some cases will the time taken between pick up of the patient and arriving at A&amp;E be the most important consideration. In most cases it is the initial response, the treatment and diagnosis and quality of care, including specialist care, that matter most. Patients with severe trauma, appropriate heart attack and stroke victims may be best helped by being taken directly to specialist units, receiving care on the way to hospital. This may not be the nearest hospital&mdash;the right place might often be a specialist unit where they see enough cases to maintain expertise and achieve the best outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="c.832W.2/1">Mental health services in the City of Manchester are primarily provided by the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care NHS Trust. At the end of 2005, the primary care trust and Manchester city council undertook a public consultation on the future direction of mental health services, entitled Change in Mind, which gave a mandate to reorganise mental health services to meet the requirements of the National Service Frameworks, through a combination of redesign and new investment. PCTs and the city council have underpinned these changes by an additional &pound;4 million of recurrent investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.832W.2/2">Services provided by Manchester Health and Social Care Trust were reviewed to modernise ways of work and to increase community provision. Key changes include new specialist services for people with mental health problems; integrated community health and social care services for older people with mental health problems, improved access to emergency mental health services and stronger emphasis on social inclusion. Full implementation commenced from April 2007.</p>

Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England.

Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. Children are defined as 0 -15 year olds, and as 16 -18 year olds in full time education. <i> Dispensing doctors</i><i> </i>Data up to 2000 is not strictly comparable with data from later years. Up until September 2000 only patients having their prescriptions dispensed by the community pharmacists and appliance contractors were required to complete the back of the prescription form, but from October 2000 this requirement was extended to patients of dispensing doctors. Therefore data prior to October 2000 does not include prescriptions dispensed by dispensing doctors.</td> </tr>
