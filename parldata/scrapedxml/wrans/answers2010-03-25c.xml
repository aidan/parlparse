	<p pid="c.420W.5/1">A wide range of services and benefits in kind are available to older people and these are administered both centrally and locally. As a result, the information is not available in the format requested: some information is not collected and some could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The information which is available is given as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/2" class="italic"> (i) NHS services</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/3">People aged 60 and over are able to claim free prescriptions and eye tests on the grounds of age. Detailed information on prescription charges is not held in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/4">In financial year 2008-09, 90,380 free NHS sight tests were given to people aged 60 and over within the North Yorkshire and York PCT area, costing an estimated &#163;1,789,524.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/5">There is no automatic entitlement for adult pensioners to NHS optical vouchers or free dental treatment. Individuals may qualify for these benefits if they are in receipt of certain qualifying benefits, or if they have been assessed as eligible for assistance under the NHS Low Income Scheme.

	<p pid="c.420W.5/9">The statutory minimum travel concession, introduced in April 2008, gives those aged 60 or over and eligible disabled people free off-peak local bus travel in any part of England. The Government provide around &#163;1 billion a year to fund the concession.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/10">Travel concession schemes are provided through local authorities, which have flexibility to enhance their schemes to offer more than the statutory minimum, so there are local variations in what is offered and take-up of concessionary travel also varies from one area to another. Therefore it is not possible to quantify the value of the benefit in kind in a specific local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/11" class="italic"> (iv) Television licences</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/12">Free television licences for people aged 75 or over were introduced in November 2000. TV Licensing, who administer free licences as agents for the BBC, are not able to provide geographical breakdowns of licences issued. However, figures are available for the number of households with at least one person aged 75 or over receiving winter fuel payments in York local authority. These people would be eligible for a free television licence. 12,180 households received winter fuel payments in York local authority in the year 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.5/13">The television licence fee for the year 2009-10 is &#163;142.50 for a colour television licence, and &#163;48.00 for a black and white television licence.</p>

Warm Front provides grants for heating, insulation and energy efficiency measures. For the year 2009-10, 132 single pensioner households and 100 two-pensioner households received Warm Front assistance in the York local authority area, and the average spend on each of those households was &#163;1,870.08 and &#163;1,675.20 respectively.</p>

In order to avoid undermining the House's position in the commercial competition, it is not possible to disclose any further information at this stage. According to childcare experts, there is likely to be a build up of usage over a period: the average use of the first 12 months of a new nursery is likely to be around 40 per cent.

According to Mr. Franco there are 650 corpses properly identified in their graves buried during the last 20 years. There are approximately 350 corpses not identified during the same 20 years. The burial of non-identified people at La Macarena's cemetery has been properly registered in the control books kept by the municipal authorities and the officers in charge of the cemetery's administration.

	<p pid="c.429W.8/1">Following DEFRA's consultation on non-agricultural diffuse pollution in 2007, we made a decision to progress each policy option separately. For example, we have recently consulted on options for legislative mechanisms to control phosphates in domestic laundry cleaning products in the UK. We have also proposed a requirement for developers to consider sustainable drainage systems for surface water for all new developments in the Flood and Water Management Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.429W.8/2">As part of this, the use of a legislative approach based on general binding rules (GBRs) is another of the options which we are developing. While we are not in a position to hold a consultation in the near future, as policy develops and further evidence of the impact of GBRs is gathered, we may hold a consultation. To commit to any policy on further development of GBRs we must be confident that any action would be of benefit to the environment, and that the economic and social impacts of the action are assessed.</p>

	<p pid="c.434W.2/1">An independent assessment is commissioned at the end of each three year phase of the Supplier Obligation (now termed the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target), building on the cost-benefit assessment undertaken and published at the launch of each scheme. Independent analysis of the three year supplier obligation scheme ending March 2008 showed it to have been extremely cost effective in delivery-that for every &#163;1 added on to GB household bills to pay for the obligation, benefits equate to an average saving of &#163;9 per household bill over the lifetime of the measures. Equally, the present supplier obligation, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target which ends in March 2011, is also believed to be highly cost-effective. Annual benefits (net of costs) are expected to be around &#163;649 million for the lifetime of the measures, with around &#163;228 benefits per tonne of carbon dioxide saved in the traded sector and &#163;153 benefits per tonne of CO2 saved in the non-traded sector. Insulation measures make up over 60 per cent. of savings to target-equivalent to some 4 million households receiving insulation measures.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> The levels associated with fines do not relate to the amount of the fine but to the offence committed and the statutory maximum that may be issued for that offence. Therefore as the maximum fine for each of these offences is a level 5 every fine issued for these offences would be considered as a level 5 fine; as it would cover the range &#163;0-&#163;5000. We have therefore shown the number of fines issued by band.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup> Section 1 includes the following offences:<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(2)(a).</i><br/> Breeding or breeding from a fighting dog.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(2)(b).</i><br/> Selling, exchanging, offering, advertising or exposing for sale a fighting dog.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(2)(c).</i><br/> Giving or offering to give a fighting dog.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(2)(d).</i><br/> Allowing a fighting dog to be in a public place without a muzzle or a lead.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(2)(e).</i><br/> Abandoning, or allowing to stray, a fighting dog.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 1(3).</i><br/> Possession, without exemption, of a Pit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa or other designated fighting dog.<br/> <sup>(5)</sup> Section 3 includes the following offences:<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 3(1).</i><br/> Owner or person in charge allowing dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place injuring any person<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 3(3).</i><br/> Owner or person in charge allowing dog to enter a non-public place and injure any person.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 3(1).</i><br/> Owner or person in charge allowing dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place, no injury being caused.<br/> <i> Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Sec 3(3).</i><br/> Owner or person in charge allowing dog to enter a non-public place causing reasonable apprehension of injury to a person.<br/> <i> Notes:</i><br/> <i> Magistrates courts</i><br/> In the case of sentences at magistrates courts, a change was made to the categorisation by area as part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates courts during 2008. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court, while sentences given at courts not yet using the Libra system are categorised in the same way as at the Crown court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates courts were using Libra. This change will have almost no impact on the categorisation by area; only around 0.01 percent of sentences at magistrates courts could have been affected in 2007 and 2008. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates courts) in courts outside their areas.<br/> <i> Crown </i><i> c</i><i> ourt</i><br/> Sentences at the Crown court are categorised according to the police force that prosecuted the offence including those sentences that may be given at a court outside the prosecuting police force's area.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Justice Statistics Analytical Services in the Ministry of Justice</td> </tr>

First, to continue with the measures currently under way to raise awareness about current schemes and enforce existing rules with operators. Second, to improve current schemes without regulation, possibly through the introduction of a protocol. Or third, to implement the Lord Chancellor's powers to approve debt management schemes contained in Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.450W.5/1">The average cost of a prison place comprises the expenditure on public and private prisons (as recorded in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Agency Annual Report and Accounts), increased by an apportionment of relevant costs borne centrally and in the regions by NOMS. This involves some estimation. In addition, expenditure met centrally by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) is included. The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. health and education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Where the costs of young people are recharged by NOMS to the YJB, expenditure is shown gross and not reduced by income from the YJB.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.5/2">For 2008-09 the overall cost of a prison place was &#163;45,000 (to nearest &#163;1,000). This includes expenditure met by NOMS national and regional structures, including Prison Service administration, and the YJB. It does not include expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. for health and education).</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.5/3">In general health care and education costs are not included. Where prisons have been contracted out to the private sector the cost to NOMS includes health care and this is included in the cost per place above. In general prisoner education is not included. In general clinical drug addiction services are not included. Services which are the responsibility of NOMS (e.g. drug testing, accredited drug treatment programmes and Counselling, Assessment, Referral advice and Throughcare services) are included. Dog handling costs are included.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.5/4">Before 2008-09, Her Majesty's Prison Service annual report and accounts included the direct prison cost per place. This included only the expenditure met and managed locally at each prison and excluded expenditure met at area, region or national level. The reported figures included expenditure on health care and education which was recharged to the other Government Departments. It did not include that expenditure met directly by other Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.5/5">Cost per prison place is expressed in terms of the Certified Normal Accommodation number of places; this gives a higher unit cost than the cost per prisoner.</p>

	<p pid="c.451W.2/1">Costs will vary depending on the nature and intensity of the supervision. The National Audit Office Report (NAO), &quot;The Supervision of Community Orders in England and Wales&quot; (January 2008) included an estimate of the cost of delivering a supervision requirement. The NAO reviewed five probation areas and estimated the average annual cost in those areas of delivering the supervision requirement to be &#163;652. This estimate did not include the cost of probation overheads. Research indicates that female offenders have more identified needs on average than male offenders with a similar risk of re-offending, therefore supervision is often more expensive. The NAO report above did not account for this variable in their estimates. The Specification, Benchmarking and Costing programme in the National Offender Management Service is defining what it should cost to deliver services and this work is due to be completed by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.451W.8/1">The funding for the supervision of offenders sentenced to unpaid work is part of the general grant provided to probation areas. The actual costs will vary between areas and according to the type of work placement.</p>
	<p pid="c.451W.8/2">The National Offender Management Service Specification Benchmarking and Costing Programme, has produced a service specification for unpaid work / Community Payback based on an assumed operating model. This will enable more accurate calculations of costs and is used by probation areas and Directors of Offender Management to assess Community Payback as part of a best value exercise.</p>
	<p pid="c.451W.8/3">The service specification for unpaid work/Community Payback calculates the cost of commencement, including risk assessment and offender induction during the first two hours of the sentence at &#163;82.40. For an offender attending a weekday work group in an urban area, the ongoing cost is calculated to be &#163;8.83 an hour. The cost of a 160 hour sentence is therefore &#163;1,477.54 and the cost of a 240 hour sentence is &#163;2,183.94. These calculations do not include indirect costs such as premises, which will vary between probation areas. The hourly cost of Community Payback work at agency placements, where supervision is undertaken by the organisation benefiting from the work is less costly, while operating work groups at weekends and in remote locations is proportionally more costly.</p>

	<p pid="c.452W.2/1">The supervision requirement is one of 12 requirements of a community order. The factors taken into account when costing the supervision requirement are:</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.2/2" class="indent">offender tier (there are four tiers in the National Offender Management Model describing different case management approaches and map against different resource levels and offender manager competences);</p>

	<p pid="c.452W.2/7">Gender of the offender is a factor when costing supervision requirement because the OASys research shows that women offenders at a given tier have on average a higher number of needs than male offenders.

	<p pid="c.452W.5/1">Between April 2005 and February 2010, 4,135 offenders have completed an accredited programme in the West Yorkshire probation area. In the first four years West Yorkshire probation area consistently over achieved in relation to its completion target for accredited programmes. The data for 2009-10 are for 11 months. Therefore it is not possible to say that this will be the case this year, as achievement for this period is 89 per cent. of the annual target.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/2">A full breakdown by district and programme type is shown in the following tables. Targeting by programme type began in April 2007 and a more detailed breakdown between the various types of programme is available from this point. The accredited &quot;offending behaviour&quot; programme category includes the suite of accredited programmes delivered in West Yorkshire, other than domestic violence and sex offending. This includes thinking skills, substance misuse, and drink driving programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/3">Programme delivery in West Yorkshire is organised within districts. However, in the two smallest districts (Calderdale and Wakefield), delivery is linked to neighbouring larger districts (Bradford and Kirklees). This means that an offender can begin a programme in another district rather than waiting to start in the district in which (s)he is resident. This is good practice in that a prompt start is more likely to result in successful programme completion.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/4">Accredited programme targets have been reduced in the past two years as the probation area has introduced a range of specified activities and alcohol treatment conditions for offenders who pose a lower risk of harm and reoffending, thereby reserving accredited programme provision for the more serious offenders. West Yorkshire plans to expand further its suite of interventions over the next two years to provide sentencers with a broader range of options.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/5">In 2009-10 a target was set for the programme completion rate (by district and programme). Across the probation area performance has exceeded target for offending behaviour and sex offender programmes but not for domestic violence. The range of provision will be increased in 2010 with an introduction of a shorter domestic abuse programme for less serious offenders in order to improve completion rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.456W.5/1">Tables showing the numbers of claims leading to orders being made for the repossession of property by mortgage lenders and landlords in England and Wales by Government Office Region for 2005 to 2009 are shown as follows. The figures are based on the physical locations of the properties which were the subject of the court actions.</p>
	<p pid="c.456W.5/2">These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made. This counting basis is more accurate than the number of orders made, because it removes the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. It is also a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.</p>
	<p pid="c.456W.5/3">These figures do not indicate how many properties have actually been repossessed. Repossessions can occur without a court order being made, while not all court orders result in repossession.</p>
	<p pid="c.456W.5/4">Statistics on mortgage and landlord possession claims in the county courts of England and Wales broken down by region, local authority and court, are published by the Ministry of Justice on a quarterly basis on the Ministry's website at:</p>

HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> The NHS Information Centre for health and social care, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)</td> </tr>

FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  <sup>(2)</sup><i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.  <sup>(3)</sup><i> ICD10 Clinical Codes</i><i> </i>The ICD-10 codes for malnutrition are: E40.X Kwashiorkor E41.X Nutritional marasmus.  <sup>(4)</sup><i> SHA of treatment</i> This field is derived from the hospital provider code (procode). It indicates the strategic health authority (SHA) area within which the treatment took place.  <i> Notes:</i>  1. <i> Small numbers</i><i> </i>To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number.  2. <i> Data quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  3. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><i> </i>HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.500W.2/2">In the 2008/09 academic year the LSC allocated &#163;23,377,000 to specialist land-based colleges to deliver Adult Learner Responsive provision (ALR) and &#163;22,684,000 for 2009/10. Although the allocations for five land-based colleges increased, there was an overall decrease in ALR allocation between 2008/09 and 2009/10. Across the FE and skills sector there was a decrease in ALR funding that reflected a commitment to increase funding for Train to Gain and Apprenticeships and away from Developmental Learning. Development Learning is defined as provision that is not aligned to one of the priority qualification categories: these are Full Level 2 (equivalent to 5 GCSEs at A*-C), Full Level 3 (2 A Levels or equivalent), Level 4, Foundation Learning and Skills for Life.</p>
	<p pid="c.500W.2/3">Funding allocations for 2010/11 academic year have not yet been finalised but final allocation letters are due to be sent to FE Colleges and Training Organisations from the end of March.

	<p pid="c.508W.2/6" class="indent">Where asylum seekers are living in the community, Census field staff will not know whether or not they are asylum seekers, and the census questionnaire will not seek this information. Such people will be enumerated via a combination of special enumeration and general enumeration procedures dependent on their length of intended residence and their place of residence. Both language support and translation services will be available. In addition, field staff will have received specific training in how to best encourage people to complete a questionnaire and deal with refusals. There will also be a tailored publicity and communications strategy to accompany this.</p>

	<p pid="c.508W.5/4" class="indent">The quantified discounted benefit has only been calculated for the 2011 Census programme as a whole, specific figures for the net increase of 6 individual questions per person (with no increase in household questions), have not been calculated in financial terms.

	<p pid="c.508W.5/6" class="indent">As explained in the previous answer referred to in your question, the quantified discounted benefit for the 2011 Census has been estimated to be circa &#163;750 million, however these benefits only relate to an estimated half of the uses of census data of which ONS is aware and so this figure is considered to be a very significant under-estimate.</p>

	<p pid="c.509W.5/6" class="indent">Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation requires only those conditions that contributed directly to death to be recorded on the death certificate.

Whether a condition contributed is a matter for their clinical judgement.</p>

	<p pid="c.509W.5/10" class="indent">3. Malnutrition or effects of hunger were mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor, in (a) private care homes and (b) public care homes in the London government office region, in each year from 2000 to 2008 (Table 3).</p>
	<p pid="c.509W.5/11" class="indent">There were (a) two deaths in private care homes and (b) one death in a public care home where malnutrition was the underlying cause of death, in the London government office region, in the years 2000 to 2008 combined.<sup>(1,2,3,4)</sup></p>

Deaths were included where one of these causes was the underlying cause of death. The introduction of ICD-10 in 2001 means that the numbers of deaths from malnutrition before 2001 are not completely comparable with later years.</p>

In terms of monetary values, the Department is able to provide the following information on its expenditure in the last three years through contracts with some of its leading suppliers of temporary staff in those years. The spend in this category is being realigned and is currently reckoned at some &#163;13 million per annum, which in 2008-09 represented less than 1 per cent. of total expenditure by the Home Office and its agencies of &#163;1,749 million.

	<p pid="c.520W.11/3">However, each immigration removal centre provides on-site medical care 24 hours a day. All detainees are seen by a nurse for a health screening within two hours of arrival at a centre and are given an appointment to see the GP within 24 hours. GPs see detainees earlier if required. Thereafter, they access health care on demand, subject to a triage service similar to that found in GP surgeries in the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.520W.11/4">Secondary treatment is provided by the local primary care trust by way of a referral from healthcare.</p>

Police force areas correspond to criminal justice areas except for the Metropolitan and City of London Police, which are combined to form the London criminal justice area. Prosecutions brought by agencies other than the police are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the sentencing court. In the case of sentences at magistrates courts, a change was made to the categorisation by area as part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates courts during 2008. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while sentences given at courts not yet using the Libra system are categorised in the same way as at the Crown court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates courts were using Libra. This change will have almost no impact on the categorisation by area; only around 0.01 per cent. of sentences at magistrates courts could have been affected in 2007 and 2008. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates courts) in courts outside their areas.<br/> The figures referred to in the response relate to stand alone community sentences only.<br/> Requirements similar to those of the stand alone orders which have been given as part of the generic community order are not included.

Accordingly, the HCA recommended that Oldham be given a place on the transfer programme. In his written ministerial statement of December 2009, the Housing Minister agreed a place on the programme for Oldham, enabling the council to proceed to Stage One of the tenant consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="c.544W.2/1">The indices of deprivation 2007 and 2004 (ID 2007 and ID 2004) were constructed at Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level. LSOAs are consistent in size and over time, and allow identification of small pockets of deprivation. This also overcomes difficulties in producing statistics for electoral wards associated with frequent boundary changes. There are 32,482 LSOAs in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.544W.2/2">Domains within the Indices of Deprivation are independent dimensions of multiple deprivation, each with their own impact on multiple deprivation relative to its importance. In the ID2004 and ID2007 the overall IMD was constructed by combining the individual domain indices using explicit weights, driven by theoretical considerations and research into the issue of weighting carried out by the University of St. Andrews (Dibben et al., 2007<sup>(1)</sup>). The weightings are as follows:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="c.546W.3/1">The Commission does not impose fines on member states in relation to irregularities found during the course of applying management controls to the administration of European Regional Development Funds (ERDF). It does apply Financial Corrections where, in its view, those management controls have not met the high standard they require. These are estimated to remove that element of funds not subject to audit that might have been found to be irregular.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.3/2">The only Financial Correction applied to the 2000-2006 ERDF programmes was imposed on the NW Objective 2 and URBAN programmes for failures in management control (Article 4 of regulation (EC) 438/2001). This amounted to &#8364;30,886,153. The total value of the programmes is &#8364;860,000,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.554W.12/1">Local authorities estimated that 462,000 hereditaments were benefiting from Small Business Rate Relief (SBRR) on December 2008. By applying that figure to the eligibility estimates made for the 2005 rating list it is estimated that around 80 per cent. of eligible hereditaments were claiming SBRR in 2008-09 - see table 1. This estimate suggests that around 20 per cent. or 113,000 of eligible hereditaments are not claiming SBRR. However, relief granted to small businesses has been increasing since SBRR was introduced-from &#163;202 million in 2005-06 to &#163;298 million in 2008-09. This represents a real terms increase of 34 per cent. Furthermore in 2008-09, 92 per cent. of the total relief that would be paid if all those estimated to be eligible were to claim, was actually being paid - see table 2.</p>

PPS3 goes on to say that where local authorities wish to plan for, or agree to, densities below this minimum, this will need to be justified.</p>

There are a number of different approaches to project delivery available for Building Schools for the Future, the preferred approaches being to use a Local Education Partnership (LEP) or to use the Contractor Framework managed by Partnerships for Schools on behalf of the Department for Children, Schools and Families.

	<p pid="c.563W.5/2">Sure Start Children's Centres are becoming a universal service-on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-16">16 March</phrase>, the Prime Minster announced that the Government had met their target for 3,500 Sure Start Children's Centres in England. Children's Centres provide access to integrated services for young children and their families. They contribute to all Every Child Matters outcomes and a number of my Department's Strategic Objectives, in particular: to secure the wellbeing and health of children and young people; achieve world class standards in education; and close the gap in educational achievement for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/3">The National Evaluation of Sure Start, which has been under way since 2001, is comparing the development of children living in areas with children's centres originally established as Sure Start Local Programmes with children living in other areas. Its most recent report published in 2008 provides evidence of improved outcomes for children and families living in early Sure Start areas. Families living in early Sure Start areas used more child and family-related services than those living elsewhere. The reported benefits appeared to apply to all social groups, including those facing most disadvantages.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/4">The National Evaluation showed that children behave better and are more independent if they live in early Sure Start areas. Parents have more positive parenting skills and provide a better home learning environment for their children, helping prepare children to do well at school and make the most of their talents.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/5">The 2008 Foundation Stage Profile results show that 21,000 more five-year-olds are achieving a good level of development across a range of areas of learning and at the same time gaps have narrowed-lowest achieving children and children from disadvantaged areas are starting to catch up. These results suggest that our reforms and investment in the early years-including through Sure Start-are starting to have an impact on all children, and in narrowing gaps.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/6">The latest report from the National Evaluation of Sure Start indicated that young children living in the early Sure Start areas were more likely to have received the recommended immunisations and less likely to have had an accident resulting in injury.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/7">The Department's research on the use of children's centres, carried out by Taylor Nelson Sofres, entailed interviews with parents and carers of young children during 2008. The report in 2009 indicated that 78 per cent. of respondents knew about their local centre, and 92 per cent. who had used their local centre were satisfied with the service they received. The report also showed high levels of satisfaction with individual services provided through children's centres such as child care, nursery education, health, and family and parenting services.</p>

	<p pid="c.564W.5/1">There are a total of 83 designated Sure Start Children's Centres in Merseyside reaching over 66,800 children under five and their families. Reach area defines those children and families with the opportunity to access children's centres. Merseyside is assumed to refer to five local authorities: Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, St. Helen's and Knowsley.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.5/2">The Department's guidance to children's centre leaders and local authorities sets an expectation that they should evaluate the effectiveness of children's centre services.</p>
	<p pid="c.564W.5/3">The National Evaluation of Sure Start started in 2001 and last reported in 2008. Evidence from the last report showed improvements in outcomes for children and families living in areas served by children's centres, including children's behaviour and parents' support for their children's learning at home. The benefits appeared to apply to all social groups, including those facing most disadvantage. Awareness and satisfaction of children's centres is high. The TNS Research Report (2008) shows; 78 per cent. of all respondents knew about their local centre; 74 per cent. were familiar with the term 'Children's Centre'; and levels of satisfaction were very high with 92 per cent. of all users saying they were satisfied (68 per cent. were very satisfied). The Department has recently commissioned an evaluation of the implementation and impact of the full range of children's centres, with a first report expected in late 2010.</p>

On an annual basis this threshold is 64 or more sessions of absence, (authorised or unauthorised) during the year. (On a two term, autumn and spring basis, the threshold is typically 52 sessions). Unauthorised absence is defined as absence without leave from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences, such as lateness, holidays during term time not authorised by the school, absence where reason is not yet established and truancy.</p>

This increase was estimated in the autumn of 2009 using the 2009/10 funded numbers at existing academies and CTCs; the historical rate of increase in academy provision as their sixth forms grow (reflecting their role in increasing participation) to estimate the growth into 2010/11; and the average size of sixth form in maintained schools converting into academies. The major part of the increase between years is actually due to the expected conversion of up to 80 maintained schools into academies in 2010/11. The actual increase in funded places will depend on the allocations process for individual academies, which is still under way.</p>

	<p pid="c.596W.2/1">The available information on PSHE teachers and their qualifications comes from an occasional sample survey which collects data on teachers by subject taught and on their post A-level qualifications. The Secondary Schools Curriculum and Staffing Survey was last carried out in 2007, and found that very few secondary school teachers of PSHE in maintained schools in England held a qualification in the subject (less than 1 per cent.). The survey asks teachers to specify post A-level qualifications (degrees, masters, PGCEs, certificates of education, HNDs, post graduate certificates and diplomas) but does not collect details of teachers Continuing Professional Development or courses that do not result in a formal post A-level qualification.</p>

	<p pid="c.596W.5/1">Schools already receive funding for continuing professional development for the whole school workforce, included within their delegated budgets. However, it is not ring-fenced because we believe school leaders are best placed to determine how funding should be allocated based on the needs of individual teachers, identified and agreed through the performance management process, and in the context of the school's own development and improvement priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.596W.5/2">Revenue funding per individual pupil has increased by &#163;2,410 (83 per cent.) in real terms between 1997-98 and 2009-10, and therefore we expect that many schools will have increased their spending on CPD for teachers and other staff to reflect that.</p>

	<p pid="c.597W.2/1">In 2005/06, the School Census started to collect attendance data at individual pupil level from secondary schools only. This was extended to primary and special schools in 2006/07. The school level information collected before 2005/06 cannot be used to answer this question.</p>

	<p pid="c.597W.2/20">Overall absence in 2007/08 stood at 6.29 per cent. the lowest on record, having fallen for eight of the last 10 years. On average 70,000 more pupils were in school each day in 2007/08 than would be the case if absence rates were still at the level of 1996/97.</p>
	<p pid="c.597W.2/21">Persistent absence in secondary schools accounts for 27.6 per cent. of all overall absence. Schools and local authorities now have to target 'persistent absentees'. During 2008/09 the Department targeted, through National Strategies, 360 secondary schools, with high levels of persistent absence located within 42 local authorities. Collectively, these 360 schools reduced in 2008/09 their persistently absent pupils by 18 per cent. from the end of spring term 2008 to the end of spring term 2009. This shows our policies are working well and recognises the hard work taking place in schools and local authorities.</p>
