	<p pid="a.1630W.2/1">Last year, the Army considered how best to implement the move to larger regiments and the reduction of four infantry battalions. This involved a wide-ranging and detailed consultation exercise, with the infantry being invited to express their views on how the restructuring should be implemented. Colonels of individual regiments, a number of whom are retired officers, were directly involved in the consultation via the Colonels Commandants of the Divisions of Infantry (who count among their number former, as well as current, Service personnel). The latter were responsible for representing the views of their Divisions to Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB); each was invited to address the Committee in person in early December. The Chief of the General Staff also received a small number of letters from retired officers.</p>

I am not aware of any hon. Members having made representations to the ECAB; though a number have, of course, expressed their views to Ministers by the usual means.</p>

	<p pid="a.1633W.9/1">It is not possible to list all pledges made by DFID to international appeals and at donor conferences in each of the last three years without incurring disproportionate cost. The following examples, however, illustrate the UK's very positive record for honouring financial commitments made against specific appeals:</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.9/2" class="indent">At the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo in January 2002, DFID pledged &pound;200 million over financial years 2002&ndash;03 to 2007&ndash;08. DFID is on course to meet and exceed this pledge in the current financial year. At the Berlin Conference on Afghanistan in March 2004, the UK Government increased this pledge to &pound;500 million over the same time period. The latest estimate is that Government Departments have so far disbursed over &pound;303 million of this amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.9/3" class="indent">After the Bam Earthquake on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-26">26 December 2003</phrase>, DFID pledged around &pound;2.15 million following appeals of the United Nations and the International Federation of the Red Cross. All of this money was disbursed, except &pound;450,000 we had committed to the International Federation of the Red Cross; their appeal was sufficiently funded by other contributions they received and they advised that the UK contribution would not be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.9/4" class="indent">At the Madrid Donors' Conference on Iraq in October 2003, the UK committed &pound;544 million towards humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. We have, so far, disbursed &pound;367 million of this amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.9/5" class="indent">The Government have committed &pound;75 million towards the immediate humanitarian response to the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean, of which &pound;40 million has been pledged to the UN Flash Appeal.

	<p pid="a.1634W.5/1">The UK Government have been at the forefront of international efforts to deliver debt relief to the world's poorest countries. It provides substantial debt relief through the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This initiative, launched with the help of significant UK backing in 1999, is delivering many benefits. To date, over US $70 billion in debt relief has been agreed for 27 countries, reducing their debts by around two-thirds on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/2">The UK has committed &pound;2.3 billion of debt relief for eligible countries to cover our obligations under HIPC, including 100 per cent. relief on bilateral UK debts for these countries. It has also pledged an additional $479 million through the multilateral institutions to further support HIPC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/3">Fifteen countries have reached Completion Point of the HIPC Initiative, and have received irrevocable debt reduction from all creditors and 100 per cent. cancellation from the UK and other G7 creditors. Uganda was the first to reach Completion Point in 2000, followed by Bolivia, Mozambique and Tanzania in 2001, Burkina Faso and Mauritania in 2002, Benin, Mali and Guyana in 2003, and Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Nicaragua, Niger and Senegal in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/4">A further six countries have reached Decision Point of the HIPC Initiative, and no longer make any payments to the UK. Of these, Cameroon, Guinea Republic, and Malawi reached Completion Point in 2000, followed by Sierra Leone in 2002, and Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003. These countries will receive substantial reduction from all creditors and 100 per cent. cancellation of UK debt and other G7 creditors' debt when they reach Completion Point. Other countries that have received debt relief under the HIPC Initiative did not owe any money to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/5">The UK has and continues to work with many HIPC countries on a partnership basis. Our country programmes have placed a high priority on assisting these countries as they move through the HIPC process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/6">The UK has already cancelled the aid debts of the poorest countries under its Retrospective Terms Adjustment policy, and in 1997 launched the Commonwealth Debt Initiative to cancel the remaining aid debts of the 'poorer' (lower middle-income) Commonwealth countries committed to poverty reduction. This initiative covers Commonwealth countries with a GNI of less than US $3,115 and small island middle-income Commonwealth countries. Since 1997, 12 Commonwealth countries have benefited from this initiative: Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, Solomon Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tonga, and Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
	<p pid="a.1634W.5/7">In 2004 the UK announced a major new initiative for relief of multilateral debt. From January 2005, the UK will pay its share (10 per cent.) of the debt service owed to the International Development Association (IDA) and African Development Fund on behalf of eligible countries. The initiative already applies to 20 countries (i.e. the 15 post-HIPC countries, as well as Armenia, Mongolia, Nepal, Vietnam, and, in light of the South East Asia Tsunami, Sri Lanka) and more will benefit as they progress through HIPC and strengthen their public expenditure management. The UK is actively working to encourage other countries, in particular our G8 partners, to contribute to the initiative in order to provide full multilateral debt relief.</p>

	<p pid="a.1636W.5/1">DFID is aware of the international increase in electronic barter, and electronic trade exchanges. E-barter and e-payments are private sector initiatives, and international and local businesses will pursue economic opportunities in developing countries as they arise. DFID's activities in international trade policy, and capacity building, have not so far focused on electronic barter, or bilateral exchange mechanisms of this nature. DFID's trade strategy is being finalised at present, but there have been no requests from stakeholders in counterpart governments to include e-barter issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1636W.5/2">DFID's concern on electronic exchanges, including the movement of funds, relate to the access of the poor and unbanked to electronic money and payment mechanisms. Access to electronic payment mechanisms is limited to those with access to bank accounts and credit cards in many cases, which currently excludes the majority of the world's poor. DFID's current focus on banking the unbanked&quot; is consistent with preparing the way for the poor to benefit from electronic payment mechanisms.</p>

It also notes the lack of mental health services and that new approaches to community mental health are needed.

	<p pid="a.1643W.3/3">For the first stage of this process, the Secretary of State will appoint an advisory panel to advise her on the areas in which the new regional casinos should be located. In taking forward its work, it will invite the regional planning bodies in England, whose function outside London is undertaken by the regional chambers, to identify a list of broad locations for regional casinos emerging from the work on their regional spatial strategies. At least 60 per cent. of the members of the regional planning body must be members of a range of authorities in the region, including county councils. Regional planning bodies are also required to seek the advice of county councils when revising regional spatial strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643W.3/4">Under the Gambling Bill, potential casino operators will also be required to obtain a premises licence from their local licensing authority. The Bill provides that in the case of a county in which there are no district councils, the licensing authority is the county council.</p>

In 1999&ndash;2000, the Competition Commission carried out an extensive investigation into supermarkets which concluded that, taking all matters into consideration, the industry was broadly competitive and that, overall, excessive prices were not being charged nor excessive profits earned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.0/3">However, it identified a number of practices engaged in by the larger supermarkets which, because of their buyer power, adversely affected the competitiveness of some of their suppliers. The recommendation of a Code of Practice was accepted and came into force in March 2002. The Office of Fair Trading have reviewed the effectiveness of the code and are currently carrying out an audit of supermarket practice. They hope to complete this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1653W.0/1">Defra uses a variety of sources, including the latest monitoring data and research reports to assess avian biodiversity. A long-standing partnership between the statutory conservation agencies, and data providers such as the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, supports many of the bird monitoring and surveillance schemes currently organised in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/2">The results from different schemes are regularly assessed to provide insight into how bird populations are changing and, where possible, whether recruitment, survival or movement are responsible for the patterns observed. Sources such as the web pages for each species under the heading of Breeding Birds of the Wider Countryside Report (<a href="http://www.bto.org/birdtrends/index.htm">www.bto.org/birdtrends/index.htm</a>) give summaries of their trends and some interpretations of the probable causes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/3">Other key sources that Defra uses in monitoring avian biodiversity include the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/4" class="indent">WeBS Alerts System (<a href="http://www.bto.org/survey/webs/webs-alerts-index.htm">http://www.bto.org/survey/webs/webs-alerts-index.htm</a>)&mdash;providing national and site-level trend information for wintering waterbirds numbers (WeBS is a partnership between BTO, WWT, RSPB and JNCC).</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/5" class="indent">Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (<a href="http://www.bto.org/bbs/index.htm">http://www.bto.org/bbs/index.htm</a>)&mdash;providing breeding bird results and online data submission facility (BBS is a partnership between the BTO, JNCC and RSPB).</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/6" class="indent">Breeding Birds in the Wider Countryside (<a href="http://www.bto.org/birdtrends/">http://www.bto.org/birdtrends/</a>)&mdash;the 'one-stop-shop' for information about the population status of our common terrestrial birds&mdash;updated annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/7" class="indent">Results from the seabird monitoring programme compiled by the JNCC (<a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1550">http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1550</a>), which in 2004 raised concerns about the populations of some of the UK's internationally important seabirds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.0/8">In addition, Defra utilises a wealth of research material on birds, such as the recent review of the effects of climate change on birds (<a href="http://www.bto.org/research/advice/ecc/index.htm">http://www.bto.org/research/advice/ecc/index.htm</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.1653W.6/1">The European Environment Council stated in 1996 the target of limiting global temperature rise to 2oC above pre-industrial levels, requiring stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere at levels below 550ppm. The Environment Council based the target on scientific evidence suggesting that the impacts arising from temperature change greater than 2oC are likely to be severe enough to be classified as dangerous, and therefore to be avoided under the terms of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The target has subsequently been reaffirmed, although the science is continually under review to assess the relevance of the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.1653W.6/2">The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution supported this level of stabilisation in its report Energy&mdash;the Changing Climate, published in June 2000, taking account of the scientific assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Government's Energy White Paper, published in 2003, accepted the findings of the Royal Commission. The 60 per cent. target is consistent with the emissions reductions needed by 2050 from developed countries if carbon dioxide is to be stabilised at levels below 550ppm, taking emissions from developing countries into account. Greater reductions will be needed beyond 2050. The scientific analysis is discussed in the paper The scientific case for setting a long term emissions reduction target published by Defra in 2003 and available on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.1654W.5/1">I assume the hon. Member means to refer to adaptation policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.5/2">The Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change conference convened by the Department from 1&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February</phrase> this year built on the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and concluded that there was greater clarity and reduced uncertainty about the impacts of climate change across a wide range of systems, sectors and societies. In many cases the risks identified were more serious than previously thought. This conference underlined the need for urgent work on climate change adaptation as well as mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.5/3">At the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 10th Conference of the Parties in December 2004, the Department supported negotiations that established the five year Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures. This includes work on the scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change as well as provisions for financial support for adaptation in developing countries through UNFCCC funds to which the UK Government contributes. The Department also supports projects in India, China and Africa to provide underlying climate science and impacts assessments to underpin the development of adaptation strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.5/4">Domestically, a climate change perspective is already incorporated into a number of policy areas, including planning guidance, water resource management plans and health advice. The Department is working with other Government Departments, local authorities and investors to improve awareness and understanding of the implications of climate change and to encourage the development of adaptation strategies. In this context, the Department funds the UK Climate Impacts Programme, which helps organisations to assess their vulnerability to climate change so that they can prepare their own adaptation strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.5/5">The Department will develop an Adaptation Policy Framework during this year to coordinate efforts on adaptation across Government. Public and private sector organisations at local, regional and national levels will be crucial to the implementation of real adaptation action identified under this framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.1656W.8/1">We expect the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy to deliver a number of benefits to English farmers. In particular, the decoupling of subsidy from production means that farmers will be free to farm for what the market wants, rather than what the subsidy regime dictates, helping them to become more market oriented and competitive. Initially, farm incomes in England are expected to increase very slightly, with restructuring of businesses and greater efficiency encouraged by decoupling likely to give rise to further improvements in the longer term, relative to what would have happened in the absence of reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1656W.8/2">In addition, the single payment scheme replaces a number of sectoral schemes so should reduce paperwork and bureaucracy. Initial studies indicate that time spent by farms on relevant form filling will be reduced by 60 per cent. by 2007, when considering the SPS and any additional forms related to entry level stewardship.</p>

	<p pid="a.1657W.6/1">The Government believe that a strongly liberalising outcome to the current round of World Trade Organisation negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda, will benefit UK consumers and producers alike. In pursuing this objective it is mindful of the difficulties some sectors may face and is anxious to ensure that no sector is unfairly put at a competitive disadvantage. We believe there is clear consumer demand in the UK for products meeting high levels of quality, safety and animal welfare. Our Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food is designed to help UK producers to meet this demand. In a WTO context, we continue to press for the introduction of animal welfare provisions which will recognise the additional costs faced by those such as the UK egg industry in complying with high EU animal welfare standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1658W.8/1">The European Environment Agency (EEA) does not operate directly within its member countries. Most of its work is carried out through contractual arrangements with national organisations. The EEA coordinates this activity within the UK and elsewhere mainly through the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), which is a partnership network of over 900 experts and over 300 organisations in 37 countries. Additionally, the EEA has established five European topic centres to support data collection, management and analysis. One of these (for water) is a consortium of institutions headed by WRc PLC, based in the UK. The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities. The UK network within Eionet consists of nine main institutions either contracted to carry out work for the EEA or supplying expertise and data to fulfil national reporting obligations. Coordination of the national network within the UK and liaison with the EEA is done by the National Focal Point (NFP) based in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who also supply the UK representative on the EEA Management Board. The UK NFP also produces a twice yearly newsletter to keep contacts and other interested stakeholders up to date on EEA activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.8/2">In 2004 the EEA published 23 reports, technical reports and briefings on environmental topics in paper form, listed in Table 1. In addition the Agency published a brochure 'Eionet connects', detailing the workings of the network. The EEA makes these reports and many other documents available on its website, including its Annual Reports and Annual Management Plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.1662W.2/1">None of the fish stocks that involve the North Sea are exclusively within the United Kingdom's fisheries limits as they also include parts of other sea areas as well. For these stocks, no separate part of the Total Allowable Catch is related exclusively to the UK waters involved, and as such the question as asked cannot be answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1662W.2/2">To calculate an estimate as requested would require information on the catches by vessels of other member states. Such information is only available in terms of totals for the sea areas involved, and this does not include any breakdown of catches in terms of those caught within the UK 200 mile or median line limit. Such estimates could thus only be made available through requesting such information from the individual member states concerned.</p>

The 10 new member states were not part of the MAGP mechanism, however the Commission is working with them to urgently establish suitable reference levels which will apply retrospectively (from the date of accession). In addition, all potential new entries to the fleet in any member state (including those of the 10) must be offset (in tonnage and power terms) by equivalent withdrawals.</p>

However, industry estimates that 18 million handsets are replaced every year and that in total over the last two years there have been about five million handsets taken by mobile phone recycling and refurbishment companies in the UK. It is further estimated by industry that about 60 per cent. of the handsets taken for recycling and refurbishment have been refurbished and tested in the UK and then sold for re-use abroad, mostly to Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. The remaining 40 per cent. have been sent for materials recycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.1669W.2/1">Since 2001 officials from my Department have been involved in a strategic study of the environmental impact of intermittent storm sewage discharges to the Thames Tideway. The Thames Tideway Strategic Study Group includes members from Thames Water, the Environment Agency, the Greater London Authority and the Office of Water Services (Ofwat). The remit of the study is to identify problems caused, and to propose potential solutions, having regard to costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/2">In June 2004 an interim report from the study was submitted to Defra. I carefully considered the findings and proposals and decided that further investigations were needed into the proposed long-term interceptor tunnel solution, and possible smaller-scale measures, which could provide earlier improvements to the overflow discharges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/3">As a result, the Final Guidance from the my right hon. Friend, Secretary of State, to the Director-General of Ofwat concerning water company price limits from 2005&ndash;10, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-04">4 October 2004</phrase>, indicated further work needed to be done. The Final Determination published by Ofwat on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December 2004</phrase> included provision for funding of further investigations by Thames Water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/4">I expect the Study Group to report back to Ministers on the outcome of the further investigations as soon as possible. At that point Ministers will consider options for an appropriate course of action. Any investment required can then be considered by Thames Water and Ofwat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/5">Thames Water's price limits for 2005&ndash;10 include provision for significant treatment capacity increases at Mogden, Beckton and Crossness sewage works. The capacity increases are expected to reduce the frequency and impact of storm water discharges from these works, although no increases to the storm sewage storage capacity at these works is planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/6">Funding provision has also been made to improve the continuous treated discharge at Riverside sewage works, and to enable Thames Water to continue to deploy two oxygenation vessels to the tidal Thames whenever the Environment Agency considers they are needed to reduce the impact of overflows following rainfall events.</p>
	<p pid="a.1669W.2/7">It is one of Defra's aims to promote sustainable infrastructure, such as sustainable drainage systems in future housing projects, such as the Thames Gateway.</p>

	<p pid="a.1672W.0/1">The supermarkets code of practice seeks to regulate a limited number of practices engaged in by the major supermarkets in their dealings with their direct suppliers, relatively few of whom are farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1672W.0/2">Responsibility for the code rests with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). In February 2004 OFT published a report of its review of the operation of the code. This can be found on the OFT website at: <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press+releases/2004/28-04.htm">www.oft.gov.uk/news/press+releases/2004/28&ndash;04.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1672W.0/3">The review concluded that there was a widespread belief among suppliers that the code was not working properly, but it found no hard evidence for this belief. Given the reluctance of suppliers to provide specific evidence of alleged breaches of the code, the OFT has commissioned a focused audit of the four supermarkets bound by the code. The purpose of the audit is to establish hard facts about compliance with the code as a basis for any further action. The OFT hopes to publish a report of the audit in the next few weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.1678W.5/1">The European Investment Bank's lending decisions are a matter for the Bank and the individual project promoters. The promoters submit potential projects, which are then assessed by the Bank against its lending criteria. Based on this assessment, the Bank's Board of Directors decide whether or not to approve an individual project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678W.5/2">Under its Statute, the European Investment Bank has to ask for an opinion from the Government of the member state in which the project will take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1678W.5/3">European Investment Bank loans do not readily break down into the categories requested. Listed in the following table are loans to UK projects approved in the last five years by the European Investment Bank, broken down by UK region. Details of lending to the UK broken down by sector are available on the EIB website <a href="http://www.eib.org">http://www.eib.org</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1687W.0/1">Formaldehyde is used as an inactivating agent to eliminate poliovirus infectivity. Also, it is used to inactivate diphtheria and tetanus toxins. Gluteraldehyde, a closely related chemical, is used to inactivate acellular pertussis toxins. The quantities present in the new vaccines are low, and less than 0.1 milligrams of formaldehyde and less than 0.02 mg gluteraldehyde per 0.5 millilitre dose. Formaldehyde is present naturally in the human body at levels of about 2.5 micrograms per ml of blood. For a two month old child, this is about 10 times as much as in the amount present in a single dose of vaccine. There is no evidence that these quantities pose a risk to health and there are no plans to remove these substances from vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687W.0/2">None of the current vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme contain mercury. Thiomersal, which releases ethylmercury, has played an important role either as a preservative or in the initial stages of the manufacture of some vaccines for over 60 years. Thiomersal was contained in the diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis (DTwP) and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. However, with the introduction of the new vaccine Pediacel on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase>, the routine childhood immunisation programme no longer includes mercury-containing vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687W.0/3">Foetal bovine serum is an essential growth supplement for the cells used for the propagation of live viruses. The bovine serums used have demonstrated compliance with European Union regulations for minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicines. The serum is used solely in the early stage of the manufacturing process of the vaccine and is reduced to trace amounts during purification and dilution steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687W.0/4">The monkey kidney cell line used for the production of inactivated poliovirus in the new vaccines has been extensively examined for contaminating viruses. The cell line meets the requirements of the World Health Organisation and European Pharmacopoeia. To exclude the risk of extraneous viral contamination each production lot is examined for contaminating viruses during the production process. The viral inactivation process has been fully validated. No monkey kidney cells are present in the final vaccine.</p>

	<p pid="a.1688W.3/2">The returning to dentistry campaign was aimed primarily at people returning from a career break who want to return to work part-time. We have been informed of 65 dentists who have returned to national health service dentistry since April 2004, equating to 37 whole time equivalent dentists. We do not collect information on which of these people returned to work in response to the Keeping In Touch scheme (ongoing) or the returning to dentistry campaign, which began at the end of June 2004.</p>

For 2005&ndash;06, this will increase the funds available for NHS dentistry by over 19 per cent. over the 2003&ndash;04 expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688W.6/3">In 2004&ndash;05, the Department has allocated a total of &pound;50 million to strategic health authorities (SHAs) to support access. Of this sum, &pound;1.5 million has been allocated to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight SHA, to improve access, choice and quality in NHS dentistry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1689W.2/1">We have undertaken a review of the dental primary care workforce in consultation with representatives of the dental profession&mdash;professional bodies, dental academics, as well as the British Dental Association. The National Health Service workforce will be increased by the equivalent of 1,000 dentists by October 2005, allowing up to an extra two million people to be treated nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689W.2/2">By April 2006, primary care trusts (PCTs) will be responsible for securing the provision of primary dental care services, either through a contract with an individual practices or by providing services themselves. PCTs, including those within London, have been drawing up local dentistry action plans setting out how they are using their proportion of the &pound;59 million additional funding we have allocated to improve access to NHS dentistry this year, and their priorities for commissioning in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689W.2/3">Barnet PCT is also preparing for the new dental contract by working to develop an oral health and dental strategy aimed at improving the oral health of the local population, tackling health inequalities and supporting and planning dental services. This will allow the PCT to support and develop primary dental services in a proactive and co-ordinated Way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689W.2/4">There are currently 208 general dental practitioners in Barnet PCT. This includes dentists, orthodontists and vocational trainee dentists providing NHS general dentist services from 87 practices. Barnet PCT has received an allocation in 2004&ndash;05 of &pound;309,000 from the Department to support improved access and quality of dental services and there were 884 additional patient registrations between March and September 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689W.2/5">Barnet PCT also has a dental access centre which is located in the walk-in centre at Edgware Community Hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.1695W.0/1">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended in principle the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine for children, subject to further consideration. Full details can be found at <a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/jcvi/index.htm">http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/jcvi/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.0/2">Since our meeting last year, I have received a total of 10 letters and questions from hon. and right hon. Members on Prevenar.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.0/3">The JCVI has considered information published in the scientific literature on the effectiveness of Prevenar and also considered some currently unpublished surveillance data on the impact of Prevenar used in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.0/4">In addition, phase II clinical trials were carried out with a nine-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to investigate whether the same level of protection could be achieved when the vaccine was given at two, three and four months of age (at the same time as the meningitis C conjugate vaccine) compared with the US primary schedule at two, four and six months of age. The results of this study showed that good protection was achieved using the two, three and four months schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695W.0/5">A two-dose primary immunisation schedule of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine given at two and four months was also compared to the three-dose schedule. The results of the trials supported the use of a two-dose primary immunisation schedule, with each dose separated by two months, in the first four months of life. The data also supported a single dose catch up programme for children aged one year and over.</p>

	<p pid="a.1697W.2/3">In 2000, DfES issued non-statutory guidance to schools on the teaching of SRE. Schools are required to adhere to the principles set out in the guidance, although the exact content of each school's programme&mdash;and the resources used to support its delivery&mdash;are a matter for individual schools, following consultation with governors, parents and students.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697W.2/4">The guidance recommends that SRE is delivered within the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) and should help young people to develop: positive attitudes and values: the personal and social skills needed to manage relationships; and a knowledge and understanding of issues related to their sexual health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1699W.5/1">The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper recognises the importance of ensuring that aviation meets its external costs, including its environmental costs. The UK has made it clear that tackling climate change will be a priority for our presidency of the EU in 2005. We believe that the best way of ensuring that aviation contributes towards the goal of climate stabilisation would be through a well-designed emissions trading regime. The European Commission has recently commissioned a study to look at options for aviation participating in the EU emission trading scheme. We intend to press for the inclusion of intra-EU air services in the EU scheme from 2008, or as soon as possible thereafter, and to make this a priority for our EU presidency. However, we will also continue to explore and discuss options for the use of other economic instruments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1702W.3/1">The objectives of the improvement scheme are to provide safer access to and from the A12 by improving the junction arrangements at Hatfield Peverel and Witham, providing adequate space for traffic to merge and weave, and to reduce congestion by separating the existing local traffic between Hatfield Peverel and Witham from the A12.</p>
	<p pid="a.1702W.3/2">Further to the outcome of the public inquiry into proposals for a link road on the south side of the A12 held in 2003, the Highways Agency has reviewed all viable options. Several are now being looked at in more detail and assessment work should be completed by early summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1705W.5/3">The most recent figures for traffic flows are 94,000 vpd (approx 47,000 in each direction. The Highways Agency does not have current noise levels adjacent to the motorway as these are not monitored.</p>

	<p pid="a.1706W.3/1">Privately owned car parks are private property and charges and conditions for their use are a contractual matter between the owner and users. This is not a matter that is the subject of public legislation concerning fines and it would be for the owner to pursue any unpaid charges as a civil rather than criminal matter. The Secretary of State has no powers to issue guidelines on the management of private car parks. When using a private car park a motorist is effectively agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of its use, which should be displayed clearly.</p>

A dedicated FOI website for the FCO will be going live later this month. Meanwhile, the information can be found on the FOI pages of the main FCO website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).

The European Commission presented these regulations as a comprehensive package designed to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus. These measures would facilitate trade from the northern part of the island and strengthen its economic integration through financial assistance of &euro;259 million.

It concludes that the Government of Sudan, the Arab militias and the rebels are all guilty of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, which may amount to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. The ICI has given the UNSG a list of suspects it believes may have perpetrated these crimes, and recommends that he pass this list to a competent prosecutor.</p>

	<p pid="a.1720W.3/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Burnley since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/2">In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. From the &pound;108 million investment in innovative sports facilities through the Active England programme, Burnley has benefited from an award of &pound;1 million towards the cost of building a new joint health and leisure centre on the former St. Peter's car park site in Burnley town centre. Eight other sports facilities in Burnley have also benefited from Sport England Community Capital awards totalling over &pound;2 million and Burnley football club has received a Football Youth Development award of &pound;289,000 from Sport England. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million, benefiting schools throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 Arts Council England, North West grants increased from &pound;7.6 million to &pound;19.6 million. In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England investment in the north-west will be &pound;28.4 million. Burnley has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including funding for Mid-Pennine Arts, the arts development agency for East Lancashire, which is based in Burnley, and the Burnley Youth Theatre, which develops young people's access to the theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/4">From September 2005, schools in Burnley will be included in the third phase of the Creative Partnerships programme, which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/5">Young people in Burnley also benefit from the Lancashire Youth Music Action Zone, which was launched in 2001 and has so far been awarded two grants totalling &pound;280,000. In April 2005 it will be awarded a further grant of &pound;110,000 from Youth Music. 6,000 young people have taken part in local music projects and events run by Lancashire Youth Music Action Zone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/6">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Burnley will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/7">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/8">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Burnley area. BBC Drama's adaptation of North and South was filmed at Queens Street Mill, Burnley, and a forthcoming drama about Casanova was filmed partly on location at Towneley Hall, Burnley. A new feature film is currently filming in Burnley.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/9">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in Burnley with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/10">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year's Eve to 11 am on New Year's Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/11">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Burnley, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/12">Tourism in Burnley has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the North West Development Agency. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Burnley.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/13">English Heritage has awarded grants worth over &pound;1.3 million to Burnley since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, including six grants totalling over &pound;1 million for the Burnley and Padiham Conservation Area Partnership Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/14">Burnley Library has 49 PCs connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million Lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/15">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community value of public libraries. Lancashire county council has recognised this value, for example by siting at Burnley Library the County's first of 15 SMILE centres for children and young people with learning difficulties, following a DCMS/Wolfson Foundation Reader Development Grant of &pound;178,000 in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720W.3/16">Information from the National Lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Burnley has benefited from over 190 awards totalling over &pound;8.7 million. Of these, 28 awards worth over &pound;2.9 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.1722W.2/16"><sup>(16)</sup> Change of premises during this period</p>
	<p pid="a.1722W.2/17">As the scope of DCMS responsibilities has broadened and staff were recruited or transferred under machinery of government changes, more office space has been required. This has increased cleaning costs. Annual increases in cleaning contracts have been the norm and the above figures reflect cost per square metre cleaning costs in central London.</p>

	<p pid="a.1724W.2/2">The information about prices paid is commercially sensitive. It is not the GAC's practice to publish the prices paid for individual works of art purchased directly from the artist, individual or from a dealer as information of this nature might prejudice the commercial interests both of the GAC in its purchasing activities generally and of the relevant artist, individual or dealer. This practice is consistent with the practice of the national collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.1724W.2/3">However, the prices paid for works of art acquired at auction are published by the auction houses, and in these cases are listed in the document referred to above.</p>
	<p pid="a.1724W.2/4">The Government Art Collection is part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; its acquisition policy is guided by the Advisory Committee on the Government Art Collection which is a non-departmental public body. Members are both independent and ex-officio, including the directors of the National Galleries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1724W.5/1">We estimate that up to 65 per cent. of applications to convert existing licences would also simultaneously apply to make variations, which would include extending licensing hours. Estimates are for England and Wales as a whole and are not made for each police authority area. A recent British Beer and Pub Association survey indicated that none of the 30,500 public houses and bars in England and Wales owned by its members expected to apply to open for 24 hours. The survey indicated the majority of pubs will stay open for no longer than at present during the week, and most will only look for an extra hour or two at the weekend.</p>

	<p pid="a.1725W.5/1">In 1999, DCMS published in a review of efficiency and effectiveness of national museums and galleries a set of potential performance indicators. Working with the National Museums Directors Conference, these performance indicators have been refined to a set of key indicators. The measures include the number of visits by C2DEs to a sponsored museum, the ethnicity of the visitors, and whether visitors are from the UK or overseas. They do not include either the gender of visitors or whether they are disabled, but do separately identify, educational visits, children under 16 and people over 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.1725W.5/2">The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which is sponsored by DCMS, has put in place similar measures to monitor visits to the regional hub museums. Participation by teachers and by individual adult and community groups is also measured, as are educational visits.</p>

	<p pid="a.1741W.2/1">The answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-01-25.276"><i>Official Report</i>, column 276W</phrase> gave projected volumes of passport demand between 2005 and 2014. During this period we anticipate fluctuating demand for both adult new applications and adult renewals. The pattern is different for each demand type and is based on the constraints detailed as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/2">The forecast decline in adult new passport applications is due to the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/3" class="indent">Since 1999, the majority of applications for new passports have been from children, as opposed to adults due to the policy introduced in 1998 that children require their own passports and should no longer be included on parents' passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/4" class="indent">When a child passport holder turns 16 and applies to renew their passport, the application is treated as an adult renewal (since we already have a record of them on our database and have carried out previous identity checks). The absence of children turning 16 as a major source of adult new applications has resulted in the approach of saturation of new passport uptake within the adult population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/5" class="indent">Adult new passport intake has fallen from a peak of 2.2 million applications in 1996 to approximately 820,000 in 2000&ndash;01. It has gradually declined since to only 660,000 applications in 2004. The UKPS estimates that this gradual decline will persist to approximately 540,000 applications by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/6" class="indent">Once saturation has been achieved, the actual new adult passport demand will be susceptible to variations in the number of immigrants who take up British nationality (as a consequence of Government policy) and the number of children that have not held a passport by the age of 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/7">Adult passport renewal volumes are forecast to reflect fluctuations in the volumes of passports that are available to be renewed during the period. Passports that are available to renew include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/8" class="indent">Adult passports issued 10 years previously; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/9" class="indent">Child passports issued five years previously to 11 to 15-year-old children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1741W.2/10">The peak in renewals around 2006 is partly driven by the fact that this is the tenth anniversary of the year when the one year British Visitors' Passport&quot; was abolished and the fifth anniversary of the initial bulge in children passport issues, following the above mentioned policy change.</p>

	<p pid="a.1742W.5/1">Arts can make a significant contribution to the effective and humane operation of the prison regime. Financial support to arts activities for offenders are provided centrally to several national arts organisations. It is recognised that the arts can act as a gateway into education for prisoners who have not been engaged with formal learning.

	<p pid="a.1743W.2/1">The National Offender Management Service is developing a joint prison probation strategy for establishing and maintaining links with employers. These links are focused on sectors that have significant labour shortages nationally and regionally, such as: construction; catering; industrial cleaning; utilities; sports and fitness; driving, and distribution. Opportunities are also being explored in horticulture and information communication technology. These sectors were identified following consultation with the Confederation of British Industry, Jobcentre Plus and Sector Skills Councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743W.2/2">The Prison Service is taking the lead on a cross-Government work programme for engaging with employers which has been agreed by the Employment, Training and Education Sub-Board of the Reducing Re-offending Programme Board. This work programme includes contributions from NOMS, the Probation Service, Jobcentre Plus, DfES and the Learning and Skills Council. Its aim is to build on existing work to encourage employers to contribute to the training of offenders and to commit to the recruitment of those who achieve an agreed level of skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743W.2/3">At a local level, employer links are being developed and maintained by the Heads of Learning and Skills and Resettlement Managers in establishments.

	<p pid="a.1743W.2/4">The Prison Service is currently developing an employer database, holding information on those who are willing and able to offer work to ex-offenders.

However, the need for greater and more effective collaboration across force boundaries is an issue highlighted by the recent police reform White Paper Building Communities, Beating Crime&quot;. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary have been commissioned to examine this issue as part of a wider study into whether the current 43 force structure in England and Wales is the right one to meet today's and tomorrow's policing needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1745W.2/1">International students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. In recognition of this, students seeking to vary or extend their conditions of stay in the UK will be charged a reduced fee for postal applications. Our analysis, which is set out in the recently published Regulatory Impact Assessment, indicates that at the level proposed, the postal charges were unlikely to have a significant impact on the UK's ability to attract and retain international students. However, in order to ensure that remaining to study in the UK remains a competitive option, we have decided that charges should be at a lower rate of &pound;250 for the standard postal service. The higher, premium fee is an optional service which students can take advantage of if they so choose.</p>

In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-31">31 March 1999</phrase>. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2004&ndash;05 will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1748W.5/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department's aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748W.5/2">Currently, the Department has six strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748W.5/3">Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates' courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748W.5/4">The range of the Department's policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to all of that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, statistical information about the Department's activities can be found at: <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm</a> as well as at <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk">www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1748W.5/5">An example of the information available on those sites is data on persistent young offenders. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced between August and October 2004 was 59 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area, which covers the constituency of Pendle. This compares with 124 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area in the 1997 calendar year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1750W.6/1">Court Service policy is that, Courts list rape trials as fixtures and not as floating trials. Arrangements for the presence of complainants, as with all prosecution witnesses, are a matter for the prosecuting solicitor. Complainants in rape trials would be offered a pre-court familiarisation visit. Arrangements can also be made for the complainant to enter the court building through a separate entrance or at a specific time and be met by a member of the court staff. Most venues of the Crown court now have dedicated witness facilities for witnesses to wait without fear of meeting the defendant. The Witness Service, which is present in all criminal courts, offers emotional and practical support for witnesses at court. Subject to judicial discretion, special measures, such as giving evidence by way of a video link or the use of screens in court, would also be available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1760W.0/5" class="indent">Issues associated with the implementation of changes to child support have been documented by the Secretary of State in his reports to Parliament and in evidence that both myself and the Secretary of State have given to the Work and Pensions Select Committee. In essence the computer service provided by EDS has not fully met our expectations and as a result work on hand is higher than forecast.</p>
	<p pid="a.1760W.0/6" class="indent">Where appropriate, where a case cannot be progressed because of a computer defect Agency staff will contact both parties with a view to putting interim payment arrangements in place. Alternatively, parents can calculate for themselves the appropriate amount to be paid by using the self calculator on the Agency's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1760W.0/7" class="indent">We are working closely with EDS to remedy difficulties within their service and are hopeful that the main phase in the remediation process will be complete by the middle of 2005. If parents have lost out financially as a result of error or delay by the Agency then financial redress will be paid to them within the terms of the Departmental Guide to Financial Redress for Maladministration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1762W.11/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Burnley will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, whilst older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 24 per cent. of adults and 5 per cent. of children in North West England are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>

	<p pid="a.1762W.11/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Burnley, the proportion in employment has risen to 77.3 per cent. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the New Deals, with over 1,800 in Burnley alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/21">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,200 families in Burnley.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/22">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/23">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 4,975 pensioners in Burnley are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;39.67 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762W.11/24">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70+ payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills.

	<p pid="a.1770W.2/2">The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training is usually known as Cedefop&quot; from its French title. Its activities in the UK in 2004 focused on two key areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.1770W.2/3" class="indent">(i) Cedefop study visits for vocational training policy makers and practitioners included six visits to the UK by practitioners and policy makers from other EU member states, during 2004, each lasting around five days. 74 visitors from 23 European countries visited England, Scotland and Wales during the period and 57 people from here studied vocational training systems in 21 countries across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) Cedefop's Refer&quot; network provides information on developments in vocational education and training across the European Union. It comprises exchange of information between national consortia in each EU country. The network encourages and facilitates mutual exchanges of information; promotes the creation of partnerships; and provides consortium members with an opportunity to broaden their contacts with other international organisations in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.1775W.4/1">The new deal has been successful in helping more than 1.2 million people into work. Long-term youth unemployment has been virtually eradicated and long-term adult unemployment has fallen by three-quarters since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775W.4/2">New deal for young people has contributed to this success by helping more than half a million young people into work, and over 200,000 long-term unemployed adults have been helped into work through new deal 25 plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775W.4/3">People who return to jobseeker's allowance after finding a job through the new deal have added to their skills and experience, making it easier for them to find a job in the future. In addition, when they re-enter the new deal, people also move into work more quickly than they did the first time they were on the programme because they have recent experience of work and have more jobsearch skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.1780W.3/1">There are a number of programmes, such as Access to Work, Work Preparation and Workstep designed to help disabled people return to work. Jobcentre Plus also offers interviews with a personal adviser to all disabled people making new or repeat claims to qualifying benefits to ensure they are aware of the help and opportunities available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/2">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme, which provides practical advice and support to help disabled people enter or stay in paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/3">Work Preparation is an individually tailored, work-focused programme that enables disabled people to address barriers associated with their disability and prepare for working with the confidence necessary to achieve and sustain their job goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/4">Workstep provides support in jobs for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work but who, with the right support, can work effectively and develop in their job. Longer-term support continues to be available for those who need it and is a major element of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/5">Details of the number of disabled people helped to return to work through Access to Work, Work Preparation and Workstep in each of the last five years are not available at constituency or Jobcentre Plus district level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/6">Disabled people may also receive help through the new deal programme. New deal for disabled people is a voluntary programme which gives customers on qualifying disability or health-related benefits in England, Scotland and Wales access to a network of Job Brokers. Job Brokers work with customers to help them compete in the labour market and support them in finding and keeping a job.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/7">Disabled people may also receive help through other New Deal programmes such as the new deal for young people, new deal 25 plus, new deal 50+, and new deal for lone parents. Over the last five years we estimate that around 430 disabled people have been supported through these new deal programmes in Hendon, of which around 180 have entered work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1780W.3/8">Information relating to people supported through the New Deal for Disabled People is not available at constituency level. The available information for the North London Jobcentre Plus district is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.1782W.5/17">1.Figures are for Great Britain only, in 2004&ndash;05 price terms, using the Gross Domestic Product deflator index, rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million. They assume overnight introduction for all citizens above state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1782W.5/18">2.It is assumed that the rules are changed from 2005&ndash;06 and that basic state pension is increased in line with prices. It is assumed that all individuals above state pension age (65 for men; 60 for women) receive the full category A rate of basic state pension (currently &pound;79.60 per week) regardless of contribution record or marital status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1782W.5/19">3.Gross additional basic state pension costs are estimated by the Government Actuary's Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. basic state pension costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for consequential changes to national insurance fund benefits and non-income-related vote benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1782W.5/20">4.Costs are net of income related benefits and income tax. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated is constant after 2006&ndash;07.</p>
