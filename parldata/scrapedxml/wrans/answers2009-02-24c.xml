	<p pid="c.519W.6/1">Following UK Parliament elections, certain election documents and records, including the marked register currently, must be sent to the relevant sheriff clerk for storage. After one year the records must be destroyed. Following a Scotland Office consultation last year, responsibility for the retention and supply of post-election documents and records for UK Parliament elections is to be transferred from sheriff clerks to returning officers. The amendment is being made through the Political Parties and Elections Bill currently before Parliament. This will bring Scotland more in to line with the arrangements in England and Wales as well as with the existing arrangements for local authority and European Parliament elections in Scotland. The intention is to make similar provision for Scottish Parliament election records through secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.6/2">I am aware that the Scottish Courts Service has commissioned an independent investigation into the particular circumstances of the loss of the marked register from the Glenrothes by-election and it would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment.

	<p pid="c.533W.12/2">The same VAT agreements allow EU member states to introduce reduced rates of VAT of not less than 5 per cent. on a prescribed list of goods and services. All taxes are kept under review, but given the wide range of the UK's zero rates we see little scope within the reduced rate list for the introduction of further VAT reliefs that would benefit disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="c.534W.5/1">There have been no discussions about changing the interpretation of the rules governing the scheme that provides for the recovery of VAT by libraries and museums under the provisions of section 33A of the VAT Act 1994.</p>
	<p pid="c.534W.5/2">The scheme was introduced as a part of the Government's commitment to make access to the main museums and galleries free. Because VAT can be recovered only on purchases relating to taxable business activities (such as charging for admission), abolishing admission charges could have left museums and galleries bearing the cost of irrecoverable VAT. The scheme refunds this VAT, but it is confined to museums and galleries. The National Libraries are included in it, but only in relation to their permanent collections on free public display.</p>

	<p pid="c.544W.5/1">To date, 17 Interim Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006. However, local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>
	<p pid="c.544W.5/2">We are confident that the legislation is beginning to work well. We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.544W.5/3">We are keen for local authorities to make use of EDMOs, where appropriate, and are supporting the independent Empty Homes Agency's new guidance on EDMOs. The guidance, which is currently being tested, is internet based and interactive and will take local authorities through the EDMO process step by step. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning is providing a foreword for the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.544W.5/4">We are also hosting a seminar at which I will address local authorities encouraging them to take action and to share best practice on tackling empty homes, including the use of EDMOs.</p>

Community Land Trusts have the potential to get the weight of the community behind the development of affordable housing and bring forward land for development, particularly in rural areas. We recently published a consultation on the development of a viable Community Land Trust sector and we have received 63 responses from a wide range of stakeholders which we are currently analysing. We will publish the results in the near future.</p>

This is designed to ensure the widest possible access while ensuring that priority goes to those people who are in the greatest housing need.

	<p pid="c.551W.2/1">Last year the Government commissioned an independent review of the private rented sector from Julie Rugg and David Rhodes of the centre for housing policy in the university of York. The review reported in October 2008. As part of its proposals to improve quality and professionalism within the sector, it recommended that letting and managing agents should be subject to mandatory, independently-led regulation. Such a regime would include independent redress for consumers and policing of the sector. We are currently considering the proposals in the review with key stakeholders and will be responding formally later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.568W.2/2">I am very aware of the affordability issues faced by some customers, such as scout groups, following the switch to site area charging for surface water drainage by some companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.2/3">Our view is that while the basic polluter pays principle of the guidance is correct, something is clearly very wrong if faith buildings, community amateur sports clubs and scout huts are facing such big increases in their bills, and where there are such marked variations between what is being charged in different areas, by different companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.2/4">Under the powers enshrined in the Water Industry Act 1999, in 2000 the Government issued statutory guidance to Ofwat on water charging policy. Ofwat's subsequent and more detailed guidance to companies on surface water drainage charging was issued in 2003. Both of these documents addressed the issues surrounding the scale and pace of surface water bill changes for non-domestic, non-business customers and the need for charges to be based only upon the actual area within a property that drains to the public sewer.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.2/5">We understand that the highest price increases are occurring in the United Utilities area, and that United Utilities now proposes to set its surface water drainage charges for 2009-10 at 2007-08 levels for customers such as faith buildings, community amateur sports clubs and scout huts (i.e. at levels prior to the introduction of site area charging). This is a very welcome step forward although we will continue to monitor this issue and engage further with Ofwat if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="c.575W.6/2"><i> </i>The East Riding Council (indicating that Yorkshire Water would be a partner) submitted a bid for funding from DEFRA in October 2008. This followed a call for expressions of interest from local authorities to undertake early implementation of surface water drainage improvements. The purpose of the work was to test new guidance for producing surface water management plans and report back findings by mid 2009. DEFRA received more than 30 applications although the trial was restricted to six owing to the proposed level of support and advice that would be available during the trial. The East Riding proposal was of good quality but in this instance was not selected to be part of this first phase. The successful bids were announced by the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-18">18 December 2008</phrase> during the Government's Response to Sir Michael Pitt's Review&mdash;Lessons Learned from the 2007 Floods.

The Summer Diversity Internship programme is open to undergraduates and graduates from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and those with disabilities. The programme seeks to provide high calibre ethnic minority and disabled undergraduates/graduates with a six-nine weeks work placement within Government Departments across Whitehall.

	<p pid="c.578W.5/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number of people who were registered to vote in parliamentary elections as a percentage of the estimated resident population aged 18 and over for each parliamentary constituency in England Wales for 2007. This is the latest year for which estimates of the usually resident population are available by parliamentary constituency. The table has been placed in the House of Commons library.</p>
	<p pid="c.578W.5/5" class="indent">These figures should not be interpreted as the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote. The population eligible to vote in parliamentary elections includes British Citizens resident overseas and excludes foreign citizens (from outside the British Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland) resident within England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.578W.5/6" class="indent">In addition, figures for the registered electorate may be inflated because people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses) and electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or died. This may lead to percentages of over one hundred per cent and can affect the comparability of figures across parliamentary constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.602W.2/1">The majority of Exchequer funding provided in support of these activities is channelled to local authorities via settlements from the Department for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/2">DCMS works with other Departments and our network of sponsored bodies (NDPBs) to set overarching objectives relating to the sectors for which we have policy responsibility in Government. Delivery of these objectives is usually the responsibility of the lead NDPB who take forward delivery of our strategic priorities at a national and local level. As follows are examples of work taken forward in the South West region:</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/3" class="italic"> Sporting Activity</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/4" class="italic"> Free Swimming</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/5">Local authorities across the South West have signed up to the Government's initiative to offer free swimming to both those aged 16 and under and over 60. The local authorities that have opted in to offer the scheme to both age groups have also received a share of a &pound;10 million capital fund to spend on modernising or improving pool provision in time for the start of the two-year scheme in 2009. Those local authorities that will offer free swimming to both age groups also stand to benefit from a further &pound;25 million capital challenge fund in both 2009-10 and 2010-11 to spend on improving pool provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/6" class="italic"> 5 Hours of Sport</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/7">DCMS works with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to support the delivery of the PE and Sport Strategy for Young People (PESSYP) which will increase the quality and quantity of school and community based sport on offer and give young people more opportunities to be active. It builds on the success of the 2003 PE, School Sport and Club Links Strategy (PESSCL) for five-16 year olds.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/8">The new 5 hour offer will deliver further Government commitments announced by the Prime Minister in 2007 and set out in PSA 22 which promises to 'deliver a successful Olympic games and Paralympic games with a sustainable legacy and get more children and young people taking part in high quality PE and sport'.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/9">The strategy will be delivered through the two key delivery bodies, Sport England&mdash;with its focus on sport in the community, and the Youth Sport Trust&mdash;with its network of School Sport Partnerships and focus on PE and sport in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/10">Sport England (who fund projects from Exchequer and lottery funding), have identified two projects for which funding has been provided specifically for built facilities for young people in the South West:</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/11" class="indent">&pound;136,500 granted over the last three years to Swim Torquay Limited for extension of facilities which is heavily used for swimming lessons for young people.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/12" class="indent">Falmouth Youth Club was awarded &pound;300,000 for the Dracaena Centre in 2007 (this was a CIF award).</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/13">Young people will also benefit from funding targeted to the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/14">In addition to built facilities, in the last five years (April 2003-to date) Sport England has invested in 216 projects in the South West. Projects which would benefit young people specifically include:</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/15" class="indent">Sport Unlimited This project is in its second year and it constitutes Sport England's part of the 5 hour sport offer.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/16" class="indent">The Youth Sport Trust is delivering two hours of sport via PE in schools plus one hour of extra curricular sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/17" class="indent">The Step into Sport programme which amounts to &pound;770,000 focuses on young people aged 14 to 19 started three years ago. It provides opportunities for young people to become involved in sports leadership and volunteering encouraging them to continue this into later life</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/18" class="italic"> Cultural Activity</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/19" class="italic"> Participation in the Arts</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/20">Many cultural initiatives in the South West Region are supported by Arts Council England including DAISI (Devon Arts in Schools Initiative) and The Wren Music Trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/21" class="italic"> Find Your Talent</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/22">In February 2008 the Government announced the new &pound;25 million Find Your Talent (FYT) pathfinder programme to trial different ways of delivering a five hour cultural offer for children and young people from 0-19.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/23">North Somerset is one of ten Find Your Talent pathfinder areas launched in September 2008. The pathfinders, working in partnership with schools and local and national organisations over three years, will provide opportunities for children and young people to have a range of high quality arts and cultural experiences in and out of school.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/24" class="italic"> Awards For All</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.2/25">&quot;Awards For All&quot; is a Lottery Grants scheme for local communities. Managed by the Big Lottery Fund, in the last five years, 5381 awards in the South West, the majority of these projects will affect young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.605W.0/2">It is a key principle of Government funding of adult learning that there is a shared responsibility on the part of learners, employers and the Government to contribute towards the costs of learning. The Skills Strategy White Paper 21st Century Skills: Realising our Potential (published in July 2003) set out our intention that employers and learners should contribute towards the cost of their course, in light of the returns they derive from learning. Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances (March 2006) confirmed our intention to increase learner and/or employer fee contributions to 50 per cent. by 2010-11 for those not eligible for free provision. Lord Leitch's Review of Skills (December 2006) reaffirmed the importance for a shared responsibility to invest in skills with employers and learners asked to contribute most where they see the greatest private returns. We are therefore increasing private fee contributions for both employers and learners from 42.5 per cent. in 2008-09, to 47.5 per cent. for 2009-10 and 50 per cent. for 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.605W.0/3">Apprenticeship funding rates for adults therefore are lower than rates for young people aged 16-18, with employers expected to contribute to the total cost of an adult apprenticeship framework. Employer contributions may be in cash to the training provider or in kind through supporting the delivery of the training activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.605W.3/1">Apprenticeship frameworks are designed to meet both the skills needs of employers and individuals. Like employment in general there is no presumption that they be full-time or part-time although custom and practice will differ between employers and across sectors. Any employee should be able to apply for an apprenticeship irrespective of whether they work full or part-time and we are making special efforts to break down gender or race stereotypes in apprenticeships. Our aim is to encourage the take-up of apprenticeships. The Government are committed to rebuilding apprenticeships. Since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007-08. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&mdash;up from 27 per cent. in 1997. A remarkable achievement.</p>

	<p pid="c.610W.2/1">In order to improve the identification of those learners who progress from an apprenticeship into higher education we are exploring the possibility of linking administrative datasets. The early work looks promising and the Higher Education Funding Council for England is currently testing the methodology to ensure it is robust. The findings are expected to be published in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.610W.2/2">In World Class Apprenticeships we set out the Government's intention that every apprenticeship framework has a clear pathway to higher education and this will be a requirement of our revised Apprenticeships Blueprint when it is published in 2009. This will ensure every apprentice knows there is a clear pathway to higher education if they want it.</p>

	<p pid="c.617W.2/1">This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for part-time undergraduate students in 2000. In 2004/05 we introduced a package comprising two non-repayable, income assessed grants; a grant towards fee costs and a course grant to pay towards study costs such as travel and books. In 2006/07 we created the most generous package so far for part-time students in England, increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and raising the income threshold for receiving support by more than the rate of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.617W.2/2">In the current academic year the maximum course grant is &pound;255 and the maximum fee grant is &pound;1,180. Single students with an annual household income of below &pound;16,090 may be eligible for full fee and course grants; those with incomes up to &pound;26,825 may be eligible for partial grants. These income thresholds are increased by &pound;2,000 if the student has one dependent child, by &pound;1,000 for each subsequent dependent child and by a further &pound;2,000 if the student lives with a partner. Additional discretionary support, via the Access to Learning Fund, administered by the higher education institutions, may also be available to help part-time undergraduates with their fees, child care and other costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.622W.0/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have therefore asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/4" class="indent">and</p>

	<p pid="c.622W.0/7" class="indent">How many served orders for the confiscation of (a) a driving licence and (b) travel documents resulted in the full payment of child support arrears in (i) 2006-07 and (ii) 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/8" class="indent">The entire system of child maintenance, including the Child Support Agency, is, as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-01">1 November 2008</phrase>, the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/9" class="indent">Information on the number of enforcement actions undertaken by the Agency is published in table 21 of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics and is available in the House of Commons Library and online at:</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/10" class="indent"><a href="http://www.childmaintenance.org/publications/statistics.html">http://www.childmaintenance.org/publications/statistics.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/11" class="indent">Currently, under Section 39A of the Child Support Act 1991, the Commission may apply to a magistrates' court or sheriff to impose a sanction in cases where other legal enforcement action has failed. It is up to the courts to decide which, if either, of the available sanctions is most appropriate. Those sanctions are driving licence disqualification or a committal sentence; the courts do not currently have the power to confiscate travel documents in child support cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/12" class="indent">In the last two years the courts issued 505 suspended or full committal sentences, and 19 suspended or full driving licence disqualifications in relation to child maintenance cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/13" class="indent">The Commission may make representations to the court as to which sanction it considers appropriate in the circumstances but we do not keep a record of how many times, or in what proportion of cases, this right has been exercised. The courts issued four full driving licence disqualifications in 2006-07 and five in 2007-08. Of these, 66% showed an improvement in the debt figure owed, with two cases paying off the full amount owed to their children.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/14" class="indent">Sections 27 to 30 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 enables the Commission to make an application to the court for a specific sanction. The available sanctions will be driving licence disqualification, imprisonment, passport confiscation or imposition of a curfew, the latter two of which will be new powers for the courts. These powers are not yet commenced.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/15" class="indent">The Welfare Reform Bill 2009 contains powers to enable the Commission, without application to the court, to disqualify non-resident parents who wilfully refuse to maintain their children from holding or obtaining a passport or driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.622W.0/16" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.630W.2/1">Our reforms contain a number of measures to boost the value of pension saving:</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/2">From 2012, employers will be required to automatically enrol their workers into a qualifying workplace pension arrangement and contribute to that arrangement. Employer contributions will be a minimum of percent on a band of earnings, and around 1 per cent. in the form of tax relief. Overall contributions, including the employee contribution, will be at least 8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/3">The new personal accounts scheme will be one of the pension schemes available to employers to meet the employer duty from 2012, and is designed to be low cost to minimise the impact of charges on the value of saving.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/4">A more generous and simpler state pension to provide a solid foundation for saving. By 2050 just 30 per cent. of pensioner households are projected to be entitled to pension credit, compared to 45 per cent. today.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/5">There are also measures to boost the value of saving within the existing pension and benefits system:</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/6">Pension rules allow up to 25 per cent. of a pension pot to be taken as a tax free lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/7">In addition the 'trivial commutation' rules allow individuals with small pension funds to take the full amount as a lump sum (&pound;16,500 in aggregate private pension saving in 2008-09, of which up to 25 per cent. may be tax free).</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/8">The savings credit was designed to reward those who have made small savings for their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/9">Capital disregards in the benefit system mean that small amounts of capital do not affect benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/10">Some working age benefits and tax credits discount some or all of the value of pension contributions when calculating benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/11">Those people who see a lower impact on their net retirement income due to interactions with the benefit system will still get the full value of their private savings, and many will also be receiving generous top ups from the state to boost their total income, due to their needs in retirement. This could be due to circumstances such as needing extra support, for example due to disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.630W.2/12">The report of the Savings Incentive Work programme &quot;Saving for retirement: Implications of pensions reforms on financial incentives to save for retirement showed&quot; that, on standard assumptions, over 95 per cent. of savers modelled could expect to get more than &pound;1 plus inflation back for each &pound;1 contributed, and a large majority could expect double that. It also showed that for a range of case studies the reforms improve the payback on saving. The report also explored a number of measures proposed by stakeholders to further improve returns which suggested that the Government have struck a good balance between the competing objectives of affordability, incentivising saving and alleviating poverty&mdash;on balance the package does not need to be changed.</p>

	<p pid="c.631W.8/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps he is taking to ensure that his Department has the capacity to provide effective and timely assistance and support to those made redundant. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/4" class="indent">The support we can provide begins as soon as a business announces redundancies and involves help for the employer and employees. In Scotland this help is delivered by way of the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative. PACE is a Scottish Government initiative, in which Jobcentre Plus is an active participant, which provides a framework for a consistent and co-ordinated public sector response to dealing with companies in difficulty, including redundancy. The key aim of PACE is to help people who have been made redundant into alternative employment or training, as quickly as possible. This help can include workplace briefings by Jobcentre staff, skills assessments, and advice on how to look for a new job.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/5" class="indent">Support is also available through the Rapid Response Service (RRS) administered across Great Britain by Jobcentre Plus. This provides access to funding to help individuals made redundant where no other help exists or is insufficient to get them back into work. The budget for this service was doubled this year, from &pound;3m to &pound;6m, and will be doubled again next year to &pound;12m. This will enable us to deal more effectively with situations involving 20 or more redundancies, or where there is a group of smaller redundancies in one locality. Although this funding has not yet been called upon in Scotland, any bid will be administered in line with the local PACE Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/6" class="indent">We have also announced that more people who are made redundant will get help through Programme Centres. These provide people with different kinds of help such as assistance with CV-writing and gaining jobsearch skills. Access to Programme Centres was previously restricted to those furthest from the labour market. Advisers will now have the discretion to allow any customers to access this help as soon as they become unemployed. This will be useful for people who have been in work for a long time and have no recent experience of job hunting.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/7" class="indent">We are also extending Local Employment Partnerships to provide help for newly redundant people. Local Employment Partnerships are simple deals we have agreed with employers, from local to national level, whereby we prepare customers for work and employers provide guaranteed job interviews, work placements, mentoring and work trials. Through these, Jobcentre Plus is already working successfully with over 13,000 employers, and has helped over 100,000 people into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.631W.8/8" class="indent">To enable Jobcentres to manage the increase in register sizes, we are recruiting additional staff and are looking at extending office opening hours and how we might use partner premises where appropriate to create the additional capacity we need to help the increasing number of customer who need our help. We have also expanded our Rapid Reclaim arrangements. These enable customers who were in receipt of benefit at any time in the 26 weeks immediately prior to redundancy, to quickly access benefits via an abbreviated new claims process.</p>

	<p pid="c.632W.5/1">Winter fuel payments were designed to give older people reassurance that they could turn up their heating in winter. Eligibility is not based on income. The winter fuel payment for 2008-09 is &pound;250 for households with someone aged 60-79, and &pound;400 for households with someone aged 80 and over.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.5/2">Information based on the Department's Family Resources Survey, shows that in 2006-07, winter fuel payments were made to less than 50,000 households with net income before housing costs of more than &pound;100,000 per annum. Higher up the income distribution, clearly, the number is less than that. 2006-07 is the latest year for which information is available.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.5/3">50,000 households represents less than 0.5 per cent. of all households where at least one adult is aged 60 and over.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.5/4">Net income before housing costs is gross income less income tax payments, national insurance contributions, contributions to occupational and private pension schemes, local taxes, maintenance and child support payments, and parental contributions to children living away from home.</p>

	<p pid="c.640W.0/1">The &pound;150 million is revenue, not capital expenditure. It is being made available as part of primary care trusts' (PCTs) overall general allocations. These are increasing by 5.5 per cent. in each of 2009-10 and 2010-11, a total increase of &pound;8.6 billion over the two years of which the dementia funding is part. PCTs have flexibility over the use of these resources in line with the operating framework. Total expenditure in each year on dementia, and on each of the 17 objectives that are not central budgets, will therefore be determined by the national health service locally. National estimates of expenditure on each objective are set out in the impact assessment published on the Department's website alongside the National Dementia Strategy. This information is contained with &quot;Living well with dementia: A National Dementia Strategy&quot;, which has already been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.645W.2/1">The supply of counterfeit medicines is a growing problem worldwide and one which the Government are taking very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has therefore introduced a 24-hour anti-counterfeiting hotline in November 2007 as part of the Agency's Anti-Counterfeiting strategy. The Strategy was launched in November 2007. It sets out a three year plan and contains a commitment to audit activities carried out under it. A review is planned for the end of the three year period. The cost of the designated telephone is currently &pound;65.00 per quarter, which is met from the Agency's overall telecommunications budget and it is manned by MHRA personnel as part of their normal duties. To date, 64 reports have been received (via e-mail, website, telephone and letter). All were responded to and none have proved to be counterfeit.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/3">The MHRA has analysed in detail all of the cases of counterfeit medicines which have been discovered in the United Kingdom supply chain. This study has also contributed to the European Commission's proposals to tackle counterfeit medicines which are currently subject to public consultation. It has also contributed to a comprehensive review of the UK supply chain which has also been released for public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/4">A 'watch list' of counterfeit medicines and medical devices which may appear in the supply chain has been established and circulated to Customs, police and other regulators to be aware of, and to deal with, potential threats.</p>
	<p pid="c.645W.2/5">The number of instances that counterfeit medicines and Devices have been found in the supply chain in each of the last four years is in the following table.

	<p pid="c.646W.2/1">We take the issue of eating disorders, especially among young people, seriously. This is why the Department asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to produce clinical guidelines on core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders. This guidance was published in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/2">The Department currently supports the eating disorder charity, beat, through direct funding worth &pound;131,000 over three years, 2006-09. Since 2001-02, real terms investment in adult mental health services increased by 44 per cent., almost &pound;1.7 billion, putting in place the services and staff needed to transform mental health services. The national health service (NHS) spent &pound;5.53 billion on these services in 2007-08, with real term investment increasing by 3.74 per cent. between 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.2/3">We have thus made very substantial resources available to the NHS from which to provide treatments and services for the population.

	<p pid="c.658W.2/1">The way to reduce the number of confirmed cases of measles recorded each year is to increase the number of children vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/2">In addition to the routine MMR vaccination programme, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-06">6 August 2008</phrase> the Department launched a national MMR vaccine catch-up campaign. The aim of the campaign is to immunise all children between one and 18 years of age who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated with MMR vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/3">To support the campaign the Department has provided extra funding to primary care trusts (PCTs) with PCTs outside London having their funding limits increased by &pound;30,000 and London PCTs' funding limits increased by &pound;60,000. The Department has also sourced additional supplies of vaccine, provided technical support to general practitioners to help them identify children who have not received the MMR vaccine and provided additional online reports to PCTs to help them monitor the effectiveness of their catch-up programmes. The Department has also sent all general practitioner surgeries new measles leaflets and posters.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/4">The Department has held meetings with both strategic health authorities and PCT immunisation co-ordinators, regional directors of public health and directors of performance to emphasise the importance of reducing measles cases through improving vaccination uptake.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/5">A public relations campaign will be rolled out from March 2009. Key messages will include how serious and infectious measles is and how it's never too late to have the MMR vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/6">Middlesbrough PCT, Redcar and Cleveland PCT and Stockton-on Tees Teaching PCT are implementing the national MMR vaccine catch-up campaign and have three key strategies:</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/7" class="indent">a local service level agreement with GPs to help with the catch-up plan especially with pre-school age children;</p>
	<p pid="c.658W.2/8" class="indent">sending a letter to all parents of school leavers offering an MMR vaccine booster for those who have not received two MMR vaccine doses; and</p>

However, the panel has undertaken 235 assessments since its first meeting and eight products have demonstrated sufficient basic research and development, validation and recent in use evaluations to enable the RRP to make a recommendation that the product should be made available to NHS bodies. Of these eight products, seven have been made available to the NHS by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency via the NHS Supply Chain and will be contributing to their programmes to reduce infections.</p>

The effectiveness of local screening programmes against these standards is being assessed as part of the external quality assurance process being undertaken by the NSP.

	<p pid="c.671W.5/2">The likely effects of the reclassification of cannabis to a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 have been evaluated in the regulatory impact assessment (IA)<sup>(1)</sup> produced to accompany the Parliamentary Order. This IA is an internal evaluation. Based on existing evidence the IA makes a series of key assumptions; it forecasts potential liabilities associated with the legislative and the proposed enforcement change. The IA is published at:</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/4">Estimates of unit costs applied to criminal justice system outcomes within the IA were obtained from the agencies involved and from relevant research where available. As a result, volumes and figures stated are broad estimates; they do not necessarily reflect actual costs in any particular situation or point in time.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/5">In respect of prison places, the IA identifies potential additional prison places for cannabis possession offences; it estimates a potential increase in prison place requirement of 21 places over five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/6">For supply, trafficking and production offences the impact assessment clearly sets out the reasons why an assessment on prison places was not made. This includes the fact that the maximum sentence prescribed by the 1971 Act will remain unchanged at 14 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/7">The overall estimate change in the enforcement liability associated with cannabis possession including arrest and prosecution can be found in Table 6 of the IA as set out.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/8" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Please note the Impact Assessment was re laid on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-16">16 January 2009</phrase>. A drafting error in the IA was identified on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-19">19 December 2008</phrase>. Following this, the impact assessment was withdrawn from the OPSI website on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-23">23 December 2009</phrase>. A full review of the IA was undertaken and the revised document is now in the public domain. For a full explanation of the drafting error please see response to PQ 24583. The error identified in the document does not affect the estimates of costs of arrest, prosecution or prison numbers.</p>

	<p pid="c.672W.2/2">In respect of the movement to Class B alone on the numbers using cannabis there is no claim that this alone will act as a deterrent on cannabis use.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/3">The Impact Assessment (IA)<sup>(1)</sup> on the reclassification of cannabis looks at reclassification alongside a step change in enforcement response and the potential change in the estimated population of cannabis users. Based on existing evidence the IA makes a series of key assumptions; it forecasts potential liabilities and volumes associated with the legislative and proposed enforcement response. These assumptions include a reduction in the population of serious cannabis users following recent British Crime Survey trends, desistence from users 'getting older' and increased desistence of users is assumed following more robust contact with police and the Criminal Justice System. The full IA can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/5">Over the seven year period examined in the impact assessment there is estimated to be a desistance of an additional 23,000 serious cannabis users under reclassification alongside the associated enforcement response. The estimated difference in total population of serious cannabis users under reclassification and the enforcement response is set out in Table 8 of the aforementioned impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/6">There has been no assessment of how cannabis reclassification will impact on those using other illegal drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/7" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> In preparing the response to this PQ a minor drafting error was identified in the Impact Assessment (IA). As a consequence the IA was withdrawn from the public domain. A revised version was re laid in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-16">16 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/8">The erroneous sentence in the IA stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Over the entire period, the change option is estimated to result in the desistence of 72,000 additional serious cannabis users&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.2/10">and appeared on page 15 of the original IA as found on the OPSI website. The cited figure of 72,000 was incorrectly quoted as a result of misinterpretation of the figures in Table 8 as relating to annual levels of desistence, rather than the cumulative level of desistance. The correct figure of 23,000 additionally desisting over seven years was cited in the preceding sentence and contained in Table 8 of the IA. Following the identification of this error a full review of all figures and tabular information contained in the IA has been conducted. There have been no errors in the original calculations contained within the IA.</p>

	<p pid="c.682W.2/2">There has been no recent assessment of this Act by the Home Department. This Government are determined to curb the use of dogs by criminals and, in particular, gangs. Our proposed amendments to the Police and Crime Bill 2009 will build on existing legislation, to further target the use of dogs by gangs. The amendment will give the courts power to stop an individual taking charge of a dog in a public place if it is being used to support gang related activity.</p>

	<p pid="c.683W.5/1">The information requested is not currently available. For the period up until 2007-08, the Home Office collected data on recorded offences of 'Causing death by dangerous or careless driving (including while under the influence of drink or drugs)'. However, it has not been possible to determine from the information held centrally which, if any, of these offences were committed while the offender was under the influence.</p>
	<p pid="c.683W.5/2">However, with effect from April 2008, offences of 'Causing death by careless driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol' have been collected separately and figures for 2008-09 will be available in July 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.686W.6/1">All police forces across England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police, have now implemented the national Policing Pledge. This means that every citizen in Enfield and throughout England and Wales has a clear minimum standard of what to expect from their police force. The focus for forces now is ensuring that local pledges are in place and that the public know what they are entitled to.</p>
	<p pid="c.686W.6/2">The Policing Green Paper made it clear that the Home Office will now adopt a more strategic role, strengthening grassroots accountability and enhancing the role of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in providing public assurance about the quality of policing in all forces. Locally, if the public do not feel the commitments embodied in the pledge are being met they can raise this with the police themselves or through their police authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.686W.9/2">ExISS release 1 consists of the police to magistrates court and the police to Crown Prosecution Service links.</p>
	<p pid="c.686W.9/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-18">18 February 2009</phrase>, out of 43 police forces, 39 had completed deployment of the police to magistrates court link. 34 police forces had completed deployment of the police to Crown Prosecution Service link with a further eight police forces partially deployed. One police force was in the advanced stages of deployment planning for both release 1 links. No Police forces are piloting the link, all are either deployed or in the deployment phase.</p>
	<p pid="c.686W.9/4">In the year 2007-08 there was a capital spend of &pound;9 million on the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.686W.9/5">It should be noted that in addition to the programme to deploy ExISS release 1 to the 43 'Home Office' police forces, a further project is under way to deploy to the British Transport police, managed by the British Transport police themselves, with a target for deployment later in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.686W.9/6">The primary aim of ExISS release 1 is to ensure that the links between the applications are being fully utilised in order for police, magistrates court and CPS staff to reduce the amount of re-keying of information that has already been entered into a partner organisation's application. By the end of the financial year 2008-09 it is expected that 40 police forces will have fully deployed ExISS release 1, and by the end of calendar 2009 all 43 forces will have fully deployed ExISS release 1. By the end of calendar 2008 ExISS release 1 had delivered &pound;2.7 million of benefit to the agencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.689W.8/1">The Government are committed to increasing the conviction rate for rape. In order to do so the Government have focussed their effort on improving the response of the criminal justice system by implementing changes to the ways in which the Police and Crown Prosecution Service investigate and prosecute such cases and by providing special measures in court to ensure that victims are confident to come forward and report an offence, and see it through to conviction. The Government have also provided support for victims through services such as sexual assault referral centres and independent sexual violence advisors.</p>
	<p pid="c.689W.8/2">There are a number of different ways of calculating conviction rates. In respect of cases that are prosecuted as rape that result in a conviction for rape, the conviction rate in 2007 was 37 per cent. This is the highest it has been for 10 years.</p>

The objective is to provide the police with equipment that meets their needs, is safe, affordable and is proportionate to the safety threat posed by a vehicle that has refused to stop and is under police pursuit. We are aware too of the developing potential of remote vehicle slowdown and stopping technology and are keeping in touch with progress to ensure we are able to benefit from advances in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.696W.5/1">The Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) is currently undertaking a range of work to identify new means of stopping vehicles. Investigation of existing products has found no commercial off-the-shelf solution that would meet police needs. HOSDB is therefore now looking at different technologies that might be used. The objective is to provide the police with equipment that meets their needs, is safe, affordable and is proportionate to the safety threat posed by a vehicle that has refused to stop and is under police pursuit. We are aware too of the developing potential of remote vehicle slowdown and stopping technology and are keeping in touch with progress to ensure we are able to benefit from advances in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.717W.5/1">The Government have taken a number of steps to help Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) promote and increase electoral registration rates. Section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 (EA Act) placed a new duty on EROs to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries and inspecting records that an ERO is permitted to inspect. These records are those held by the local authority and include council tax, land and property, housing benefit and educational where available. It is for each ERO to decide on the best steps to use in conjunction with their local knowledge to ensure that requirements for making contact with persons and maintaining the register are complied with.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.5/2">Section 69 of the EA Act imposes a duty on EROs to promote local participation within their areas. Assisting EROs in meeting this obligation falls within the Electoral Commission's remit, as does issuing guidance to electoral registration officers more generally.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.5/3">The Act also included a provision for the Electoral Commission to introduce a new performance standards framework for electoral services. The Commission published a final set of performance standards for Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain in July 2008, details of which have been laid before the House. The Commission will publish the results of EROs' self-assessments against these standards in spring 2009.</p>

We are working with stakeholders and the British Banker's Association to ensure that both domestic violence victims and their advisers are more fully informed of their options. We will be considering this issue when developing our delivery plan in the future and recently produced a leaflet including some advice on this issue. From the information received on domestic violence cases we are not able to identify the financial abuse aspect.</p>

	<p pid="c.719W.5/1">To date, no formal estimate has been made of the cost of the HM Prison Everthorpe Veterans in Custody Support programme. However, we are aware that a prison officer in the establishment devotes about one day a week to attend to referrals and a further three hours a month to facilitate a veterans' forum. It will not be possible to estimate the cost of a national roll-out of this programme, until we have some reliable research to better determine the numbers of veterans offending. We anticipate that this information will be available to us by September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.719W.5/2">Prison In-Reach, a cross departmental non-executive working group, led by the Ministry of Defence, brings together representation from The National Offender Management Service and public sector prisons in addition to third sector partners. This provides an excellent opportunity for collaborative working and the pooling of resources. The Department of Health is a key partner of both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Justice in the provision of health care services to veterans and the general offender population. Once the research is available, it may be possible to discuss the delivery of specific interventions to meet the needs of veterans.</p>
	<p pid="c.719W.5/3">The group is currently preparing a guidance pack for prison officers, working with veterans. This will provide a useful resource for prisons wishing to develop a service similar to that delivered at Everthorpe. We anticipate that this will be ready for distribution and introduction during the second quarter of this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.722W.5/1">The requirement for an offender assessment (OAsys) to be completed within eight weeks of arrival applies to offenders received into an establishment following sentencing. As Gartree is a training prison, all prisoners received there should already have an up to date OASys assessment in place. However, Gartree did develop a backlog of OASys assessments that had not been reviewed for over three years and a recovery plan has been put in place to address. It is expected that annual reviews of all outstanding OASys plans will be completed by June 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.730W.0/3">Direct marketing does not just refer to selling products or services to individuals, it includes the promotional activities of charities as well.

	<p pid="c.737W.2/2">The Department has made no assessment of the effect of the registration with the telephone preference scheme (TPS) on the ability of charities to raise funds through telephone appeals. The effectiveness of the TPS is a matter for the Information Commissioner's Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.2/3">The ability for consumers to register their wish not to be contacted unnecessarily by Direct Marketeers, whether they be charities or commercial organisations, is a key benefit of the telephone preference system.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.2/4">Before they register with the TPS, consumers should bear in mind that they may miss out on calls from companies and charities that they would be happy to hear from. It is important to make sure that permission is given in advance to those companies and charities so they can continue to contact potential donors via the telephone.</p>

	<p pid="c.742W.6/1">In keeping with good procurement practice most consultancy engagements placed by DCSF are based on a requirement for the delivery of outcomes or outputs, and not for the number of people employed. Our management information system reflects this and records the numbers and values of contracts or engagements, rather than individual consultants. We are, therefore, unable to answer the question in the way it has been asked. However, the total number of live consultancy engagements in DCSF at the end of November 2008 was 329 and at the end of November 2007 was 202. The equivalent figure for the Department for Education and Skills at the end of November 2006 was 146. Figures were not kept centrally for previous years. The increase partly reflects the need for additional input from external experts on our delivery programmes (such as academies and contact point) and partly better recording as new systems we introduced in 2006-07 bedded in.</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.6/1">It is important that individuals, parents and schools should all take responsibility for improvements in educational standards. In fact this is essential if the nation is to get a proper return on the large and growing investment in education in the early years and in schools, colleges and universities. Education standards have risen greatly over the past decade, thanks in part to the partnership between the education system and the young people whom it exists to support, but there is more to do. The Children's Plan set out the Government's commitment to put children and young people, their families and their communities at the heart of everything we do. Partnership with parents is a unifying theme of the Children's Plan, and the chapter entitled &quot;Excellence and Equity&quot; sets out further steps the Government are taking to extend and deepen this partnership, and to respond to the views of pupils themselves. It is also vital to raise educational aspirations at both family and community level, and the recently announced cross-Government project &quot;Inspiring Communities&quot; is one example of how this vision is being carried forward.</p>

However the School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.765W.0/1">The Department has provided guidance to schools on the recruitment of supply teachers in the document 'Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education'. The guidance sets out the responsibilities of those recruiting supply teachers and the best practices, some underpinned by legislation, to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/2">The framework for the Department's Quality Mark award for employment agencies and local authorities also sets out recruitment, selection and vetting standards for supply teachers. Schools are encouraged to use holders of the Quality Mark who have demonstrated they meet these standards in managing and providing supply teachers to schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/3">Temporary Workers in Education (TWiE) is a project of the Department's Educational Procurement Centre (EPC). The EPC has a remit to work across the schools sector promoting and supporting sustainable procurement practices and effective contract management with the goal of achieving cost and administrative savings for schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/4">The TWiE project aims to provide London schools with a reliable, safe and accessible online method of procuring temporary education workers. It is currently working collaboratively with the London Borough of Hounslow which is in a tender process on behalf of the London Contracts and Supplies Group. Companies have been invited to tender to act as a neutral vendor which will provide an online system through which London Boroughs and London schools can procure temporary workers including supply teachers. It is expected that a contract will be awarded in June 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/5">OGC staff sit on the Project Board which oversees the TWiE project, and have done so since September 2008. OGC and DCSF have also had discussions in relation to the project, including regular monthly meetings between senior responsible staff. There have also been a number of discussions agreeing the role of OGC staff on the Project Board, and a meeting to review models for the project. Some of these discussions also touched on the provision of supply teachers and other staff outside London.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.0/6">In addition to OGC's role on the TWiE Project Board, another member of OGC staff has been advising the London Contracts and Supplies Group on the current tender process and as part of this work has had some contact with Department staff, particularly on the issue of pricing models.</p>

	<p pid="c.772W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice collects data for England and Wales on prosecutions brought against parents under the Education Act 1996 for the offence under s444(1) for failing to secure their child's regular attendance at school; and for prosecutions under s444(1A), the aggravated offence of knowing that their child is failing to attend school regularly. It is possible, because of the way courts record data that some data are collected under the more general heading of various offences under the Education Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="c.772W.2/2">The information on the number of people by gender sentenced and given fines or immediate custodial sentences is detailed in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.772W.2/3">The Department also separately collects for England data on penalty notices issued to parents for failing to ensure that their child attends school regularly and for the school academic year 2006/07 this was 14,625. The Department does not collect data by gender type.</p>
