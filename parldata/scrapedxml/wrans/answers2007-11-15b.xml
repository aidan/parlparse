The Department's walking and cycling team currently consists of six people. Another team, the sustainable travel team, promotes all forms of sustainable travel which clearly has a strong emphasis on walking and cycling. This includes the Department for Transport (DFT) half of the DFT/Department for Children, Schools and Families School Travel Project: 14,000 schools have school travel plans and for &quot;Walking to school&quot; grants in which 3,200 primary schools are receiving grants for increasing walking through walking buses and other walking initiatives. In addition, colleagues in other teams including traffic management, road safety and communications for example also work on policies to encourage and promote walking and cycling. We also created an independent body, Cycling England, in 2005 which has a budget of &pound;10 million per annum to promote cycling.</p>

	<p pid="b.335W.9/2">The Department currently anticipates total receipts from the sale of assets of approximately &pound;9 million in 2007-08; &pound;36 million in 2008-09; &pound;10 million in 2009-10 and &pound;5 million in 2010-11. The disposals planned for the latter three years will form part of the Department's asset management strategy to be published in December this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.335W.9/3">Estimates of sale proceeds are subject to fluctuations in the property market and cannot be guaranteed, nor can it be stated with certainty exactly when these sales will take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.335W.9/4">It should also be noted that the figures apply to the wider DEFRA network, not just to the core Department. The assets in question are surplus or under-utilised land and property. The largest anticipated sale is that of DEFRA-owned land and buildings at Guildford, and we expect this to account for approximately one third of the income from asset disposals over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.339W.2/2">The Animal Welfare Act 2006 protects the welfare of animals on-farm and makes it an offence to cause suffering to any animal. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 lay down requirements in respect of general welfare, inspection, housing and feeding for all farm animals. The welfare of ducks is also covered by a specific code of recommendations. Flock-keepers are required by law to have access to and be familiar with this code, which encourages high standards of husbandry.</p>
	<p pid="b.339W.2/3">Animal Health (AH) enforces the welfare legislation and carries out regular inspections at farm premises to check the welfare of livestock. AH also investigates all complaints and allegations about poor welfare on-farm.</p>
	<p pid="b.339W.2/4">DEFRA has funded a three-year research project to assess the welfare of ducks. The work involved a comprehensive assessment of different commercial systems currently in use in this country. The project is due to report back soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.341W.0/1">International commercial trade in ivory has been prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1989 and this is actively enforced by HM Revenue and Customs at our borders and the police service internally. The illegal import or export of ivory can result in a large fine and/or several years imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.341W.0/2">The UK fully supports efforts undertaken by the CITES community to improve enforcement activity in source and destination markets as well as working to eradicate illegal trade within the UK itself. The UK financially supports two key CITES programmes related to ivory trade: the Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) and the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) programmes. These enable the international community to monitor poaching and illegal trade levels so resources can be targeted where they are most needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.341W.3/1">My Department, via the Market Transformation Programme, works with the lighting industry, the Energy Saving Trust and Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes to promote energy efficient lighting which is both commercially viable and acceptable to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.341W.3/2">While the upfront cost of energy efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) has been historically greater than inefficient tungsten filament bulbs, research carried out by the Energy Saving Trust suggests that, because they last up to 10 times longer and use significantly less energy to generate equivalent light levels, efficient bulbs can save householders up to &pound;60 over the lifetime of a bulb in reduced energy bills and replacement costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.341W.3/3">New products are continually being developed and the retail prices of efficient bulbs have fallen significantly in recent years. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Commitment scheme has helped to drive down the price of energy efficient products, including CFLs, as energy suppliers work with retailers and manufacturers to offer good quality and affordable products to customers. Under the scheme, approximately 82 million CFLs have been distributed or sold to consumers since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.341W.3/4">We are not aware of any particular safety issues associated with high efficiency light bulbs such as CFLs. CFLs do contain a small amount of mercury, typically 3-4 mg, and should be disposed of responsibly. The European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive places a responsibility on manufacturers to ensure that these bulbs are disposed of in a safe manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.342W.6/2">In July 2003 the Government signed an agreement with the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), which represents about 900 members involved in the direct mail and promotions industry, to raise recycling levels of direct mail to 30 per cent. by the end of 2005, 55 per cent. by the end of 2009 and 70 per cent. by the end of 2013.

	<p pid="b.342W.6/3">The DMA also agreed to further develop the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) to improve the targeting of addressed direct mail, provide greater flexibility for both consumers and producers, and increase awareness of the service among householders.

	<p pid="b.342W.6/4">Together with the Waste and Resources Action programme (WRAP), the DMA is working to develop a recycle logo to be printed on all direct mail. The DMA is also working with WRAP in conjunction with the paper mills and adhesive manufacturers to minimise the use of materials that may contaminate the recycling process.</p>
	<p pid="b.342W.6/5">The Waste Strategy for England 2007 commits the Government to working with the DMA to develop an opt-out system for unaddressed direct mail, and to exploring with them whether an opt-in system would be an appropriate mechanism to further reduce unnecessary direct mail.

	<p pid="b.343W.2/1">My Department has not made any assessment of the merits of using plastic milk bottles or re-usable glass bottles. Assessing the most sustainable option for packaging containers will depend on a number of factors, including transport and the re-use or recycling of materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is currently undertaking a life-cycle analysis of milk packaging, which will look at the various different glass and plastic options and will include consideration of the impact of returnable packaging systems. This project is scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2008. WRAP is also working with local authorities and manufacturers to increase recycling of both glass and plastic bottles.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/3">A deposit system for bottles has an obvious appeal to the public, however there would be difficulties in implementing such a system in the UK. In 2004, DEFRA commissioned a project to evaluate whether a deposit system could provide additional value, in combination with the current packaging waste recovery system established in the UK, to achieve wider EC Directive targets. This work took into account existing deposit and return schemes in Europe, the USA and Canada.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/4">The report's conclusion was that a deposit scheme may not achieve our overall environmental goals since such systems favour packaging formats that do not necessarily deliver environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/5">A deposit scheme would be extremely expensive when compared to the existing UK packaging system, which uses a market mechanism and a tradable &quot;packaging waste recovery note&quot; (PRN). This system is reputedly the most cost-effective system in Europe for implementing the Packaging Directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.344W.3/1">We see no substantial differences between the two concepts. Indeed, we agree with the concept within the Integrated Maritime Policy that marine spatial planning is a key tool for improving the sustainable development and restoration of marine and coastal areas. As we set out in the proposals in the Marine Bill White Paper in March 2007, marine planning will clarify our marine objectives and priorities for the future, and direct decision-makers and users towards more efficient, sustainable use and protection of our marine resources.</p>

The Advertising Standards Authority acted on OFT's recommendation and amended its guidance in April 2005 but did not require advertisers to include the face value of tickets in adverts.

In drawing up the review, NDA has extended the scope beyond the narrowest definition of 'durability of stores' in order to address the concerns expressed on storage of non-immobilised wastes in various legacy facilities. The NDA will not include a detailed assessment of the security arrangements for waste storage facilities because this is the responsibility of the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) (part of the Nuclear Directorate of the HSE), the Government regulator for security in the civil nuclear industry.</p>

Security arrangements are kept under constant review by OCNS who liaise with NDA and site licensees to ensure compliance with NISR 03.</p>

Prosecutors must be ready to assist the court by placing before it relevant information concerning the impact of the offending on the victim and the community, as well as relevant statutory provisions, sentencing guidelines and case law.

	<p pid="b.379W.0/2">The Department issued guidance in 1994 Health Service Guidance (94) 27: &quot;Guidance on the discharge of mentally disordered people and their continued care in the community&quot; which details action to be taken following mental health in-patient deaths.

	<p pid="b.379W.0/6">MHAC reviews the deaths of patients who have died from non-natural causes to establish whether good practice, as defined in the Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice, has been followed and whether lessons for future practice and policy need to be learned. This review may include sending a Commissioner to the inquest which considers the circumstances of the death or arranging a visit to the hospital to consider the issues arising.</p>

	<p pid="b.381W.8/1">The percentage of national health service revenue spending spent on pay is forecast to increase in 2008-09. This is a national estimate and it is a proportion of the overall growing NHS revenue funding, therefore overall expenditure on NHS staff is expected to increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.381W.8/2">Revenue allocations are made to primary care trusts to provide them with funding to deliver local and national priorities. It is not possible to provide an estimate of the change in number of NHS staff employed, as workforce planning, and therefore setting the number of staff required to deliver services, is a matter for local NHS organisations to deal with. They are best placed to assess the health needs of their local health community and will recruit the appropriate number of staff to meet those needs. The Department sees workforce planning as a priority and closely monitors strategic health authority local delivery plans to ensure they will deliver the activity required within the finance envelope. As part of that approach, the Department also expects SHAs to be satisfied that local workforce plans are sufficiently robust to deliver the planned activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.389W.2/1">The British Council's policy on conducting Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks complies fully with UK law. The British Council has in place a comprehensive child protection policy which all British Council staff and outside consultants or contractors whose responsibilities involve access to children and young people must adhere to.</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/2" class="italic"> Its employees</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/3">Since the early 1990s, the British Council has asked all newly recruited teachers to sign a child declaration form indicating that they have had no history or background relating to child protection issues that would preclude them from the British Council's employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/4">From January 2005, the British Council has implemented CRB checks on all staff working in the UK whose jobs involve contact with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/5">From January 2007, the British Council has run CRB checks on all teachers recruited in the UK, through its headquarters to work overseas. Where teachers are recruited directly by overseas teaching centres, similar checks are run when available in the relevant country. This is available in six of the 48 countries in which the British Council have teaching centres. Where no CRB equivalent exists, the British Council will seek information on individuals in their references.</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/6">In addition, the British Council is conducting retrospective CRB checks on all teachers where these have not already been carried out. The British Council expects to complete checks on all teachers:</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/7" class="indent">that have lived or worked in the UK by the end of 2007;</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/8" class="indent">that have lived or worked in countries with CRB equivalents by mid-2008; and</p>
	<p pid="b.389W.2/9" class="indent">in the remaining 42 countries where no CRB equivalent exists, where at all possible, by the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.389W.2/11">Employment agencies providing the British Council with temporary staff, and companies providing support services, must confirm that their own recruitment practices are consistent with the British Council's child protection policy. For consultants and other temporary staff working in posts designated as having direct contact with children and young people, the British Council must receive confirmation that the individuals concerned have undergone due checks.</p>

	<p pid="b.390W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has carried out all the reasonable adjustments to our UK premises identified as required to meet the needs of the disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995. However, given that the many individual adjustments formed part of general programmes of building upkeep, and that 19 years has elapsed since the Act was passed, the level of detail requested by the hon. Member could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/2">The whole of the FCO's UK estate has been assessed for ease of accessibility in relation to disabled users. The assessments recommended a number of reasonable adjustments, which have been carried out over the last 12 years. These include voice announcements and Braille/raised buttons in lifts, converting goods elevators to passenger use, installing wheelchair lifts, providing portable ramps, stairwalkers and evacuation chairs. We have moved kitchen equipment and lowered counter tops in tea points where necessary and provided vibrating pagers linked to fire alarm systems or security guards. Other examples of changes made include specialist furniture, new signage, replacement floor surfaces for easier access and contrasting strips on step edges, and adjusting working hours of disabled staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.5/3">Overseas, posts are aware of the principles of the DDA and have been instructed to review disabled access, make information about accessibility available, and where possible make improvements. Where access is limited, posts seek alternative ways of providing accessible services.</p>

At the recent meeting of the financial action task force, the international standard setting body currently chaired by the UK, FATF members issued a public statement to express concerns that Iran represents a significant vulnerability within the international financial system. FATF members are advising their financial institutions to take the risk arising from deficiencies in Iran's AML/CTF regime into account for enhanced due diligence. The Treasury has issued guidance to this effect to financial institutions in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.403W.5/5" class="indent">The data for analysing migrant workers come from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment.

The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas, for the reasons which are set out in the table footnotes.

	<p pid="b.416W.5/1">Lord Dearing's Languages Review, published in March 2007, identified the need to resolve the widely held perception that languages GCSEs are harder than other subjects. The review recognised that there are other reasons pupils do not perform as well in languages as in other subjects, such as the quality of teaching and the motivation of the pupil.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.5/2">As a result, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), as the regulator with responsibility for standards in GCSE, is looking at the issue. In the course of this work the QCA has received several representations from schools about grade boundaries for modern foreign languages. It is currently finalising its response.</p>

No funding was allocated for 2007-08; funding for 2011-12 will be allocated under the next spending review. Decisions on the targeting of this funding will be taken by local authorities in consultation with their schools forums, but our strong expectation is that it will be directed to those schools with the most disadvantaged pupil intakes.</p>

Staying in learning not only supports young people to get a better job; it also improves their life chances and equips them with the personal and social skills they need to thrive throughout their lives. That is why we have embarked on a series of education and training reforms which will ensure that there are suitable progression routes for all young people, and published on <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase> plans for raising the participation age to 18.</p>

	<p pid="b.426W.0/1">Financial support for learning will be restructured when the compulsory participation age is raised to 18, and we are looking at a variety of methods to ensure that this is done in the most effective way to ensure young people are enabled to participate. In doing this we will build on the foundation of the educational maintenance allowance, and the views we gathered in the public consultation on &quot;supporting young people to achieve.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.427W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">5 November</phrase> we published a document setting out how our proposals to raise the participation age have developed since the consultation, and which aspects require legislation. This explains that enforcement action will be a last resort, but if a young person is not participating once suitable learning provision has been identified for them and appropriate support provided, the local authority will be able to issue an attendance notice, specifying precisely the provision the young person must attend and where and when they must do this. We estimate that very few young people will reach the stage of being issued with an attendance notice, as the focus of the policy will be on ensuring that there is an engaging and worthwhile learning programme for every young person and the right support, including financial support, to help them stay in learning and succeed. The estimates and projections in the initial regulatory impact assessment (which has been placed in the Library of the House) are being revised to reflect developments in the policy before being published in the impact assessment that will accompany the Education and Skills Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.8/1">Under the spend plus methodology for distribution of Dedicated Schools Grant, there is no single set of area cost adjustment factors for schools by local authority in England. The level of Dedicated Schools Grant per pupil for each local authority will depend on the level of their spending on schools in 2005-06, which was closely related to the formula for Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) for that year. The Schools FSS formula contained the area cost adjustment factors set out as follows in column 1. We have in 2006-07 and 2007-08 distributed funding for a number of ministerial priorities including the greater personalisation of learning, more practical learning options for 14-16 pupils, work force reform and the increased entitlement to early years provision from 33 to 38 weeks, all of which used the ACA factors set out below in column 2. Funding for the ministerial priorities in the school funding settlement for 2008-09 to 2010-11, which I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase> also used the ACA factors in column 2.</p>

	<p pid="b.438W.6/1">The statutory duty for setting annual pupil performance targets rests with the Governing Body of every maintained school. Each school agrees their targets with the School Improvement Partner (SIP) who provides support and challenge to ensure the targets reflect the best ambition for the progress of all the pupils in the school. We expect local authorities (LAs) to review the targets for all of their schools to ensure that they are setting goals which are both ambitious and achievable. In the case of schools judged to be in need of special measures by Ofsted, the LA and the SIP will be closely involved in the annual target setting process with the head teacher and the Governing Body to ensure that the targets will support the school's improvement plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.438W.6/2">The number of schools in special measures has fallen from 515 in 1997/08 to 246 at the end of the summer term this year. As part of the comprehensive spending review we have announced new targets for schools and LAs which will place a focus on improving progression throughout the education system and further reduce failure and underperformance.</p>

	<p pid="b.442W.2/1">There are four long-established teacher pay areas, covering Inner London, Outer London, the &quot;Fringe&quot; (extending to certain parts of the Home Counties), and the rest of England and Wales (as defined in the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document). Each of the four pay areas has, since 2004, had its own pay scales. The differences between pay scales broadly relate to differing economic circumstances linked to labour market conditions and cost of living pressures. Changes to the actual pay scales follow recommendations made by the independent School Teachers' Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.2/2">Any other differences that may arise between average pay rates in local authorities will be down to differences in the composition of the teaching work force, and, in the case of the limited number of authorities which have both 'Fringe' and England and Wales pay areas within their borders, the composition of the pay areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.449W.0/1">A consortium of the Medical Research Council, Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust and University College London have submitted a bid to purchase a site adjacent to the British Library. Detailed proposals for the move and its cost will be developed once the outcome of this bid is known, including, if necessary, alternative proposals for the future use of the National Temperance hospital site. MRC envisages that the relocation of the National Institute of Medical Research might be completed by 2013.</p>
