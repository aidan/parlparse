	<p pid=".583W.2/1">I have had informal discussions with ministerial colleagues in the Netherlands on matters relating to coastal defences. However, officials from the two countries meet on a regular basis. Recognising the benefits to be gained by shared experiences both in respect of policy and engineering solutions, officials from the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and England agreed to meet on an annual basis more than five years ago and so formed the North Sea Coastal Managers Group. The English delegation is led by my Chief Engineer.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/2">Meetings of the group have proved an invaluable forum for the exchange of information on the subjects raised by the right hon. Member. However it is important to recognise that there are differences between the Netherlands and England both in terms of the geography of the coastline and the proportion of the economic wealth at risk of flooding.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.3/1">The Government recognise the benefits of local food and is keen to encourage a flourishing local food sector. In recognition of this, provision is available under the England rural development programme for   supporting activities such as the establishment of farmers' markets, the development of regional and local   branding of foodstuffs and the formation of collaborative groups to market quality products. For example, within the last year we awarded &pound;100,256 to the National Association of Farmers' Markets to raise the profile of farmers' markets across England and to increase public awareness of them.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.3/2">Defra has also helped finance a number of local sourcing workshops organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) designed to bring together supermarkets and small local producers to explore how barriers to local sourcing can be overcome. Following on from this, we helped fund the Business in The Community (BiTC) and IGD guide for small businesses looking to work with large food retailers and food service companies&mdash;&quot;Local Sourcing&mdash;Opening the Door for Small Business&quot;. In addition to this, our Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative is designed to encourage public sector bodies to procure their food in a manner that promotes sustainable development and to encourage more small and local businesses to compete to supply them with food.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.3/3">This work will be complemented at a regional level through the regional plans that each regional development agency (RDA) is drawing up to help deliver the Government Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. Although the nature of this support will be determined according to regional priorities, issues to be addressed will include the production and supply of locally sourced food by encouraging food hubs and shared facilities and the linking of local producers with local retailers and tourist businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.0/1">Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting substance and its production and supply are controlled under the Montreal Protocol. Its production is due to be phased out in developed countries after 31 December 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.0/2">However, in recognition that alternatives for all existing methyl bromide uses may not be available by 2005 a provision was made under Decision IX/6 of the Montreal Protocol, where critical use exemptions can be requested when there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives. The UK's view is that methyl bromide is being phased out by the Protocol and should not be phased back in by excessive critical uses.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.0/3">Several Parties to the Protocol, including the UK, submitted applications for critical use exemptions and a package of exemptions was agreed at an Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol in Montreal (24&ndash;26 March 2004) Some further applications, including from the UK, will be due for decision by the Parties at a meeting of the Parties in November.</p>

The seminar provided an opportunity for policy officials from across Europe to discuss how we can improve the collection and sharing of information on those who pose a risk of sexual harm.

	<p pid=".592W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 19 April 2004</p>
	<p pid=".592W.3/2">Part 5 of the Police Act 1997, under which the Criminal Records Bureau operates, does not empower the Bureau to search databases outside the United Kingdom for conviction and other information shown on its Disclosures. Inquiries made about arrangements in force in other countries have shown both how varied they are and how complex it would be to introduce widespread arrangements to link up with records in a range of other countries. The Bureau has taken the initiative by establishing its overseas information service for the benefit of employers who are considering recruiting staff from outside the UK. The service provides detailed information about the arrangements for checks in other countries, including where such information can be obtained, how to go about obtaining a check, the cost and the time taken. At present, this arrangement covers 16 countries, including nine in Europe, and work is in hand to extend the service to a further 15 countries, including 14 in Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.2/2" class="indent">The Probation Service was heading for a forecast overspend in 2003&ndash;04 and it was necessary to reduce spending to bring expenditure back into line with budget.</p>

It was therefore considered desirable to smooth the annual settlements by moving 2 per cent. from 2003&ndash;04 to 2004&ndash;05, therefore making the relative financial settlements 9 per cent. and 5.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.2/4">28 areas have managed to carry forward the full 2 per cent. or more into their budget for 2004&ndash;05. A further eight areas have managed partial carry forwards.</p>

Since then funding for Afghanistan has become available from other parts of Whitehall, with the Global Conflict Prevention Pool establishing a programme for Afghanistan (&pound;55 million over three years), and the formulation of a counter narcotics strategy with specific funding (&pound;70 million over three years). Inclusion of these figures in the pledge announced allows them to now be properly recognised by the Afghan Government.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.0/1">DFID has been involved in the projects, or programmes described in a number of ways. Firstly by contributing the UK's share of the European Commission budget allocated to the projects cited and secondly, wherever possible through in-country consultation with the EC office over project and programme design. DFID also attend the relevant Management Committees that approved the EC strategies and programmes under which the projects were or are being implemented. Finally, in some cases, DFID has formed part of a multi-donor in-country programme management committee that oversaw or is overseeing project implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.0/2">Some of the projects cited are ongoing and an assessment will only be possible once they have been completed. The EC, through its results-orientated management system and strengthened evaluation systems, is best placed to carry out such an assessment. DFID is however often involved in, or consulted on, such assessments. Assessments carried out to date have identified both significant success and areas for improvement. DFID continues to work with the European Commission to improve the quality and impact of its development assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.0/3">I refer the Hon. Member for Buckingham to the information available in the '2003 Annual Report from the European Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the EC Development Policy and the Implementation of External Assistance 2002' and the European Commission's website <a href="http://europa.eu.int">http://europa.eu.int</a> for further details about individual programmes and projects. I will place copies of the report in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".603W.2/1">The Department for International Development has a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nation's World Food Programme in Uganda. The current MoU has been in place since December 2002.

WFP is the UN agency mandated to provide food aid in such a large-scale emergency, and the only agency on the ground equipped with the necessary staff, resources and experience necessary to respond adequately to the situation. DFID closely monitors the WFP's performance through the reports it submits directly to DFID, the monthly Humanitarian Updates it provides to the donor community as a whole, and regular discussions with WFP representatives in Kampala.</p>

The Attorney wrote to ministerial colleagues asking for views and any issues which may impact upon his decision whether or not it was in the public interest to consent to the prosecution of Katharine Gun for an offence under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act. The correspondence falls within exemptions 1, 2 and 4 of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The correspondence includes information whose disclosure would harm national security and was a consultation between Ministers where their advice and views were sought. The Attorney-General considers that to disclose this would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion. He has concluded the harm likely to arise from disclosure of this material outweighs the public interest in making the information available. In    addition the correspondence related to legal proceedings and therefore comes under exemption 4.</p>

The current national average waiting time for a test is 9.8 weeks. The current waiting time for a practical car driving test at the Mill Hill test centre is 17 weeks.

	<p pid=".607W.5/13">In Northern Ireland, the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency has a target average waiting time for a practical car driving test of 23 days. The average waiting time across test centres in Northern Ireland is currently 27 days.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.5/14">In order to reduce the current high waiting times for tests in Great Britain to the six week waiting time target, the Driving Standards Agency recruited 283 new driving examiners in the last financial year and plans to recruit a further 330 in the coming year. An extra 7.30 am test slot is being added to weekday programmes in some test centres and tests are now offered on Sundays. The agency is deploying as many driving examiners as possible from Scotland to the London and South East area to tackle the problem of high waiting times there. In the context of its Business Plan for 2004&ndash;05, I have set the agency a target to bring national waiting times down to six weeks by January 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.8/1">In his budget statement my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a number of steps to help small businesses including an increase of capital allowances to 50 per cent. and raising VAT registration threshold to 58 per cent. all of which helps Small Businesses in Tynemouth.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/2">The Chancellor also announced that the Employer Training Pilot, which has been running in Tyne and Wear for the last year, would be rolled out and made available to businesses throughout the North East. This helps businesses to improve the skills of their workforce by providing training tailored to their needs. The programme not only offers free tailored advice on training but also the unique prospect of subsidised training and wage compensation to employers for the time workers are away from work&mdash;traditionally one of the biggest barriers to training in smaller companies.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/3">The core funding provided to Business Link Tyne and Wear, has provided a foundation on which the Business Link has sourced additional funding projected at &pound;14.5 million for the benefit of businesses in Tyne and Wear, for the year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/4">Around &pound;3.5 million of this is available, including a   subsidy of up to 50 per cent. for management development training and upskilling the workforce to SME's across Tyne and Wear.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/5">Businesses can also benefit from a range of Workforce Development services to help SMEs achieve the Investors in People Standard and develop their workforce. One business based in Tynemouth, received 50 per cent. subsidy to help them towards paying their Investors in People assessment fees. SMEs with between 5 and 49 employees are also eligible for additional funding towards helping them to reach the standard. In the past, financial subsidies towards consultancy costs were only available to businesses over 36 months old, and these were restricted to specific projects. Now, a subsidy of up to 45 per cent. can be accessed by businesses of any age or size towards the cost of any business related consultancy. Around &pound;4 million is available for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/6">Local SMEs can also benefit from up to 45 per cent. funding towards the cost of exhibition space and the design build and dressing of a stand. In conjunction with this, Business Link Tyne and Wear have held three 'Meet the Buyer' events over the last two years as a means for local SMEs to meet buyers from both within and beyond the region, offering SME's the opportunity to become integral cogs in supply chains.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/7">Business Link Tyne and Wear has helped a number of businesses in the Tynemouth area to access financial assistance, one such SME received a 45 per cent. subsidy to help them to develop their website. They also went on to receive an additional 50 per cent. subsidy towards the cost of training, to enable staff to update the website once developed.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/8">In addition, a restaurant in Tynemouth, received 50 per cent. funding towards Management Development training, they also had consultancy assistance, to help them to develop a marketing strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/9">Unsecured loans of up to &pound;15,000 are also available to businesses in the North East that have had difficulty accessing finance elsewhere. Businesses must work with a mentor and repay the loan within five years.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/10">Over the past 15 months Business Link has received 660 inquiries from existing businesses and people looking to start their own business in North Tyneside. Of these, 43 existing, and 22 start up inquiries were from Tynemouth. 670 businesses have started in North Tyneside. They are offered an independent service of one-to-one 'counselling' and given intensive advice on business planning, marketing and finance.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/11">An adviser from Business Link and North Tyneside Council's advisers work side by side at North Tyneside Council's premises in North Shields to provide advice and support to businesses based in North Tyneside, including Tynemouth. In addition, an adviser is based in Tynemouth and North Tyneside Colleges two days a week to offer advice to anyone that is looking to start or already running a business.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/12">Tyne and Wear Small Business Fund, through the Regional Development Agency's Single Programme Funding, (Managed by Tyne and Wear Development Company and delivered by each local authority) is a 50 per cent. Capital Equipment Grant of between &pound;500 and &pound;2,500 available to pre-start and new businesses&mdash;up to 12 months old.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/13">The Regional Service for Clustering (RSC), also funded by the Dti, through the RDA, helps groups of SME's collaborate support across Tyne and Wear&mdash;this project is based in North Tyneside.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/14">North Tyneside Council also provides free business advice and guidance to all businesses setting up in North Tyneside.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.2/1">Global steel prices have risen sharply in recent months as a result of rising input costs and market demand. This is causing difficulties for certain steel using industries where they have limited scope for passing on the increased cost to customers. There have been reports of tightness in the steel supply market, with imports to the EU reduced, but I understand that all types of steel remain available, although prices are high. There is no shortage of supply from UK steel producers.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.11/1">The Energy White Paper published in February 2003 set out the Government's energy policy to tackle the crucial environmental challenge of climate change. The challenge we face is to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one of the main causes of climate change, which have risen by more than a third since the industrial revolution and are now rising faster than at any time in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.11/2">The Government has set the target of obtaining 10 per cent. of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010, with the aspiration of doubling this by 2020.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.11/3">Renewable energy will make an important contribution to the Government's wider climate change programme. It is estimated that increased renewable energy generation, to meet the 2010 target, will deliver additional carbon savings of some 2.5 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2010, and that doubling this by 2020 would achieve further cuts of some 3 to 5 million tonnes of carbon per year above that by 2020. Wind power is expected to make the largest contribution of between 7 and 8 per cent. towards the 2010 renewable electricity generation target and the positive environmental impact that will make.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.11/4">Under the normal planning regime and for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 or the Transport and Works Act 1992 wind farm developers are required to consider all environmental aspects of wind energy projects and produce an Environmental Impact Assessment. These assessments are available to the public.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.2/1">The English National Board for Nursing (ENB) collected information on the attrition rate from nursing and midwifery courses until its abolition in March 2002 with the creation of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). A new attrition data collection system administered by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) has been put in place, from which the information will be available in due course. A single and consistent definition of attrition has also been agreed with higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.2/2">The latest complete information on attrition from nurse training courses relates to the 1997&ndash;98 cohort and averaged 20 per cent. across all branches. The human resources performance framework, published in October 2000, set a target of 13 per cent. attrition for students entering nurse training in 2000&ndash;01. Workforce development confederations and strategic health authorities are working with higher education institutions to meet this target locally.</p>

	<p pid=".636W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and I are in regular contact with the National Assembly on these issues. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency shows that the percentage of Welsh-domiciled full-time undergraduate students studying in Wales rose from 57 per cent. in 1997&ndash;8 to 62 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03: the proportion of English-domiciled full-time undergraduates studying in Wales has remained at 3 per cent. over the same period. All the evidence we have on sensitivity of demand to raising and deferring a fee of up to &pound;3,000 suggests the impact of higher fees on these trends is unlikely to be significant. If the Higher Education Bill currently before Parliament proceeds to Royal Assent, future decisions on tuition fees will be for the National Assembly. The Assembly has already committed to providing Welsh students who study in England with a package of financial support that is similar to that available to English students, including fee deferral and a grant worth up to &pound;2,700 for low income students.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.2/1">Following wide consultation with local authorities and others last year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced changes to the distribution of management and maintenance allowances within HRA subsidy to take effect from April 2004. Full details of each authority's allocation and the new methodology were published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website on 18 December 2003, as part of the General Determination of Housing Revenue Account Subsidy for 2004&ndash;05. We are considering some minor, technical improvements to the new formulae for 2005&ndash;06 and will of course consult before introducing any further change.</p>
	<p pid=".642W.2/2">The changes are purely about distribution and have   not made any difference to the total resources available for management and maintenance allowances. Transitional arrangements mean that all authorities will receive at least inflationary increases in their allowances in both 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, with most receiving more.</p>

However, our Market Renewal Pathfinders is a comprehensive programme to tackle low demand and abandonment in   nine English areas, including Merseyside. The boundaries of the Merseyside scheme were drawn up following an analysis of local housing markets to identify those areas most acutely affected by low demand and abandonment. The integrated approach to spatial and economic issues being adopted by the pathfinders should bring substantial benefits to the wider sub-region.</p>

	<p pid=".648W.0/1">The Housing Bill was introduced in the House in December 2003. At that time, the Government made available the Regulatory Impact Assessments for each of the Parts of the Bill. These set out our initial estimates of the costs of implementing the Housing Bill provisions. These included start-up costs for the introduction of the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and licensing provisions. They also included start up costs and some additional enforcement costs for the introduction of home information packs.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.0/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently in discussion with the Local Government Association about these estimated costs. Final decisions on the commitment of funds are subject to the outcome of the Government's spending review.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.5/1">It is too early to take any view about the implications of the Barker report for any particular area. Kate Barker's report sets out a challenging agenda for change which will help to carry forward the objectives of our Communities Plan. The Government agrees that, in order to deliver long term stability in housing markets where demand is highest, a substantial increase in housing supply is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/2">This needs to be delivered as part of a package which includes planning reform, a more responsive house building industry and more investment in affordable housing and infrastructure. At the same time, the economic case for increased development needs to be    balanced against its social and environmental implications.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.5/3">The Barker report looked at the national picture. Any plans to implement its recommendations will also have to take account of the widely differing housing market conditions across the country and our consideration will include the regional and sub-regional dimension. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to establish a long term market affordability goal, linked to housing supply, and consult on its implications at national and regional level within the next 18 months.</p>

	<p pid=".650W.9/1">Government policy on the proportion of affordable housing to be provided in new developments is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: &quot;Housing&quot; (2000). This states that local planning authorities should identify suitable areas and sites on which affordable housing is to be provided and the amount of provision which will be sought. Additional infrastructure required by new developments varies from site to site and is a matter for agreement between the parties. Former Ministry of Defence sites are treated in the same way by the planning system as any other development site.</p>

Current claims in which repayments have not yet been made are estimated to be in the region of &pound;220 million, of which around &pound;150 million depends on the court case. Any further repayments are subject to the other court decisions and a reliable estimate of the tax potentially repayable is not possible at the present time.

The Act also enables the recovery of two other heads of damages, namely bereavement damages and reasonable funeral expenses. Bereavement damages are currently set at &pound;10,000, and are available to the deceased's spouse, or if the deceased was under 18 and had never been married, to his or her parents.

However, Hamas also engages in social activities, providing welfare, medical and educational services in the Palestinian Occupied Territories. The group is not formally represented in the United Kingdom, but supporters are involved in fundraising and political activity on its behalf.

	<p pid=".656W.10/2">The proposal is designed to address an element of the legacy costs which followed the 1992 privatisation of the Northern Ireland electricity supply industry.

The cost of meeting this obligation is currently passed on to the electricity consumers as a Public Service Obligation (PSO) charge.</p>
	<p pid=".656W.10/3">Subject to the necessary State aid clearance, the proposed Government intervention would be provided to NIE to offset the equivalent cost to the company of   meeting this obligation.

	<p pid=".664W.6/1">We have a number of measures in place nationally to help improve conditions for disabled people at work, as well as measures to improve their access to services generally. None of these are specific to Crosby, but all are available to disabled people who live and work there.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.6/2">From 1996, the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act required most employers of 20 or more staff not to discriminate against, and to   make reasonable adjustments for, disabled job applicants or employees; in December 1998, we reduced this threshold to 15 employees. From October this year, the small employer exemption will be removed and most currently excluded occupations, such as police officers, fire-fighters, and partners in business partnerships will   be brought within the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act employment provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.6/3">Jobcentre Plus runs a number of specialist programmes providing help for disabled people, including New Deal for Disabled People, Workstep, Access to Work, the Job Introduction Scheme, and Work Preparation. All these programmes provide practical advice and support to disabled people and their employers to help overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. Since 1997&ndash;98 there have been year on year increases in both numbers helped and programme spend.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.6/4">To help people access appropriate help, Jobcentre Plus has established a network of Disability Service Teams. The teams are made up of Disability Employment Advisors, Access to Work Advisers and Occupational Psychologists; their services are accessed through local Jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid=".664W.6/5">Since April 2003, disabled people in work have been receiving financial support through the Working Tax Credit. This is available if a person is working an average of at least 16 hours per week (self-employed or for an employer); and have a disability which puts them at a disadvantage in getting a job. 70,000 families (including over 32,000 adults without children) are benefiting from the disability element within the Working Tax Credit, compared to 38,000 who benefited from the old Disabled Person's Tax Credit.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.2/1">In his recent Budget statement, my right   hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced new measures to be piloted in the seven Jobcentre Plus Pathways to Work areas.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/2">We will provide three additional mandatory work-focused interviews (WFIs) for those incapacity benefits claimants who started a claim in the two years before the pilots started, excluding the most severely incapacitated cases. These interviews will be designed to identify those who retain an interest in getting back to work and to provide effective support to enable them to do that. In addition, we will offer a new job preparation premium of &pound;20 per week, payable for a maximum of 26 weeks to encourage participation in relevant activity that supports a return to work. These measures will be brought in from early next year and will be fully evaluated.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.2/3">Existing IB recipients attending WFIs will be offered access to New Deal for Disabled People as part of the range of provision currently available in Pathways to Work areas.</p>
