These include assessments of the potential for solar, wind and tidal power generation, borehole water cooling and combined heat, power and cooling for the Palace of Westminster. Solar, wind and tidal power generation for the Palace have, at this stage, been discounted due mainly to heritage restrictions and unfavourable local conditions. Combined heat, power and cooling is now being subjected to an in-depth feasibility study the outcome of which will determine a way forward.</p>

	<p pid="d.2W.3/1">Gassing of badgers in setts with hydrogen cyanide gas was carried out between 1975-1982, when it was discontinued due to studies which showed it to be inhumane. Trapping and shooting has been the culling method used since, during the clean ring (1982-1986) and interim (1986-1997) control strategies and the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (1998-2005). Both tuberculosis-infected and uninfected badgers were removed in all of these operations. It was also the manner of culling used during the live test trial (1994-1996), which initially aimed to remove individual infected badgers that tested positive to a diagnostic test (known as the Brock Elisa test). However, due to the poor performance of the test in detecting infected badgers, the trial was suspended in 1996.</p>

However, following a spate of high profile dog attacks in 2007, DEFRA consulted police forces for their views on the current dangerous dog legislation. Responses indicated that more guidance should be made available to the police. In April of this year, DEFRA made available additional guidance on the law.

The plants using RFO are: four sewage sludge incinerators, one clinical waste incinerator and one hazardous waste incinerator. RFO is used usually as a support fuel to maintain furnace temperatures if waste burning does not remain self-sufficient.

	<p pid="d.13W.11/1">The Government believe that the time is right for the Northern Ireland Assembly to complete the process of devolution by requesting the transfer of policing and justice powers. However, the actual timing of devolution remains for the Assembly itself to decide upon, as set out in section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Progress continues to be made towards the completion of devolution and I believe that the financial package set out by the Prime Minister should enable the parties to move forward with the process.</p>

This money has been spent on paying expert assessors who work with bidding cities and on hosting events where cities can learn from the success of Liverpool as the European Capital of Culture.</p>

	<p pid="d.23W.0/21">The table shows that spend on heritage matters has increased by more than &#163;120 million in real terms since 1997. This spend is primarily attributable to-Churches Conservation Trust, CABE, Chatham Historic Dockyard, Greenwich Naval College, The Royal Parks, Occupied Royal Palaces, Historic Royal Palaces, Listed Places of Worship, Memorial Grant Scheme, National Heritage Memorial Fund, English Heritage, Museums and Galleries and Renaissance in the Regions.</p>
	<p pid="d.23W.0/22">It should be noted that the percentage decrease in spend on Heritage as a proportion of DCMS voted spend in 2003-04 reflects one-off additional funding for the transfer of pension costs across DCMS sectors.

The principles for conversion are set by the Consular Fee Regulations (1981) which allow for the rate of exchange to be adjusted in the interests of administrative efficiency. This is mainly to avoid frequent changes in fees, and to help in giving change, and is the agreed way of translating fees set in sterling by Parliament into local currency. The consular rate of exchange is based on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's corporate exchange rate, from which it may vary by up to 10 per cent., and it is kept under regular review to ensure that it stays within the required range.</p>

Through this work we are aware that there were 1,000 cash in transit attacks in 2008. A wide variety of data are shared among these stakeholders including not only police intelligence but also data from the British Security Industry Association on the number of cash in transit robberies that take place on a daily basis, the location of these offences, the type of premises attacked and the time of day that they take place. These data help to inform the action that needs to be taken by ourselves and our partners to tackle these offences.</p>

Deployments in support of other tasks have been undertaken by individual volunteers; 15 personnel from the Royal Gibraltar Regiment have deployed on operations in Afghanistan between August 2004 and February 2009. Since then there has been a temporary suspension in volunteers being deployed while we investigated a potential issue with compensation arrangements covering such deployments. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment are entitled to compensation benefits under their own terms and conditions of service including when deployed to Afghanistan. Work has commenced to bring these compensation arrangements in line with the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme through legislation. The temporary suspension has now been lifted.</p>

The treatments are intended to increase the service life of the pavement before the existing surface requires replacement due to surface disintegration or unacceptable reduction in skidding resistance. Investigations on the overall performance of these treatments is ongoing, to examine all aspects of their effectiveness. Initial assessment suggests that the treatments are likely to be either neutral or result in slight reductions in traffic noise levels over the lifetime of the treatment when compared with the current surfacing.</p>

	<p pid="d.76W.8/1">Planning policy guidance note 17, Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation, states that local planning authorities should undertake rigorous assessments of the needs of their communities for open space. This enables them to set their own open space standards which take into account local circumstances, including the extent of development. It is for local authorities to determine how much open space should be provided as part of a new development, whether in the green belt or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.76W.8/2">Under our plan-led system, all development in the countryside is strictly controlled, but in green belt there is an additional restraint-the presumption against inappropriate development. This is explained in planning policy guidance note 2, &quot;Green Belts&quot;. Only where the harm that inappropriate development may cause to the green belt would be clearly outweighed by other considerations, and where there are very special circumstances to justify the development, should permission be granted by the planning authority.</p>

	<p pid="d.82W.5/2"><i> </i>Since 1997, my Department has identified a number of significant areas of improvement made in information security policy across government. The Office of the e-Envoy was established in 1999 within the Cabinet Office and produced security policy guidance on e-government development. Sir Edmund Burton's 2001 review into information security policy provision across government recommended a central policy unit be established at the centre to lead on information security policy for government. The Central Sponsor for Information Assurance (CSIA) was duly established in 2003. CSIA published the refreshed National Information Assurance Strategy in 2007 outlining the Government's strategic approach to improve professionalism, capability, awareness and education in information security and assurance.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/3">In June 2008 the Cabinet Secretary published the Data Handling Report (DHR) on the security of cross-government data handling procedures which identified key areas for improvement in data security and outlined specific measures that Departments must take. In addition, the Security Policy Framework (SPF) was introduced in December 2008 to replace and update the Manual of Protective Security which had been in place since 1995 and is now the sole source upon which all departmental security policy should be based. These recent measures further reinforce the Government's strong commitment to review and address information assurance concerns and to the securing of personal data held by public authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.84W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/2">Poverty statistics, published in the households below average income series, only allow a breakdown of the overall number of people in relative poverty at Government office region level or for inner or outer London. Therefore, information for the Tees Valley, or Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland constituency is not available.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/3">Estimates of the number of households who have left poverty are not available, as each year different households are surveyed to produce low income statistics in the households below average series. However, I am able to provide information about the net change in the number of households with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income over the period requested for England and the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/4">Between 1997-98 and 2007-08, the number of households with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income in England rose by 100,000 before housing costs and fell by 400,000 after housing costs. Over the same period, the total number of households in England rose by 1.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/5">For the north-east, three years of data have had to be combined due to survey volatility. Between 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and 2005-06 to 2007-08, the number of households with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income in the north-east stayed at the same level before housing costs, but fell by 100,000 after housing costs. Over the same period, the total number of households in the north-east stayed at the same level.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/6" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/7" class="indent">1. These statistics are based on households below average income, sourced from the Family Resources Survey. The Family Resources Survey is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/8" class="indent">2. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/9" class="indent">3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. For the north-east, three years of data have had to be combined due to survey volatility.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/10" class="indent">4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/11" class="indent">5. For the households below average income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equivalisation factors.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.0/12" class="indent">6. Change in numbers of households in low income and overall have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.3/1">The Department identifies unfilled places in local authority maintained schools and academies through an annual surplus places survey. In 2008 the survey established that there were 2,673 or 8 per cent. of unfilled 16 to 19-year-old places in academies with all year groups present. However, each year academy 16 to 19-year-old funding is normally allocated on the basis of estimates by the academy of the number of pupils aged over 16 that are on roll for the next September (except for that small minority of academies where these are based on actual census numbers). Each academy's estimate is considered in the light of its actual recruitment against funded numbers, with a view to ensuring that unfilled funded places for 16 to 19-year-olds are kept to an absolute minimum. This process takes account of local Learning and Skills Council information on provision in the relevant area.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.3/2">For those academies where funded places are based on estimates, a clause in their funding agreement stipulates that an adjustment will be made to the following year's formulaic grant allocation if the actual numbers recruited across all year groups are more than either 10 per cent. or 2.5 per cent. (depending on the funding agreement) below the total estimated numbers on roll, 16 to 19-year-old pupils are included in this calculation.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.6/2">The Department does not provide funding for sponsors. Sponsors establish not-for-profit charitable companies to set up and run the academies; and these companies receive funding from the Department and sponsors.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/3">There are two models for sponsors' payments: traditional procurement and the endowment model. On the first of these, the sponsorship payment is a contribution to the construction cost of academy buildings, normally of &#163;2 million, but in the case of sponsors with their fourth or more academy, &#163;1.5 million. The timing of this payment is usually phased and varies from academy to academy and is agreed between the Department and the Academy Trust. ULT sponsors 13 traditional procurement academies:</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/4" class="indent">Manchester;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/5" class="indent">Lambeth;</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.6/15" class="indent">William Hulme; and</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/16" class="indent">Stockport</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/17">The traditional procurement model was changed to the endowment model when responsibility for the provision of academy buildings was transferred to Partnerships for Schools (PfS).</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/18">With the endowment model, sponsors establish an endowment fund which generates revenue for the Academy Company to use to counteract the impact of deprivation on the communities they serve. This revenue is not used for either capital costs or to meet the academy's running costs, which are funded by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/19">With the endowment model, payments by sponsors begin only after the academy has opened, and are usually phased over a period of five years. ULT currently sponsor four endowment model academies:</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/20" class="indent">Accrington;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/21" class="indent">Midhurst Rother;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/22" class="indent">Kettering Buccleuch; and</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/23" class="indent">Shoreham.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/24">In some traditional procurement model academies (including some ULT academies), particularly where a sponsor has several academy projects and needs time to raise sponsorship contributions, the Department has agreed to pay an additional grant to the Academy Trust to cover part of a sponsor's agreed sponsorship payment. This is then recovered by the Department through deductions from the academy's &quot;General Annual Grant (GAG)&quot;, which academies receive to meet their running costs. Academy sponsors then make contributions to the academies to make good these deductions.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/25">For some multiple academy sponsors, such as ULT, who have already committed &#163;2 million to a number of academy projects, we have agreed that the sponsor can use &quot;reasonable endeavours&quot; to raise funds. To date, payments made by sponsors to academy companies in relation to the traditional procurement model amount to almost &#163;100 million, of which ULT have paid almost &#163;11 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.6/26">A table setting out the Department's funding for each ULT academy from 2001/02 to 2009/10 has been placed in the Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="d.108W.8/3">We have significantly expanded funding for parenting and family support and have just announced indicative local authority allocations for 2010-11 totalling &#163;89 million. Many of the projects delivered with this funding, such as family intervention projects, work with prisons and the probation service to support this group of families. The Department also directly funds a range of organisations such as Action For Prisoners' Families to deliver projects to support the families of offenders through the our third sector grant programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.108W.8/4">The Sure Start children's centres practice guidance highlights families with a parent in prison or known to be engaged in criminal activity among those vulnerable families for whom additional support should be available. It includes a separate section with good practice examples on how services can be tailored to meet the needs of partners and families of prisoners. Together for Children, the Department's delivery partner, have also produced a support product &quot;Working Effectively with Families in Sure Start Children's Centres&quot; which includes a checklist and links to resources to help centres working with families of prisoners and is available online at:</p>

	<p pid="d.112W.5/1">The DCSF has made it clear to schools that all forms of bullying, including those motivated by prejudice, should not be tolerated. Schools have the legal duty to put measures in place to promote good behaviour, respect for others and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. Schools' legal duties also include promoting community cohesion which is about building an appreciation of diversity, developing shared values and fostering good relations between different groups of pupils. Ofsted has inspected schools against this duty since September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.112W.5/2">In March 2006 we published specialist guidance on bullying around race, religion and culture which focused on preventing and tackling racist and religious bullying in schools and included specific material on bullying related to anti-Semitism. We are funding the Anti-Bullying Alliance and the National Strategies to ensure the guidance is effectively embedded in local authorities and schools.</p>

Dentists who are able and willing to do more NHS work can approach their local PCT, or bid for extra work where local PCTs are inviting tenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.118W.2/2">Access to NHS dental care is growing steadily, with 721,000 more patients seen in the 24 months ending June 2009 than in the 24 months ending June 2008. But we recognise there is further to go. The NHS has committed itself to ensuring that, by March 2011, all those who actively seek NHS dental care can access it. We have put in place the Dental Access Programme to support the NHS in achieving this commitment.</p>

	<p pid="d.129W.3/1">In developing the Green Paper, the Department asked the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) to forecast the likely levels of need for care and support until 2026. The methodology used to do this was published by PSSRU in July 2009 at:</p>

	<p pid="d.129W.3/3">The funding options look at different ways to bring money into the system to meet the forecasted levels of need. The different funding options consider both needs and means. The options under consideration are:</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.3/4" class="indent">Pay for yourself-where all individuals are responsible for meeting their own care costs. This was ruled out because it would leave many people without the care and support they need;</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.3/5" class="indent">Partnership-where everyone who qualified for care and support would be entitled to have a set proportion, for example a quarter or a third of their costs paid for by the state. People who were less well off would have more care paid for, while the least well off people would continue to get all their care free;</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.3/6" class="indent">Insurance-under which everyone would be entitled to have a share of their costs of their care and support met by the state but would go further to help people cover the additional costs of their care and support through insurance if they wanted to;</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.3/7" class="indent">Comprehensive-where everyone over retirement age who had the resources to do so would be required to pay into a state insurance scheme. Then everyone whose needs meant they qualified for care and support would get all of their basic care and support free when they needed it. It would be possible to vary how much people had to pay according to how much they could afford. The size of people's contribution could be set according to what savings or assets they had so that the system was affordable for people who were less well off; and</p>
	<p pid="d.129W.3/8" class="indent">Tax funded-where people would get all of their basic care free and would pay throughout their lives through tax. This was ruled out because it places a heavy burden on people of working age.</p>

			<tr pid="d.130W.5/41"> <td colspan="6"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 2. 'Consultant main speciality' is defined as the specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Care is needed when analysing hospital episode statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &quot;acute&quot;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br/> 3. A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or primary care trust). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). TCs (also known as Diagnostic Centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some Treatment Centres are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per trust T1, T2, T3 etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an 'X'. Hospital providers beginning with an 'N' indicates an independent sector health care provider.<br/> 4. To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> 5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the national health service have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 6. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 7.

	<p pid="d.133W.5/2">As set out on page 97 of the 2008-09 MoJ Resource Accounts, the CFO generally recovers the full cost of operations from the UK Debt Management Office each year on a reimbursement basis, in accordance with the Administration of Justice Act 1982. The large surplus in 2008-09 has arisen because of a change in the basis on which income is recognised from cash to accruals. The income reflects &#163;7.5 million in relation to costs incurred in 2007-08 and &#163;5.8 million in relation to costs incurred in 2008-09. In future, fees and expenditure will be on the same basis and will be aligned.</p>

	<p pid="d.134W.2/1">A pilot of Virtual Courts began in May 2009 and is currently operating at 15 police stations in London, linked to Camberwell Green magistrates court; and one police station in Kent, linked to Medway magistrates court.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.2/2">Virtual Courts enable defendants to appear in a magistrates' court for a first hearing while still physically located in the police station where they are charged. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-30">30 October 2009</phrase>, the pilot had dealt with 263 cases. Where cases can be heard on the same day that the defendant is charged, the average time from charge to first hearing is four hours. More than half of defendants have been sentenced at their Virtual Court hearing.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.2/3">The evaluation of the pilot is now underway and is due to report in September 2010. This will provide an assessment of the extent to which Virtual Courts enable resources to be used more efficiently. It will also explore the wider impact of the Virtual Court process to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the fairness of the process for defendants, and gather feedback from victims, witnesses and practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.137W.2/1">HMCS is currently in the process of implementing the HMCS Criminal Compliance and Enforcement Services: A Blueprint for 2008 to 2012 across England and Wales. The Blueprint sets out HMCS's strategic objective for enforcement which is for a cheaper, faster and more proportionate system that primarily focuses on 'first time' compliance while continuing to apply the principles of rigorous enforcement to the hard core of defaulters. Wales is currently developing and implementing plans to increase compliance with court orders and make more efficient use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="d.137W.2/2">The rollout of the HMCS Modernising Money Handling Project (MMHP) in Wales has also contributed to reducing costs associated with collection of financial penalties. The objective of the MMHP was to provide an enhanced range of payment methods that optimise accessibility, convenience and low cost for the fine payer and HMCS by maximising the use of electronic payment methods. The automated systems introduced have reduced the costs associated with cash handling and processing of payments.</p>

	<p pid="d.139W.5/1">I have today issued a written ministerial statement to clarify details around the roll-out of the BOSS chairs. NOMS has now purchased and delivered at least one BOSS chair to every prison that did not already have one (five extra BOSS chairs were purchased for prisons with split sites)-128 in total. This includes the female, open and contracted estate, and nine prisons which have a main function as a young offenders' institution. Immigration removal centres were not included, as the use of mobile phones is not prohibited in those sites.</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.5/2">NOMS headquarters have not mandated how BOSS chairs must be used. As is the case for many searching technologies and techniques, the decision on how to use the BOSS chairs is for individual Governors to make, and will depend on their local circumstances, including their existing local searching strategies. The relevant Prison Service Instruction (PSI) states: &quot;The frequency of searches using the BOSS and policies for its use are for local discretion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.5/3">The pattern of use will vary over time and it is not possible to say how many BOSS chairs are operational on any given day. According to a recent survey of BOSS chair usage, 115 prisons reported that the BOSS chair was in use. Reasons for non-operation include chairs awaiting repair or return from repairs and awaiting building work to accommodate the chair. Steps have been taken to improve the .provision of maintenance services. Prisons deploy hand-held detection wands as an effective alternative.</p>
	<p pid="d.139W.5/4">NOMS does not hold records centrally of the number of mobile phones discovered using the BOSS chair. In order to provide the information requested, we would need to contact all Prison Service establishments, ask them to check their local records and to submit this information to headquarters. This would incur disproportionate cost. BOSS chairs are not designed to detect illegal drugs.</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.2/1">The reducing reoffending pathways were first proposed by the Social Exclusion Unit in their 2002 report 'Reducing Reoffending by Ex-Prisoners'. The concept was developed in the NOMS National Reducing Reoffending Action Plan (2004) and Delivery Plan (2005). The pathways have been embedded in the cross-government work informing the Delivery Plan for PSA 23: Priority Action 4 which seeks to reduce the volume and seriousness of adult reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/2">The National Offender Management Service's 'Annual Report and Accounts 2008-09' states that all 16 of the targets relating to the reoffending pathways, were met. These included:</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/3" class="indent">providing over 27,000 places on cognitive behavioural programmes;</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/4" class="indent">providing over 12,000 places on drug programmes and Drug Rehabilitation Requirements;</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/5" class="indent">ensuring that over 40 per cent. of offenders were employed at the termination of their licence;</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/6" class="indent">ensuring that 26 per cent. of prisoners entered employment on release;</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/7" class="indent">ensuring that 70 per cent. of offenders are in settled and suitable accommodation at the end of their order or licence; and</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/8" class="indent">ensuring that 80 per cent. of prisoners move into settled accommodation upon release.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/9">The Government will shortly publish 'Improving Health, Supporting Justice', a national delivery plan for improving health and social care services for all those in touch with the criminal justice system. This follows the publication of Lord Bradley's report looking at the needs of offenders with mental health and learning difficulties in April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/10">A framework document 'Reducing Reoffending, Supporting Families, Creating Better Futures' was launched last week by the Department of Children Schools and Families (DCSF) and The Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The framework sets out the Departments' shared commitment to working in partnership to improve the delivery of services to the children and families of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/11">Work with the Financial Services Authority, Legal Services Commission and the Department for Work and Pensions has helped to develop a consistent approach which will enable offenders to manage their finances.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/12">The work that has been done within the pathways supports the Government's target to reduce the number of reoffences by 10 per cent. between 2005 and 2011. Reoffending rates are published annually as National Statistics in accordance with arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority. The latest statistics were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-21">21 May 2009</phrase> and show that the rate of reoffending in 2007 has fallen by 11.1 per cent. for adult offenders and 7.5 per cent. for juvenile offenders compared to 2005 (this is set against a target to reduce reoffending by 10 per cent. between 2005 and 2011).</p>

	<p pid="d.143W.7/1">Estimates of the availability of used cooking oil (UCO) for biodiesel production were made as part of the WRAP/EA 2008 financial impact assessment report for the production and use of biodiesel derived from cooking oil and rendered animal fat (tallow). This states:</p>
	<p pid="d.143W.7/2" class="indent">&quot;It is thought around 108Kt/yr of UCO is currently collected from catering premises&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.143W.7/3">and:</p>

	<p pid="d.143W.7/5">The report points out that this latter material is of higher quality and is primarily used for animal feed. The report also quotes independent analysis by the university of Swansea (Jones, P. (2004). The Collection of Used Vegetable Oil at Civic Amenity Sites. MRES Thesis, university of Swansea) which suggests that up to 30,000 tonnes per year could be available from households. However, WRAP considers that domestically-derived used cooking oil is likely to be contaminated and of poor quality, requiring considerable cleaning and blending before it is suitable for conversion to biodiesel. In total, the report estimates that:</p>
	<p pid="d.143W.7/6" class="indent">&quot;across all sources total UCO arisings are at least 250Kt/yr,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.143W.7/7">much of which is poured down the drain or landfilled.</p>
	<p pid="d.143W.7/8">The report further estimates that approximately 82,000 tonnes of waste vegetable oil is being transformed into biodiesel each year for use in the transport, heat or power sectors, with approximately 20,000 tonnes/yr being exported, 5,000 tonnes/yr used in the oleochemical industry and 1,000 tonnes/yr either incinerated or used in CHP.</p>

	<p pid="d.146W.11/1">The Government do not estimate global resources. Data are available from a range of publications-the International Energy Agency (hereafter IEA) is an authoritative source. The Government do, however, publish the Energy Markets Outlook, an annual report on UK Security of Supply, which includes discussion of longer term availability of fuels.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/2">Domestically, the UK has only recently passed an ambitious Climate Change Act and DECC has recently published the UK low carbon transition plan. Our climate change and energy security policies outlined there are not only reducing the UK's carbon emissions, but are consistent with the need to reduce our use of fossil fuels. In addition, the Government are reforming the regulatory framework for planning and consents through the Energy and Planning Acts 2008, which will help to improve the security of our energy supplies.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/3">For information, the following provides information on future supplies for each fuel.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/4" class="italic"> (i) Oil</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/5">The IEA's view<sup>(1)</sup> is that there are reserves to meet demand at least through to 2030, if sufficient investment in production capacity is forthcoming. Thus the immediate risk to oil production is not the level of resources and reserves, but the world's ability to convert these reserves into production now and in the long run. The UK recognises that tight oil markets could lead to high and volatile oil prices with potential negative effects on the economy.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/6" class="italic"> (ii) Gas</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/7">As with oil, the IEA foresees that gas reserves are more than sufficient to meet demand to 2030, with remaining reserves more than doubling since 1980, and by more than 15 per cent. for every year since 2000. Moreover, despite rising annual production, new discoveries presently exceeded production. The IEA therefore forecasts that production will be able to meet the growth in demand until at least 2030.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/8" class="italic"> (iii) Coal</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/9">According to the Department of Energy and Climate Change's December 2008 Energy Market Outlook, coal is the most abundant fossil fuel in terms of reserves. These reserves are geographically well dispersed, with economically recoverable reserves in more than 70 countries worldwide. The IEA similarly suggests that there are more than enough coal reserves to meet the growth in global demand until 2030. However, sufficient investment will be needed in new mining projects and prospecting.</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/10" class="italic"> (iv) Nuclear</p>
	<p pid="d.146W.11/11">The OECD/NEA and IAEA collates information about uranium resources and publishes a comprehensive report<sup>(2)</sup> every two years. The OECD/NEA concluded in a forward looking report on nuclear energy in November 2008<sup>(3)</sup> that identified uranium resources are sufficient to fuel an expansion of global nuclear generating capacity, without reprocessing, at least until 2050. Based on regional geological data, resources that are expected to exist could increase uranium supply to several hundreds of years.</p>

Such a situation could arise if the UK were to achieve a high market penetration of fuel cell powered vehicles, but this is not expected to occur until 2020 or later. Hydrogen is in widespread use in oil refineries and as an industrial chemical. Hydrogen has been stored successfully in salt caverns in Teesside to meet the demands of the petrochemical industry.</p>

Going forward, two new financial incentives will have a real impact on pushing small scale onsite energy technologies into the forefront of our energy future. Feed-in tariffs for electricity will act as a major incentive for the development of the market up to 5 MW, and we are working to have feed-in tariffs in place in April 2010.</p>

This generally results in a time lag between wholesale and retail price movements.

This is leading to a greater transparency in the relationship between these factors. Ofgem is also responsible for monitoring and promoting competition in these markets.</p>

There have been some successes. In September, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed a 22 per cent. decrease in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in 2008-including a 33 per cent. reduction in Helmand. This builds on last year's success, when UNODC recorded a 19 per cent. fall in cultivation. Growing Afghan law enforcement capacity is increasingly having an impact on corruption and on the insurgency, with steady increases in the number of significant drug traffickers convicted and the amount of drugs seized.</p>

	<p pid="d.156W.2/1">We are aware of a number of localised anti-Semitic incidents in Ukraine, including desecration of cemeteries, synagogues, private properties and Holocaust memorials, which have been reported in the local media this year. We take a serious view of these dreadful incidents and continue to urge the Ukrainian authorities to tackle them in a determined way in accordance with Ukraine's international commitments. The British embassy in Kyiv remains in contact with local human rights organisations and senior representatives of Ukraine's Jewish community. The British ambassador met the Chief Rabbi of Ukraine in October 2009. We have not received reports of violent attacks on Jewish people, synagogues or property in Latvia or Estonia in 2009, but we keep a close eye on any anti-Semitic political developments.</p>

	<p pid="d.161W.0/1">Syria's human rights record is a cause for concern. In the past year we have seen a worrying deterioration. Critics of the Government, including those who call for peaceful democratic reform, and some individuals who have posted dissenting comments on internet blogs, have been imprisoned. Disappearances, travel bans and arbitrary detention are increasingly common. There are reports of torture during interrogation and deaths in police custody. We do not know how many people are in detention but we continue to press Syria to abide by its international obligations on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.0/2">I share the hon. Member's concern about the continued imprisonment of Dr. Labwani. He is currently held in Adra prison in Damascus in the same conditions as other prisoners, which are poor and involve sharing a cell. Dr. al-Labwani also suffers from serious medical condition which, given his medical expertise, he is reportedly treating himself having managed to obtain the necessary medication.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.0/3">I am also concerned at the recent arrest of lawyer Haythem al-Maleh and, as we made clear in a Foreign and Commonwealth Office press statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-19">19 October 2009</phrase>, we call on the Syrian Government to release him.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.0/4">I have raised my concerns with the Syrian Foreign Minister. Our embassy in Damascus, working with other EU missions, continues to press the Syrians to improve conditions in general as well as raising the cases of Dr. al-Labwani, Mr. al-Maleh and others of concern.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.0/5">When the EU-Syria Association Agreement is in force, we will ensure that we use the dialogue established to press for action. Respect for human rights is an essential element of the agreement. The agreement provides that where a party considers that the other party is in breach of it obligations under the agreement it may take appropriate measures which could include suspension or termination of the Association Agreement.</p>

	<p pid="d.163W.3/1">The Government recognise the importance of the Construction Industry to the economy. In 2007 the construction industry, including contracting, products and services, accounted for 9 per cent. of GVA. Construction contracting by itself contributed 6 per cent. of GVA. These figures are based on the Annual Business inquiry published by ONS in June 2009, which are the latest data source the Department has at hand. The public sector is especially important to the construction industry. Some 30 per cent. of all construction work is procured by the public sector, rising to 40 per cent. if PFI projects are included.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/2">In order to help preserve jobs and skills, at the time of the 2008 pre-Budget report the Government announced that it was bringing forward &#163;3 billion of capital expenditure from financial year 2010-11 to financial years 2008-09 and 2009-10, to be spent on motorways, schools, GPs' surgeries, flood defences and improving the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/3">In addition, in the Budget the Chancellor announced a &#163;600 million cash injection for the housing market to help kick-start stalled projects and to build more energy efficient homes, including &#163;50 million to modernise armed forces' accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/4">The Construction Industry like other sectors has benefited from the Government's recapitalisation of the banks and the restoration of stability to the financial sector. The UK is the first country in the world to have negotiated legally binding lending commitments with banks receiving state support, and both RBS and the Lloyd's Banking Group have committed to additional net lending over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/5">The Construction Industry is dominated by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. Like other sectors of the economy, the industry has benefited from the Government's &quot;Real Help for Business Now&quot; initiative, including:</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/6" class="indent">The Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme: enabling banks to lend an extra &#163;1.3 billion to small and medium-sized businesses with viable business plans that can not access normal commercial lending;</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/7" class="indent">Extra lending capacity: made available through the European Investment Bank;</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/8" class="indent">The Working Capital Scheme: provides guarantees to banks for existing business lending, so freeing up more capital for new loans;</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/9" class="indent">Up to six months' Trade Credit Insurance Top-Up, backed by the Government and available for businesses where cover has been reduced due to the recession.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.3/10">The Government would shortly appoint a Chief Construction Adviser to lead the low carbon review of the Construction Industry to ensure the industry is &quot;fit for purpose&quot; for delivering a low carbon future. The Chief Construction Adviser will also chair a new Construction Category Board, which will build on the work of the existing Public Sector Construction Clients Forum, to oversee the implementation and further the development of best value in Government construction procurement.</p>

A report on Metrics for the Evaluation of Knowledge Transfer Activities at Universities, funded by HEFCE and the Research Councils, has been published by Library House. The Higher Education Business Community Interaction Survey for 2007-08 was released in July 2009 showing a continued increase in income from IP.

	<p pid="d.174W.8/1">The Grant Letter to the Learning and Skills Council for 2009-10 sent in November 2008 sets out planned expenditure across our funding priorities based on estimated volumes of activity.</p>
	<p pid="d.174W.8/2">A copy of this letter is available publicly at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="d.174W.8/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dius.gov.uk/news_and_speeches/press_releases/~/media/publications/L/LSC_GRANT_LETTER_FINAL_19-NOV">http://www.dius.gov.uk/news_and_speeches/press_releases/~/media/publications/L/LSC_GRANT_LETTER_FINAL_19-NOV</a></p>
	<p pid="d.174W.8/4">Estimated spend for all adults in 2009-10 through Train to Gain is &#163;626 million on full level 2 and &#163;161 million on full level 3 qualifications. Funding through Train to Gain is prioritised on supporting adults in employment to gain basic literacy and numeracy skills, full level 2 and full level 3 qualifications. For 2009-10 in response to the economic downturn we have provided increased flexibilities for small and medium sized enterprises to support retraining through access to funding for units and part qualifications in areas described as business critical by Sector Skills Councils.</p>
	<p pid="d.174W.8/5">The actual amount spent at each level and on particular age groups will depend on learner and employer demand throughout the year.</p>
