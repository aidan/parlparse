We have not submitted any information on future night flying restrictions at Heathrow to the Commission.</p>

The police directed the Highways Agency's maintenance contractor to close off lane 3 of the northbound M1 carriageway and the police's own contractors then recovered the vehicle. This work was completed at 13.50 hrs. The police took the advice of the Highways Agency's maintenance contractor and decided that barrier repairs should be carried out at this time, rather than be left until later, for the safety of the travelling public. The barrier repairs were completed and the northbound lane 3 reopened by 15.10 hrs. Full running capacity on the motorway was restored in time for the afternoon/evening peak.</p>

	<p pid="a.1194W.2/1">Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA Infantry battalions spread across the country. Each CCRF comprises a pool of around 500 personnel drawn from the Volunteer Reserve Forces, who have volunteered for the CCRF commitment in addition to their normal role. CCRF membership is dynamic and details of individual availability, including where volunteers have been deployed as part of their normal Reserve role, are not held centrally. It is, however, the case that when a CCRF member is mobilised to meet other commitments we aim to replace that individual immediately by another volunteer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.2/2">There are no specific recruitment schemes in place, nor are such schemes necessary given that the pool of potential volunteers consists of existing members of the Volunteer Reserves. The future size of the CCRFs is being considered as part of a wider review of the TA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.2/3">CCRFs would not be deployed in a situation which required the use of force so no question of rules of engagement would arise. Volunteers are not held at permanent readiness, although we aim to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours. There are no specific criteria which would lead to a decision to mobilise a CCRF; they form part of the pool of resources upon which we could draw in the event of a request for military assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.2/4">While the supporting infrastructure is based on the army's regional structure, it is not the case that a CCRF would only be mobilised to undertake operations within its &quot;home&quot; region. Consequently, all CCRFs are available to undertake operations anywhere in the UK over an extended period, including in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.2/5">No CCRF members were mobilised in response to the terrorist attacks in London on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>. The civil authorities coped extremely well in the aftermath of the attacks and made no request for military assistance which would have required the sort of large scale general duties support which could be provided by a CCRF.</p>

The recently published Defence Industrial Strategy identifies those capabilities. Where a contract can be let to overseas suppliers without compromising these and the overseas bid represents the best long-term value for money, taking into account relevant wider factors, we will continue to procure from overseas, so that we can continue to access the equipment best suited to our needs from the widest range of suitable suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1202W.5/1">Between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s, relative child poverty more than doubled. This Government have committed to halve child poverty by 2010&ndash;11 and to eradicate it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/2">Macro-economic stability, active labour market policies such as the new deal, policies to make work pay such as the national minimum wage and the working tax credit, and financial support for families, have all contributed to reducing child poverty since 1998&ndash;99. On an after housing cost basis, this approach has lifted 600,000 children out of relative poverty (60 per cent. of less of contemporary median income), and 1.8 million children out of absolute poverty (60 per cent. or less of median income in 1996&ndash;97, uprated by prices), between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04. Since 2000&ndash;01, 300,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty and 800,000 children have been lifted out of absolute poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/3">Financial support for families has been based on the principle of progressive universalism, with support for all families and additional support for those who need it most. Child benefit provides universal support, and the Government have increased the rate of child benefit for the first child by more than 25 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The child tax credit (CTC) was introduced in April 2003, and targets additional financial support based on the needs and circumstances of the whole household. As a result of the Government's reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, by October 2007, in real terms, families with children will be, on average, &pound;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth of the income distribution will be, on average, &pound;3,350 per year better off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/4">The Government have set out its spending plans to 2007&ndash;08, including a commitment to increase the child element of CTC in line with earnings. While it is possible to model the immediate effect of further changes, there are uncertainties in projecting the numbers of children in relative low income poverty. A further increase of &pound;5 per week in the rate of child benefit would initially lift around 350,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;3.4 billion. A further increase of &pound;500 per week in the child element of CTC would initially lift around 750,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;3.5 billion. Increasing the rate of child benefit for all children to the rate for the first child would lift around 250,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.5/5">The Family Resources Survey does not enable the Government to make an estimate of the cost or effect of reducing the rate of child benefit when a child reaches the age of 12. The Government have not made an estimate of the cost of eradicating child poverty by 2007&ndash;08, which would depend on the definition used, and would be subject to large uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution, and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1207W.6/1">Information is not held centrally on the benefits in all occupational pension schemes in the public sector. The Treasury is responsible for the general policy on the statutory public service pension schemes. All of these schemes provide survivor pensions for partners of scheme members where there is a legal partnership through marriage or civil registration in the case of same gender couples. Our policy is not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in provision for partners who are not married or civilly-registered to the scheme member. Any scheme may modernise its benefits to provide survivor pensions for unmarried and unregistered partners provided this improvement is introduced in a way which does not add to costs falling on the taxpayer. Of the statutory public service schemes <i>(a)</i> the 2002 section of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (premium) and the new armed forces scheme launched in 2005 have introduced provisions for unmarried and unregistered survivor pensions, as have the parliamentary pension scheme and the scheme for UK Members of the European Parliament with effect from 2004; and <i>(b)</i> none of the other public service schemes have yet done so. Many of the other schemes have proposals to do so as part of the restructuring of benefits associated with increases to normal pension ages and other changes which will overall reduce taxpayer costs, including the schemes for local government, the NHS, teachers, police, and firefighters.</p>

Civil society groups should hold governments to account for delivery of these commitments, and also for their results. DFID is supporting the Archbishop of Capetown's proposal for an 'African Monitor', which will bring together civil society groups across Africa for this purpose, complementing the APF's role.</p>

	<p pid="a.1217W.5/1">DFID's aim is poverty reduction, as measured by the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs), and the eventual elimination of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.5/2">Within this framework, the criteria used by DFID to assess the effectiveness of projects in support of better governance are defined by the scope of each individual project. Examples of criteria of effectiveness for governance projects might include the number of eligible citizens able to register and vote at elections, the election of representatives of disadvantaged or marginalised communities to decision-making arenas such as local government councils, or the establishment of channels for monitoring citizen satisfaction with key service sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1217W.5/3">More generally, DFID uses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria to evaluate its own programmes. The criteria are: relevance; efficiency; effectiveness; impact; and sustainability:</p>

	<p pid="a.1218W.2/1">DFID, along with all Government Departments, is committed to see reform of developed country agriculture policies, including trade policies, which distort international markets, and which if reformed, could deliver real development gains to the world's poorest countries. In the assistance we provide to developing countries, we do not start from the premise that their agriculture trade policies specifically must be reformed. The assistance that DFID provides to developing countries under our trade related capacity building programme is designed to support their own priorities and development needs, as identified by the countries themselves, and falls into three broad categories; helping developing countries to determine their own trade policies; helping them to negotiate their priorities in both bilateral and multilateral fora; and helping them to capture the potential benefits from trade. Since 1998, we have committed &pound;181 million to trade related capacity building, and are set to increase this Aid for Trade to &pound;100 million per annum by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1218W.2/2">For the least developed countries (LDCs), we contribute to the reform of their trade policies, including agricultural trade policies, through our support to the integrated framework (IF). The IF is an international initiative which assists LDCs to take the steps necessary to improve their trading performance in a manner which supports economic growth and poverty reduction. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) is carried out for each LDC participating in the IF which identifies constraints to the trading performance of LDCs, policies, infrastructure, institutional and private sector capacity. It also provides technical advice on how to address these constraints. Agriculture trade policies will be considered in participating LDCs with agricultural export sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1218W.2/3">The IF is active in over 30 countries, 21 of them in Sub Saharan Africa including Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zambia. DFID has contributed a total of &pound;4.5 million to the IF since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1218W.2/4">DFID has also contributed &pound;850,000 to the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), a multi-donor funded programme that assists developing countries in improving their expertise and capacity to analyse and implement international sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1218W.2/5">DFID has recently published an agriculture policy paper. This identifies the need to improve the benefits of agricultural trade to poor people and poor countries and reaffirms DFID's strong commitment to agriculture, which we recognise as fundamental to poverty reduction and to the livelihoods of poor people.</p>

	<p pid="a.1219W.2/1">DFID has not made any recent assessment of the humanitarian situation in Fallujah.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.2/2">Humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in Fallujah is the responsibility of the Iraqi Government, with support from the United States. Significant progress has been made since military operations concluded, and further projects are under way to improve basic services. To date, Fallujah has received US$100 million for reconstruction, and US$103 million in housing compensation. The Iraqi Prime Minister recently approved a further US$75 million housing compensation, so that Fallujah will have received a total of $281 million. Power and water is currently estimated to be available to over 80 per cent. of the population as a rule; however, a recent fire at an electricity substation has restricted these services. Prior to April 2004, the population of Fallujah was estimated at 300,000; today the population is around 239,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1219W.2/3">Statistics on birth rate, death rate and infant mortality in Fallujah since 1990 are unavailable. For Iraq as a whole, this data can be estimated from surveys, However, when information is required at a more local level, the only source of information in most developing countries, including Iraq, is a population census. The most recent census, conducted in 1997, only contains details at the Governorate or regional level. Town-level estimates of birth and death rates are unlikely to have been calculated at any stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.1220W.2/1">As in any conflict or humanitarian emergency, child health has suffered hugely in Sudan. In 2004, UNICEF's figures showed that out of 1,000 live births in Sudan, an estimated 91 would die before the age of five. By way of comparison, the UK's under five mortality rate is six out of 1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.2/2">This financial year, DFID has allocated &pound;112.75 million for our work in Sudan. We aim to contribute towards the most critical needs in Sudan, especially in Darfur, Southern Sudan and the East. Of this, we channelled &pound;45 million through the UN Work plan and &pound;25 million via NGOs for a wide range of assistance including water and sanitation, emergency health care, shelter, food and nutrition; all of which help to reduce mortality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.2/3">For example, DFID currently funds a project which provides bed nets to women and children in Southern Sudan where malaria, a large contributor to infant mortality, is endemic. This follows similar programmes in Kenya and Gambia where it has been found that impregnated bed nets can reduce overall mortality rates by up to 30 per cent. in malaria endemic areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.2/4">Although only a snapshot of the situation over the last six months, the recent World Health Organisation (WHO) mortality survey in Darfur revealed that death rates have dropped by two thirds in some areas. This points to the effectiveness of the responses in stabilising and improving the humanitarian situation in Darfur. With raising levels of insecurity, however, this remains extremely fragile.</p>

	<p pid="a.1220W.5/1">DFID is working with developing country governments and their revenue authorities to improve collection of taxes and customs duties. Increasing tax revenue will increase funding available for essential services such as primary education and primary healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.5/2">DFID has not made an assessment of the impact of tax evasion and tax avoidance on developing countries' finances. The high number of businesses not formally registered in many countries is a significant constraint on collecting taxes. DFID is undertaking a study looking at the impact of tax on business which will, among other matters, examine the impact on incentives for businesses to remain in the informal sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.5/3">80 per cent. of taxes in developing countries are collected from formal companies, through VAT, corporate taxes, and taxes on labour. In contrast, the collection of personal tax is very small, so the potential for tax avoidance and evasion is less significant in terms of proportion of tax revenue from individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1220W.5/4">Through work on the investment and regulatory climate facing the private sector, and on building capacity through training in inland revenue and customs offices, DFID is contributing to reducing the avoidance and evasion of taxes in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1221W.2/1">A preliminary analysis of the barrier's route, published by the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in March 2005, identified that some 142,640 acres (10 per cent.) of West Bank land will lie between the completed barrier and the Green Line. This is some of the most fertile land in the West Bank and is currently home to 49,400 Palestinians. Where the Barrier has been constructed, Palestinians face economic hardship from being restricted from or not being able to reach their land to harvest crops, graze animals or earn a living. Residents have also been cut off from schools, universities and specialized medical care by the constructed Barrier.</p>

	<p pid="a.1224W.5/1">The Aimhigher area studies are being carried out as part of strand 3 of the national Aimhigher evaluation. While we know which areas were shortlisted for interview, we do not know which four areas were actually interviewed by independent contractors EKOS for this forthcoming report, as all individuals and areas were guaranteed anonymity as part of the interview process. This was to ensure that the answers provided reflected the true opinions of the respondent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.5/2">The main objective of the area selection process was to identify a broad range of Aimhigher Partnership areas which are reflective of the various types of Aimhigher activity undertaken throughout the country. Rurality was not one of the formal selection criteria of the initial shortlisting process, but a spread of areas with regard to the level of rurality or urbanisation was ensured.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.5/3">The contractors have informed us that all districts within the rural area selected are formally classified as rural in the ODPM user guide.</p>

	<p pid="a.1224W.8/1">Since September 2001, all teachers appointed in Further Education colleges have been required by law to obtain the Further Education Teachers' Certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/2">From September 2007, all new teachers within the 'whole' of the publicly funded FE learning and skills sector will be expected to undertake the new teaching requirement, which is to obtain Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills status and a full Licence to Practise. This is set out in the Government's November 2004 reform document &quot;Equipping our Teachers for the Future: Reforming Initial Teacher Training for the Learning and Skills Sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/3">Higher Education teaching staff are not within the scope of the current and future regulations referred to above for FE. But, from 2006, it is expected that all new teaching staff in Higher Education will obtain a relevant teaching qualification accredited against national professional standards for teaching in Higher Education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/4">The Government expects to spend a total of approximately &pound;18 million on incentives to recruit and retain FE teachers in 2005/06 and a similar amount in 2006/07. Three schemes available to eligible college teachers are Teacher Training Bursaries, Golden Hellos, and Key Worker Living. There are no age limits on these incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1224W.8/5">The Department has also funded, through the Higher Education Funding Council for England, a Golden Hello programme to encourage new entrants into teaching shortage subjects within Higher Education, totalling &pound;20 million from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-17a.43045.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-17a.1227W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="1227W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060117/text/60117w15.htm#60117w15.html_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/1">The Government have invested well over &pound;17 billion on early years and childcare services since 1997 as part of an unprecedented expansion of provision for young children and families. The 2005 Foundation Stage Profile results for this local authority demonstrate that generally children are achieving good levels of development by the end of the Foundation Stage. Nonetheless, we want to continue to improve outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/2">The Ten Year Childcare Strategy sets out ambitious plans to create a sustainable framework for high quality services for children and families. To support this, the Childcare Bill 2005 will take forward, and give statutory force to key commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/3">To raise the quality of early education the Bill provides for a new duty on local authorities to improve the outcomes of all children under 5, and close the gaps between groups with the poorest outcomes and children more generally, by ensuring early years services are integrated and accessible. The Bill also provides for a reformed and simplified regulatory framework for early years and childcare to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/4">Local authorities receive support on early education through the Foundation Stage strand of the Primary National Strategy (PNS). That support includes disseminating effective practice; supporting the transition from Foundation Stage to Key Stage 1; supporting integrated provision; ICT development in the early years; working with parents as partners; and helping to embed the Foundation Stage Profile.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/5">All local authorities now have access to Key Elements of Effective Practice (KEEP), guidance developed through sector wide consultation by the Foundation Stage strand of the PNS. KEEP represents an agreed view across the sector about the knowledge; skills, understanding and attitudes practitioners need to effectively support young children's learning and thereby raise quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/6">We have committed &pound;790 million over 2005&ndash;08 to support the development of extended services in or through schools which includes after school activities. &pound;110 million of this was allocated in 2005&ndash;06 and Lancashire local authority received &pound;1,824,687. We are unable to break this information down to parliamentary constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/7">Of the &pound;680 million to be allocated across 2006&ndash;08, &pound;250 million will go direct to schools through the School Standards Grant and the remaining &pound;430 million will be distributed to local authorities through the Standards Fund and the General Sure Start Grant. Of this Lancashire local authority will receive &pound;3,531,061 in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;4,515,291 in 2007&ndash;08. The funding is to 'kick start' extended services and can be used flexibly, for example, to support the development of childcare including the training of childcare workers. Many schools will choose to develop services in partnership with existing local private or voluntary sector providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.5/8">We are also funding the National Remodelling Team (NRT), Continyou and 4Children to support local authorities and schools nationally as they implement extended services. This support includes guidance on developing and sustaining childcare and working with existing voluntary and private providers to improve the delivery of after school childcare.</p>

Medical students on four year fast track courses do not pay tuition fee contributions, except in their first year, because the Department of Health pays the fees in years 2 to 4.

	<p pid="a.1234W.3/1">My Department is committed to helping people, including lone parents, gain the skills to help them into employment. Lone parents are identified as a priority disadvantaged group for the LSC, and FE colleges also provide financial assistance towards childcare costs from ring-fenced Learner Support Funds. The Government's Skills Strategy is focused on improving the employability of all adults with low skills, including lone parents. Many lone parents lack qualifications at or above level 2, are therefore a priority for support; including Information, Advice and Guidance and free tuition from 2006&ndash;07 for a first full Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1234W.3/2">DfES also has specific strategies to help teenage parents into learning. For example, through the Care to Learn programme, &pound;22 million is being made available in 2005&ndash;06 to provide help with childcare costs for an estimated 4,700 young parents; and those aged 16 and 17 and caring for their child and in learning also receive the education maintenance allowance maximum of &pound;30 per week, plus attendance and completion bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1234W.3/3">In addition, my Department works with Jobcentre Plus to support the new deal for lone parents which provides a package of advice and support to help and encourage lone parents not in work to improve their employment opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1235W.0/2">From 2006/07 statutory fee support for part-time students with the lowest incomes will increase by more than a quarter, with 85,000 expected to receive fee support (approximately a third of eligible part-time undergraduate students).</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.0/3">The estimated cost of the new statutory part-time fee support package for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 is approximately &pound;40 million per year. Part-time students may also be eligible for a grant towards travel, books and other course costs; that is expected to cost approximately &pound;20 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.0/4">In addition, the discretionary funds available to institutions to help part-time students will quadruple: funds allocated for part-time students under the Access to Learning Fund will rise in 2006 from &pound;3 million to &pound;12 million, although the Fund may be used flexibly across full-time and part-time students. Institutions will be able to use this resource as an additional fee support on top of the grant or to increase help to students facing financial hardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.0/5">Funding for 2008&ndash;09 will be considered as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.0/6">In 2003/04, 239,000 English-domiciled, part-time undergraduate students <sup>1</sup> studied at less than 50 per cent. of a full-time equivalent course at an English Higher Education Institution (HEI), representing 55 per cent. of all part-time undergraduate students at English HEIs. We have not made projections for students studying at less than 50 per cent. and have not made estimates of extending eligibility for statutory fee support below 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.0/7" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Students with prior degrees are not normally eligible for statutory support.</p>

	<p pid="a.1235W.6/23">There are several possible reasons for the rise in bankruptcy figures. Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. As a result provisions were included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1235W.6/24">Bankrupt student loan borrowers, though, continue to benefit from the same non-commercial terms as other borrowers, including income thresholds and repayment in line with income. Income-contingent loan borrowers are not required to repay if their annual income is below &pound;15,000.</p>
