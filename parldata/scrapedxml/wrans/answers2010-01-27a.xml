	<p pid="a.858W.7/1">The cost of the finance function for the Ministry of Justice's headquarters is made up of:</p>
	<p pid="a.858W.7/2" class="indent">the costs of finance teams that provide support to a number of the MOJ's Directorates, including the corporate centre which provides support and challenge to the entire Department;</p>
	<p pid="a.858W.7/3" class="indent">the costs for transaction processing for the former Department for Constitutional Affairs parts of the Department (including HM Courts Service and the Tribunal Service) that are funded and managed through a central contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.858W.7/4">The cost differences reflected in the publication 'Benchmarking the Back Office: Central Government' may have a number of causes including, as the report notes: &quot;different bodies in central Government have very different business models to deliver their different services&quot;. I believe that, given the MOJ's business model, this level of headquarters expenditure is reasonable in supporting a wider business area and providing support and challenge to help the board and Ministers to achieve outcomes efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.858W.7/5">The MOJ supports the work on benchmarking, and is working with other Government Departments to help us to better understand the variations in costs these data illustrate and to drive further efficiencies across the MOJ through the shared services programme started in July 2009. The MOJ also has in place plans, annexed to 'Putting the Frontline First', to improve the efficiency of both its finance and human resources functions across its headquarters, agencies and non-departmental public bodies. These include moving all human resources and finance transaction processing into a single shared service.</p>

However, any provider who had their allocation of matter starts reduced following the review can request a review by the Legal Services Commission and present evidence in support of a request to reinstate matter starts, including data regarding seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations vary greatly from firm to firm and among categories of law and therefore it is not possible to apply a standard formula to take these into account.</p>

Certain senior posts in the regional teams within NOMS headquarters are now reserved for probation service personnel on secondment. In addition, NOMS is developing a facility for vacant posts, where appropriate, to be simultaneously advertised internally to Ministry of Justice employees, and as secondment opportunities to probation service employees.</p>

	<p pid="a.866W.2/1">Contracts are in place with two groups of researchers for evaluation of different aspects of the Integrated Drug Treatment System (IDTS)-this will include the impact of methadone maintenance in particular. The contracts were let in 2008 and each group of researchers will submit a final report by April 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.866W.2/2">All accredited drug treatment programmes available in prisons aim ultimately for abstinence and are based on good practice found in the community. Offenders in custody are subject to drug testing and usually receive a range of interventions and support aimed at reducing reoffending. It is practically difficult to pinpoint the precise effect of any one of these interventions on overall drug misuse or reoffending. Evaluations to date specifically of prison drug treatment programmes run in England and Wales are limited and have not always met the highest methodological standards. However, they suggest that accredited programmes can reduce reoffending (Ramsay, M. (ed) (2003) Prisoners' Drug Use and Treatment: Seven Research Studies. Home Office Research Study 267. London: Home Office). International evidence supports these findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.868W.6/1">The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation contains strong provisions to minimise the amount of animal testing by EU-based companies when compiling their substance registration dossiers. These require that animal tests be the last resort, with the use of non-animal test methods instead wherever possible, and prohibit the repetition and duplication of animal tests. REACH also requires that when preparing registration dossiers, data derived from animal tests must be shared between all members of a Substance Information Exchange Forum (SIEF) in order to achieve this. Where further tests are necessary to complete registrations for substances on the market in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per year, then proposals must be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for approval before any such tests are undertaken, so pre-emptive testing would be illegal. Part of this approval process involves a 45-day public consultation on the test proposals, so that third parties have the opportunity to provide information on the substance that would render the proposed animal tests unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/2">In order to help companies address the issue of using animal tests when preparing registration dossiers, a short guidance note has been published on the DEFRA website:</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/chemicals/reach/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/chemicals/reach/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/4">which draws attention to these legal requirements, and suggests a number of possible non-animal alternative test methods including chemical grouping and read-across approaches, use of (Quantitative) Structural Activity Relationships (QSARs), and in vitro tests. Information can also be provided by way of a weight of evidence assessment, and certain tests specified in REACH may also be waived where it can be shown that exposure of humans or the environment to a substance is insignificant or absent.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/5">It is important that companies remember that they should not be undertaking animal testing for REACH registration before their test proposals are approved by ECHA as being necessary. Companies should actively look for alternatives to animal testing wherever possible, and refer to the REACH Test Methods Regulation for what is available for use. Other internationally-valid non-animal test methods that do not appear in the Test Methods Regulation may also be used. However, where animal tests are the last resort, then companies should use the most refined method possible to reduce the numbers of animals involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.868W.6/6">ECHA has published detailed guidance on data-sharing and information requirements for the REACH registration process on its website, and the UK REACH Competent Authority (provided by the Health and Safety Executive) is also shortly to publish a guidance leaflet for industry on animal testing and use of alternatives on its website. This will explain the REACH testing obligations, help with identifying the most appropriate test method, with information on the various available non-animal test methods.</p>

	<p pid="a.870W.2/1">DEFRA has a long term commitment to reduce its carbon emissions. Performance in 2008-09 shows that DEFRA's carbon emissions from offices has reduced by 18 per cent. on the 1999-2000 baseline, exceeding the 2010 Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) target by 6 per cent. Since 2006-07 the Department has delivered a reduction of 4 per cent. carbon emissions (year on year) from its estate through its Carbon Reduction Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/2">DEFRA's achievements have been recognised through the award of the Carbon Trust Standard in May 2008, where the Department was one of the first 12 pathfinder organisations to receive the award. This built upon the earlier success of the Department achieving Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme (EEAS) status in July 2007. Both of these awards clearly demonstrate that DEFRA has an ongoing commitment to long term, year on year carbon emissions reductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/3">The Department is expecting to continue to deliver significant year on year savings, anticipated at as much as 6 per cent. year on year.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/4">A strategic long term investment plan allows the delivery of projects which provide long term benefits through reducing energy demand and minimising the need to reinvest in the short to medium term. To disrupt these long term plans in order to achieve 10:10 would impact negatively on DEFRA's ability to achieve its long term goals and would not deliver value for money. However, the combination of DEFRA's long term plans, a minimum 6 per cent. reduction in 2010 and a short term call to action all constitute a credible contribution to tackling climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.870W.2/5">In light of the above, achieving a 10 per cent. saving across the DEFRA Estate in a single year would require my Department to divert significant funds from its long term delivery plan; therefore The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its Executive Agencies have not signed up to the 10:10 campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.872W.0/31">CEFAS has relatively higher non consolidated pay when compared as a percentage against the DEFRA network, because they have specifically worked to structure a total rewards package with a greater non consolidated pay element, that is directly performance based and must be re-earned each year. This places a greater link between performance and reward and while their percentage of non consolidated pay is larger than others this is more than offset by their consolidated pay (i.e. salaries) which is low relative to the DEFRA network and Whitehall.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.2/1">There are various measures which create duties to address contamination, depending on the circumstances of the case. Contaminated land legislation (Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) makes persons liable for the cost of remediating a site if they caused or knowingly permitted it to become contaminated land. This allows direct action to be taken by regulators, and it creates an incentive for operators to avoid causing contamination in the first place, and to clean it up voluntarily if it occurs. For contamination caused after <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-01">1 March 2009</phrase>, the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 would also be applicable in similar circumstances and to achieve similar objectives to Part 2A of the 1990 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.2/2">Legislation also directly applies to prevent contamination during the operation of a petrol station. Under the Groundwater Regulations 2009 there is a code of practice to prevent hazardous substances from reaching groundwater from underground tanks, such as those at petrol stations. The Environment Agency can serve a notice on the operator if it is likely that the code of practice is not being complied with. The Agency also has powers under the Anti-pollution Works Notices Regulations 1999 to serve notices where there is a threat of pollution to controlled waters or to require clean up where pollution of controlled waters has occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.2/3">Where a petrol forecourt is operated under a rental agreement, there may be further duties on the operator to deal with contamination as an indirect result of legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.5/2">Between <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December 2009</phrase>, 49 people have been arrested attempting to gain employment, or working specifically at the Olympic park and athletes' village sites, 40 of these were never actually employed at the sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.5/3">Prior to April 2009, no data exclusively for arrests on the Olympic park site is available. Arrest figures collected between April 2008 and March 2009 are for projects in Stratford and the surrounding area, and include the Olympic park and Olympic village. Only an aggregate figure is available for this period and a total of 138 foreign nationals seeking to gain employment or working at these locations (including the Stratford City Westfield development) were arrested on suspicion of working in the UK without permission or presenting false documentation during this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.5/4">These figures do not constitute part of National Statistics as they are based on internal management information. The information has not been quality assured under National Statistics protocols and should be treated as provisional and subject to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.5/5">The responsibility for ensuring employees have the right to work in the UK rests with the employer. Since April 2008, UKBA staff have been working with the Olympic Delivery Authority and contractors to support the site security process of checking that people employed on the Olympic park and athletes village hold genuine identity documents and are legally entitled to work in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.5/6">Three employers have been issued with Notices of Potential Liability for employing illegal workers and failing to carry out the appropriate checks to confirm that their employees are entitled to work in the UK. Two have been fined, one was found not to be liable.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-05-06.16"><i> Official Report</i>, column 16WS</phrase>, as part of work to consider the optimal base-porting arrangements for the less complex variants of the Future Surface Combatant (FSC), the Department would examine whether there is any case to change the base-porting of the Type 23 frigates. Under the Maritime Change Programme, key stakeholders, including representatives from Portsmouth and Plymouth city councils as well as naval base staff, are supporting Warwick university in developing a shared socio-economic model, which will help to greater understand the implications of any potential future change to warship base-porting arrangements at Portsmouth and Devonport.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.11/2">The contiguous impact of three principal scenarios is to be initially investigated: the move of Trafalgar Class submarines from HM Naval Base Devonport to HM Naval Base Clyde; the decommissioning of Type 22 Frigates and any potential change to the current Type 23 base-porting arrangements. We aim to have this model ready in spring 2010 to help inform debate and decision making. The impact of any proposed base-porting changes across the Defence Lines of Development, including accommodation, support, personnel and infrastructure, will be also assessed during the decision making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.11/3">Currently, no date has been agreed by when an announcement on any potential Type 23 base-porting arrangements will be made. As part of any future announcement, we will be able to confirm that there will be no base porting changes for around five years as we are committed to providing sufficient notice for Royal Navy personnel and their families and the wider community to plan for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.890W.14/2">The Major Projects Report 2009 reported delays to the Astute Class Programme which will lead to cost growth and reduction in planned submarine availability. Of the seven planned Astute Class submarines the first four boats have been ordered. Boat 1 (Astute) is currently undergoing an extensive programme of Sea Trials while Boats 2 to 4 (Ambush, Artful and Audacious) are in various stages of construction. Orders for long lead items for Boat 5 and the reactor core for Boat 6 have also been placed.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.14/3">Following the delays, work to re-baseline the Astute Programme is ongoing and the final impact on both the overall programme and individual boat build profile can only be confirmed once detailed joint planning and cost analysis work has been completed and MOD investment and HM Treasury re-approval has been obtained.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.14/4">A competition for the Tanker element of the MARS Programme was originally started in late 2007. The competition was cancelled in March 2009 and subsequent work to review the procurement strategy concluded that a more open approach, considering a range of possible solutions is more likely to secure best value for money. A new international competition for the Tanker element of MARS is therefore under way and Pre-Qualification Questionnaires from a number of companies/consortia are currently being evaluated. This work is nearing completion and, once internal MOD approval to proceed to the next stage of the competition has been granted, invitations to submit outline proposals will be issued; this is expected to be during spring 2010. On current plans the contract is due to be awarded in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.14/5">The later classes of MARS ships, Fleet Solid Support and Amphibious Combat Support, remain uncommitted at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.901W.2/1">Community Safety Accreditation Schemes allow Chief Officers to designate limited powers to employees of organisations which contribute towards community safety and tackling antisocial behaviour (ASB) such as park wardens, train operators and private security guards. These powers enhance the contribution of people in roles that are already concerned with keeping communities safe; and mean that there are more people on the streets with powers to tackle and not tolerate ASB.</p>

The Home Office does conduct an annual audit of persons accredited by each police force. This is a snapshot of accredited persons at one time and does not represent all people accredited over time. Figures for accredited persons in the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency are collected separately as theirs is a specialist role with a single power granted to stop vehicles for testing.

	<p pid="a.914W.0/2">Section 113 B (4) of Part V of the Police Act 1997 requires that in addition to criminal record information from the Police National Computer (PNC), Enhanced certificates should include any other information which a chief police officer considers might be relevant to the job application in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.914W.0/3">This is usually non-conviction information deriving from local force records and is referred to as 'approved information'; chief officers are obliged to provide such information for Enhanced certificates under the Act. Where disclosed, information of this nature is considered by the police to represent a factual record of previous events that an employer in the most sensitive type of occupation should be aware of in making an employment decision affecting the most vulnerable groups of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.914W.0/4">Factors that would be taken into consideration when making decisions to disclose would include, but not be restricted to, the position the individual is currently applying for, the age of the information, whether the information might be directly relevant to the assessment of the person's suitability to work with children and whether it is reasonable to disclose the information, bearing in mind the human rights of the individuals concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.914W.0/5">In making such assessments, the chief officers follow guidelines including, Home Office circular 5/2005-&quot;Criminal Records Bureau: Local Checks by Police Forces for the Purpose of Enhanced checks&quot; and this has been augmented by a process known as the Quality Assurance Framework. The circular makes clear that consideration has been given to a person's right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this regard there is a section in the circular which details what factors should be considered in determining relevancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.914W.0/6">The Quality Assurance Framework (QAF) is a standardised approach to processing local intelligence information held by Police Force Disclosure Units and was developed by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the CRB. QAF provides a step-by-step process framework that ensures that information is considered consistently and in the same way every time. Searches performed on local systems using the QAF Framework and document set produce an audit trail that can be used for quality assurance and to assure QAF compliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.917W.9/12">The catering contractor for 1 Horse Guards Road introduced a food waste recycling programme in March 2008 under which food waste is removed from the building and is transported to a biogas plant where it is subjected to an anaerobic digestion process. In addition, the process produces fertilizer and electricity as by-products.</p>
	<p pid="a.917W.9/13">Previously, volumes of food waste had been calculated using the industry standard of food produced but not used and was measured on the basis that each bag of food waste weighed around 3kg on average. When the food waste recycling programme was introduced in March 2008 for 1 HGR, the system changed from counting bags to physically weighing the waste before removing them from the site, and this explains the vastly increased figure from what was reported in earlier years.</p>

Every six months, on a commercially confidential basis, departments review supplier performance on key ICT projects: one of the areas for review being 'delivery to cost parameters'.</p>

	<p pid="a.936W.2/1">The opportunities to reduce the carbon emissions and heating bills of residential craft homes are limited due to the inherent lack of scope for key energy efficiency measures, such as cavity wall and loft insulation. Moreover, under the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT), energy suppliers are only obliged to promote energy saving measures to residences connected directly to main energy networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.2/2">However, owners of residential craft are able to take advantage of CERT subsidies if purchasing certain DIY materials and energy saving technologies. Items such as insulation panels and low energy light bulbs frequently receive heavy subsidies under CERT in national retail outlets and are available at discounted rates to all consumers.</p>

The MRWS White Paper makes clear that no decision on whether geological disposal will be considered by the Independent Planning Commission (IPC) has yet been made. However, the Government are currently inclined to look towards applying the new planning system and we consider that a geological disposal facility is likely to be regarded as a nationally significant infrastructure project. Should the Government decide in future that radioactive waste should be dealt with by the IPC, the Government would set out the national policy in a National Policy Statement, which would be finalised following an appraisal of sustainability, public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.2/6">Analysis of the data suggests there are pockets of potential for generating energy from tidal resource, in particular off the Isle of Wight and the Dorset coast, but these are at a level significantly lower than elsewhere in the UK. At present the South coast is not viewed by the commercial sector as a prime area for tidal resource but as technologies develop we may see devices which are well suited to the lower velocity of tidal flow available from the region.</p>

Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis. These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> Secondary diagnosis<br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Assignment of episodes to y</i><i> ears</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

Patients may qualify for an NHS sight test on more than one criterion. However, they would only be recorded against one criterion on the form.</p>
	<p pid="a.946W.11/8" class="indent">2. Patients are more likely to be recorded according to their clinical need rather than their age. For example, a patient aged over 60, with glaucoma is likely to be recorded in the glaucoma category only. The count by eligibility is therefore approximate. Patients may also have had more than one sight test in the specified time period.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.6/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The &quot;NHS Constitution&quot; contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and a NHS Health Check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Slough constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/3">Figures for October 2009 show that in Berkshire East Primary Care Trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/4" class="indent">92 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/5" class="indent">97 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/6" class="indent">In September 2009, at Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 98.6 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/7" class="indent">Between September 1997 and September 2008, the number of consultants at Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 76 to 120. Between September 1997 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 1,154 to 1,386.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/8" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008, the number of general practitioners per 100,000 within Berkshire East PCT has increased from 54.9 to 62.3.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/9" class="indent">96.8 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/10" class="indent">Berkshire East PCT opened its GP-led health centre on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase> at Upton Hospital in Slough. The Slough Walk-in Centre offers longer opening hours, meaning that any member of the public will be able to see a GP or nurse between 8 am and 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/11" class="indent">There are two private finance initiative (PFI) schemes in the area that serve this constituency: a &#163;19 million PFI scheme from Berkshire West PCT that opened in March 2004 and a &#163;30 million PFI scheme from Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that opened in April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.957W.6/12">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Slough will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>

	<p pid="a.965W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the Commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-20">20 January 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/3" class="indent">As Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your question on what the policy of the Charity Commission is on undertaking investigations of whether schools with charitable status are promoting the public benefit; and what statutory provisions govern such Charity Commission investigations (312287).</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/4" class="indent">In July last year, the Charity Commission published public benefit assessments of twelve charities, which included five charitable fee-charging schools. We conducted these assessments on a co-operative basis with the charities concerned. In the case of the schools, we worked with two that had volunteered to be assessed and with three that agreed to be assessed after we had approached them.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/5" class="indent">In terms of our policy and the context in which this is set, we carried out these assessments following the Charities Act 2006 which:</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/6" class="indent">changed the definition of charity by removing the presumption that certain categories of charity, including those which advance education, are for the public benefit. The revised definition means that all charities have to show that they have purposes which are for the public benefit; and</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/7" class="indent">gave the Charity Commission, as the independent regulator of charities, a statutory objective to promote awareness and understanding of the operation of the public benefit requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/8" class="indent">These public benefit assessments are part of our work in furtherance of this statutory objective. We explain our policy on carrying out these assessments in section H of Charities and Public Benefit which, following extensive consultation, we published in January 2008. It is guidance to which all charities must have regard and which sets out the approach and factors we take in all those cases where we are looking at the public benefit of an organisation. In summary, we said that:</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/9" class="indent">in order to provide clear information about how the public benefit requirement is met by different groups of charities, we will issue guidance about what public benefit means for different types of charity and that such guidance would include pilot assessments of the public benefit of individual charities in different sub-sectors; and</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/10" class="indent">we were likely to carry out detailed public benefit assessments on charities most affected by the removal of the presumption of public benefit and about which public benefit concerns were raised during the debate on the Charities Bill, such as fee-charging charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/11" class="indent">These first assessments have provided practical examples on the application of the public benefit principles and guidance which should help other school charities to meet the requirement themselves. We think that, at this stage, these are sufficient for schools and we have not included schools in the second round of public benefit assessments which we started in December. Public benefit will, however, continue to be an essential element of our separate, reactive casework with charities (including schools) which we would not routinely publicise. In these cases we will explore public benefit in more detail only where:</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/12" class="indent">it is necessary to do so (because, for example, we must be satisfied that the revised aims of a charity will continue to be charitable before agreeing to a change of purpose), and</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/13" class="indent">there is a high risk that public benefit will be difficult to demonstrate-examples of high risk factors include private benefits, novel or controversial purposes, narrowly defined beneficiary classes and high fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/14" class="indent">In terms of the statutory provisions governing these assessments, the Commission has power, both at common law and under the Charities Act 1993, to do anything which may fairly be regarded as necessary, conducive or incidental to carrying out its statutory objectives and functions. Section 1D of the Charities Act 1993 (as inserted by the Charities Act 2006) requires us (so far as is necessary) to have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice in the performance of our functions. I should also mention, for the sake of completeness only, that we have formal inquiry and protection powers under section 8 and 18 of the Charities Act 1993: we have not used these powers in relation to charitable schools and public benefit and would only do so where serious misconduct or mismanagement is involved or where it is necessary to protect charity assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/15" class="indent">We published a short briefing for MPs about these assessments last July, and I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/16" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.971W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-26">26 January 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your request to the Minister for the Cabinet Office, what changes have been made to the mechanisms by which information on marital status has been collected by the Office for National Statistics since 1997. (313090)</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/4" class="indent">Information on marital status can be broadly separated into information that provides estimates of the population by marital status at a given point in time ('stocks'), and information on the movement of people between different marital status categories over a given period of time ('flows'). Both types of information are collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) through a variety of sources, and both types of information are used to calculate population estimates and projections by marital status. For most statistics on marital status, ONS currently publishes statistics for England and Wales only.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/5" class="indent">With regard to both stocks and flows, the main change since 1997 in the collection of information on marital status has been the introduction of civil partnerships. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase> in the UK. The Act enables same-sex couples aged 16 and over to obtain legal recognition of their relationship. Other than this change, the collection of information on marital status has remained largely unchanged since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/6" class="indent">The main mechanisms for the collection of data on stock estimates by marital status are social surveys and censuses. Following the introduction of the Civil Partnership Act, questions in ONS social surveys (such as the Annual Population Survey) have been changed to allow the collection of information on the currently and previously civil partnered population. Information on revised survey questions is available in the following document:</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Harmonised Concepts and Questions for Social Data Sources: Primary Standards-Demographic information, household composition and relationships&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/harmonisation/primary-concepts-and-questions/P2.pdf">www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/harmonisation/primary-concepts-and-questions/P2.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/9" class="indent">The main mechanism for the collection of data on changes in marital status (flows) is the registration of vital events. Data on birth, death, marriage and civil partnership registrations are collected by the General Register Office (GRO), which supplies data to ONS for statistical purposes. Similarly, data on divorces and civil partnership dissolutions are supplied to ONS by the HM Court Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.971W.2/10" class="indent">The main change in marital status vital event registration since 1997 has been the collection of data on the formation and legal dissolution of civil partnerships. In addition, changes have been made to the registration of deaths (to identify deaths of the currently and previously civil partnered population) and the registration of births by parents' marital status (related to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act). Information on civil partnerships is available at the link below.</p>

	<p pid="a.980W.0/1">The Department is continuing to work with the Department for Work and Pensions to raise the profile of enterprise among jobseekers, including young women, and help them access the advice and support they need. Building on the success of the self-employment support provided under the &quot;Six Month Offer&quot;, access to intensive business start-up support and advice through Business Link is due to be extended to those who have been unemployed for 13 weeks or more. In addition, eligible jobseekers will be able to receive the tax-free Self-Employment Credit of &#163;50 a week for up to 16 weeks to help with the transition from benefits to work, including self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.980W.0/2">Female entrepreneurship is also being encouraged through the &quot;Flying Start-Make It Happen&quot; programme, where 5,000 more places have been made available to provide unemployed graduates with the help and support they need to become successful entrepreneurs and start their own business.</p>
