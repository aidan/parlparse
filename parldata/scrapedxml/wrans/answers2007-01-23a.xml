	<p pid="a.1613W.3/1">British Energy is responsible for estimating its future clean up costs. These estimates are subject to review and approval by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The NDA has approved the most recent estimates relating to British Energy's Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors and to longer term waste management and is in the process of reviewing the estimates for Sizewell B.</p>
	<p pid="a.1613W.3/2">As a result of the restructuring of the company, Government will underwrite the Nuclear Liabilities Fund, British Energy's segregated decommissioning fund, to the extent that its liabilities exceed its assets. This fund, into which BE makes certain contributions, covers the costs of decommissioning British Energy's nuclear power stations as well as certain other liabilities relating to waste management. In its annual accounts, the Department records a contingent liability or asset in relation to this undertaking. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, the Department recorded a contingent asset of &pound;4.1 billion. This contingent asset is the net of the forecast decommissioning, spent fuel and waste management liabilities to be borne by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund, offset against the value of the assets (largely linked to British Energy's future performance) held by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund to meet these liabilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1614W.3/1">The Government remain fully committed to raising product standards and encouraging consumers to use the most energy efficient domestic appliances available. In this, the Government support the Energy Saving Trust's activities to provide advice to consumers about the energy efficiency of the products they use. The Government also support the trust's work in endorsing and vigorously promoting the most energy efficient products under its energy efficiency recommended scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614W.3/2">The Government's Market Transformation programme (MTP) supports measures such as the mandatory EU energy labelling scheme which, for a range of appliances, has been mandatory since <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>. Energy labels provide clear and easily recognisable information about the energy consumption and performance of domestic products on a seven-point scale ranging from &quot;A&quot; (most efficient) to &quot;G&quot; (least efficient), thus enabling consumers to make a considered choice when purchasing energy consuming products. Furthermore, minimum energy performance standards have resulted in the removal of the most inefficient appliances from the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614W.3/3">Take up of the most energy efficient products has also been encouraged through the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC)&mdash;an obligation on energy suppliers to promote improvements in household energy efficiency. The first phase (to 2005) generated &pound;600 million worth of investment in household energy efficiency measures. Suppliers' targets were doubled in the second phase (2005-08) and is now generating &pound;400 million of investment in energy efficiency measures each year. The commitment has succeeded in transforming the market for wet and refrigeration appliances and led to significant increases in sales of efficient condensing boilers. The 2006 climate change programme signalled our intention to seek a further increase of 50-100 per cent. in the target for the next phase of EEC in 2008 to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614W.3/4">Recent revisions to building regulations have also helped drive the deployment of energy efficiency measures such as glazing, light fittings and condensing boilers, with revisions to standards in 2002 and 2006 improving energy efficiency standards by 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1614W.3/5">All of the aforementioned are under constant review as we work to encourage consumers and producers to move towards more energy efficient products.</p>

	<p pid="a.1616W.5/1">The low carbon buildings programme is divided into two phases. Phase 1, with a total budget of &pound;28.5 million aims to demonstrate how energy efficiency and microgeneration technologies can be combined to create low carbon buildings. Phase 2, with a total budget of &pound;50 million aims to drive down costs, making the market for microgeneration technologies more sustainable in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.1616W.5/2">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October 2006</phrase> that we would be re-allocating &pound;6.2 million of the total &pound;28.5 million funding for Phase 1 to householders, giving a total household pot of &pound;12.7 million. On projected demand levels this should allow householder funding to continue until June 2008. By this time, some of our wider measures to promote microgeneration should be taking hold, and we believe the sector may have matured to a point where householder grants are no longer necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1616W.5/3">Funding for other projects under Phase 1 is expected to continue until March 2009. The Government plan to commit funding for Phase 2 projects until March 2008.</p>

These are plans setting out how we will carry out the Disability Equality Duty, monitor, and report on progress. In particular this includes our arrangements for gathering information on the effect of our policies and practices on the recruitment, development and retention of our disabled employees, including those with mental health conditions, and making use of that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1626W.3/2">The following arrangements are set out in my Department's disability equality scheme to support disabled employees including those with mental health conditions. As a member of the 'Employers Forum on Disability', we welcome applications from disabled job applicants, and we are an authorised user of the Job Centre Plus Disability Symbol. As part of our symbol commitments, we guarantee to interview all candidates with a disability who choose to apply under the scheme and satisfy the minimum criteria for both externally and internally advertised posts. Advertisements are placed as widely as possible, using diverse media to capture applicants from under-represented groups. In addition, my Department's commitment to supporting the Workstep programme and the New Deal initiative (key elements of the Government's strategy on welfare to work) encourages managers to take on disabled people, thus increasing their employability. My Department's disability network provides a voice for disabled employees to the development of new employment policies and practices that promote equality of opportunity. We have in place local disability advisers who help and advise managers and disabled job applicants/employees in making reasonable adjustments under the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>

Other than this, there are no specific qualifications or experience required for appointment to the Boundary Commission for England. In practice, the nature of the role makes it highly desirable for applicants for appointment to provide evidence of an ability to: understand and apply legislation; give objective consideration to sometimes lengthy representations, many of which will express conflicting views; and deliver recommendations supported by sound reasoning. There are a range of experiences that might help individuals to develop such abilities. Appointment of local government boundary commissioners in England is a matter for the Electoral Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1629W.9/1">The concept of PFI passes risk to a private sector partner who is better able to manage these risks. The primary determinant of whether to proceed with a PFI approach is the assessment of the value for money of the bidder's proposal against a public sector comparator on a whole life, risk adjusted basis. MOD relies on open competition to drive out value for money and ensure that any price premium paid is appropriate for the risk transferred.</p>

	<p pid="a.1630W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. This consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SFC) score for the property. SFC scores are banded into categories 1 to 4 from the best condition to the worst. SFC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1630W.6/2">We are confident that the current SFC system used by MOD fully takes into account the four basic tenets of the Decent Homes Standard. In short, these are to be fit for habitation by meeting statutory housing regulations, to be in a reasonable state of repair, to have reasonably modern facilities and to have a reasonable degree of thermal comfort. Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve standard 1 for condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1630W.6/3">It is for these reasons that it is not the intention to use the less demanding Decent Homes Standard and to continue to use a more stringent set of criteria, endeavouring to meet the high standards that service personnel deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.1633W.0/1">For the Army, longer service separation allowance (LSSA) and the associated bonuses are scheduled to be replaced by the longer separation allowance (LSA) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have already transferred to LSA as part of an ongoing roll-out of a new tri-service allowance package. The new operational bonus has nothing to do with this reform of existing allowances. There is therefore no question of 'giving with one hand and taking away with the other'. The new bonus is coming out of entirely new money&mdash;over &pound;60 million this year. The reform of existing allowances, decided three years ago and endorsed by the independent armed forces pay review body, was not about 'cuts'&mdash;it was about making the system fairer&mdash;all the money stays in armed forces allowances and benefits. So overall our soldiers, sailors and airmen are now over &pound;60 million better off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.0/2">LSA is a fairer system and has a number of advantages over the LSSA and AT/AT+ bonus system it replaces. For example, LSA is less divisive and removes the unfairness of soldiers on the same deployment either just qualifying for or missing out on the accumulated turbulence (AT) and/or accumulated turbulence plus(AT+) bonuses. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> LSA will also be payable immediately, with no initial qualifying period, as opposed to 12 months service under LSSA. This benefits soldiers (and sailors, airmen and airwomen) who deploy on an operational tour in their first year of service who, by the end of a six month tour, would have received 180 days extra payment (&pound;1,080, before tax, at &pound;6.02 per day; LSA Level 1 and LSSA Basic Rate are both &pound;6.02 per day) and accrued more days of qualifying service so that they would qualify for the next level of payment earlier than they would have done under LSSA. Under both LSSA and LSA a soldier moves to the next rate after each 300 days qualifying service. More significantly, there are 14 rates of LSA rather than the three of LSSA, with a top rate of &pound;25.42 as opposed to &pound;12.82.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.0/3">The financial impact on an individual soldier of removing the accumulated turbulence (AT) and accumulated turbulence plus (AT+) bonuses is dependent upon how long they have been serving, how many days qualifying separation they have accrued and where they are in the rolling two window that is used to calculate the AT bonus calculation. AT bonus is paid after 280 days qualifying separation in a rolling period and AT+ after a total of 365 days qualifying separation in a rolling two-year period. The AT and AT+ bonus are both worth &pound;1,350 before tax. The vast majority of soldiers did not qualify for the bonuses on a normal deployment pattern. For example, only 1 per cent. of the Army qualified for the AT+ bonus in 2005. The number of soldiers serving 600 days in a two-year period is very infrequent and estimated to be no more than a handful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.0/4">In these rare cases the net change of the move to the new system depends on length of service. Under the LSA rules a soldier who accrues considerable QS during the course of a career enjoys significant financial benefit compared with LSSA. This is demonstrated by the following example cases:</p>
	<p pid="a.1633W.0/5">Junior soldier serving 600 days separated service in a two year period, initial six-month tour within first 12 months service.</p>

The SBA would also need to work closely with the Cyprus authorities to develop the appropriate assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1638W.2/24">Before 2004-05, the flood risk management function of the EA was funded primarily through a combination of grants from DEFRA for specific projects and levies on local authorities. The latter, which were largely supported by revenue support grant from the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, are not included in the table. Both forms of funding were largely replaced by grant in aid from DEFRA from 2004-05 onwards. The EA decides how best to use grant in aid to achieve outcomes agreed with Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1638W.2/25">The table excludes revenue spend by LAs supported by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This covers local authority own spend and their levies to the EA and IDBs. The table excludes expenditure on capital projects for coast protection. These often also provide significant benefit in terms of reducing risk of flooding from the sea but it would not be possible to identify the proportion resulting in flood risk benefit without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1638W.2/26">I regret figures prior to 1995-96 are no longer available. Funding after 2007-08 is being considered in the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1640W.2/1">The directive provides for two types of liability. Liability for environmental damage from certain categories of occupational activity is implicitly 'strict'. All other activities are expressly subject to fault-based liability. Categories of activity for which liability is implicitly 'strict' include two relating to genetically modified organisms and micro-organisms, and are defined in annex III of the Environmental Liability Directive as:</p>
	<p pid="a.1640W.2/2" class="indent">i. &quot;Any contained use, including transport, involving genetically modified micro-organisms as defined by Council Directive 90/219/EEC of <phrase class="date" code="1990-04-23">23 April 1990</phrase> on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1640W.2/3" class="indent">ii. &quot;Any deliberate release into the environment, transport and placing on the market of genetically modified organisms as defined by Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1640W.2/4">However, this requirement for liability to be 'strict' can be qualified in certain circumstances. For example, the directive provides that member states may allow the operator not to bear the costs of remedial action where he was not at fault or negligent in circumstances where the damage was caused by an emission or event authorised by a permit. The Government's provisional preference in relation to the exercise of this discretion is set out in the consultation document, available from the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/env-liability/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/env-liability/index.htm</a></p>

	<p pid="a.1641W.0/1">Emissions from deforestation in developing countries are currently not covered by the Kyoto protocol because of concerns that forestry protection projects would displace the deforestation elsewhere, with little or no net gain. Discussions are under way on how emissions from deforestation may be treated for future commitment periods. There are a number of proposals under discussion that would provide incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation below 'national' (rather than project specific) baselines. Achievement relative to a national baseline would take account of any displacement of deforestation within a country. One issue is whether incentivised activities should give rise to formal offsets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1643W.2/4">The UK's opposition to Norway's commercial whaling programme has been consistent and strong. In April 2006, the UK led a d&eacute;marche against Norway's announcement of a record increase in the number of North Atlantic minke whales they planned to catch last year. As it transpired, Norway only caught 546 of its planned catch of 1,052.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643W.2/5">UK officials at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in June 2006 were in the forefront of the opposition to Japan's unsuccessful attempts to overturn the moratorium. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs engage in international lobbying to encourage other countries to join the IWC and oppose commercial whaling and lethal scientific whaling. In December 2006 the UK joined a d&eacute;marche of 27 countries requesting Japan to reconsider its planned whaling programme for the next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643W.2/6">The UK led the international condemnation of Iceland's decision to resume commercial whaling. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase>, our ambassador in Reykjavik led a multinational d&eacute;marche of 25 countries plus the European Commission, making clear the extreme disappointment felt by those parties at Iceland's decision, and urging Iceland to abandon its current operations. My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare, (Mr. Bradshaw), summoned the Icelandic ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October 2006</phrase> to protest in the strongest possible terms against Iceland's activities.</p>

Recently, local authorities were advised by means of my Department's regular bulletin that the qualifying threshold (25 full-time equivalent young people) and the weekly rate (&pound;100) that applied during the 2005-06 grant year will be continued in 2006-07. The effect of this will be to ensure that local authorities with above average numbers are able to access the grant on the same terms as last year.</p>

In 1996-97, some 10,200 teachers were given premature retirement and a further 4,980 retired early on the grounds of ill health. Corresponding figures for 2005-06 are 6,640 and 1,470 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1649W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, new provisions have been introduced into the Teachers' Pension Scheme that will provide teachers with greater choice and flexibility over the way they manage the transition from work to retirement. These changes will allow teachers to wind down in the years leading up to retirement, for example by moving to part-time working or taking a post with less responsibility, while protecting their pension rights. New phased retirement provisions have also been introduced that will enable teachers to remain in teaching in a reduced capacity while at the same time drawing some of their pension benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1649W.2/3">Work force reforms, the continuing drive to reduce bureaucracy in schools and these new pension provisions will serve to encourage older teachers to extend their working lives in ways that better support their personal circumstances and in doing so will have a positive impact on teacher retention.</p>

	<p pid="a.1651W.5/1">As a result of changes introduced in September 2004, modern foreign languages is no longer a compulsory subject in the Key Stage 4 curriculum. Instead pupils have a statutory entitlement to study languages. The non-statutory guidelines, first published by QCA in 2004 as part of the Guidance document &quot;Modern Foreign Languages in the Key Stage 4 Curriculum&quot;, provide a non-statutory framework for the teaching of modern foreign languages, which is similar to a programme of study. The QCA Guidance is for head teachers, curriculum managers and teachers with responsibility for modern foreign languages in schools with Key Stage 4 provision. It is expected that regard will be had to the guidance, though schools are not bound to follow the non-statutory guidelines. The content of study for the range of qualifications, approved under sections 96/98 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which pupils may take at Key Stage 4 varies with some courses emphasising certain aspects more than others.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652W.2/1">All secondary schools are required to set ambitious targets for the performance of their pupils at Key Stage 4&mdash;notably the numbers of pupils that will get five or more good GCSEs or equivalent qualifications, and from 2008, the number of pupils that will get five or more good GCSEs or equivalent qualifications including English and maths. School Improvement Partners, typically high quality head teachers, will work closely with a school, ensuring that it identifies the support it needs to evaluate its performance and make improvements that enable all children to fulfil their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.2/2">All schools have access to high quality curriculum support and professional development opportunities for staff in the core subjects of English, maths, science and ICT provided by the Government's Secondary National Strategy. The National Strategy also provides expert subject consultant support for those schools facing particular challenges in those subjects. The Government supports programmes that help underperforming schools work in collaboration with excellent schools to drive up their performance, with a particular focus on use of performance data and sharing of good practice. For schools below the Government's minimum floor targets, we have a range of strategies for ensuring the performance of these schools increases rapidly, including the replacement of the school by an Academy, the federation of the school with another stronger, often specialist, school, and bespoke packages of support focusing on improving the leadership and management, teaching and learning at the school. We are monitoring the impact of the support currently in place at each of these schools to ensure that it has the necessary impact. We are also aiming to identify those schools that are currently above our floor targets but are at highest risk of missing them in future years, so we can provide them with additional support now to ensure that their performance improves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652W.2/3">Our approach has been highly successful&mdash;as evidence from the figures published last week suggests&mdash;58.5 per cent. of pupils aged 15 achieved 5 A*-C GCSEs or equivalent qualifications in 2006, an increase of 13.4 percentage points since 1997; 45.3 per cent. of pupils achieved this standard including English and maths, a 9.7 percentage point improvement since 1997. The number of all-ability schools where more than 70 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs or equivalent qualifications has risen seven fold since 1997&mdash;up from 83 to 604; and the number of schools where fewer than 25 per cent. of pupils achieve this standard is now 47, down from 616 in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.1654W.11/1">Since the introduction of the National Literacy Strategy in 1998, there has been a 14 percentage point improvement in the number of pupils achieving the target level for their age in the Key Stage 2 English tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.11/2">To build on this success, the new Primary National Strategy literacy framework was made available to schools October 2006 and will support faster progression in English. The new framework fully reflects the recommendations from Jim Rose's independent review of early reading which advocates 'high quality phonic work' as the key means for teaching beginner readers how to read and spell words. The implementation of the new framework is backed by a comprehensive programme of professional development for head teachers and subject leaders in schools. The Primary National Strategy also continues to improve the focus and accessibility of its comprehensive range of teaching and training support including through expert consultants at the local level in order to improve primary results at both key stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1654W.11/3">Furthermore the 'Every Child a Reader' pilot, which provides intensive support for those children with significant difficulties in reading, will be rolled out nationally benefiting 30,000 children a year by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.1665W.2/2">During this year, my Department will be offering additional challenge and support, through the National Strategies, to 436 secondary schools, located across 54 local authorities, which have been identified as having particularly high levels of persistent absence. The National Strategies will be supporting these local authorities and schools in planning and monitoring their progress during the year; sharing with them its knowledge of best practice across the system; challenging current systems and processes to help improve them; and closely monitoring progress on reducing levels of persistent absence.</p>

UK receipts amount to 9.5 per cent. of total receipts paid to member states over the 1976 to 2005 period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1680W.6/1">Train traction can be increased by controlled application of sand and by managing wheel-spin through intelligent control of the torque applied to the wheels by the motor. Both of these methods are already in use on modern rolling stock and locomotives across the UK network. New wheel materials with a higher coefficient of friction are theoretically possible but none has been found so far that is capable of standing up to railway conditions. Linear induction motors (which do not rely on wheel/rail friction) are in use in a few niche applications across the world but require expensive additional infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1699W.2/1">The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership weeks of action carried out in Nottingham and other areas are excellent examples of joined up partnership working. They can achieve significant results for local communities in tackling crime and disorder and promoting community engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1699W.2/2">The Home Office encourages and supports partnerships across England and Wales to adopt weeks of action as one dynamic element of their broader crime and disorder strategies and action plans. A series of seminars are currently being held across the country, an effective practice guide is being developed and resources are being devoted to rolling out this approach, building on the experience and learning of community safety practitioners in Nottingham and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.1700W.2/1">The Offender Management Bill gives to the Secretary of State the statutory duty to make arrangements to provide probation services, so enabling him to commission services from providers in the public, charitable, voluntary and private sectors. The Bill also establishes probation trusts, as the public sector providers with whom he may make such arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.2/2">It is not envisaged that the Secretary of State will hold all contracts directly. The Bill also provides for probation trusts and other providers to enter into sub-contracts for services. This will be a key means of ensuring partnership working and the proper involvement of providers at the local level; potential providers will be expected to demonstrate these links when submitting bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700W.2/3">NOMS commissioning processes, while upholding the principle of fair competition, will seek to reduce barriers to further partnership working and encouraging new providers, by minimising the overall cost and complexity of tendering, using fit for purpose pre-qualification regimes that are proportionate to the likely contract value, term and risk; and streamlining monitoring, regulatory and reporting requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1701W.11/1">The information requested is not held centrally as the arrangements for retiring from service as a police officer are a matter for individual police authorities. However, the Government Actuary's Department estimates that in each of the next 10 years around 4,000 police officers in England and Wales will become eligible for retirement with either an ordinary pension after 25 years' service or a short-service pension which is payable to officers with less than 25 years' service from age 55 upwards depending on their rank and force. For comparison, wastage rates in the official Police Service Strength publication indicate that the number of leavers in the four years up to March 2006 ranged between approximately 5,500 and 7,000 a year, which includes those leaving before reaching retirement age and those retiring early on grounds of ill health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1709W.5/1">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a new suspended sentence&mdash;the suspended sentence order (SSO). The SSO is available for offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. It is more flexible than the previous suspended sentence and available to the courts in all cases as an alternative to an immediate custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709W.5/2">The SSO is more demanding than the previous suspended sentence; it allows the court to impose community requirements together with a suspended custodial sentence of up to 12 months (six months in the magistrates court) which is activated if the offender breaches the community period.</p>

	<p pid="a.1711W.14/1">Private members clubs, such as private golf clubs, are not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. In 1989 the Government asked private clubs which have both men and women members to take voluntary action to abolish any discriminatory practices. We made clear that we did not rule out the need for legislative action. Some clubs have taken steps to remove inequalities, but there is evidence that some mixed-sex private clubs still discriminate on the grounds of sex, almost exclusively to the disadvantage of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711W.14/2">Excluding women from full membership rights in private clubs such as golf clubs is basically unfair and it can involve demeaning and humiliating treatment. It can also prevent women from fulfilling their potential contribution to a club. We consider that it is no longer acceptable for organisations that admit both men and women as members or guests to discriminate against some members or guests, simply because of their gender. The Government's Discrimination Law Review is therefore considering how to address sex discrimination in private members clubs, including private sports clubs, that have members of both sexes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1721W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/2">In 1996-97, in Great Britain, the proportion of children living in households with less than 60 per cent. of median income was 25 per cent. before housing costs and 33 per cent. after housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/3">The latest data available are for the year 2004-05. In this year, in Great Britain, the proportion of children living in households with less than 60 per cent. of median income was 19 per cent. before housing costs and 27 per cent. after housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/4">It should be noted that children here are defined as those aged under 16, or aged 16 to 18, unmarried and on a course up to and including 'A' level standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/5">There is a remarkable variety of incomes across the EU and therefore, in absolute monetary terms, relative poverty is measured using different thresholds. Purchasing power parities are currency conversion rates that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between their countries. Using this method demonstrates that the relative poverty threshold in the UK in 2004-05, in PPS, for households with two adults and two dependent children was 21,385. This is similar to the figure for Austria (21,382) and Germany (20,935). Looking at just the figures for the EU15, the highest threshold was in Luxembourg (34,316) and lowest in Greece (11,130).</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/6">The following table shows the proportion of children (aged under 16) in households with less than 60 per cent. of the median national income in each EU15 state in 1997 and 2004. These figures are all before housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/7">It should be noted that the figures for the UK are not the same as those published in the households below average income (HBAI) series. This is because the 1997 figures utilise a different data source, the European community household panel. The 2004 figures differ because, although they use HBAI data, these has been harmonised ex-post for maximum consistency with the comparative EU dataset.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721W.9/8">A trend between 1997 and 2004 cannot be derived as different data sources are used in the two years. However, the data demonstrate that whereas, in 1997, the UK had the worst child poverty rate in the EU15, now it is close to the EU average.</p>

	<p pid="a.1723W.0/2">As a result of the reforms which Sir David Henshaw put forward he estimated that the number of children receiving maintenance would increase from 1.1 million to 1.7 million, with an increasing proportion of parents making private arrangements. In steady state Sir David Henshaw estimated the long run administrative savings to be in the region of &pound;200 million, based on a caseload of between 0.8 million and 1.1 million in the new organisation. In making these estimates Sir David identified in his report the need to do further research to support the transition of cases and that there is an element of unpredictability about such transitional flows.</p>

	<p pid="a.1723W.3/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/3" class="indent"><i> </i>In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many Child Support Agency cases were <i> (a)</i> outstanding and <i> (b)</i> unprocessed in (i) Eastbourne constituency and (ii) East Sussex in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/6" class="indent">As such, the Agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed cases and it is not possible to allocate these to individual constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/7" class="indent">With regard to part <i> (a)</i>, the Agency can only provide the information requested for applications (both new and old scheme) operating on the new computer system (CS2). Therefore this is not representative of the overall trend and volumes of the total amount of uncleared applications at the geographical level requested. Please see the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/8" class="indent">It should be noted that there are always applications for which the Agency cannot assign a county or a constituency, either because they had been received directly via Jobcentre Plus and had not reached the point in the process at which details on the constituency of the parent with care can be identified, or because the application is on the old computer system from which it is not possible to provide robust estimates at the geographical level requested. In September 2006, there were around 70,000 such applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/9" class="indent">For future reference, it should be noted that information relating to the number of uncleared applications on the new computer system in September 2006 in each parliamentary constituency is publicly available, and can be found in Table 27 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/10" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_sep06.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/csa_quarterly_sep06.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/11" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared applications nationally across both schemes, 247,500 in September 2006, is the lowest since comparable records began, the Agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. The Agency therefore has a 2006/07 target to ensure that, by March 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25 per cent. and our challenge, as set down in our Operational Improvement Plan, is that the Agency should not have a backlog in this area by March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723W.3/12" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1726W.3/2">Where providers perform better than outlined in their contract, we would look to fund additional outcome payments using residual money from any under-performing providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1726W.3/3">While we will expect providers to deliver work focused interviews for all those customers referred to us, providers are able to offer the pathways to work service to customers directly. It is therefore for the provider to determine how they focus their resource and how many customers they support in order to achieve the job outcome targets that will have been agreed in the contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734W.9/1">Instruments are purchased by local national health service bodies, not by the Department. Since 2001-02, however, the Department has allocated some &pound;100 million for the purchase of surgical instruments by NHS trusts. Those instruments were intended to facilitate central processing by reducing the amount of processing done other than in sterile services departments, or by the setting up of an offsite service. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-01">1 March 2002</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-30">30 November 2006</phrase>, the NHS purchased surgical instruments worth some &pound;155 million using the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency's (NHS PASA) framework agreement. This sum includes instruments purchased to replace damaged ones or to increase instrument stock as well as to facilitate centralised reprocessing. NHS trusts may also have purchased instruments without using the NHS PASA framework agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1745W.8/2">Shift is a five year initiative that began in 2004, intended to reduce the stigma and discrimination experienced by people on grounds of mental ill health, for example, in employment and the media. It is managed by the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) and funded by the Department. It received &pound;900,000 in 2003-04 and &pound;1 million in 2004-05.

	<p pid="a.1749W.2/1">The provision of in-year financial support is no longer permitted. Deficits in national health service organisations must rest where they fall. In 2006-07, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have the power to agree a top slice with their primary care trusts (PCTs) in order to create a reserve which may then be needed by the SHA to record financial balance across the patch. Transactions to create these resources must be fully reflected in the accounts of each organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1749W.2/2">PCTs which make a contribution to their SHA reserve will be repaid, normally within the three-year allocation cycle, but the reserves will not be used to support directly other organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1752W.9/2">Information is not held centrally on the number of national health service organisations which currently outsource aspects of patient record management or the typing of patient records, or back office functions, to agencies overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.9/3">In the future, each consenting person using the NHS will have a personal electronic care record held within the NHS care records service (NHS CRS). The NHS CRS is the lynchpin of the new modern, integrated information technology (IT) infrastructure and systems and services being implemented through the national programme for IT. No national IT systems maintaining patient record services have been outsourced to India and there is no intention to do so. It is known that iSOFT plc, one of the application software subcontractors, is developing software in India. This software is operated exclusively within England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1752W.9/4">Contracts let by the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency, which is responsible for delivering the national programme, expressly preclude the transfer of patient information outside the United Kingdom. NHS Shared Business Services Ltd, a 50/50 joint venture between the Department and Xansa, currently provides financial and accounting services to over 100 NHS trusts and other NHS bodies. At present, 28.5 per cent. of their work is handled through an outsourcing contract to Xansa PLC's India-based operation. The partners have agreed that no more than 60 per cent. of work can be offshored through this venture.</p>

There are no targets, but we expect PCTs and clinicians to be aware that they can help treat more patients by prescribing one of the lower cost statins where it is clinically appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1759W.3/1">Data collected on cancer incidence, survival and mortality is provided by nine cancer registries, which cover all of England, and the Office for National Statistics uses data from registries to summarise and analyse cancer data at the national level. The cancer registries provide a comprehensive population based count of all cancers, which is recognised as one of the best in the world. The registries have provided full coverage of England since the 1960s and since the cancer plan the Department has invested over &pound;6 million in cancer registry modernisation to help them work more efficiently. We are also introducing a national cancer registry dataset, which will standardise cancer data collection. This will provide for more consistent quality and analytical interpretation of data for monitoring cancer services and trends within the population. It will also help reduce duplication and help facilitate linkage to the new electronic patient record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1759W.3/2">In February 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published improving outcomes guidance for people with skin tumours including melanoma. The guidance is now being translated into a series of measures for inclusion in the manual for cancer services. The manual supports quality assurance of cancer services and enables quality improvement. The manual is aimed at all commissioners and providers of national health service cancer services and progress against the measures can be used for self-assessment or peer review.</p>

However, any product reformulation to reduce the levels of trans fats, generally through the removal of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, should not result in increases in the saturated fat levels in foods.</p>
