	<p pid="b.692W.11/1">In 2009-10, the Highways Agency spent a total of &#163;23 million on the purchase of new winter service vehicles (gritters).</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.11/2">The Highways Agency's previous winter service vehicles comprised 'Foden-Telstar' spreaders, which were between 12 to 17-years-old, thus requiring increasing amounts of maintenance to keep them operational. The equipment was falling behind with modern alternatives, which allow flexibility to adapt to different treatment techniques and materials, providing a more effective and efficient winter service with less environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.11/3">The replacement of these winter service vehicles was commissioned using a four-year framework contract. Total actual and forecast costs are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.692W.11/6"> <td></td> <td><i> &#163; million</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.692W.11/13">The budget available for the final year of the framework contract cannot be confirmed until after the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.11/14">The Highways Agency also spent &#163;330,000 on a new SCRIM vehicle (Sideway force Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine) for measuring the road surface skid resistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.11/15">Traffic officer vehicles are provided on a lease basis and the Highways Agency is charged a combined monthly fee that includes lease and maintenance. The total lease/maintenance cost of the vehicles in financial year 2009-10 was &#163;3,757,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.2/1">The Department for Transport seeks to improve access to and safety on public transport, including for disabled people. For example, free off-peak local bus travel throughout England has given the opportunity for greater freedom and independence to around 11 million older and disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.2/2">By law, all newly built or refurbished public transport vehicles must be accessible to disabled people. Over a third of all trains are already accessible, as is half the bus fleet. Deadlines have been set for when all trains, buses and coaches must be accessible. Disability legislation also covers infrastructure, such as bus and railway stations. These are becoming more accessible as buildings are built or renovated. Transport operators also have a legal duty to consider the needs of disabled people when publishing service information and providing booking and other facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.2/3">We are also seeking to ensure that those who travel have the confidence and basic skills to do so; that transport staff have the appropriate training to help people; and that passengers can travel in a safe environment. For example, just over 1,000 stations are currently accredited under the Secure Stations Scheme, and there are increasing numbers of help points and CCTV cameras on our public transport systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.9/2">The National Minimum Wage Act and the working time regulations do not make provision for the following entitlements which are currently covered by the agricultural wages order:</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.9/4" class="indent">Stand-by duty and night allowance</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.9/10" class="indent">Workers of compulsory school age</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.9/11" class="indent">Students on a work placement of less than one year.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.9/12">Specific provision for these categories of workers is not made under the national minimum wage legislation. However, such persons are entitled to employment rights and protections under the working time regulations, and the legislation dealing specifically with the employment of children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.9/13">It is also important to note that the terms of a worker's employment contract which exist at the time the AWB is abolished will continue to apply until such time as the contract is varied by agreement between the employer and the worker, or until the contract comes to an end. This is the case whether the terms are written, verbally agreed or implied by custom and practice. If an employer makes changes to the terms of employment without the worker's agreement, this constitutes a breach of contract. The worker may have a claim for breach of contract, unfair dismissal or unlawful deduction of wages if the change relates to pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.698W.2/1">The Government are mindful of the interest surrounding this emerging technology and its use in food production. The European Food Safety Authority has noted that, whilst relatively limited data are available, the available evidence indicates that food from healthy cloned cattle and pigs and their offspring does not present any risks to consumers. Food derived from cloned animals is nevertheless subject to the European regulation on novel foods and cannot be marketed without an authorisation under that regulation. The Food Standards Agency has advised that this is also the case for food from the descendants of cloned animals. To date no applications for authorisation have been made and no authorisations have been issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.2/2">Looking forward, European Union Agriculture Ministers have collectively asked the European Commission to produce a detailed report on cloning by the end of 2010 and this will provide further basis for evidence-based decision making at EU level. We will be looking carefully at the Commission's report as we consider this subject further.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.2/1">All six species (including their nests, eggs and young) are fully protected by domestic legislation in England: the corncrake, bittern, black-tailed godwit, cirl bunting and turtle dove through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the black grouse (which is a quarry species) through the Game Acts. The corncrake, bittern, black-tailed godwit and cirl bunting are listed on Schedule 1 of the Act, so special penalties apply to those who disturb these species whilst at, on or near their nests. The corncrake and bittern are on Annex 1 of EU Directive 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Where present in appropriate numbers, these species are recognised as interest features of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and part of the qualifying interest of special protection areas. Many also occur on reserves managed by Natural England and/or its non-governmental organisation partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.2/2">As a result of recent or historic population declines, all six species appear on the UK 'Red' list of 'Birds of Conservation Concern' meaning they are of high conservation concern, and all are recognised as priority species by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Effective conservation action for these species is a thus seen as a high priority, both for Government through its agencies (notably Natural England) and for non-governmental organisations such as the RSPB, with which we work in close partnership.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.5/1">There has been a welcome recent fall in the number of herds disclosing with reactors and a resulting reduction in the number of cattle being compulsorily slaughtered. This is part of a downward trend that has been observed for some time but we have seen similar declines over the last nine years only to then see disease levels rise again. It is not possible (and will not be for some time) to know with any certainty what may be causing these changes and whether they are therefore temporary or permanent.</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.2/1">One of the UK's key priorities for common fisheries policy (CFP) reform is to move away from the current centralised system that attempts to micro-manage fishermen's daily activities. Genuinely strategic decisions should continue to be taken at EU level, but more responsibility for implementation can, and should, be devolved to member states, and those closest to the fisheries.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.2/2">In order to pursue this agenda, the UK is engaging with other member states, the European Commission, European Parliament, industry, and major non-governmental organisations in order to establish a way forward that delegates the maximum responsibility to those closest to the issues, whilst complying with the relevant treaty obligations.</p>

For the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June 2010</phrase>, forecast estimates equate to around 67 days.

A controlled release of the highly specialist psyllid <i> Aphalara itadori</i> is now under way to help control this plant.

	<p pid="b.708W.2/1">Awareness of the effects of illegal logging is important as UK consumers have every right to know how their purchases impact on other parts of the world, and that responsible UK companies are able to trade on a level playing field with others in the timber trade. Agreement was recently reached on the EU Timber Due Diligence Regulation, which aims to eradicate illegal timber from the EU market, attracting media interest, notably from the BBC and <i> The Sunday Times</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.708W.2/2">We will seek to take advantage of future opportunities to publicise the work we are doing in this area, and to reiterate the Government's commitment to tackling illegal logging. We work closely with non-governmental organisations and the timber industry, and will use these relationships to further increase public awareness of the effects of illegal logging.</p>

	<p pid="b.708W.5/1">Tropical deforestation has negative repercussions for actions to combat climate change, halt biodiversity loss and foster development in some of the world's poorest communities. Therefore it is vital that UK efforts to combat deforestation are co-ordinated. As well as cross-departmental co-operation at official level, regular trilateral meetings between the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and the Secretary of State for International Development ensure that action to tackle deforestation is co-ordinated across Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.710W.6/1">Despite international wheat prices rising by some 50% since the start of July, a global wheat shortage is unlikely due to high levels of stocks being carried globally from previous record crops. In the UK, wheat accounts for less than 10% of the cost of a typical loaf of bread, and cereal feed costs account for up to 15% of the retail value of pork and chicken. In the absence of a sustained surge in grain prices, or sharp rises in energy prices, the overall effect on consumers should be limited. The Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.711W.10/1">The arrest in 2007, of Htay Kywe, Mie Mie and Zaw Htet Ko Ko and their subsequent long term imprisonment, were actions by the military Government of Burma designed to keep the leaders of the 1988 Generation Students movement out of politics. We are aware of reports that Zaw Htete Ko Ko is suffering from medical problems and that many detainees suffer ill treatment and are held in harsh conditions far from their families. The Coalition Government have sustained international attention on the plight of all political prisoners in Burma and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Jeremy Browne, publicly endorsed Amnesty International's campaign for the release of the three leaders. In my meetings with ASEAN and other regional Ministers, I have specifically raised the UK's continuing concern over political prisoners. Our embassy in Rangoon is monitoring these specific cases closely and our ambassador in Rangoon repeatedly raises the need for the release of all political prisoners with ministers in the Burmese military government and will continue to do so. We will raise the issue of Burma's political prisoners in the forthcoming session of the UN Human Rights Council and other multilateral meetings.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.0/1">We continue to work across Whitehall, and with our international partners, to monitor developments on the Korean peninsula. The situation has remained tense since the sinking of the Republic of Korea Naval vessel, the Cheonan, in March of this year as a result of a North Korean attack. We also remain concerned about North Korea's nuclear programme and its ongoing role in the proliferation of military material. Long-term stability on the Korean peninsula will only be achieved through the complete and verifiable denuclearisation of North Korea. We believe the Six Party Talks offer the best prospect for achieving this. It is essential that North Korea abandon its current course and create the conditions for the resumption of talks.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.5/1">There are several dedicated housing help lines. Repairs to service family accommodation (SFA) properties in the UK are carried out under the Housing Prime Contract (HPC) in England and Wales, the Regional Prime Contract (RPC) in Scotland and separate arrangements exist in Northern Ireland (NI). In all cases occupants can report faults and request repairs via a freephone helpdesk.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.5/2">The HPC is being delivered by Modern Housing Solutions (MHS) who is responsible for maintaining some 45,000 properties. The MHS helpdesk received some 393,656 calls in 2009, of which some 226,889 resulted in work orders being raised. Although the total number of calls regarding SFA in Scotland and NI is not available, the RPC raised 15,424 work orders for Scottish SFA in 2009 and 11,148 were raised for NI SFA.</p>

	<p pid="b.731W.3/2">The budgetary structure of the Ministry of Defence does not show separately the costs of the three individual Armed Services (Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force). This is because large parts of the Armed Services operate as fully integrated joint organisations in which elements from the Navy, Army and Air Force work closely together and share land, buildings and facilities, and sometimes equipment. The MOD's Permanent Joint Headquarters, which commands most of our military operations, is one example. Another is the defence equipment and support organisation which provides front line commands with equipment and logistic support.</p>

Those recruited must already have attained at least the rank of Sergeant (or equivalent) and be able to demonstrate tactical technical experience in a related field.

Where training needs are identified which fall outside of the centrally-managed programme, arrangements are made by individuals or teams in accordance with departmental procedures and guidance and with costs met from within agreed budgets for general administrative expenditure. While departmental systems can identify expenditure on learning and development activities, it is not currently possible to differentiate between expenditure on courses and expenditure on other forms of learning and development activity.

	<p pid="b.754W.0/1">The Government are committed to tackling and preventing homelessness. We have established a new cross-Government working group on homelessness bringing together Ministers from eight Government Departments to address the complex causes of homelessness and rough sleeping. A new approach to evaluating rough sleeping levels is being introduced so that there is clear information in all areas, to inform service provision and action to address the problem. &#163;74 million in homelessness grant to local authorities and the voluntary sector has been allocated in 2010-11 to support work to prevent homelessness, including &#163;2.7 million for local authorities in the west midlands.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.3/1">Summary tables giving the number of households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty, the number of households in temporary accommodation arranged by each local authority and rough sleeper counts and estimates for the past 10 years have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/2">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly P1E returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library and via the CLG website:</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/4">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/5">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/6">with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/7">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.3/8">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the CLG website:</p>

	<p pid="b.757W.3/1">For 2010-11, all empty properties with rateable values up to &#163;18,000 are exempt from business rates. 70% of properties have a rateable value below that threshold so, if empty, will pay no rates this year. The temporary threshold is intended to provide owners with help to manage short-term pressures in a difficult property market. We recognize the impact of the last Government; increases in rates by curtailing empty property relief in a recession. The new Government face a great challenge handling the massive budget deficit we have inherited. We have however already taken steps to provide additional support on business rates by increasing SBRR over the next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.2/1">The Department for international Development (DFID) carries out annual reviews of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), in line with its standard procedures for monitoring and evaluation. The first annual review was completed in May 2010, using evidence from the design phase of the CIFs and the early plans for CIFs investments. The Department judged that the CIFs will largely achieve their objectives.</p>

We want communities and individuals to benefit from the increase in renewable energy, including wind power, and to own a stake in our collective low carbon future. This is why we committed to encouraging more community owned renewable energy and allowing communities that host renewable energy projects to keep the additional business rates they generate.</p>

	<p pid="b.784W.3/1">Stroke remains a priority for the Government and has a Tier 1 Vital Sign in the revision to the Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2010-11. We agree with the National Audit Office and the Committee of Public Account's (PAC) conclusions that there is still room for improvement in stroke care, especially in post acute care and rehabilitation for stroke survivors where progress has been slower than with acute services. The Government's response to the PAC report sets out the work that is being done to achieve further progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.798W.2/2">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Lorraine Langham, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-09">9 August 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/4" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector for response. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is currently on leave and I am deputising for her in her absence.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/5" class="indent">The latest period for which published figures about maintained school section 5 inspection outcomes are available is the spring term of 2009/10. This answer, therefore, takes into account those primary and secondary schools (including academies and city technology colleges) which were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase> and had received an inspection on or before <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/6" class="indent">Under the school inspection frameworks used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as section 10), the school's overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: 'excellent', 'very good', 'good', 'satisfactory', 'unsatisfactory', 'poor' and 'very poor'. Since September 2005, the overall effectiveness judgement has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as section 5) using a four point scale: 'outstanding', 'good', 'satisfactory' and 'inadequate'.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/7" class="indent">Given the differences in the measurement of overall effectiveness between the frameworks, it is not possible to operate a simple, read-across approach between section 10 and section 5 inspection frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/8" class="indent">As the question refers to those schools which were found to be outstanding, this answer only looks at those inspections that took place under section 5 (from September 2005). It does not include those schools currently 'good' or 'satisfactory' under section 5, with previous inspection judgements under the previous section 10 framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/9" class="indent">Information on which schools were open on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase> has been taken from the Department for Education's Edubase system. Information regarding section 5 inspections was taken from archived information on Ofsted's systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/10" class="indent">Of the 7,545 primary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were 162 primary schools rated 'good' where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated 'outstanding'.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/11" class="indent">Of the 1,611 secondary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were 25 secondary schools rated 'good' where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated 'outstanding'.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/12" class="indent">Of the 7,545 primary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were 36 primary schools rated 'satisfactory' where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated 'outstanding'.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/13" class="indent">Of the 1,611 secondary schools inspected more than once under section 5, there were two secondary schools rated 'satisfactory' where their previous section 5 inspection was also rated 'outstanding'.</p>
	<p pid="b.798W.2/14" class="indent">Tables 1 and 2 below contain the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="b.800W.6/1">The Conservative and Liberal Democrat manifestos both proposed a reduction in size of the House of Commons, to 585 and 500 seats respectively (the latter in the context of the introduction of the single transferable vote). The coalition agreement announced that legislation would be introduced &quot;to provide for the creation of fewer and more equally sized constituencies&quot;. Ultimately it is a matter of judgment as to the most suitable size of the House, and Ministers decided that a modest reduction to 600 seats would be appropriate, mindful that hon. Members must be able to serve their constituents and that the House must be of sufficient size to be able to carry out its functions effectively. Under the Government's proposals, the <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> register suggests the electoral quota for the UK would be around 76,000. 218 of the existing constituencies are already within 5% either side of 76,000, so the impact of our proposals will see constituencies of a size well within existing norms.</p>

	<p pid="b.812W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in how many cases the Child Support Agency recorded intercession by an hon. Member in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.812W.2/5" class="indent">We tried to contact your office to clarify your request but we were advised that you were unavailable for most of the day so we have interpreted the question as being the volume of correspondence received by the Commission from MPs in 2009-10.</p>

Parents of children under 17, or under 18 if the child is disabled, as well as carers of certain adults, already have the right to request flexible working, to help them balance their work and caring responsibilities. Extending this right to all employees, will encourage more employees and employers to benefit from the flexible working, and make making a request more commonplace, removing the stigma attached to making a request.</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.8/1">Of people who made a claim for ESA between October 2008 and June 2009 and who were found fit for work at assessment, 52,800 (32%) have had an appeal heard by Tribunals Service to date. The appeal was granted for 31,600 (40%) of these cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.8/2">The Department does not have figures for the number of cases appealed but not yet heard by the Tribunal Service. Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard, particularly for the most recent cohorts of ESA claims. These figures should continue to be treated as emerging findings and not final at this stage.</p>

In particular if a customer has terminal cancer they can claim Employment Support Allowance (ESA) under the Special Rules (SR). A customer who claims under the SR is terminally ill and not expected to live for more than six months. Awards of Employment and Support Allowance are made on the basis of medical certificates from a GP. Customers with a terminal illness are not required to have a full medical examination for a work capability assessment. Following the benefit claim immediate advice is sought from Atos Healthcare to confirm that SR applies. In August 2010 replies were received in 0.8 days within the two day AACT.</p>

	<p pid="b.827W.5/1">The Government strongly support the use of video links technology where it is appropriate to do so and encourages courts to look to increase its use wherever possible. Revised guidance was issued to the courts in August 2010 with a primary focus to increase utilisation of video link equipment across the courts estate by highlighting best practice and inviting courts and local prisons to set up 'Partnership Agreements' to enable greater use. In addition I have asked my officials to look more generally at how wider use of video and telephone links, where appropriate, might improve the public's experience and the operation of the justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.827W.5/2">Much has been done in recent years to reduce unnecessary court hearings particularly in the magistrates courts where the number of hearings has fallen from estimated average number of 3.02 hearings per defendant (March 2007) to 2.19 hearings in June 2010 (Time Interval Survey, June 2010). However where a hearing is necessary we support the use of video links in appropriate cases wherever possible.</p>

Some alternative providers needed additional matter starts and these have been agreed while others were able to handle some or all of the requests within their existing allocation of matter starts. Requests for additional matter starts are considered during the life of the contract with a legal aid provider.

Provisions include minimum standards on information, documentation, education, health care, accommodation, withdrawal of reception conditions as well as extra provisions for children and vulnerable individuals. The directive contains no obligation on member states to provide &quot;free legal advice&quot; and assistance to asylum seekers at the initial stage of their case. After a negative decision, the directive stipulates that access to legal assistance for appeals shall be laid down in national law (Article 21 (2)). As this is a minimum standards directive, member states are free to provide &quot;more favourable conditions&quot; than those contained in the directive. Unlike most member states, the UK continues to provide free legal &quot;advice&quot; and &quot;representation at the Tribunal&quot; out of public funds to eligible asylum applicants at both the initial stage and appeals. The current tendering process has in no way restricted the scope of legal aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.845W.3/1">People often find themselves involved in court actions when their disagreements might be better resolved between themselves at a much earlier stage and with a more satisfactory outcome, through processes such as mediation, rather than the 'winner takes all' approach offered by litigation. The intervention of the court should only be sought when a genuine point of law exists or when people or businesses are at risk. As a Government, we are keen for people to take a less adversarial and a more collaborative approach to solving their problems and encourage greater use of mediation in both civil and family issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.846W.0/1">I work closely with all the Ministers in my Department on the range of issues for which I am responsible. The speech to which you refer, given by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Crispin Blunt) on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July</phrase>, drew attention to PSI 50/2008 which expired on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-05">5 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.0/2">Prior to this, decisions on activities in prison were taken locally by Prison Governors. The expiry of that PSI provided an opportunity to reassess whether local discretion could be returned to Prison Governors, or whether activities in the 140 prisons were better managed via central prescription. A new instruction was subsequently issued which drew attention to the need to ensure public confidence and modest costs were maintained, but which returned decision-making to the local level.</p>

In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br/> 2.

	<p pid="b.863W.2/2" class="italic"> Community payback schemes</p>
	<p pid="b.863W.2/3">The high-visibility community payback scheme did not commence until December 2008, therefore reoffending rates for the period covered by the scheme will not be available until data for the 2009 cohort are published in March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.863W.2/4">Reoffending rates are available for those who commenced both community and suspended sentence orders with a requirement for unpaid work only.

These are the latest available data.</p>
	<p pid="b.863W.2/5">These figures do not make an assessment of the effectiveness of unpaid work schemes; differences between the rates may be due to differences in offender characteristics rather than simply the effectiveness of unpaid work in reducing the likelihood of reoffending.</p>

	<p pid="b.863W.2/9">There is mixed evidence from published sources on the effectiveness of restorative justice in reducing reoffending. A Home Office/Ministry of Justice evaluation found a fall in the likelihood of reconviction over a two year period but, because of the small sample size, this was not statistically significant. There was no impact on the severity of reconvictions. The study did find a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of subsequent reoffending (when using a meta-analysis technique).</p>

	<p pid="b.869W.2/1">Failed asylum seekers who are destitute and unable to leave the UK immediately due to circumstances beyond their control, can request the provision of support under section 4 of the 1999 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/2">Those in receipt of section 4 support are provided with accommodation and subsistence payments to the value of &#163;35.39 per week. Until November 2009, the section 4 subsistence payment (then &#163;35 per week) was provided by means of supermarket vouchers administered by UK Border Agency accommodation providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.869W.2/3">The voucher system was open to abuse and fraud and there was evidence that vouchers were often traded for cash at reduced levels. The vouchers also presented poor value for money to the user with restricted retail outlets. The Azure pre-paid payment card was introduced in a phased roll out between November 2009 and February 2010 to tackle this.</p>

If a supported person has an exceptional specific need for facilities to travel for purposes that do not fall within the aforementioned qualifying journeys, this can be arranged if the supported person demonstrates that his/her need is sufficiently exceptional to warrant a grant.

This explained that the way the existing programme was developing gave rise to serious concern. Progress had been extremely disappointing. While some elements had been delivered, there was a succession of missed milestones coupled with issues of quality. Delivery of the next critical parts of the programme was already running at least 12 months late and on top of this there remained risks of further delays. Since July 2009 the supplier had been in breach of contract and, despite extensive negotiations, no agreement had been reached about a remedial plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.878W.2/1">Following the Home Secretary's commitment to end the detention of children for immigration purposes the UK Border Agency is working to establish more effective ways of managing family returns without the need for detention in immigration removal centres. Through a new approach to families, the UK Border Agency is seeking to encourage greater compliance and increase the number of families who choose to return voluntarily. The new process is designed to give families every opportunity to comply with return and empower them to make their own preparations for departure.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.2/2">Two pilots are currently being conducted to develop and refine the new family returns process, one in the North West of England and one in London. Additionally, UK Border Agency enforcement teams across the country are changing the way they work in every family case to ensure that every effort is made to secure the departure of illegal migrant families without detention.</p>

Even then, admission is not simply a formality once such entry clearance has been obtained; a Border Force officer may cancel that entry clearance and refuse leave to enter if there is evidence that deception has been used to obtain the clearance or a change of circumstances has removed the basis of it.

	<p pid="b.895W.2/2">The need to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds into higher education is written into the coalition programme for government. Lord Browne, who will present proposals to Government this autumn following his independent review of higher education funding and student finance, has already stated that a guiding principle is to ensure that talent, rather than the ability to pay, determines participation in higher education. We will await Lord Browne's report and judge its proposals against the criteria set out in the coalition agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.2/3">More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/4" class="indent">The majority (81%) of SFLG recipients receive SFLG on their first loan application.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/5" class="indent">For a majority (76%) of SFLG recipients, there were no alternative sources of finance available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/6" class="indent">This is confirmed by 79% of SFLG recipients reporting the bank would probably, or definitely not, have given them a loan without SFLG.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/7" class="indent">Just under half (49%) of businesses would definitely, or probably not, have proceeded with their project without SFLG.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/8" class="indent">A growth in sales, jobs and exports is attributable to SFLG supported lending within the first two years of the loan. The 3,100 SFLG supported businesses in 2006 have created between 3,550 to 6,340 additional jobs in the two years following receipt of the loan, created between &#163;75 million and &#163;150 million additional sales over two years; and were responsible for &#163;33 million exports per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/9" class="indent">Just within two years of receiving the loan the benefits of the scheme are outweighing the costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/10" class="indent">SFLG appears to be a particularly cost effective way of creating additional employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/11">The full report is available via the BIS website:</p>
