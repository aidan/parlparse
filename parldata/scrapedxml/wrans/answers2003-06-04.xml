	<p pid=".400W.10/1">We are concerned about sleep-related road accidents and have an extensive programme of publicity and research aimed at reducing these.</p>
	<p pid=".400W.10/2">Campaigns to warn drivers of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel have run since August 2000 and have included leaflets, posters, TV and radio advertising. Most recently, radio adverts were run over Easter and the May bank holidays advising drivers to take a break. These were reinforced by some 190 truck backs, delivering to Moto, Sainsburys, Asda and others, carrying the 'Don't Drive Tired' message over the April to June period this year. We have also recently produced a new public information film, for use by TV stations, to remind drivers to take proper breaks during long journeys.</p>

	<p pid=".400W.10/4">The Department has also undertaken considerable research to study driver sleepiness. The University of Loughborough Sleep Research Laboratory has carried out a series of road audits into sleep-related vehicle accidents on sections of selected trunk roads and motorways in the UK. The results were published in February 2001 in Road Safety Research Reports No. 21 and 22, available on-line at: <a href="http://www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/index.htm">www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/index.htm</a> A report on six more audits is due to be published in the summer. A project to study the effectiveness of motorway service areas in reducing fatigue-related accidents is also under way.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.2/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is working closely with local authorities to tackle the problem of vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion. Enforcing VED helps to improve the accuracy of DVLA's database of vehicle keepers, which in turn, enables local authorities and the police to identify those who offend on parking charges, speeding, and other offences.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.2/2">DVLA does not charge local authorities for information on the name and address of vehicle keepers, and there are no plans to introduce a payment scheme for local authorities who provide information on unlicensed vehicles to DVLA. However, those local authorities that have taken on devolved powers to wheel clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles are able to retain the penalties charged to offenders to release their vehicles. Furthermore, the Government are in discussion with these authorities to see what else can be done to help with the costs associated with this initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.2/1">The Energy White Paper, published earlier this year, sets out the Government's aspiration to achieve the production of 20 per cent. of the UKfs electricity through renewable sources by 2020. Specific targets have not been set for different renewable technologies and the market will decide which are developed. Biomass, including purpose-grown industrial crops, could become one of the largest contributors to the renewables mix by 2020. Funding under the Energy Crops Scheme is aimed at establishing around 20,000 ha of purpose-grown energy crops by 2006. The Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme is aimed at developing projects fuelled by purpose-grown energy crops and other biomass to produce around 100MW of electricity and the production of heat and combined heat and power.</p>

The Government will consult key stakeholders in due course on targets. The Government is promoting the production of biofuels through the existing 20 pence per litre duty incentive for biodiesel and the intention announced in Budget 2003 to introduce a similar duty incentive for bioethanol with effect from January 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-01">1 November 2002</phrase> the Department wrote to all slaughterhouse operators to obtain information on existing blood disposal routes. Analysis of the responses indicated that a number of red meat slaughterhouses disposed of their blood direct to sewer and did not have collection tanks. As many as one third of slaughterhouses expected to have to install suitable storage facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/2">The Department has worked closely with the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) and other industry experts to develop guidance on simple, low cost ways in which slaughterhouses could comply with the new requirements. This suggests that the cost of providing the necessary facilities could be as low as &pound;200 but if more substantial work is needed it could be several thousand pounds.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.8/3">It has been estimated that the ban on applying raw blood to land or direct to sewer may increase the cost of disposing of blood from around &pound;16/tonne, for landspreading, to &pound;60-&pound;80/tonne for rendering, incineration or treatment in an approved biogas or composting plant.</p>

	<p pid=".406W.6/1">The World Summit on Sustainable Development set a target to significantly reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity at the global, regional, sub regional and national levels by the year 2010. A challenge of this magnitude requires international co-operation. We are working within existing international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to this end.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/2">The CBD reviewed the outcomes from WSSD at its intersessional meeting in March 2003. The UK was among those Parties which pressed successfully for a recommendation that each Conference of Parties should assess progress towards the target. To faciliate this, the CBD together with the United Nations Environmental Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre organised an international conference in London from 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-23">23 May 2003</phrase> with financial support from my Department. The meeting made a number of recommendations on how we might better co-ordinate efforts to achieve the goal and monitor progress towards it.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/3">The Darwin Initiative is one means by which the Department provides direct support to other countries to help safeguard their biodiversity. This grant programme launched at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 assists countries that are rich in biodiversity but poor in resources to conserve and sustainably use their biological diversity. Phase II of the Initiative launched in November 2002 by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, focuses on enhanced legacy to produce greater biodiversity gains, increasing partnership with local organisations and communities and stronger links to the aims of the Convention on Biological Diversity. So far it has committed over 30 million to over 300 projects with links to some 100 developing countries and countries with economies on transition. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-02">2 August</phrase>, the Prime Minister announced an increase in funding from &pound;3 million per annum rising to &pound;7 million a year by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.6/4">Last year also saw the largest ever replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which now stands at three billion dollars over four years. In addition to its assessed contribution to this replenishment, the UK contributed a voluntary additional amount of &pound;15 million, making a total contribution of around &pound;118 million. A substantial proportion of the GEF goes to biodiversity projects and within that a substantial proportion to protectedareas.</p>

	<p pid=".408W.5/2">All meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by official veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of diseases. Meat from Brazil must have been matured and tested to confirm that it has reached a sufficiently low pH (acidity) and then de-boned so as to remove any risk of the FMD virus being present. Whole carcase meat and bone-in cuts are not permitted.</p>
	<p pid=".408W.5/3">European Community law requires that all meat imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks, which may include taking a sample for testing. It is the responsibility of the Official Veterinary Surgeon to decide what type of test might be carried out. These checks ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport.</p>

This target was altered at the recent annual general meeting of the OIE for countries that have implemented active monitoring programmes, to 200 confirmed cases per million adult cattle. The consistent decline of the epidemic is steadily bringing the UK closer to this threshold.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.0/1">Many industrial activities in Great Britain are currently regulated under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This introduced the systems of Integrated Pollution Control, which controlled releases to all environmental media, and Local Air Pollution Control, which controlled releases to air only.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/2">The Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 were made under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and will eventually replace Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The Regulations implement the European Community (EC) Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) in so far as it relates to installations in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/3">The IPPC regime applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of certain industrial activities. This means that emissions to air, water (including discharges to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects, must be considered together. It also means that regulators must set permit conditions so as to achieve a high level of protection for the environment as a whole. These conditions are based on the use of the 'Best Available Techniques' (BAT), which balances the costs to the operator against the benefits to the environment. IPPC aims to prevent emissions and waste production and where that is not practicable, reduce them to acceptable levels. IPPC also takes the integrated approach beyond the initial task of permitting, through to the restoration of sites when industrial activities cease.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.0/4">Separate systems have been introduced to apply the IPPC Directive to Scotland, Northern Ireland and the offshore oil and gas industries. Regulation of industrial pollution in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a matter for the appropriate Ministers in these devolved administrations.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.11/1">The government recognises that flood risk management is crucial to the successful development of the Thames Gateway. In order to improve understanding of the likely effect of the Thames Gateway construction on existing and future flood management arrangements, my department has consulted with the Environment Agency. As a result, the Agency has accelerated plans for a strategic flood risk assessment of the Thames Gateway Zones of Change.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.11/2">This study is scheduled for completion at the end of May 2003, but early indications are that cost effective and sustainable flood risk management within the Thames Gateway, can be achieved by creative and intelligent planning and design. This will require close partnership working between the government and all agencies and developers involved. This strategic approach also opens up opportunities for significant enhancement of the environment that would not be possible if development is undertaken in an uncoordinated way. There are financial and environmental benefits to be gained from developing the Thames Gateway in a careful and sustainable way, including building flood defences at the time of development rather than later, or by allowing sufficient space for future defence construction in the development.</p>

	<p pid=".418W.3/1">Defra provides grant aid on capital flood and coastal defence projects that meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score. Operational responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation of defence measures rests with the operating authorities&mdash;normally the Environment Agency (EA), local councils and internal drainage boards&mdash;which have the relevant local knowledge. They also identify the need for defence measures and decide which projects to promote and their timing.</p>
	<p pid=".418W.3/2">Defra also encourages operating authorities to take a strategic approach to coastal defence measures. I understand that both Sefton Council and the EA, who are responsible for lengths of this coastline, are preparing coastal defence strategies which will, inter alia, take into account the condition of defences and seek to identify sustainable measures. Defra is providing grant to the Council towards the cost of related studies.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.0/1">Defra first became aware of difficulties obtaining strychnine hydrochloride in early February when a number of regular users contacted Defra's Rural Development Service who are responsible for authorising use of this compound to control mole infestations. Enquiries by my officials revealed that the difficulties had arisen due to a shortage of raw material experienced by the supplier used by many pharmacies. An alternative supplier, who gave assurances that they were able to meet demands, was identified and contact details were posted on the Defra website in early March (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/strychnine-shortage.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/strychnine-shortage.htm</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/2">Furthermore, to ease difficulties obtaining strychnine, Defra temporarily suspended the practice of specifying a named pharmacist on the permit to purchase strychnine (Form LP10). This change, which remains in force, enables authorised permit holders to purchase strychnine from any pharmacist with stocks of the compound.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/3">In view of the temporary nature of the shortages, an assessment of the cost to farmers was considered unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/4">Representations were received from regular users, including pest controllers and farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/5">Aluminium phosphide is also approved for use as an alternative for mole control. In the past the Department has commissioned work on a further alternative preparation, micro-encapsulated bromoform. This preparation has not been through the approvals process and it is not considered appropriate for the Department to pay for such registration costs.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/6">Defra has recently asked the Central Science Laboratory to undertake a review of the range of mole control methods which exist across the EU. The aim of this review is to produce guidance to UK interests on the most humane and effective methods of mole control which are currently available.</p>
	<p pid=".421W.0/7">As far as I am aware, strychnine hydrochloride is currently available from pharmacies, and there have been no recent enquiries reporting shortages. I am unable to comment on the long-term availability of this compound, as this is a matter for the importers.</p>

	<p pid=".423W.3/2">The Competition Commission's reasoning for not allowing veterinary surgeons to charge for prescriptions over the next three years is set out in paragraphs 2.169 to 2.173 of volume I of the report. The Commission stated in the report that if it was concerned simply to establish the correct market price for prescriptions then it might be reasonable to leave vets to set their own prices and then rely on the market. The Commission reasoned that prescription charges have a major impact on competition with pharmacies, as vets are able to set the charges so as to deter clients from asking for prescriptions. In that way, they can influence the terms of competition with pharmacies to their own advantage. The Commission's view is that the three-year period of writing prescriptions at no additional charge is necessary in order to ensure that charges will not deter animal owners from obtaining written prescriptions and making use of pharmacies.</p>

	<p pid=".427W.2/1">Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it. No central records were kept of how many school playing fields were sold before October 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/2">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase> to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/3">Applications to dispose of school playing fields are assessed against three main criteria. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/4" class="indent">(i) schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/5" class="indent">(ii) community needs: that community use of school playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary, and</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/6" class="indent">(iii) finance: that any sale proceeds are reinvested to provide new or improved sports facilities, or are used otherwise to help raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".427W.2/7">All applications made since <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-16">16 July 2001</phrase> have been scrutinised by the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel. The Panel comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association. The Panel provides advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria. In 1999 the Government approved 42 applications to sell school playing fields larger than a sports pitch; 32 applications were approved in 2000, 22 in 2001 and 23 in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.5/1">The UK government has been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. In particular, the UK is seeking agreement that additional bilateral voluntary debt relief should be excluded from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point in the HIPC initiative, and this rule change could provide a further US $1 billion in debt relief to HIPCs. The UK is also seeking to explore further options to address the issues of creditor litigation within the enhanced HIPC initiative. While the initiative does not alter the legal rights and obligations between HIPCs and their external creditors the UK believes that an adequate HIPC legal defence is still essential in reaching fair and equitable settlements with some creditors. More detail on the steps taken by the IMF and World Bank to encourage creditor participation and the status of commitments on HIPC from the G7 Kananaskis Summit, can be found in the September 2002 HIPC Status of Implementation Report and the March 2003 HIPC Initiative&mdash;Statistical Update. Both are available from the World Bank Website <a href="http://www.worldbank.orq/hipc">www.worldbank.orq/hipc</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/2">On March 12, 2003, the Executive Board of the IMF paper discussed creditor participation issues in the HIPC initiative. The Public Information Notice issued by the IMF on April 3, 2003, for this meeting reported the discussion between Directors on the issue of HIPC-to-HIPC debt:</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;On HIPC-to-HIPC debt relief, Directors took note of the fact that these claims are concentrated in a few HIPC creditors, and that some creditors have already made commitments to deliver their share of debt relief under the Initiative. Directors agreed that, where resolution of such outstanding claims is hindered by technical issues, the staff should be ready to provide technical assistance when requested by both parties, to help HIPC creditors and debtors themselves resolve these outstanding technical disputes.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/4" class="indent">Many Directors welcomed the proposal of the World Bank staff to establish and administer a trust fund to channel donor assistance to finance HIPC-to-HIPC debt relief. They agreed that such a trust fund should be used in cases where HIPC creditors are unable to deliver their share of HIPC relief owing to financial constraints, in accordance with the principles and conditions set out by individual donors. Others, however, questioned the need for such a fund given the small size of HIPC-to-HIPC debt and the existence of moral hazard issues.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/5">The full text of this Public Information Notice is available from the IMF website <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/news.htm">www. imf.org/external/news.htm</a>. With respect to tax incentives for creditors taking part in the HIPC initiative, corporate loan creditors can already claim relief under the loan relationships regime for losses on the release of debt owed by HIPC countries. The Inland Revenue is not aware of any non-corporate loan creditors.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.5/6">While the UK continues to work hard to promote the HIPC initiative the Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over US$50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.3/1">The Secretary of State is the Minister responsible for the delivery of all MDGs. I hold responsibility within the Department for the specific goals on water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.3/2">DFID supports an integrated approach to sanitation, water supply, and hygiene to improve health and combat poverty. Expenditure on specific water sector or related projects and programmes has remained roughly constant over the past three years; estimated at &pound;82 million in 1999&ndash;2000, &pound;91 million in 2000&ndash;01 and &pound;87 million in 2001&ndash;02. However, DFID's budget allocation is managed on a country rather than sector basis; our recent departmental report 2003 provides this information.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.3/3">The work DFID does has regard to what other donors are doing, and to our comparative advantage. In the water sector we have developed a role focused on improving policy. The provision of direct budget support (&pound;296 million in 2001&ndash;02) rather than funding projects has given us this leverage, particularly in Africa. A small proportion of the budget allocated through direct budget support may go directly to the water sector, but the main contribution of budget support to meeting the water/sanitation MDGs is through improvements in public sector capacity and governance. We continue to push for the inclusion of sanitation, water supply and hygiene in individual country Poverty Reduction Strategies Papers (PRSPs).</p>
	<p pid=".432W.3/4">DFID also provides funds, which may include spending on water, through a number of multilateral channels. DFID continues to work to ensure aid efficiency and for example, is currently engaged in the EU Water Initiative, which aims to improve the efficiency of existing financing mechanisms for water infrastructure through better donor co-ordination between member states.</p>

In light of this, fresh assurances were given by the Indonesians that British-built military equipment would not be used to violate human rights anywhere in Indonesia in September 2002. The Indonesians also said that the equipment would not be used offensively. These assurances cover all British-built military equipment.</p>

Nonetheless, I remain concerned that the use of the Hawk in Aceh may have been in breach of earlier assurances, and am actively seeking further assurance from the Indonesian Government about the future use of Hawk aircraft in Aceh. I will be raising the issue of the use of British-built equipment with the Indonesians on a visit to Indonesia this week. There have been no confirmed reports of other British-built military equipment being used in military action in Aceh. We continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.5/1">The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime brought to an end a long period of violations of the Iraqi people's human rights. As requested in UN Security Council Resolution 1483, put forward by the UK, US and Spain and adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>, the UN Secretary-General has appointed a Special Representative whose responsibilities include the promotion of human rights.

We aim to work closely with the Special Representative. In addition, working to support the people of Iraq in moving toward the establishment of a representative government based on the rule of law and affording equal rights and justice to all Iraqi citizens will be the best means to ensure that their human rights are protected.</p>

We have sent a small team of experts to Iraq to assess the current capacity of the Iraqi judicial system in relation to transitional justice, to consult suitable Iraqi bodies as they are established and to make recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".442W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-21">21 May 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/2">At present, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) staff are spread over 15 sites across the United Kingdom. Continuing with this level of dispersion will ultimately degrade DSTL's effectiveness and long-term viability. The split of the former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency has resulted in DSTL being left with many capabilities that are supported by small teams or individuals. If we are to preserve and develop these capabilities effectively then we need a degree of consolidation to exploit their synergies, achieve critical mass and sustain their technical excellence. We also know that, despite everything that information technology can do, there are enormous gains in communication and knowledge-sharing when people actually work together in the same or adjoining buildings. In addition, career development is much easier when people do not have to uproot themselves simply in order to work in a different technical area. Additionally, there are financial considerations. As a Government agency, DSTL is publicly accountable for how it uses taxpayers' assets and money. In anything but the short term the additional costs imposed by the current level of dispersion are considerable. These costs will inevitably divert funds from more productive uses in maintaining and developing facilities and delivering better quality science for the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/3">To address these issues, DSTL intends to move its staff onto three core sites at Fort Halstead, Porton Down and Portsdown Main. This was announced in July 2002 and hon. Members whose constituencies were affected were written to at the time explaining this decision. The site rationalisation plan commenced in August 2002 and it is intended to be completed by late 2006. It will involve the relocation of approximately 1,600 staff during this timeframe. The moves will ultimately reduce the fragmentation of the science and technology base of DSTL, bringing together like capabilities and reducing overheads and duplication of support functions in the organisation. This will ensure that DSTL can sustain long-term capability whilst providing an improved career structure for staff. While there is a possible risk that relocation will have a short-term impact that could affect capability in some areas, any effects will be more than outweighed by the significant long-term advantages these changes will produce. The relocation of the four staff currently employed at DSTL Dunfermline is part of the DSTL site rationalisation plan.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/4">The investment appraisal conducted by DSTL to support the site rationalisation plan was independently reviewed and agreed by the MOD Senior Economic Adviser. This work considered both the costs of re-provision of facilities and staff transfer. Staff will be eligible for support under the DSTL relocation procedures and the specific application of the procedures will be discussed on an individual basis taking into account personal commitments. The costs associated with the housing of staff who intend to relocate to the core DSTL sites will depend on the personal circumstances of the individuals but the organisation estimates an average cost of &pound;27,000.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/5">DSTL uses the planned goals and objectives of the laboratory to identify the career and personal development requirements for its staff. The career aspirations and personal development needs are obviously specific to individuals and determined by their own personal development plans and all staff in the organisation, regardless of their location, are given equal opportunity to undertake appropriate training and development to deliver the organisation's objectives. Costs for career and personal development are not determined on a per capita basis and depend on the individual's training and development needs. DSTL always looks to develop the talents and capabilities of its current staff and would look to existing staff to fill any vacancies created by the loss of DSTL Dunfermline staff from within the organisation. DSTL does not therefore envisage a significant increase in such costs attributable to their relocation plans. It currently has a relatively low annual turnover of staff and has an effective recruitment and training strategy, recruiting over 100 science graduates each year. Two of the four members of staff based at DSTL Dunfermline are within five years of normal retirement and succession plans and the associated costs to train staff to replace them are required regardless of any individual's intention to relocate.</p>
	<p pid=".442W.2/6">Finally, it has to be recognised that as a result of the split of DERA some moves are unavoidable. On those sites owned by QinetiQ, DSTL only has assured tenancy for a fixed period. Rather than embarking on a number of relocations as each lease expires that would place the organisation into a long-running series of moves, which would cause continuing disruption to staff and delay the benefits arising from rationalisation, it has been decided that a single plan that covers all sites should be adopted. The current lease at DSTL Dunfermline is for a period of five years, ending <phrase class="date" code="">12 August 2006</phrase>. However the other members of their technical group, which is currently based in Farnborough, will be relocating to Porton Down in the final quarter of 2003 and the intention is to consolidate the technical team at Porton Down as soon as is practicable.</p>

	<p pid=".444W.8/1">Subject to the constraints of the security situation on the ground, British troops in southern Iraq, including members of the Royal Military Police (RMP), have been providing ITN investigators with whatever assistance they reasonably could in trying to establish what has happened to Fred Nerac and Hussein Osman.</p>
	<p pid=".444W.8/2">The Ministry of Defence's position has always been that the RMP would only undertake a formal investigation into the disappearance of the two men if they had sufficient grounds to suspect that a war crime might have been committed. Following new information that has recently come to light, however, the RMP Special Investigations Branch will now investigate the disappearance of Fred Nerac and Hussein Osman.</p>

	<p pid=".453W.6/1">RAF Woodvale is the home to Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron (MASUAS), Liverpool University Air Squadron (LUAS) and No. 10 Air Experience Flight (AEF). Both University Air Squadrons at RAF Woodvale train undergraduate student pilots according to the Elementary Flying Training syllabus, which, during a student's time at university, provides them with general handling, instrument flying, formation and navigation. Ex-UAS student pilots are then able to enter the RAF at a stage where they can be streamed and selected for fast jet, helicopter or multi-engine aircraft. The AEF provides air experience for air cadet members of the Air Training Corps and RAF sections of the College Cadet Force.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.6/2">With effect from July 2003, RAF Woodvale will also train up to 17 Direct Entrant pilots to their streaming point, since the RAF element of the Joint Elementary Flying School contract is to be absorbed into the contract that covers UAS flying. This will be done within existing contracted flying hours.</p>
	<p pid=".453W.6/3">The UASs also provide general Service training for potential officers of all branches of the RAF.</p>

The discussions have not addressed the arrangements between the force and organisations that have been contracted to help provide the service.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/2">I understand from the Chief Constable that every Sussex Police-owned mobile phone was registered at the beginning of the scheme, a total of 1,687 phones. There was also an internal publicity drive to encourage staff to register both private and family members' phones. This marketing drive also explored links with external community partners and consequently a substantial number of mobile phones owned by East Sussex County Council, Brighton and Hove Council and West Sussex County Council have been registered.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.2/3">I further understand that, on the basis that some 700,000 people in the county have mobile phones, the force estimated that approximately 300,000 people would register for the Phase two text message service. It conducted its largest ever leaflet distribution campaign, in conjunction with Neighbourhood Watch, which resulted in some 15,000 people registering initially. This number may since have increased.</p>

Whilst users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represent just under one-quarter of all arrestees interviewed in NEW-ADAM, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>

	<p pid=".462W.5/1">The advanced features and flexibility offered by the new digital radio communications service for the police will contribute significantly to officer and public safety. The service will provide high quality fully encrypted communications to prevent eavesdropping, and for the first time will allow officers to call for assistance in emergencies by the operation of a single key.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.5/2">Following the Stewart Report on mobile phones and health, we asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to look at the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology used by Airwave. Their report, prepared by the NRPB's independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation, was published in July 2001. It concluded that, &quot;Although areas of uncertainty remain about the biological effects of low level Radio Frequency radiation in general, including modulated signals, current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features of the signals from TETRA mobile terminals and repeaters pose a hazard to health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.5/3">The report recommended further research to address remaining areas of uncertainty. We are taking this forward with a comprehensive programme of work, which has found no adverse health effects so far. As part of this programme, the Home Office has commissioned a national health monitoring study of Airwave police users. Regular updates are available on the Home Office website <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.5/4">Advice to planning authorities about radio masts is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and is supported by the ODPM Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development. No minimal distance from TETRA masts residential properties is recommended. The rule is that international guidelines on energy levels received from the mast should be met in areas accessible to the public. Independent checks of Airwave base stations have shown that these energy levels are hundreds of times less than the guidelines. As the service rolls out the location of TETRA masts within the Airwave service will be available on the &quot;Sitefinder&quot; database managed by the Radiocommunications Agency.</p>

These include the increased use of open competitions and assessment centres to provide a wider pool of diverse applicants and the appointment of an outreach worker to increase numbers in our under-represented groups, including staff with disabilities. In addition, a varied programme of awareness raising initiatives is planned as part of the European Year of Disabled People, including seminars focusing on particular disabilities and a leaflet, issued to all staff, advising them of internal services and assistance available. Our annual disability self-declaration exercise will also take place later this month.</p>

	<p pid=".466W.13/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that a wide variety of films is shown in cinemas across the UK. When it established the UK Film Council in April 2000 as the Government's leading strategic agency for film, one of its key objectives was to develop film culture by improving access to film.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/2">For this reason, the UK Film Council provides funding for independent regional cinema through its network of Regional Screen Agencies. Last year, &pound;1.25 million was provided to support independent cinemas.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/3">In addition, the UK Film Council is currently finalising a cinema exhibition strategy to further support audiences and, where appropriate, cinema exhibitors. This strategy will be delivered using &pound;18 million of Lottery funding, &pound;15 million of which has been delegated to the Film Council from the Arts Council of England, and is aimed at ensuring that the widest range of UK audiences gain access to the broadest range of British and International cinema.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/4">The key components of the strategy are:</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/5" class="indent">a Cinema Exhibition Fund totalling &pound;14 million for investment in a 'circuit' or network of specialised cinema screens, including an allocation for 'traditional' capital use such as refurbishment;</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/6" class="indent">a Digital Fund totalling &pound;1 million for investment in non-theatrical exhibition, and a package of measures aimed at increasing the availability of soft-subtitled prints <sup>1</sup> for the deaf or hard of hearing and audio description facilities for the blind or visually impaired; and</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/7" class="indent">three UK-wide funds, each of &pound;1 million per annum:</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/8" class="indent">a Cinema Education Fund;</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/9" class="indent">a Specialised Print and Advertising (P&amp;A) Fund; and</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/10" class="indent">a UK Film Distribution Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/11">Through the Film Council and the Cinema Exhibitors' Association, the Government are made aware of the issues and concerns facing independent cinemas in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.13/12" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> 'Soft' subtitling, as opposed to 'hard' subtitling that appears automatically on the screen, is stored on computer disc, which can be projected onto the screen when required using new sub-titling technologies equipment (such as DTS and Dolby).</p>

	<p pid=".468W.5/1">Quality is the foundation of a successful and competitive tourism industry and must include a variety of good quality accommodation that meets visitor expectations, both in terms of facilities and service. We want to ensure that the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) schemes: meet the needs of and are easily understood by visitors; attract a very high proportion of accommodation providers; and encourage continuous improvement in standards. There has been no change of tourism policy in this respect from what was published in Tomorrow's Tourism (1999).</p>
	<p pid=".468W.5/2">We have not conducted a formal assessment of the accommodation schemes but are determined to increase both industry take up and consumer recognition of the schemes. However, recent research by the (former) ETC has shown that membership of a quality grading scheme brings benefits to participants in terms of higher occupancy levels: 13 per cent. difference in higher occupancy levels between those who are members of the national, harmonised grading scheme and those who do not participate.</p>
	<p pid=".468W.5/3">We receive regular informal updates on consumer (and industry) views in correspondence and during visits in this country and abroad. We are confident that any research by VisitBritain into consumer attitudes towards accommodation schemes or views about the nature and detail of the current or proposed schemes will be adequately funded. VisitBritain will be assessing the requirements relating to consumer research and industry consultation over the coming months once confirmation has been made regarding the direction of the proposed changes. A final budget relating to this work is expected to be available in the autumn along with the final report. The research will be robustly conducted, involving other relevant bodies as appropriate, and properly analysed. We will, of course, take into account consumer views, as well as industry views, before reaching any decisions about the best way forward&mdash;this is what was done prior to the launch of the schemes for serviced accommodation in England, when they were harmonised with those of the AA and RAC in 1999.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.2/1">Discussion with senior industry representatives over the last year and a half has affirmed their commitment to the huge importance of quality, including the principle that establishments only of acceptable quality should be marketed via publicly funded e-tourism channels and in local authority brochures.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.2/2">The first part of the review of the accommodation grading schemes is being led jointly by the three National Tourist Boards in England, Scotland and Wales, who have engaged Alan Britten (former chairman of the English Tourism Council) to lead the review group, consult widely and report his findings to this Department this autumn. The group will examine the differences that exist between the schemes for hotels and guest accommodation in each country, with its main aim being to reach a view on whether common schemes are feasible and would be more readily understood by consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.2/3">Good progress on common Great Britain schemes has already been made in respect of quality assurance schemes for non-serviced accommodation, for instance self-catering, Hostels and Campus accommodation. The national Boards have agreed that research and consultation in relation to the self-catering scheme should commence during the summer of 2003. This part of the review will also include consideration of the effectiveness of the symbols used to indicate scheme membership and how we could reduce the proliferation of signs and logos that are currently displayed. The review will consider consumer and industry views of the value of the quality assurance schemes, the scheme's effectiveness and value for money of scheme membership. We also wish to look at how we can increase the levels of participation in the schemes, especially hotels and guest houses.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.2/4">The second part of the review relates to England only and is being led by VisitBritain. It will look at the management of the schemes, covering issues such as: assessment, administration, recruitment of businesses, and promotion to consumers. We expect a report to be ready early in 2004</p>

	<p pid=".470W.2/1">We are confident that any changes made to the current accommodation schemes, which will take three years to implement from the consumer perspective, will be cost-effective as well as increasing clarity and benefiting business. Any costs relating to inspections to any new standards will be minimal, as they will fit in with the established annual timetable.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.2/2">Replacement signage, if required, is in any case optional and should benefit business in view of the greater clarity we are aiming to achieve.

	<p pid=".471W.5/1">Preliminary assessments of the impact of Olympic Lottery games have been provided by Camelot, and reviewed by the National Lottery Commission. These estimates suggest that any negative impact on income to the existing good causes would be small&mdash;four per cent. for the remainder of the Camelot licence period, until 2009. It is possible that should additional funding be required the impact may rise to 11 per cent. between 2009&ndash;12. However, Olympic Lottery games have the potential to invigorate interest in the Lottery in general and in that way may benefit all the existing good causes.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.5/1">Before April 2001, there was no statutory basis to make payments of widow's benefits to men. The Government, in introducing its reform of support in bereavement from April 2001, said, following earlier findings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) that similar cases were admissible, that its obligation was to future widowers. The reforms of 2001 met that obligation and went further by making the new Widowed Parent's Allowance available to existing widowers from its introduction.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/2">In June 2002, the European Court of Human Rights found that the UK Government had violated the Convention in respect of Mr Kevin Willis by not paying him the Widowed Mother's Allowance and Widow's Payment that he would have been entitled to h.ad he been a woman in the same circumstances. The Court ordered a payment equivalent to the benefit that he would have received had he been a woman and an amount in respect of interest. The Government is not contesting that judgement.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/3">The Court did not consider the question of widow's pension and litigation remains before the domestic and Strasbourg Courts. The Court of Appeal heard arguments in the domestic cases during week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-07">7 October 2002</phrase> and judgment was reserved. The European Court of Human Rights decided to adjourn further hearings of two applications by widowers concerning widow's pension until the completion of the domestic litigation.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.5/4">There are important matters to be settled in both jurisdictions that will affect the Government's decisions in dealing with all the widowers affected. The Government is continuing to respond to the European Court of Human Rights1 requests for written observations on individual applications from widowers but, until the litigation is resolved, the Government cannot speculate about the outcomes of these cases or the decisions that it may take in the light of them.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.3/1">Under the Human Tissue Act 1961, organs and tissue may be taken and used for medical purposes after a post-mortem examination by a national health service pathologist if the person who has died authorised this prior to death. Where the deceased has not expressed a view, relatives may authorise such taking and use of organs and tissue.</p>

However, the Report of a Census of Organs and Tissues Retained by Pathology Services in England, published by the Chief Medical Officer in 2000, may be of interest.</p>

The changes in pay (over and above 10 per cent.) for specific groups, such as speech and language therapists, will depend on decisions made locally about which national job profile matches a particular post or, where there is no match with a national profile, on a local job evaluation. 97.3 per cent. of the qualified speech and language therapist workforce is female.</p>

	<p pid=".488W.2/2">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) (formerly the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)) has for many years undertaken surveillance of biological agents on the Department's behalf. The approach taken has been to build on the public health need to have in place clinical and laboratory based surveillance for the most likely agents that could be used in a biological attack.

	<p pid=".488W.2/3">In October 2001 a further package of guidance on the deliberate release of anthrax, smallpox, plague, botulism and the approach to dealing with a chemical, biological or radiological deliberate release was issued. Complementary operational guidance for clinicians, including general practitioners (GPs), was placed on the then PHLS's (now the HPA's) website. These are regularly updated.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.2/4">In December 2002, the Department published Interim guidelines for smallpox response and management in the post eradication era on the departmental website.

	<p pid=".491W.0/1">We have no evidence of audiology departments discriminating against any age group in the fitting of digital hearing aids. Such discrimination would not be acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".491W.0/2">Most first wave sites fitted new patients when they were first modernised and then extended this to include review patients. However, this is a matter for local discretion and some current sites are fitting both new and review patients concurrently from the start. The Royal National Institute for the Deaf has issued guidelines to audiologists in sites taking part in the modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) project. These guidelines advise that patients who have received National Health Services analogue hearing aids in the last three years should not be renewed for a digital aid unless there are clinical reasons why it is particularly appropriate to fit such an aid. The guidelines suggest that patients should be assessed for digital aids if there has been significant deterioration in their hearing since the last assessment, or if the patient has been persistently dissatisfied with the performance of the analogue aid. 83,397 hearing aids had been fitted as part of the modernisation project by the end of March 2003. The cost of finding out how many of those were fitted to patients who already had analogue aids would be disproportionate, and the information is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".494W.8/3">The minimum practice income guarantee is designed to ensure that no practice loses out from the new allocation formula, providing they achieve a minimum level of quality. Practices that gain from the allocation formula will not receive a minimum practice income guarantee and will have their global sum allocation determined by the formula. Most practices will see a substantial rise in gross income. The average increase will depend on what services general practitioner practices provide and the level of quality they achieve.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.0/1">Primary care trusts have a pivotal role in assessing the extent of health care needs within their catchment area and funding service provision, including adult hospice and children's hospice services. The level of funding agreed is a matter for local discussion.</p>

This funding is specifically to meet the commitments and aims set out in the NHS Cancer Plan. The extra &pound;50 million represents an increase of about 38 per cent. in the amount of National Health Service funding being put into adult specialist palliative care over 2000 levels and means that the pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan will be more than met. Allocation from this &pound;50 million to local cancer networks will be made once network investment plans have been approved by the joint NHS/voluntary sector group&mdash;National Partnership Group.</p>
	<p pid=".496W.0/3">During 2002&ndash;03 Chorley and South Ribble Primary Care Trust provided &pound;472,000 to St. Catherine's Hospice and &pound;11,000 to Derian House. These amounts will be uplifted to reflect inflation during 2003&ndash;04 prior to any further allocation which may be made from the &pound;50 million.</p>

Patients have travelled using a number of different modes of transport, including ambulance, Eurostar and air charter. Air charter is only used where the numbers to be transported make the option cost effective. Air charter has been used on five occasions to transport 122 patients from Plymouth National Health Service Trust and the Royal United Hospital in Bath to hospitals in St. Etienne, France. Spare capacity was made available to the patient's relatives, at no cost to the NHS. The precise costs of the air charter are subject to commercial confidentiality; the cost per patient for the air charter compared well with the cost of the equivalent commercial flights.</p>

	<p pid=".506W.5/2">The Government has made clear its commitment to implementing what was agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. Details of those Departments with lead responsibility for taking this forward is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".506W.5/3">The Department of Health does not have a lead responsibility in relation to WSSD. Although there is no major direct health interest, poor water quality and sanitation, for example, are recognised causes of ill health and disease. Therefore, we are continuing to work with other Government Departments to ensure that, where appropriate, health and health care issues are included in the effective delivery of the UK commitments made in Johannesburg.</p>
	<p pid=".506W.5/4">The Department is represented on the Government's new Sustainable Development Task Force announced by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in February 2003. The task force will play an important part in the review of the Government's Sustainable Development Strategy, which will take into account World Summit outcomes.</p>
