New measures have recently been introduced to address the smuggling of tobacco from other countries, including legislation which places an obligation on tobacco manufacturers not to facilitate smuggling, and the incorporation of a covert anti-counterfeit security mark on packs of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco. The introduction of the security mark supports legitimate retailers by creating a deterrent to counterfeit products infiltrating the retail supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.9/2">In December 2006, DEFRA let a contract to assess the impact of the restrictions brought in by Commission Regulation 318/2007 in March 2007. The contractors were asked to assess the impact of the current import ban on wild birds on illegal trade levels, as well as the related risk of the introduction of exotic diseases to native and domestic bird populations. Completion of the report was delayed to enable the contractors more time to obtain and assess data. The contractors draft report has however now been submitted to DEFRA, and it is being considered to ensure its accuracy and that the contract terms have been met. It is anticipated that the report will be finalised and published either in April or May. In addition, Government continue to support the national wildlife crime unit which acts as a monitor on the illegal trade in such species in the UK.</p>

However, following some estimates of likely take-up of vaccine from industry and expert recommendations on where we could expect the disease to be present this year, we have ordered 20 million doses for use in England (and a further 2.5 million doses are reserved for use in Wales). The UK was the first member state affected by the current outbreak to place an order for vaccine. We are considering with industry how best to secure future supplies.</p>

	<p pid="a.727W.8/2">The vaccine we have ordered from Intervet will be available in 50 ml and 20 ml bottles, and livestock keepers will be able to purchase vaccine through their private vets via veterinary wholesalers. The wholesale &quot;list&quot; price is likely to be &pound;22.02 for the 50 ml bottles and &pound;13.10 for the 20 ml bottles. However, it is expected that the final on-farm price is likely to be between &pound;27.50 and &pound;33.00 for the 50 ml bottles (i.e. around 55 to 66 pence per ml) and between &pound;16.35 and &pound;19.65 for the 20 ml bottles (i.e. around 82 to 98 pence per ml) plus VAT. This will allow the wholesalers and veterinary organisations to cover the overhead, handling and administration charges throughout the distribution process. The on-farm price will be dependent on arrangements between keepers, their private vets and veterinary wholesalers.</p>

	<p pid="a.728W.2/1">In collaboration with a core group of industry stakeholders, the Government fully considered the option of a compulsory vaccination programme. However, this would cost the farming industry at least 50 per cent. more than voluntary vaccination and, because of the associated increase in regulatory burdens, would slow down the distribution of vaccine in a situation where speed will be of the essence. Moreover, the lack of scientific evidence to support an immediate prospect of eradication through vaccination suggests that the case for compulsion is weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.728W.2/2">Together with the core group, the Government have therefore developed a vaccination plan that avoids the negative consequences of compulsion, but promotes mass take-up of the vaccine through an industry-led campaign.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.8/2">The method used to estimate the impact of additional capacity at Heathrow on UK aviation CO2 emissions in the 'Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport' consultation document is referenced at paragraph 2.23 of the impact assessment (annex B). Full details of the forecasting method can be found in chapter 3 of 'UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 Forecasts', available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.8/4">There is no internationally agreed way to allocate to individual countries the CO2 emissions from international flights. For reporting purposes, the UN framework convention on climate change requires each nation to report emissions based on aviation bunker fuel consumption, which is closely related to fuel used on departing flights. To ensure consistency with historic reported totals, and to avoid double-counting CO2 emissions, our forecasts include international aviation emissions on a departing flight only basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.746W.11/1">The Government do not encourage the carriage of firearms on board UK registered merchant ships. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Government condone the use of armed guard protection on board such ships. For example, certain shipments of nuclear material and certain VIP passenger movements have received armed guard protection. In these exceptional circumstances, ship owners should ensure that the guards are properly trained in the effective use of firearms in order to minimise accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.11/2">In line with their policy of discouraging the carriage of firearms on board UK registered merchant ships, the Government have not set rules of engagement for armed guards at sea. Any company providing an armed guard protection service to a UK registered merchant ship is fully accountable under UK law and the laws of any state in whose territorial and internal waters the firearms are carried.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.11/3">While the Government do not encourage the carriage of firearms on board UK registered merchant ships, there are legal provisions governing their carriage. Firearms are controlled under the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended) and these provisions were explained in Merchant Shipping Notice 1704 published in January 1998. Permits to carry firearms on ships are issued by the police under guidance issued by the Home Office. Where firearms are carried on board UK registered merchant ships the ship security plan should detail how and where they are stored and state the procedures for accessing them.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.9/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has not made any specific assessment of the financial support given by the South East Regional Development Agency (SEEDA) and English Partnerships to the regeneration of derelict sites in the former East Kent coalfield. However, other related assessments have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.9/2">As part of the Department's sponsorship framework of the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), a general assessment of the performance of the RDAs is undertaken by the National Audit Office in the form of Independent Performance Assessment (IPA). This assesses five criteria; ambition, prioritisation, capacity, performance management and achievement. The last IPA report on SEEDA was published in November 2006 (and can be found on SEEDA's website: <a href="http://www.seeda.co.uk">www.seeda.co.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.9/3">More specifically, SEEDA itself commissioned consultants BBP and SQW to undertake an interim evaluation of the East Kent coalfields programme. The purpose of this was to establish the impact of regeneration activity to date in the East Kent coalfields area and to assess how well the coalfields programme has addressed its targets. This report was presented to SEEDA in August 2007 in draft and is currently being refined to include 2007 data.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.9/4">BBP and SQW were previously commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) to conduct an independent evaluation of the coalfields regeneration programme in England. This was published in March 2007. The report provided strong evidence of the positive impact of English Partnerships' National Coalfields Programme on our former coalfield communities, including the East Kent coalfields. The report, 'Regenerating the English Coalfields&mdash;Interim evaluation of the coalfield regeneration programmes' is available on the Communities and Local Government website:</p>

	<p pid="a.751W.2/15">We have continued to realign funding towards basic literacy and numeracy, full level 2 and full level 3 qualifications providing skills for employment and further progression in learning away from, for example, very short or low quality courses. This has enabled us to support significant increases in participation for young people and adults in these key programmes, providing them with the education and skills they need to fully participate in an economically successful and socially cohesive society.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.2/16">This Department and the LSC are working closely with the Department of Work and Pensions and Jobcentre Plus to implement the proposals outlined in &quot;World Class Skills: Implementing the Leitch Review of Skills in England&quot; and the Green Paper: &quot;In Work, better off,&quot; both published in July this year. These include supporting individuals, including older workers into sustainable employment and progression in work and in skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.2/17">In line with this we are working with employers through Train to Gain and the Skills Pledge to meet skill needs and to ensure that all employees including older people have the basic skills, including literacy and numeracy and Level 2 skills (equivalent to five good GCSEs) needed to sustain and progress in employment. To support this we are increasing funding for Train to Gain from &pound;440 million in 2007-08 to over &pound;900 million in 2010-11. We want to encourage all employers in England to make a Skills Pledge that is a specific promise that every eligible employee will be helped to gain basic skills, and a full Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.751W.2/18">We recognise the importance of FE and adult learning in meeting a range of social and community needs and remain fully committed to ensuring that older learners can benefit from a wide range of learning opportunities, including learning for its own sake, for personal fulfilment and to sustain an active role in the community. In addition we have committed &pound;210 million per annum until 2010-11 to safeguard learning opportunities for personal fulfilment, community development and active citizenship.</p>

In Northern Ireland, Article 19(1)(b) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 provides a constable with the power to enter and search any premises, including aircraft, for the purposes of affecting an arrest of a person for an indictable offence. In Scotland if a constable has grounds to believe that a crime has been committed anywhere within an airport, including an aircraft which has landed and is stationed at a terminal, they can investigate in the same way as for any other crime committed elsewhere within their force area.</p>

	<p pid="a.760W.0/1">We are involved in a variety of activity to reduce the incidence of offences related to identity theft. A public-private sector work programme, the Identity Fraud Steering Committee (IFSC), was set up in 2003 to co-ordinate this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/2">We have sought to ensure better co-ordination in prosecuting fraudsters. This has involved the establishment of a network of single points of contact in all police forces and a range of Government Departments and agencies dealing with identity fraud investigations and prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/3">Legislation has also been strengthened. Tougher criminal penalties have been introduced for driving licence and passport offences, alongside offences in the Identity Cards Act 2006 to target those who possess and use false identity documents and genuine documents belonging to someone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/4">More powers to share data to combat fraud have been enacted in the Serious Crime Act 2007, and most recently the Disclosure of Death Registration Information Scheme, under the Police and Justice Act 2006, was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/5">We have introduced systems to confirm the validity of UK passports presented to other organisations and interviews for first time passport applicants over 16-years-old now take place to verify the identity of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/6">The IFSC produce a leaflet and a website <a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk">www. identitytheft.org.uk</a> to increase public awareness of the problem. The material advises on how to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity fraud, warning signs to look out for, and what someone should do if they do fall victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase> the Attorney-General announced that funding had been approved for the proposals arising from the Government's Fraud Review. This includes the development of a National Fraud Strategic Authority, together with a National Fraud Reporting Centre, the establishment of the City of London Police as the lead force on fraud, and proposals for measurement of fraud. These measures will help to tackle fraud in general and increase our understanding of the nature and extent of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.0/8">Finally, our plans for a National Identity Scheme will provide people with a highly secure means of protecting their identity and help citizens to prove their identities easily, quickly and with vastly improved security.</p>

	<p pid="a.768W.5/1">The information requested on the total cost of police pensions and on the cost of pension provision as a share of police spending for each constabulary for the years before 2006-07 is not held centrally as the administration of the police pension schemes is the responsibility of individual police authorities. Information on financial statistics, including expenditure on police pensions and overall spending, for police forces is included in the annual reports published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). This information is gathered independently of the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.5/2">However, the system for financing police pensions changed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Under the new system, police authorities no longer have to meet the cost of pensions in payment out of their operating accounts. Police authorities now have a separate pensions account for this purpose, into which are paid officers' contributions and a new employer's contribution. Where the pensions account does not have enough funds to meet the cost of pensions in any year it is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. A key benefit of this change is that it takes away from police authorities the responsibility for meeting the rising cost of pensions in payment as a result of an increase in the number of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.5/3">Figures from the annual police pensions financing reporting cycle show that based on police forces' unaudited accounts for 2006-07, the estimated pensions expenditure from forces' pensions accounts under the new system across the service was &pound;1.96 billion&mdash;&pound;1.46 billion net of the contributions made by serving officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.5/4">The following figures are the most recently published projections of total future expenditure on police pensions in England and Wales, net of the contributions made by serving officers. These were produced by the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) as part of the consultation process on the new system for funding police pensions in 2005. GAD advise that in view of the time elapsed since the figures were produced they should be viewed only as indicative as the likely future trend of police pensions expenditure. No projections are available for 2013-14 to 2050-51.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.5/5">The following table outlines figures for the expenditure of each police force on employer contributions for police pension purposes, based on their unaudited accounts, set against each force's budget requirement for 2006-07 as a percentage.</p>
	<p pid="a.768W.5/6">Membership figures are not held centrally, but we estimate that there are approximately 140,000 active members of one or other of the two Police Pension Schemes. We also estimate that there are approximately 120,000 police pensioners, including survivor pensions, and a further 20,000 police deferred pensioners. This gives a total estimate of 280,000 members of the police pension schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.3/1">Jobcentre Plus has a responsibility to use taxpayers' money wisely. Access to Work assessment procedures evaluate customer needs and identify the most cost effective but suitable support solution. In the majority of cases, external assessors carry out workplace based assessments. Once support has been agreed the customer or their employer purchase the support from a supplier of their choice up to the agreed funding level and claim reimbursement from Access to Work.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.3/2">Managerial checks are carried out to ensure validity of applications and that claims are adequately checked before payments are made. These checks also ensure that the correct amount is paid promptly to the relevant person or organisation and the amounts claimed are in line with the spend profiled for the customer.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.3/3">To further mitigate the risk of fraudulent claims or inappropriate support, all Access to Work customers receiving ongoing support are reviewed at least once annually to confirm that the appropriate support is being claimed and received. All customers complete a renewal declaration stating that any change of circumstances has been notified and the support meets their needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.6/2">The administration of the Child Support Agency is the matter for the chief executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephan Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, with reference to the Answer of 17th July 2007, Official Report, columns 205-6W, on children: maintenance, what the reasons were for recent statements by the staff operating the Child Support Agency (CSA) MP hotline that they are unable to contact the Bolton Office of the CSA by telephone.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/6" class="indent">In my previous letter to you I confirmed that when the Agency received a complaint relating to a clerical case managed by the Bolton site, the initial contact with the Bolton site was by email to ensure that all the necessary information to progress and resolve the client's concerns was gathered.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/7" class="indent">Since my last response to you in July 2007, the Agency has addressed the concerns that you and others have raised about how the Bolton site was managing complaints. Our Minister, Lord McKenzie, also wrote to all Members of Parliament in July last year announcing the Agency's decision to increase the resource dedicated to managing the clerical caseload. All complaints involving Members of Parliament or the Independent Case Examiner were transferred to specialist caseworkers within the Agency at the end of last year. In addition the Agency now retains new clerical cases until the first maintenance payment has been received, allowing the Bolton site to concentrate on collecting and paying maintenance for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/8" class="indent">These changes now mean that clerical cases are progressed in five separate sites across the Agency. To support these changes the Agency introduced a new database which allows all sites receiving queries relating to clerical cases to deal with all but the most complex of issues. Where the Agency is unable to resolve a query relating to a clerical case from the MP Hotline by reference to the database, the Agency now co-ordinates the response through a specialist team based in our Falkirk Centre. This team then takes responsibility for resolving the query and will contact the Member of Parliament to progress the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/9" class="indent">I can assure you that the Agency is committed to improving the service to those clients whose cases are managed clerically and as a result of the additional resource dedicated to this area client service will continue to improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.6/10" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

This consideration does not remove the duty on the court to consider fairly the case against the tenant who is accused of committing or failing to prevent antisocial behaviour.

	<p pid="a.780W.8/1">Neither jobseeker's allowance, nor income support are payable to people who live outside Great Britain. Further, 0.45 per cent. only of incapacity benefits claimants live abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.8/2">An EC regulation co-ordinates member states' social security schemes for workers who move between member states. The EC regulation provides that generally, sickness and invalidity benefits must be exported if a beneficiary moves to another member state, although there are some restrictions on the export of sickness benefit. In effect, people in Great Britain who qualify for contributory incapacity benefit (IB) because they have made sufficient national insurance contributions, can continue to receive their benefit if they take up permanent residence in one of the other EU member states. The agreement also extends to the states of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. The UK also has reciprocal arrangements with a number of non-European countries (e.g. USA, Jamaica) some of which include similar arrangements for people from Great Britain to continue to receive contributory benefit when they move there and vice-versa.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.8/3">Of those receiving IB abroad most live in the Republic of Ireland and Spain and smaller numbers across a wide range of other European countries. Very few live outside Europe. They include both British expatriates and nationals of other countries who have worked and paid contributions in Great Britain and have then returned to their own country. They also include &quot;pro rata&quot; cases where the benefit is paid partly by the UK and partly by a foreign authority as customers have contributed to insurance schemes in both Great Britain and an EEA state.</p>

A recent study commissioned by the MOD found that, providing it is consumed in its entirety, there is no nutritional evidence to suggest that healthy personnel could not subsist on 24 hour ORPs indefinitely. Personnel deployed on extended patrols usually live on ORP for the duration of their task, although whenever possible, ORPs (both the 24 hour and 10 man variants) are supplemented by fresh produce cooked by service chefs.</p>

	<p pid="a.794W.2/1">Service family accommodation (SFA) is provided to house service personnel and their dependants, and in England and Wales most SFA is owned by Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL). Surplus properties are returned to that company. In Colchester some unoccupied properties have been used to accommodate single service personnel while new single living accommodation (SLA) blocks are being built. However, as new SLA becomes available the SFA properties are returned to AHL. For instance around 100 properties have been identified for return to AHL in Financial Year 2008-09. For these, among other, reasons we have no current plans to make empty SFA available for non-military use.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/2">Out of the 1,094 SFA properties at Colchester some 219 are currently void (not in use for their intended purpose). Void stock includes SFA being held for planned moves of service units, or awaiting planned upgrades, sale or release, modernisation or demolition. The Department is taking a number of steps to reduce the amount of void SFA. Since March 2007, the total number of void SFA worldwide has reduced from 13,336 to 12,240 properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/3">Whether SFA is occupied or not, we pay the same rent to AHL, an average of 3,500 per annum per property, It is thus not possible to identify the rent paid to AHL for void properties in this and previous years, as no separate assessment of the cost of void SFA is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.796W.3/5" class="indent">The audit I have undertaken is now concluded, and it indicates that across Defence the number of people performing press officer functions is around 70, although it is impossible to give a precise figure, and some of these also have other duties. A number of other individuals are involved in communication activity but do not have a press officer role.</p>

	<p pid="a.801W.3/1">The Allnutt Review of Tourism Statistics, published in June 2004, made 14 major recommendations. The implementation of these has necessarily been framed against available resources, the evolution of needs and taking advantage of opportunities that have arisen.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/2">A main recommendation of the review was to establish and resource an effective organisation to develop and maintain tourism statistics of appropriate quality. This 'Tourism Statistics Unit' was recommended to most appropriately be located in the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The recent formation of the English Tourism Intelligence Partnership (ETIP) has led to significant progress being made against this recommendation and planning is under way for the unit to be established, in the ONS, this summer. The work plan for a new 'Tourism Intelligence Unit' (TIU) is being drawn up, and will include fully reviewing the recommendations and preparing costed proposals for future development and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/3">A brief summary of progress against each of the other recommendations is provided as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/4" class="italic"> Recommendation 1: UK Tourism Survey (UKTS) and Leisure Day Visits Survey (LDVS) should be subject to a major redesign</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/5" class="indent">The UKTS was redesigned and recommissioned in 2005 to address serious concerns about the erosion of data quality. The LDVS was most recently conducted by Natural England in 2005 (England only). The ONS has identified a cost-benefit analysis of the possible future inclusion of these two surveys within the ONS' new Integrated Household Survey as part of their provisional work plan for the TIU.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/6" class="italic"> Recommendation 2: Some interim improvements should be made to the LDVS</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/7" class="indent">Improvements were made to the methodology for the 2005 England Day Visits Survey. VisitBritain have been exploring possible options for a more regular, consistent, day visits survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/8" class="italic"> Recommendation 3: The International Passenger Survey (IPS) should be improved as a source of tourism statistics</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/9" class="indent">A recent change to the survey methodology has extended the weighting of the survey results to a regional basis, but other significant improvements&mdash;such as the regular inclusion of a detailed expenditure trailer&mdash;would require major financial investment. However, the IPS in its current format continues to provide credible and reliable data on inbound and outbound tourism.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/10" class="italic"> Recommendation 4: The registers of accommodation and other tourism businesses should be improved</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/11" class="indent">The provisional work plan for the TIU includes development and publication of a better statistical picture of the 'supply side' tourism data&mdash;drawing on ONS business data.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/12" class="indent">In 2007, VisitBritain commissioned a project aiming to measure the level of serviced and non-serviced accommodation stock across England, by region, using their own extensive database of accommodation data from regional partners and commercial organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/13" class="italic"> Recommendation 5: The UK Occupancy Survey (UKOS) should be improved to cover all types of commercial accommodation and provide viable statistics of occupancy and visitor nights</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/14" class="indent">The methodology for the England part of the occupancy survey was changed in 2007, with a switch to an online-only approach to speed up reporting and improve response rates. The survey still covers serviced accommodation only.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/15" class="italic"> Recommendation 6: The Survey of Visits to Visitor Attractions (SVVA) should be amended to focus more on the quality and completeness of its statistics of visitor numbers</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/16" class="indent">The National Tourism Organisations continue to each conduct a separate annual Survey of Visits to Visitor Attractions. In addition, VisitBritain has addressed the call for timelier visitor data by launching the quarterly England Attractions Monitor in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/17" class="italic"> Recommendation 7: Regional input-output tables of the best possible quality, and supplementary statistics from relevant businesses, should be produced as key input to the proposed development of Tourism Satellite Accounts</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/18" class="indent">A pilot UK Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) was published in 2004, with a follow-up pilot TSA for the English regions published in 2005. Proposals for future development of TSA work will be scoped and costed by the TIU.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/19" class="italic"> Recommendation 8: Panel surveys should be developed to provide timely short-term indicators of trends for a range of relevant indicators</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/20" class="indent">VisitBritain launched a 'Domestic Industry Panel' in 2006 to help identify reasons behind the trends seen in the quantitative surveys. It is conducted three times a year and involves interviews with senior people in leading tourism businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/21" class="indent">The England Attractions Monitor, launched by VisitBritain in 2006, is a quarterly panel of 500 visitor attractions across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/22" class="indent">A 'Trip Tracker' survey is also run by VisitBritain in advance of major holiday periods&mdash;Easter, Christmas and the August bank holiday&mdash;in order to monitor short-term trends. However, the survey is a random telephone survey rather than a panel survey.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/23" class="italic"> Recommendation 9: Methods for producing local tourism statistics should be developed and piloted</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/24" class="indent">The proposal for improved production of local area tourism statistics will be reviewed by the TIU.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/25" class="italic"> Recommendation 10: Arrangements should be established for tourism interests to influence the development of employment and related statistics</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/26" class="indent">The provisional work plan for the TIU includes the development and publication of a better statistical picture of the 'supply side' tourism data, drawing on ONS business data&mdash;this will include undertaking basic statistical analyses of employment and other economic data.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/27" class="italic"> Recommendation 11: The dissemination of tourism statistics, and information about the basis and quality of those statistics, should be improved</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/28" class="indent">VisitBritain have greatly improved the communication of research and market intelligence to the industry. They produce rich 'Market Profiles', quarterly round-ups of research and intelligence and have revamped their research web pages (to replace the Star UK website).</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/29" class="indent">The provisional work plan for the TIU includes development of a series of guidance notes that will outline the basis and quality of all key tourism statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/30" class="italic"> Recommendation 12: Various steps should be taken to improve the quality of statistics of Business Tourism</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/31" class="indent">No significant progress&mdash;in line with review's recommendation to see as low priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/32" class="italic"> Recommendation 13: The review also makes a number of other, relatively minor, recommendations</p>
	<p pid="a.801W.3/33" class="indent">No significant progress&mdash;also low priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.806W.6/1">Table 1 as follows details the funding which Partnerships for Schools plans to allocate to Building Schools for the Future projects in waves 1, 2 and 3. Funding is provided to local authorities as an 'envelope' to allow local allocation of resources to individual schools in accordance with local priorities. As projects develop, the funding allocations are updated, so it is likely that the final allocations will change. Funding levels have not yet been confirmed for live projects in wave 4 and beyond. However, table 2 shows current indicative allocations, which are subject to change, for each wave 4 authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.810W.5/1">All local authorities, schools, and early years settings must haves regard to the special educational needs code of practice which provides advice on carrying out statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs. Children with dyslexia should have their needs identified and support put in place in the same way as children with any other type of special educational need (SEN).</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.5/2">To help those working in schools with identifying and supporting children with dyslexia, last October we launched the Inclusion Development Programme, which will offer professional development in key areas of SEN starting with training on communication difficulties, including dyslexia. The Inclusion Development Programme materials are being developed in close consultation with dyslexia organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.5/3">This builds on earlier support to schools which has included: funding the British Dyslexia Association's schools resource pack 'Achieving Dyslexia Friendly Schools'; working with the British Dyslexia Association to produce and disseminate a poster to primary schools on identifying children with dyslexia; and funding the National Strategies production of a DVD 'Learning and teaching for dyslexic children'.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.5/4">To identify and disseminate best practice in improving outcomes for children with dyslexia, we are working with a number of dyslexia organisations on the &quot;No to Failure&quot; project. This is supporting schools in three local authority areas to be &quot;trailblazers&quot;, where children are being screened for dyslexia and specialist tuition is provided to those identified with dyslexia. The impact on outcomes is being evaluated. The project is also raising awareness of dyslexia as a learning difficulty. We are providing up to &pound;900,000 funding over three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.5/5">As set out in the Children's Plan (cm 7280), we will develop a pilot which will evaluate the impact of additional intensive reading tuition for children identified as needing this through the 'Every Child a Reader' programme. If specialist provision demonstrates significant impact, we will look at how assessment and specialist dyslexia support could be rolled out nationwide as best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.810W.5/6">Through the Education Act 1996, local authorities are required to arrange for the parent of any child with SEN in their area to be provided with advice and information about matters relating to those needs. We are providing &pound;64,000 this financial year, and &pound;86,000 next financial year to enable the British Dyslexia Association to enhance their helpline's provision of information and advice for teachers and parents on best practice in identifying and supporting children with dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.0/1">I believe that pilot initiatives are a valuable way to test and develop policy options and their likely impact prior to implementation. They allow us to work in close partnership with local leaders and key partners to understand how policies will work in practice. This understanding from early testing and implementation is key to our decision-making on national roll-out. Due to the prohibitive cost involved in trawling a 10-year period I am unable to supply the details of all the individual schemes that my Department has sponsored for the period requested; but I am happy to attach the most recent information we have for 2007 as an illustration of the range and cost of our test activity. Although too early for full, formal evaluations of these schemes, I can give assurance that all initiatives are closely monitored and the learning fed back into policy design and operational implementation on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.0/2">We have recently improved our internal processes for planning and coordinating our pilot schemes to ensure we maximise the learning and cost savings from this activity in a more systematic way while minimising burdens on front line delivery. We are also working hard to ensure that local authorities and regional government office colleagues are closely involved in the selection of pilots, and that there is strategic coherence in the breadth and range of such activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.814W.5/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has no evidence to suggest that any household has chosen to reduce their income in order that their children become eligible for education maintenance allowance (EMA). Where people have made choices which have reduced income, such as moving from full time to part time work, it seems unlikely that such choices would have been made solely on the basis that their child may, in the following financial year, be able to claim EMA for up to one year. Parents are entitled to make decisions about their lifestyle and career, and it is not for the administrators of the EMA scheme to challenge those personal choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.814W.5/2">For EMA purposes, the majority of successful applicants have their household income assessed on the basis of a tax credit award notice (TCAN) awarded by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or through a benefits check verified with the Department for Work and Pensions. Both Departments make detailed investigations to assess the evidence presented for establishing income for tax and benefit purposes. Our strategy for protecting the EMA scheme against potential abuse through the incomplete or false declaration of household income includes a data sharing protocol with both of those Departments. We currently investigate evidence we assess as high risk. We plan to strengthen this by building on our data sharing protocol to verify all EMA income assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.815W.2/1">Schools in Building Schools for the Future (BSF) are required to complete a post occupancy evaluation as part of the design quality indicator for schools process. This was put in place for local authorities joining the programme as pathfinders and in the subsequent waves. Post occupancy evaluation typically takes place after the building has been through a cycle of one summer and one winter and so the first evaluations are expected to take place towards the end of 2008.</p>

Future academies, delivered through BSF will be subject to the requirements of that programme.</p>

Other local authorities provide Bikeability standard training as part of their normal programme without DFT grant. For example York city council provide training to around 2,500 children to different Bikeability levels, including 1,200 to Level 2.</p>

	<p pid="a.817W.2/1">In the early years of diploma delivery, we have made it our priority that all learners doing diplomas should have a good experience. To this end, we instituted a rigorous Gateway process, designed to ensure that only consortiums which were well placed to deliver from 2008 were allowed to do so. Only around 20 per cent. of applications were approved to teach diplomas in 2008 through this process, with 144 consortiums across the country involved in delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.817W.2/2">Since then, we have been supporting these consortiums in a range of ways, and training teachers to teach diplomas. At the time of making Gateway applications, the consortiums approved to deliver from 2008 estimated that around 39,000 young people could be taking diplomas, In a number of cases, we have encouraged consortiums to keep student numbers lower than their initial projections in the first year, as new arrangements are introduced, in order to ensure that the quality of the experience for young people is extremely high. Therefore, we would anticipate that learner numbers in these areas should be lower than initial consortiums' projections. However, young people are making choices at present for September and, particularly post-16, will continue to do so for some months. We are therefore unable to provide an accurate national figure for learner numbers in September at this point.</p>
	<p pid="a.817W.2/3">Recent announcements of the results of the second Diploma Gateway show a significant increase in the quality of applications to deliver diplomas, leading to a substantial increase in the number of consortiums approved to deliver diplomas in 2009 against the same rigorous criteria. By September 2009, we anticipate that some 335 consortiums will be offering diplomas to around 100,000 young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.820W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.2/2">Historically, vocational qualifications at level 2 have been associated with improvement in earnings where those qualifications were obtained in the workplace rather than in college, and for people who have no or low qualifications rather than those who are already qualified to level 2 or better, for example through having good GCSEs. Thus the skills strategy has emphasised the acquisition of vocational qualifications in the workplace and has prioritised funding toward those with low or no previous qualifications. There is also clear evidence that higher level qualifications provide substantial benefits but that those with low or no qualification face barriers to learning; so the skills strategy has also aimed to get people up to at least level 2, from where they will both be incentivised to continue in learning because of the substantial average earnings gain to be had, and because the personal barriers to further learning are likely to be lessened.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.2/3">The latest evidence on the economic benefits for level 2 vocational qualifications was published in autumn last year<sup>(1)</sup>. It changes this picture in that level 2 vocational qualifications give higher average earnings gain than previous studies have shown, and for a wider group of people. In many cases the gains seem to be better than the equivalent academic or general qualifications. Earnings improvements for young people up to the age of 25 who gained such qualifications experienced on average at least a 12 per cent. improvement in earnings, and for some qualifications much more. People with such qualifications also experienced substantial improvements in employment chances. The benefits continue to be larger for those with no or low prior qualifications than for those already qualified.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.820W.2/4">That report also provided for the first time detailed evidence on level 2 vocational qualifications gained as adults (over the age of 25). The earnings differential is slightly lower than when acquired by young people, but they are still substantial, on average at least an 11 per cent. improvement in earnings. The exception in that study was the National Vocational Qualification at level 2 (NVQ2), which was associated with a lower improvement in earnings when acquired by adults. There are thought to be two reasons. First, there is a data difficulty, in that there are a relatively large proportion of adults in this country without qualifications. Many will have skills at around level 2, so a simple comparison of those with and without such qualifications does not reveal the true improvement in earnings for an individual who increases their skill level through gaining such a qualification. A further research study that will report later this year is using a different, longitudinal, approach and will identify more clearly the scale of benefit from gaining qualifications. Second, in the early years after NVQs were introduced, they were used extensively in government programmes for the unemployed, and hence they are disproportionately held by adults who have lower employability. As time goes on, and NVQs are used by the workforce more generally, the benefits are expected to become more apparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.2/5">There is much less evidence on level 1 vocational qualifications. Recent evidence does show substantial positive improvements in employment chances for individuals who were low-achievers at school though<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

We have consistently informed the Chinese government of our view that greater autonomy should be granted to the Tibetans.

We seek to encourage the Chinese authorities to enter into a dialogue without preconditions and have noted that the Dalai Lama has stated publicly that he does not seek independence, but greater autonomy for Tibet.

The QAA carries out this function by conducting audits of the management of quality in institutions. One aspect of these audits is to consider how closely institutions follow the QAA's Code of Practice, which includes a section dedicated to the assessment of students. The judgments of the QAA audit teams are made public in published reports. Additionally&mdash;and unique to the UK&mdash;all higher education institutions are expected to appoint external examiners to assist them to monitor the standards of their awards.</p>

The Construction Industry has responded very positively to the Government's Skills Pledge, with over 1,000 employers already committed. For apprenticeships, the aim is to double the number of apprenticeships in the sector to 20,000 by 2012. The National Skills Academy for Construction was launched in 2007 and has a major programme of activities working with employers across England. The number of Inspire scholarships, offering support to individuals studying for a Built Environment degree, has increased this year to 300.

It has also helped employers source other non qualification skills support, such as Investors in People, as well as more general business support from Business Link.</p>
	<p pid="a.844W.9/2">Our plans for the expansion of Train to Gain were set out in November 2007 in Train to Gain: A Plan for Growth. Our ambition is that employers will be able to both identify and then source, against existing funding rules, their skills needs at all levels, including higher education.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.2/1">This Government have instigated and supported a range of policies to encourage a wider range of people to be able and willing to participate in higher education (HE). We have done this because of economic need and to support social justice. Forecasts show that half of the 12 million jobs that should become vacant between 2004 and 2014 will be in occupations most likely to employ graduates. And higher education offers significant benefits to individuals&mdash;over their working life, the average graduate can expect to earn comfortably over &pound;100,000 more than a similar person with just A levels, and graduates experience better health, are less likely to commit crime and are more likely to engage in civil society. It is right that these benefits should be available to all, regardless of their background, but the issues affecting HE participation patterns are varied and need to be addressed across the education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/2">In recent years we have made good progress. There has been a steady increase in the number and proportion of entrants to HE who come from lower social class backgrounds. This is reflected in recent UCAS application data for 2008 entry&mdash;in England, the proportion of applicants coming from lower social class backgrounds is up from 28.2 per cent. in 2007 to 28.9 per cent. this year. The numbers and proportions of entrants to HE from lower social class backgrounds are at their highest ever levels, as are the numbers and proportions of entrants from state schools and low participation neighbourhoods. Similarly, the proportion of young people from lower social class backgrounds is at it highest level.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/3">There is a range of interventions which contribute to this progress&mdash;the Aimhigher Programme, improvement in student financial support both from the Government and from higher education institution bursaries, institutions own outreach activity working directly with schools and the Government's broader efforts to raise attainment across the board and to narrow attainment gaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/4">The Aimhigher Programme has been operating nationally since 2004 although similar, predecessor programmes began in 2001. The programme is designed to increase opportunities for people from under-represented groups to participate in HE. There have been various evaluations of the programme which show that it has had a positive impact on participants' attainment and their attitudes towards HE. In the programme's early years (2001 to 2002 when it was known as Aimhigher: Excellence Challenge (AH: EC)), and before it became a national programme, research showed that being part of AH: EC:</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.2/6" class="indent">(b) involved improvement in nearly all measures of year 11's GCSE results, with an average improvement in total points scored of 2.5, which corresponds to an increase of between two and three grades in one GCSE; and</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/7" class="indent">(c) led to participants being more likely to say that they intended to take part in HE (by 3.9 percentage points).</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/8">Additional research conducted by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) showed that over 70 per cent. of universities responding to its survey said that Aimhigher as a national programme added value to their widening participation policies and activities, that Aimhigher provided a positive and welcome boost to their own efforts to widen participation in HE and that this translated into increased applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/9">Widening participation requires long-term address and we have announced the continuation of Aimhigher to 2011. We will continue to work with HEFCE to commission a national study to report before the end of 2011 on outcomes across the whole programme since 2004, when the unified, national Aimhigher was introduced. And at local level, Aimhigher Partnerships will determine the extent to which the Aimhigher programme has raised HE awareness, aspirations and attainment among participants and within participating institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/10">There is less accumulated evidence about the effectiveness of other interventions given that they were introduced relatively recently. But we do know that the Office for Fair Access, which agrees access agreements with HEIs, showing what they will do to attract students from lower-income backgrounds, reported that in the first operational year of access agreements, 2006-07:</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/11" class="indent">(a) HEIs paid &pound;96 million to low income students in bursaries in 2006-07 (21.4 per cent. of additional income went back to students in support), benefiting well over 70,000 low income students;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/12" class="indent">(b) for those on the lowest incomes (entitled to full state grant) the mean bursary was &pound;870. A typical bursary (median and mode) by institution for the lowest income is &pound;1,000 per year;</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/13" class="indent">(c) &pound;21 million additional income spent on additional outreach in 2006-07; and</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/14" class="indent">(d) by 2008-09 institutions estimate that they will be disbursing over &pound;300 million a year in bursaries and scholarships to students on low incomes (OFFA definition of low income is family incomes up to &pound;47,425 (2006-07 values).</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/15">We continue to support the work of universities and colleges through the Department's own communications activity and make efforts to raise awareness of bursaries alongside all other elements of the higher education student finance package.</p>

	<p pid="a.850W.2/4">It shows that in 2010-11 a total of 2.5 million adult learner places will be funded through the adult learner and employer responsive models. In line with the national roll-out of level 3 provision delivered through Train to Gain set out in 'Train to Gain: A Plan for Growth (November 2007)', the number of funded adult learners on full level 3 provision significantly increases between 2009-10 and 2010-11 (from 144,000 to 356,000). This increase reflects the higher level skills challenge set out by Lord Leitch. It more than offsets the planned reductions in funded non-accredited and non-priority learning places in 2010-11 resulting in an overall increase in funded adult learner places</p>

	<p pid="a.872W.5/1">There are six centres for the treatment of adults with pulmonary hypertension in England. These are at Newcastle, Sheffield, Papworth, Hammersmith, Royal Free and the Brompton hospitals. Several of these centres run outreach clinics at other hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.872W.5/2">From April 2008, pulmonary hypertension services for adults will be commissioned by specialised commissioning groups on behalf of their constituent primary care trusts.

The hub is Great Ormond Street hospital for Children and the spokes for follow up care are six centres of paediatric cardiology at Leeds General Infirmary, Bristol Children's hospital, Freeman hospital in Newcastle, Birmingham Children's hospital, Yorkhill hospital in Glasgow and the Royal Hospital for Children in Belfast.</p>

The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. 2. Assessing growth through time. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. 3. Data Quality. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 4. Ungrossed Data. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed). <i> Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

The guidance to the MAPPA responsible authorities&mdash;the police, prison and probation services&mdash;assists them in the effective supervision of offenders convicted of the most serious sexual and violent offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.6/1">Young adult offenders are not placed in secure training centres or secure children's homes. The Youth Justice Board began collecting comparative data on assaults by trainees in under-18 young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children's homes in April 2007. The following table provides this data for the period April 2007 to January 2008. For earlier data, collected by the Prison Service following different recording principles, and relating solely to young offender institutions, I refer the hon.
