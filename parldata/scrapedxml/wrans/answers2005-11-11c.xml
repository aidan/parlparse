	<p pid="c.765W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/2">The Information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. Chris Ruane, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question concerning the percentage electoral registration rate in each Local Authority area. (26409)</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics is not able to calculate percentage electoral registration rates: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. However, the Office for National Statistics does on occasion publish comparisons of the resident population of voting age (aged 18 and over) and the number of people who are registered to vote. These comparisons provide the closest available approximations to the information you requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/6" class="indent">The tables, which will be placed in the House of Commons Library, give comparisons between the number of registered electors and the estimated mid-2004 population for local authorities in the UK. Table 1 shows a comparison against parliamentary electorate and Table 2 against local/European electorate. Please note Table 1 refers to Great Britain only as Northern Ireland are unable to provide Parliamentary electorates for local authority areas. In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-01">1 December 2002</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase> electoral data.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/7" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/8" class="indent">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.765W.3/9" class="indent">Any comparison of these data with figures for previous years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>

	<p pid="c.769W.14/2">This proposal reflects widespread agreement following consultation. The European Commission's draft Audit Directive (latest text 2004/0065(COD)) contains a provision requiring the signature of a named individual auditor on each audit report. The Department consulted on this directive in September 2004 and published the results of the consultation in February 2005 (available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/consultations/consultation-1370.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/consultations/consultation-1370.html</a>)</p>
	<p pid="c.769W.14/3">Separately in early 2005, the Audit Quality Forum, which involves UK auditors, their clients and investors, recommended that the lead audit partner should sign his or her own name on each audit report. The March 2005 White Paper &quot;Company Law Reform&quot; contained proposals to this effect, and in July the Department published draft clauses for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.769W.14/4">About a dozen consultees commented specifically on this proposal. Most supported it in principle and made suggestions for improvements to clarify the draft clauses. Some of these suggestions have been incorporated in the Company Law Reform Bill that was introduced to Parliament last week.</p>

	<p pid="c.771W.11/1">I have no information for the City of London that would allow the assessment of the contribution mobile communications has made to its productivity. The mobile network operator, O2 commissioned a study from the Centre for Economic and Business Research in July 2004 to assess how the contribution of mobile phones to the UK economy was likely to change over the next 10 years. A final report on the regional contribution of mobile communications, provided figures broken down by region. For the South East it found that mobile communications contributes 3.23 per cent. of GDP, which is &pound;1,573 per household per year. It also found that mobile communications accounts for 1.15 per cent. of all jobs in the South East.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.11/2">We have no plans to undertake a further assessment specific to the City of London.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.11/3">The mobile phone sector contributes to both the UK GDP and Government finances. According to research by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR), mobile contributed &pound;22.9 billion to UK GDP in 2003, 2.3 per cent. of total GDP. Mobile network operator, O2 commissioned a study from CEBR in July 2004 that assessed how the contribution of mobile phones to the UK economy was likely to change over the next 10 years. The report shows how the mobile phone sector now contributes as much to GDP as the total oil and gas extraction industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.11/4">The research shows that the mobile sector is making a major contribution to national productivity both through sustaining a high level of productivity in the sector itself and through enabling higher productivity in the rest of the economy but no specific figures are available specifically for the City of London, although the City probably has the highest concentration of mobile telecommunications use in the country.</p>

HMRC have found that the previous controls for dealing with such claims are not sufficiently robust and are being abused. HMRC have therefore decided that they must tighten their procedures and have recently reminded businesses that claims must be supported by all the required documentation, and about what details a valid VAT invoice must contain. These rules apply equally to all businesses and are no different to the rules that apply domestically for businesses seeking to recover VAT incurred on their purchases.</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.3/1">The deficits and surpluses of funded statutory public service pension schemes such as the local government pension scheme, and those of funded pension schemes in the wider public sector, are not calculated centrally.

	<p pid="c.785W.2/2">Crowding on all London passenger services, including between Hastings-London Victoria and Brighton-London Victoria are measured against Passengers in Excess of Capacity Rules (PIXC) rules. This is against the number of seats on longer-distance services and against total capacity (seats plus, standing) for services where the first stop that passengers alight (or last stop where passengers board) is not more than 20 minutes from the terminal station. This allows for the scheduled stops within the 20 minute threshold at Clapham Junction and East Croydon in both directions.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.2/3">The latest available count data (2004) show that all morning and evening peak Brighton to Victoria and Hastings to Victoria services are within their official passenger capacities, except for the 1632 Victoria to Brighton service. The Train Operating Company has allocated less carriages to the 1632 Victoria to Brighton train in order to provide longer trains to meet the greater passenger demand in the high peak period after 1700. However, an alternative service between Victoria and Brighton is scheduled shortly after this service at 1636, and this does provide spare capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.785W.2/4">Ultimately the responsibility for the day-to-day safety and welfare of passengers using the railway rests with the Train Operating Companies. Focus is being given to improve timetabling, infrastructure maintenance and renewals and other factors that can impact on reliable delivery of train services, which will in turn impact on crowding levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.786W.5/1">The use of stone mastic asphalt materials (SMA) for road resurfacing was assessed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s. As a result of concern regarding the loss of surface texture required for high-speed skid resistance, its use was prohibited as a surfacing on trunk roads including motorways in England. Proprietary materials based on SMA, known as 'thin surfacings', have been developed to address the surface texture concern and these are now widely used on the trunk road and motorway network. The Department, on behalf of the UK Roads Board has commissioned best practice guidance for local authorities on how and where thin surfacings and SMA can be applied. The results of this research will be available early next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.796W.8/3">The in work credit is designed to help lone parents cope with the financial aspects of moving from welfare to work, and ensure they are better off in work. It is being piloted in 23 Jobcentre Plus districts and has been rolled out in four phases from April 2004 to October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.8/4">The areas covered are: Bradford; North London; South East London; Cardiff; Central London; Dudley and Sandwell; Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders; Lancashire West; Leeds; Leicestershire; Staffordshire; West London; Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon; City and East; Lambeth; Southwark and Wandsworth; South London; Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire; Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire; Essex; Hampshire; Kent; and Surrey and Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.8/5">The work search premium helps remove the disincentive for lone parents in the costs of looking for work. It is being piloted in eight Jobcentre Plus districts: Bradford, Cardiff and Vale, Dudley and Sandwell, Edinburgh, Lancashire West, Leicestershire, South East London, and West London.</p>
	<p pid="c.796W.8/6">An interim evaluation of the pilots is being conducted and we expect to publish a report in autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.797W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about what additional facilities are proposed to assist those currently using the Jobcentre in Burslem. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.797W.2/4" class="indent">As you will be aware, Burslem Jobcentre is scheduled to close in March 2007. Those customers currently claiming jobseeker's allowance through Burslem Jobcentre will have access to services provided by the new, purpose-built premises, planned for Hanley, only three miles away from the current Burslem Jobcentre location. Burslem customers claiming Incapacity Benefit and Income Support already use the Hanley site for all their dealings with Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.797W.2/5" class="indent">A feasibility study of alternative local locations options has been undertaken and negotiations are currently under way with the local authority over the introduction of telephone facilities in Burslem library to allow our customers to access our services direct, free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.797W.2/6" class="indent">Consideration is also being given to the possibility of routing the Staffordshire JobsBus through Burslem. The JobsBus is a mobile unit offering customers access to vacancy information, telephone and fax facilities and also an employment information computer package. Specialist advisers often join the regular JobsBus staff to offer specific advice, for example to lone parents, people returning to work after ill health or people who have health problems that affect the work that they can do. I have asked Julie Carruthers, the District Manager for Jobcentre Plus in Staffordshire, to contact you when a decision on this is reached.</p>

	<p pid="c.798W.5/1">Since the original announcement of 11 Building on New Deal (BoND) pilot districts in November 2004, we have undertaken a detailed planning and impact analysis to ensure that the measures detailed in the BoND strategy paper can be tested as originally envisaged, and that the design is affordable. Given this and our proposals to reduce the number of Jobcentre Plus districts, we have decided that seven areas are sufficient to test the effectiveness of BoND. This allows for the robust evaluation needed to inform decisions on national implementation.</p>
	<p pid="c.798W.5/2">The seven chosen areas allow us to test BoND in different types of labour markets across the country, including urban and rural locations, and areas with a greater concentration of people from black and minority ethnic communities. Seven comparator areas have been chosen using the same criteria, enabling a clear comparison of performance between BoND and comparator areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.798W.5/3">The Jobcentre Plus districts identified to pilot BoND from October 2006 are: Ayrshire, Dumfries, Galloway and Inverclyde; Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire; Cardiff and Vale; Cheshire and Warrington; Cornwall; Northamptonshire; and North East London.</p>
	<p pid="c.798W.5/4">The BoND comparator areas are: Highlands, Islands and Clyde Coast; Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire; Staffordshire; Kent; Cumbria ; Hampshire and Isle of Wight; and South East London.</p>

	<p pid="c.805W.2/2">The Department allocates funds for further education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector, including adult participation, to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. The LSC was established in 2001 bringing the planning and funding of post-16 education together under one body within a framework set by Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/3">In 2003&ndash;04 the LSC spent &pound;1,756 million on adult participation nationally. In 2004&ndash;05 this increased to &pound;1,847 million&mdash;an increase of 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/4">My Department does not hold figures at local or regional levels. Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive has responded to you with further details about the specific issues you have raised. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/5" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. John Grogan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/6" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills referred to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) by Bill Rammell regarding the percentage change in 16 to 18 years and adult participation budgets for education in local Learning and Skills Councils and Regions between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/7" class="indent">The LSC allocates funds for further education through the 47 local Learning and Skills Councils. The funds are allocated on an academic year basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/8" class="indent">The attached spreadsheets show the distribution of the FE funding in ascending order by local Council and at regional level showing the cash and percentage variance between 2003/04 and 2004/05.</p>

Our work to raise educational achievement and improve placement stability will contribute towards continued reductions in offending and improvements in other outcomes for looked after children. Funded by the Government, MACRO have recently published a good practice guide on reducing offending by looked-after children, which reinforces the message that looked-after children must be provided with constructive supervision and guidance to reduce the risk of offending, and that those who have offended must be offered appropriate services to minimise the likelihood of re-offending. This publication has been distributed to all Directors of Children's Services and all YOT managers. We intend to consult early in 2006 on further wide ranging proposals for transforming outcomes for looked-after children.</p>

A small number of schools and local authorities have made inquiries, but we do not keep records of this.</p>

Strands such as Gifted and Talented, Learning Mentors, Learning Support Units, City Learning Centres, Aimhigher and Study Support have, among other things, pioneered personalised learning programmes; tackled barriers to learning; extended study opportunities for pupils, providing access to state of the art ICT; enabled ICT led innovation in the delivery of the curriculum; fostered new approaches to teaching and learning; kept at risk pupils in school and engaged in the curriculum; and enhanced continuing professional development for teachers.</p>

	<p pid="c.813W.2/1">The Department and the other United Kingdom health Departments have commissioned Cancer Research UK to run SunSmart, which was launched in 2003, as the national skin cancer prevention and sun protection campaign. The SunSmart campaign includes raising both public and professional awareness of skin cancer through providing information about it and guidance on preventative measures to reduce the risks associated with skin cancer and exposure to sunlight. The campaign raises awareness through support for health promotion events, the provision of printed resources, media briefings and through the SunSmart website at <a href="http://cancerresearchuk.org/sunsmart/">http://cancerresearch uk.org/sunsmart/</a>. SunSmart also supports schools in developing their own sun protection policies through school guidelines and curriculum resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.813W.2/2">SunSmart's printed resources and the website contain prevention messages on avoiding excess sunlight and ultraviolet rays and using protective screening methods including covering up in the sunlight and the use of effective sunscreen products. The campaign also provides information to help recognise the symptoms of the different types of skin cancer and on seeking medical advice if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.813W.2/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently issued updated referral guidelines for suspected cancer to assist general practitioners in determining those patients who need to be referred urgently to see a specialist within two weeks. The guidance addresses skin cancers.</p>
	<p pid="c.813W.2/4">The Department and the Welsh Assembly have also commissioned NICE to produce service guidance for skin tumours including melanoma. This guidance is due for publication in January 2006 and will address area such as diagnosis, treatment and follow up.</p>

Used in conjunction with trained support through the NHS stop smoking service, smokers are up to four times more likely to quit successfully than using willpower alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.815W.2/4">I am aware that Allen Carr's Easyway (International) Ltd is in contact with NICE to make their case and I am sure that, in deciding what should be available on the NHS, this is the appropriate route.</p>

	<p pid="c.816W.2/1">The Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS) risk measurement methodology is applied to accurately measure losses to fraud in areas of national health service spending in order to identify the scale of the problem and take firm action to prevent this from occurring. CFSMS is currently working on measuring losses in major areas of the NHS budget and has for example been actively involved in seeking to fraud-proof the new general practitioner contract. Continued measurements of losses to fraud will take place as weaknesses are identified and substantive budgets affected. This is and must be an ongoing process as spending areas and budget allocations will continue to change. As such, there can be no accurate overall estimate of the outstanding amount of fraud in the NHS, only a continuous effort to identify weaknesses as budgets and policies change and evolve.</p>

	<p pid="c.818W.8/19">2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>

	<p pid="c.820W.8/1">An expert committee was appointed in October 1998 to review the Mental Health Act 1983. This was chaired by Professor Genevra Richardson and the committee is generally referred to as the Richardson Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.8/2">The Richardson Committee produced its Report in July 1999, which was published along with the November 1999 Green Paper, &quot;Reform of the Mental Health Act 1983&quot;, which sought views on the various recommendations of the Richardson Committee. The Green Paper was followed by the White Paper, &quot;Reforming the Mental Health Act 1983&quot; and a draft Bill for consultation in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.8/3">The responses from this consultation and further work resulted in a revised draft Mental Health Bill, which was published in September 2004. This was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny, which resulted in a report in March 2005, a response to which was published in July 2005. The recommendations from the Richardson Committee have, therefore, been subject to considerable discussion and development over the course of the last five years and it is not possible to assess each of the recommendations in terms of whether they have been adopted or rejected.</p>
	<p pid="c.820W.8/4">The Richardson Report lists all members. This is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/06/26/14/04062614.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/06/26/14/04062614.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="c.824W.2/49">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.824W.2/50">1. Registration data include personal dental service counts of patients seen in the past 15 months as a proxy for registrations for some schemes. This is to give greater consistency with registrations data for the GDS, which has a 15 month re-registration period. Many PDS schemes use longer periods and some, such as dental access centres, do not require patients to register.</p>
	<p pid="c.824W.2/51">2. Registration rates (the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient's address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. The figures were calculated using population estimates for the primary care trust areas for the nearest year for which data is available.</p>

	<p pid="c.829W.6/1">The Department has not had any direct contact with Havering council to discuss contingency plans for an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or tuberculosis (TB).</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/2">The Department's emergency preparedness division has regular liaisons and discussions with the strategic health authorities' (SHAs) emergency planning leads. The SHAs have responsibility for ensuring that all national health service trusts have major incident plans in place and are prepared to deal with a range of incidents that include SARS and other infectious diseases. These plans are developed with multi-agency input and are regularly tested and reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/3">With regard to TB, the Chief Medical Officer launched the TB action plan in October 2004. The plan is a commitment to tackle rising rates of TB through 10 key areas of work, and identifies some of the underlying reasons for the rise in TB rates. This is a national plan for England and local TB services are expected to develop their own plans reflecting local conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/4">Local TB outbreaks are managed in accordance with standard procedures by local health protection units, which are part of the Health Protection Agency. In the event of a TB outbreak, the local consultant in communicable disease control would trace contacts of people who had significant exposure to someone with TB. Those contacts would be screened for disease and treated as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/5">The plan is available on the Department's website at</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en">www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAnd GuidanceArticle/fs/en</a>?CONTENT_ID=4090417&amp;chk= DsgbSP</p>
	<p pid="c.829W.6/7">SARS is not currently regarded as being a world-wide problem. The last cases were in China in 2004. However, the possibility of SARS re-emerging remains and there is a need for continuing vigilance. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals have been asked to remain vigilant to the possibility of SARS, even though the threat to the United Kingdom remains low at this time.</p>

The guidance was developed in consultation with the Department and leading experts. Cancer Research UK is in discussions with the sun bed industry to review industry practices and self-regulation.

	<p pid="c.831W.3/2">Kent and Medway strategic health authority (SHA) was aware toward the end of financial year 2004&ndash;05 that Swale primary care trust (PCT) had underlying financial problems. The PCT reported an audited year-end position of &pound;0.45 million overspent.</p>

	<p pid="c.831W.3/5">This is a local matter. Responsibility for decisions about funding and the provision of local health services now rest with PCTs. It is for PCTs, in conjunction with SHAs to plan and develop services according to the needs of local people.</p>

A simple one-page leaflet on biosecurity and surveillance for smaller concerns and back yard keepers has also been produced and is being distributed widely including to all veterinary practices and placed in trade and specialist press targeting the same audience.

	<p pid="c.832W.6/7">At present low risk gatherings can be licensed. This means the gathering can only consist of budgerigars, canaries, zebra finches, Bengalese finches and birds classed by fanciers as &quot;British&quot; birds (i.e. captive bred birds of species native to the British Isles, not including pigeons, poultry and waterfowl). The show organiser must agree to meet a number of conditions such as record keeping and biosecurity measures before a licence is granted. Sales from licensed gatherings are not permitted.</p>
	<p pid="c.832W.6/8">Gatherings of other birds including poultry, waterfowl, pigeons and exotic species are considered to be higher risk. Conditions under which shows of higher risk birds might be permitted to take place are still under consideration. Such gatherings will not be licensed until we are confident that they can take place without undue risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.832W.6/9"><i>(f)</i> Information about how to apply for a licence is available from local Animal Health Divisional Offices and comprehensive guidance has been available on the Defra website since the beginning of November.</p>

This corresponds to an additional fuel requirement of about 3 per cent. on average fuel consumption for a new car sold today. Carbon dioxide emissions are almost directly proportional to fuel consumption implying that the average vehicle would see a carbon dioxide penalty of about 5g/km over its lifetime.</p>

	<p pid="c.834W.2/2">There are no plans to ban the use of animals in circuses in the absence of evidence that it is not possible to meet their welfare needs in a circus environment. However, the introduction of a welfare offence under the Animal Welfare Bill will require the person responsible for an animal to take reasonable steps to ensure its welfare. In addition we propose to overhaul the existing legislation in relation to performing animals. We consider that our proposed changes will lead to significant improvements in the welfare of animals used in circuses.</p>

Council tax data collected before this year are considered unreliable. So from 2001 back to 1997, the combined data from the following two sources are used: local authorities' housing strategy statistical appendix (HSSA) returns for empty council and private sector dwellings; and housing corporation's regulatory statistical return (RSR) for empty registered social landlords (RSLs) properties. Since RSLs did not collect LTV data until 2005, only total vacant dwelling figures are available from this combined source. Therefore separate answers for <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> are not possible for 1997 to 2001.</p>

Measures include assisting around 100,000 first time buyers and key workers nationally to achieve their home ownership aspirations and, through investment and efficiency savings, to deliver 75,000 social rented homes by 2008. Future delivery of social housing after 2007&ndash;08 will be dependent on the outcome of the Spending Review 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.6/2">The 2003&ndash;05 Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Housing Strategy identified the provision of affordable housing in high demand areas as one of its priorities. Through the Regional Housing Board's 2004&ndash;06 investment programme over &pound;57 million is being invested in affordable housing in West Yorkshire and &pound;6.7 million in Kirklees. Of this, around &pound;3.9 million has been invested in affordable housing schemes in Huddersfield and 104 affordable homes are being provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.6/3">The provision of affordable housing in high demand areas remains a priority in the 2005 Regional Housing Strategy. The Housing Corporation are currently working with sub-regional partnerships and local authorities to put together an affordable housing programme for 2006&ndash;08, which will lead to between &pound;41 million and &pound;45 million being invested in new affordable homes in West Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="c.838W.6/4">The Regional Housing Strategy also sets out other options for local authorities and their partners to consider in order to provide affordable homes, such as alternative sources of funding and capacity through the planning system. We have approved a PFI (Private Finance Initiative) scheme in Kirklees which is intended to provide 550 affordable housing units up to 2010. There will be 400 units for small households and 150 units for people requiring extra care housing. Kirklees council are also delivering around 100 affordable units a year through the planning system and section 106 agreements.</p>

	<p pid="c.841W.2/1">All councils are and will continue to be subject to inspection. Key targets for reductions in the inspection of local authorities were set out in the November 2002 announcement on Freedoms and Flexibilities. These include an exemption from virtually all inspection for councils in the excellent CPA category and a 25 per cent. reduction for councils in the good category.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/2">Overall, significant reductions have been secured in the inspection burden placed on English single tier and county councils, with the greatest reductions focussed on excellent and good councils.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/3">Between 2001&ndash;02 and 2004&ndash;05 the number of days inspectors from the Audit Commission, Ofsted, Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) and Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) spent in councils had reduced by over one third and the number of inspections undertaken had reduced by more than 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/4">The Audit Commission, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) sponsors, anticipates that by 2006&ndash;07, the volume of inspections needed for CPA, including the corporate assessments planned for that year, should fall by 68 per cent. from the 2002&ndash;03 level. Excellent councils will only be subject to inspection where there are grounds for serious concern in a particular service, and good councils will continue to receive a significant reduction in inspection.</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/5">In accordance with ODPM Circular 02/2004, authorities categorised in CPA as excellent and good only need to provide the minimum essential information for Government to monitor performance, namely:</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/6" class="indent">outturn data for Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs);</p>
	<p pid="c.841W.2/7" class="indent">targets for BVPIs in the current year and subsequent 2 years; and</p>

However, they have advised us that they intend to provide the families of the deceased soldiers with as much information as possible.

	<p pid="c.855W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/2">Commanders in the field have full authority to take action to protect life. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase>, a day of fast moving events, the Ministry of Defence was consulted throughout. The acting commander of British forces in MND (SE) was able to take the difficult decision to mount the operation to enter the police station in the knowledge that he had the full support of the chain of command. The two British soldiers arrested in Basra on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase> by the Iraqi Police Service are both UK nationals and were not carrying the passports of any other nation.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/3">The car that the two British soldiers were travelling in was not seized. Although some of the personal equipment worn or carried by the British soldiers was removed by the Iraqi Police Service, most was recovered. All the equipment subsequently found in the police station was retrieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/4">Due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable information it is not our policy to comment on civilian casualties. In this case, although we are aware of media reports, we have not been provided with any evidence relating to the deaths of Iraqis.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/5">The Ministry of Defence has well-established procedures for handling claims for compensation in Multi-National Division (South East) and indeed any other theatre in which we operate. If there are any legitimate claims for negligence that arise out of the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase>, they will be considered in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/6">I am aware of serious allegations of prisoner abuse at the Jameat including two alleged deaths in custody. UK support to the Iraqi Police Service in Basra and elsewhere is designed among other things to enhance police governance, accountability and respect for human rights. We take this very seriously. We have been pressing the Iraqi authorities very hard in both Basra and Baghdad to investigate these allegations thoroughly and then to take appropriate action and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/7">The Iraqi Government have said that the two soldiers were arrested because the Iraqi Police Service initially believed them to be terrorists and they were not able to immediately confirm their status as British soldiers. Having confirmed their identity we were extremely concerned when they were not released in accordance with Iraqi law. We have subsequently agreed with the Iraqi Government that in future any such incident will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant articles of Iraqi law, which affirm that the UK retains sole jurisdiction over its armed forces personnel.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/8">We never received a formal request from either Basra's principal council or the Iraqi Government to hand the individuals over to the Iraqi authorities. Furthermore an Iraqi judicial inquiry concluded that under Iraqi law there were no grounds for such action, given the immunity of Multinational forces personnel from the Iraqi legal process.</p>
	<p pid="c.855W.0/9">British forces were fully within their rights to act in the way they did and I fully support their actions.</p>

	<p pid="c.856W.5/1">The 6th Regiment, Royal Military Police (6 RMP) Historic Inquiry Team (HIT) have been established as the HQNI focal point for providing information to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) review of all 'troubles' related deaths. They are not undertaking any investigative responsibilities in relation to this review.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.5/2">The RMP maintain close liaison with all Home Office police forces and routinely assist both in civil police investigations and requests for information involving service personnel. The current PSNI review is no different from any other Home Office police investigation and requests for information are being met with full and open disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.5/3">The PSNI are expected to review some 2,000 cases, though each case-file may contain more than one incident of death. The RMP have approximately 930 military police case files, which contain information relevant to these deaths. In addition, 6 RMP maintain the Northern Ireland Operational Archive, which stores material such as patrol reports, log sheets and patrol data. The RMP HIT remit is to trawl this material in response to requests for information from the PSNI. The number of cases involving military personnel has not yet been quantified.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.5/4">The 6 RMP HIT was formed by means of a routine internal reorganisation of existing manpower in order to meet changing priorities within an existing area of military police support. The Commanding Officer of 6 RMP made the decision to form the 6 RMP HIT so that the support to the PSNI inquiries could be delivered in the most effective way possible, and this decision was endorsed by the Chief of Staff, Headquarters Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.856W.5/5">As the 6 RMP HIT has been created through an internal reorganisation of existing regimental resources, no additional cost has been incurred and an increase to the extant 6 RMP budget is not considered necessary at this stage.</p>
