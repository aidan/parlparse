	<p pid="a.593W.7/1">The Education Service produces a range of materials about Parliament, the work of Members (of both Houses), and political literacy generally. All resources are provided free to schools. While many of the materials are suitable for use by individual pupils, they will primarily be used in the classroom. One publication targeted at pupils directly is the young person's guide entitled 'The Houses of Parliament', which is distributed to all school-aged visitors taking a tour of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.593W.7/2">Resources currently in print include a new range of booklets carefully targeted at pupils from key stage 2 to key stage 4 (covering ages seven to 16) that are available for schools and Members to order. These can be used independently or as part of class study. Due for publication shortly is the last in this new series which will be a booklet for KS5 (16 to 18). There is also a set of four films on DVD, including the award winning 'Democracy? You Decide and You've Got the Power'. This will be updated shortly to reflect the 2010 general election result and is available with a teacher's booklet for three age groups. It is also available on Parliament's YouTube channel:</p>

This provides a variety of resources which can be used online and also downloaded, including all the printed publications together with information pages, lesson plans, films, games and activities. Users can also subscribe to a monthly electronic newsletter. The Education Service will provide materials on request to Members to support their work with schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.593W.7/7">Plans for the next 12 months include further interactive online resources including games and updating of existing material to reflect the result of the 2010 election.

	<p pid="a.596W.0/1">The information requested on the Doncaster Central constituency and local authority area is not available. In the Yorkshire and Humber area the latest official statistics, covering the period from October 2009 to January 2010, show that 700 people were recorded as starting a job funded by the future jobs fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.0/2">The Young Person's Guarantee will be replaced next year by a new Work Programme. This will offer better targeted and integrated employment support to people who find themselves out of work, including young people. Unlike the Young Person's Guarantee, where young people are eligible only if they are claiming jobseeker's allowance, the new Work Programme will provide help to young people regardless of the benefit that they are claiming.</p>

In April 2005 responsibility for cleaning up the legacy sites was passed to the newly created Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). These were previously owned variously by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). These sites have always been in the public sector and the clean-up costs are recognised as public sector liabilities. BNFL's operational facilities, including the Magnox power stations, were run on a commercial basis under contracts negotiated with their customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.11/17">The NDA mission is fully funded by the public sector, through a mixture of direct grant and commercial income. The latter will decline over time as the remaining operational nuclear plants close and enter decommissioning. The European Commission approved the funding of NDA under the state aid rules and in the same Decision, concluded that there was no aid or subsidy to either BNFL or UKAEA.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.5/2">Mr Critchley is serving a life sentence for murder. He is currently detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983. His release is a matter for the Parole Board but the board will not consider his case as long as he remains lawfully detained in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.5/3">The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is the independent non-departmental public body responsible for reviewing alleged miscarriages of justice. It is open to Mr Critchley to make an application to the CCRC. If the CCRC were to consider that there was a real possibility that his conviction would not be upheld they could refer his case to the Court of Appeal. Only the Court of Appeal can quash his conviction.</p>

I made clear that without the release and participation of all political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's elections will not be free and fair. Our ambassador in Rangoon also raises issues of concern directly with the Burmese regime including calls for the release of all political prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and other members of the G8 discussed Burma at the summit in Canada and issued a statement urging the Burmese regime to allow for free and fair elections, to release without delay all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and to engage the democratic opposition and representatives of ethnic groups in a substantive dialogue on the way forward to national reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.0/3">We will continue to raise our concern at the highest possible level with Burma's neighbours, in the EU, the UN and directly with the regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.9/1">The security standards that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) applies to the storage and transportation of the various categories of Special Nuclear Material (SNM) are consistent with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines such as 'The Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and Nuclear Facilities'. These security standards are designed to protect Defence Nuclear Material against unauthorised access and malicious acts. I am withholding specific details as their publication would be likely to prejudice national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.9/2">On the safety standards applied to storage and transportation, the relevant policy is contained within Joint Service Publication (JSP) 518 'Regulation of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Programme' and JSP 538 'Regulation of the Nuclear Weapon Programme'. For the storage of SNM, the standards applied are the same as those applied to civil nuclear installations under nuclear site licensing. For the transport of SNM, the JSPs cite the IAEA publication 'Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material', which forms the technical basis of legislation covering the transport of radioactive materials in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.9/3">Where exemptions or derogations from the legislation apply, it is MOD policy to introduce standards and management arrangements that are, so far as reasonably practicable, at least as good as those required by the legislation.</p>

We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount councils, including those in the East Midlands lose. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for those local authorities to decide. We have ensured that councils, including those in the East Midlands, are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the &#163;29 billion they receive through Formula Grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

	<p pid="a.631W.2/1">Tackling the UK's record deficit is the Government's top priority and we believe that it is right that local authorities make a contribution to the efficiency savings of &#163;6.2 billion in 2010-11. We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount councils, including those in the North East, will lose. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for those local authorities to decide. We have ensured that councils, including those in the North East, are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the &#163;29 billion they receive through Formula Grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

	<p pid="a.635W.5/1">The Department's policy is clear-all patients should be treated without unnecessary delay according to their clinical need, it is for doctors to determine a patient's clinical priority, and patients should not experience undue delay at any stage of their treatment pathway. It is important, therefore, that services match their capacity with demand so that no patient waits unnecessarily to be seen whether for their first appointments or for follow up appointments.</p>

This process will be aided by driving up quality standards through a tariff for dementia patients, better regulation of providers, improving commissioning processes to deliver greater efficiencies and through national health service and public health interventions having a greater focus on outcomes for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.0/2">Additionally, revisions to the NHS Operating Frameworks for 2010-11 identified dementia as an area for local prioritisation. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide locally how best to deliver the national requirements and local priorities set out in the NHS Operating Framework including the National Dementia Strategy. Local PCTs are asked to publish their plans for implementing the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.0/3">In order to gauge progress overall in implementing the National Dementia Strategy, the Department is undertaking a national audit of dementia services. We will use the data from this, alongside information from locality action plans prepared by local authorities and PCTs in March 2010, in order to focus on where action is required to accelerate implementation of the Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.0/4">In addition, the Department is updating the current implementation plan for the National Dementia Strategy to ensure that it is focussed on those areas that will have the most impact on the lives of people with dementia and their carers. These include; promoting early diagnosis and referral with general practitioners, care of people in hospital and care homes with dementia and reduction of the prescribing of anti-psychotic medication to people with dementia.</p>
