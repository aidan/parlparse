There is specific provision for meeting costs necessarily incurred in running the office of the Leader of the Opposition. Each Opposition party has to provide a certificate from an independent auditor each year to the effect that all the expenses claimed were in respect of the party's parliamentary business.

	<p pid="c.438W.0/1">Figures for the effect on energy consumption within the UK by energy-saving measures for this particular period are not readily available. However, for the climate change programme review, we prepared estimates of the effects on carbon emissions for the household sector in the 1990s and separately for the present decade.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.0/2">The Government estimate that energy efficiency improvements in the household sector in the 1990s would have contributed around 4.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) of emissions reductions, that is, some 12 per cent. of 1990 emissions. At the same time, growth in demand for underlying energy services&mdash;warmer homes, hot water&mdash;would have increased emissions by 11.5 MtC; the increase in the use of gas for generating electricity instead of coal in the 1990s, which reduced emissions from power stations, and so reduced the associated emissions from electricity use in homes, businesses, etc, would have decreased emissions by 8 MtC; and smaller factors, mainly fuel switching by householders and changes to external temperatures, would have contributed a further 1 MtC of reductions. The overall effect on emissions was a net reduction of around 2.5 MtC.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.0/3">In the present decade, before the effects of policies are included, we estimate that background energy efficiency would save a further 4.5 MtC. Increasing demand for energy services, together with the effects of the other factors described earlier, means that the net overall reduction in this period would be approximately 0.3 MtC.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.0/4">The estimated effect of all the energy efficiency policies for households set out in the new UK climate change programme 2006, is an additional reduction of 4.8 MtC by 2010. Most of these savings are expected to be delivered between 2005 and 2010, through tighter building regulations and further activity under the energy efficiency commitment.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.0/5">Data are not available to conduct similar analyses for the industry and service sectors, but the contribution of energy efficiency is expected to be similar in percentage terms.</p>

	<p pid="c.439W.2/1">The fisheries grant in aid was increased by &pound;3 million a year from 2002, and since 1997 the Government have given around &pound;60 million to the Environment Agency to support its fisheries activities. At present, every Government Department is under instructions to make efficiency savings. This generally involves a fundamental review of the work to be done, and a reprioritisation of our responsibilities and how we manage them. Consequently, the Environment Agency GIA was reduced this year by &pound;400,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.2/2">Of the &pound;5.8 million in GIA, &pound;600,000 is spent on compliance checking and enforcement of fish movements. A reduction in GIA therefore necessitated a reduction in funding for work in this area by &pound;150,000. If sales of rod licences are above target this year the agency may be able to make good part or all of this cut.</p>

	<p pid="c.439W.5/1">The fisheries grant in aid was increased by &pound;3 million a year from 2002, and since 1997 the Government have given around &pound;60 million to the Environment Agency to support its fisheries activities. At present every Government Department is under instructions to make efficiency savings. This generally involves a fundamental review of the work to be done, and a reprioritisation of our responsibilities and how we manage them. As a result the Environment Agency has had its fisheries grant in aid (GIA) reduced this year by &pound;400,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.439W.5/2">Consequently, since the majority of the &pound;5.8 million GIA is spent on salmonid work, a reduction in GIA necessitated a reduction in work in this area and the agency reduced its salmonid improvement project by half, to &pound;250,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.440W.3/2">At the 2004 price review, Ofwat set a real terms post-tax return of 5.1 per cent.

However, a study conducted before the directive was implemented, based on 2001-02 figures, estimated that, had the right existed during this period, approximately &pound;1.8 million would have been paid to artists for sales of their works. A later study based on the period of March 2003 to February 2004 indicated that the total would be approximately &pound;1.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.450W.3/1">There are three types of internally displaced people (IDPs) in eastern Burma. These are (with the latest available numbers, from October 2005): (i) people in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities (340,000); (ii) villagers who have been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into designated relocation sites (108,000); and (iii) civilians hiding from the Burmese Army in areas most affected by armed conflict (92,000).</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/2">The recent military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of civilians hiding in conflict areas by at least 15,000. DFID's approach to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to work through local community groups inside Burma. This is a complementary approach to the use of relief teams operating cross-border from Thailand, and it enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through a mechanism which is much less-well supported by other donors. The development of civil society within the country is also a fundamental step in a successful transition to democracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/3">The number of IDPs that we can reach from inside the country is limited. Access is difficult, and the small local groups with whom we are working do not currently have the capacity to deliver greater volumes of emergency relief&mdash;although we are working to strengthen their ability to do more. Those delivering assistance to IDPs cross-border from Thailand face similar challenges. Therefore, we recognise the importance of maintaining co-ordination with all donors (both those delivering assistance cross border, and those working inside the country) to ensure that together we manage to reach as many IDPs as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/4">DFID also provides support to IDPs in temporary settlements in ceasefire areas in eastern Burma through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to which we provide &pound;500,000 a year, of which approximately 75 per cent. is attributable to work with displaced people in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/5">In addition, our health, education and rural livelihood projects provide assistance in eastern Burma, and support internally displaced people in temporary settlements and designated relocation sites there, as well as other vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/6">DFID is also providing support to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working among displaced Burmese people in the refugee camps on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border&mdash;as a grant to the Thai Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) of &pound;1.8 million over three years. In addition, the UK contributes approximately the same amount again as its share of the EC's support to the TBBC. The British Embassy in Bangkok advocates on behalf of Burmese refugees living in Thailand through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to improve the situation in the refugee camps in Thailand and to bring about a relaxation of the regulations prohibiting freedom of movement and employment outside the camps.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/7">In parallel, the Government fully support international efforts, particularly through the UN, to bring about tangible progress in restoring democratic freedoms and full respect for human rights. The UK has co-sponsored successive highly critical UN resolutions on Burma and played a leading role in drafting the resolution most recently adopted at the UN General Assembly in December 2005. This expressed grave concern at the attacks by military forces in violation of cease-fire agreements and called on the regime to end the systematic violations of human rights, including enforced displacement.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/8">UN Security Council members last discussed the situation in Burma on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-16">16 December</phrase> under 'Any Other Business'. In this discussion, the UK highlighted the on-going human rights abuses, the detention of political prisoners, internal conflicts and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Though there was no consensus to issue a presidential statement or other formal report, the discussions reflected the concern felt in many parts of the international community over the regime's failure to make progress towards democracy and to respect international human rights norms. At present there is no agreement within the Security Council, including among the permanent members, to add Burma to the Council's formal agenda, but the UK, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, will continue to co-ordinate closely with the UN and partners in the Security Council and the region in considering how best to maintain pressure for positive change in Burma.</p>

	<p pid="c.452W.2/1">The UK is committed to the development of health services that respond to the broad health needs of the population, and palliative care clearly has a vital place in this. DFID support is largely directed at countries where the health spend is less than $10 per person per year and often far less. The public spend in the Congo is $2, in Ethiopia $1.50 and in Burundi $0.70. Clearly these countries are not able to deliver the range of services that they would wish and realistically are unlikely to invest significant public budgets in palliative care. We support countries to deliver their health programmes and the priority interventions defined in their national health plan. Increasingly we provide resources through various forms of flexible budget support.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.2/2">DFID officials have met staff from the hospice community on a number of occasions, most recently during a public consultation on a revised DFID health strategy. Many committed groups lobby DFID to make greater efforts on what they see as neglected areas in the international health response. Recent communications have challenged DFID to do more on palliative care, cancer services, neglected tropical diseases, blindness, disability, malnutrition and non-communicable diseases. DFID accepts that palliative care services need to be better reflected in national health plans and budgets and that realistically support needs to be provided through home-based rather than institutional settings.</p>

	<p pid="c.452W.5/1">The Iraqi health care system faces enormous challenges which long pre-date the 2003 conflict. In the early 1980s, Iraq enjoyed some of the best health care in the Middle East. However, by 2000, international health indicators for Iraq were comparable with some of the poorest countries in Africa. Under-five mortality had increased from 50 per 1,000 in 1990 to 133 in 2001. One in four children under five were chronically malnourished. Hospitals, clinics and water and sanitation plants suffered from chronic lack of maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/2">DFID has given most of its assistance to the Iraqi health sector through financial contributions to international organisations that have particular expertise in health. These contributions include:</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/3" class="indent">&pound;5 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has helped to fund the delivery of emergency medical supplies, supported clinics and hospitals in Baghdad and Basra, and supports the Iraqi Government's Health Sector Working Group. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.who.int/en">http://www.who.int/en</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/4" class="indent">&pound;32 million to the International Red Cross for immediate humanitarian assistance</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/5" class="indent">&pound;70 million to the United Nations and World Bank multi-donor trust funds for Iraq. These trust funds finance reconstruction in a number of areas including health. The UN trust fund has approved 10 health and nutrition projects, in total valued at $96 million. The World Bank trust fund also has a $25 million health rehabilitation project which finances priority emergency services, including basic medical equipment and essential drugs. More information on both trust funds can be found at <a href="http://www.irffi.org">http://www.irffi.org</a></p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/6">However, many challenges still remain and DFID and the international community will continue to work with the Iraqi authorities to help them to rebuild the health sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.452W.5/7">Important progress has been made: health care spending across Iraq is up more than 30 times on pre-war levels; 5 million children have been vaccinated, and diseases such as polio, measles and malaria have declined; 240 hospitals and 1,200 primary health centres are functioning; and 20 hospitals are being rehabilitated and a paediatric hospital is being built in Basra.</p>

There are a range of factors which may affect the data recorded: (i) definitions of each type of need are necessarily limited in scope and some are more difficult to establish; (ii) many children have a number of needs and it is sometimes difficult to decide which is the major need; (iii) professionals from education and health fields may classify some children differently and there is some evidence that parental background may sometimes affect diagnosis; (iv) the levels of identification of SEN and the levels of School Action, School Action Plus and statementing within SEN are very varied between local authorities&mdash;this is likely to affect some types of need more than others; (v) in some authorities funding policies may effect SEN identification.  <sup>(6)</sup> Number of pupils with emotional, behavioural and social difficulties expressed as a percentage of the total number of pupils at School Action Plus or with a statement of SEN.  <i> Source</i>:  Schools Census</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.455W.2/1">The information requested is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.455W.2/2">The entitlement should be made available free at the point of delivery. It is not acceptable for parents to have to pay a fee or for there to be any conditions attached to the free entitlement. This would restrict the choice of provider for some families and, in some cases, deny children access to the free entitlement. Charges for care beyond the hours of the free entitlement are a private matter between the provider and parent.</p>
	<p pid="c.455W.2/3">From April 2006, funding for the free nursery education entitlement to local authorities has been provided through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). Local authorities have discretion over the rate at which they fund settings for delivery of early years provision.</p>

	<p pid="c.459W.2/2">We have a target for 2,500 schools to be providing a core offer of extended services by September 2006. This includes access to a varied menu of activities, parenting support, childcare 8am to 6pm, swift and easy referral to specialist services and wider community access. Currently, we have over 9,000 schools engaged with their local authority on the extended schools agenda with a representative split of primary and secondary schools. This is encouraging progress against our September target. We do not currently have data on the total number of schools operating extended hours broken down by borough or region. However, we do have data from a baseline survey of maintained schools published in September 2005. This survey showed that 61 per cent. of secondary schools and 40 per cent. of primary schools offer childcare or activities before school. The survey suggested that more schools offered activities after school hours&mdash;a total of 87 per cent. of primary, and 95 per cent. of secondary schools. In future we will be able to draw on data from the school census, which will include information about the extended services that schools are providing.</p>
	<p pid="c.459W.2/3">This Government have published guidance for schools and local authorities on planning and funding extended schools, including charging for extended opportunities, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>. It is intended to help schools plan and fund their extended opportunities in ways that will best support children, young people and their families; reflect local needs and circumstances; and build on existing provision offered by the voluntary and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.459W.2/4">The guidance includes advice on what schools may and may not legally charge for. It describes some typical extended activities and how they might be funded. The guidance emphasises the need for schools to ensure free access to extended activities for the most disadvantaged children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.462W.2/1">The Government are investing over &pound;1.5 billion (including lottery funding) in the five years to 2008 to implement the national school sport strategy. The Departments for Education and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport share a public service agreement target to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality physical education and school sport to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition&mdash;by 2010&mdash;is to offer all children four hours of sport. Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.2/2">Good progress is being made. Currently 80 per cent. of schools in England are within a school sport partnership and all schools will be by September 2006. The 2004/05 school sport survey found that 69 per cent. of pupils in schools within a partnership were spending at least two hours in a typical week on high quality physical education and sport, an 11 per cent. increase on 2003/04. The survey also found that partnership schools offer on average almost 15 different sports. Copies of the 2003/04 and 2004/05 survey reports have been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.465W.5/1">No one has the &quot;right&quot; to adopt and the proposed new legislation will continue to uphold this principle. However, the law must establish basic criteria which a person must satisfy in order to be eligible to apply to adopt. Under Northern Ireland's existing adoption legislation, the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, a single person of either sex, irrespective of their sexual orientation, may apply to adopt a child. Only married couples may apply to adopt a child jointly. Civil partners, however, are unable to adopt either jointly or singly.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July</phrase> I launched a public consultation &quot;Adopting the Future&quot;, which outlines a proposed strategy for adoption services in Northern Ireland. One of the proposals designed to increase the opportunities for children to be adopted is that civil partners and unmarried couples (whether of different sexes or the same sex) living as partners in an enduring family relationship should be eligible to adopt jointly.</p>
	<p pid="c.465W.5/3">As is currently the case, where persons are eligible to adopt, they will be required to undergo a rigorous assessment of their suitability before any placement or adoption can take place. Every child deserves a safe and happy childhood. Where this is not possible within their own family or extended family, it is essential that every effort is made to secure permanence for the child as early as possible. If a couple in an enduring partnership can demonstrate that they can provide a child with a secure and happy home, where that child can thrive and be cared for into adulthood and beyond, the law should at least allow the couple to be assessed.</p>

	<p pid="c.467W.3/2">Within the JBOs, personal advisers carry out 'work-focused interviews' to help those on working age benefits, including incapacity benefit (IB), identify any barriers to work and encourage them to address these, assess 'job-readiness' and assist clients into work or training programmes or towards other support which will improve their options and capability for work. The process has recently been improved through the introduction of action plans for people who are ill, have a disability or are lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.3/3">The Department has been piloting the Pathways to Work initiative in three areas (Ballymoney, Lurgan and Magherafelt) since <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October 2005</phrase> and in Newtownabbey, Enniskillen and Newry since April 2006. The initiative builds on existing provision and offers early, sustained support from specially trained personal advisers with the aim of helping IB recipients consider a return to work. The support package includes innovative health rehabilitation programmes with a work focus, to help clients understand and manage their health condition. New financial incentives include a &pound;40 a week return to work credit to help &quot;make work pay&quot; for those moving into a job paying less than &pound;15,000 per annum.</p>
	<p pid="c.467W.3/4">The pilot will be expanded to a further four offices by the end of 2006, covering 30 per cent. of clients making a fresh claim to incapacity benefit. The choice of pilot locations has taken account of the rural/urban mix and the potential impacts on the client group in rural areas. It is recognised that the costs of attending mandatory interviews are likely to be greater for those living in rural areas so travel costs are paid and interviews are arranged at a time to suit the client.</p>

	<p pid="c.470W.8/2">The increase in expenditure by <i> (a)</i> employment and learning is accounted for by the Essential Skills Campaign to address the problems of literacy and numeracy. The corrected figures show that spending by <i> (b)</i> health, social services and public safety decreased during the period. The increase in expenditure by <i> (c)</i> the Northern Ireland Office was due to the recruitment advertising of NIO posts locally and nationally. The corrected figures also show that expenditure by environment increased during the period. This is due to additional funding for newly launched road safety campaigns in respect of motorbikes, speeding and drugs and to increase airtime for the anti-drink driving campaign at certain times of the year such as Christmas and bank holidays.</p>
	<p pid="c.470W.8/3">Steps have already been taken to reduce the amount spent on advertising. A fundamental review of how Government procure and manage advertising has been completed.

The report covering the period 2006-09, which provides a range of housing statistics and analysis, was published in February 2006. A copy is available on its website at <a href="http://www.nihe.gov.uk">www.nihe.gov.uk</a> and can be found under the Publications/Reports/ Housing Market Reviews. I will arrange to have a copy placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/27">The review indicates that since 1979 the Housing Executive has sold more than 110,000 dwellings to sitting tenants accounting for almost a quarter (24 per cent.) of the owner-occupied sector and 16 per cent. of the housing market as a whole. The 2001 House Condition Survey provided the first reliable estimate of what proportion of these had been resold on the open market. In March 2001, some 94,000 dwellings had been sold and approximately 18,000 (19 per cent.) of these had been resold on the open market: two thirds to new owner-occupiers and the remaining one third to private landlords, reflecting the fact that they generally provide a good source of high-quality affordable homes, particularly for first-time buyers and landlords who see them as a sound investment. Between 2000 and 2004 the annual house sales figure remained at over 5,000 but in 2004-05 the number of dwellings sold fell by 24 per cent. to 3,135. The reduction reflected the introduction of major revisions to the House Sales Scheme and it is envisaged that house sales will remain at between 2,500 and 3,000 over the next three year period. Annual research carried out by the University of Ulster in relation to sold Housing Executive dwellings confirms that they continue to perform well on the open market.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/28">The co-ownership shared equity scheme remains the Department's main measure for providing assistance to first time buyers experiencing affordability problems. The scheme has been very successful assisting over 19,000 households since 1978. In recognition of this success, Government increased their funding by &pound;23 million over the 3-year period to 2008 to provide almost &pound;39 million and this will help support around 2,400 applicants over this period. A series of changes to the scheme have also just been introduced to make it more accessible for people on lower incomes: the basis of calculation of the co-ownership rental charge will reduce from 3.5 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. As a result a typical co-ownership home buyer with a &pound;100,000 property on a 50:50 basis will see their monthly rental reduce from &pound;160 to &pound;126. The professional fees associated with buying a home through co-ownership are also being reduced from &pound;400 to &pound;250.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/29">Given the sharp increase in house prices, the value limits that apply to properties eligible for purchase through co-ownership have been reviewed. The limit for the greater Belfast and Derry city council areas has increased from &pound;115,000 to &pound;135,000 and from &pound;102,500 to &pound;115,000 elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/30">The Department has also been examining recent initiatives which were introduced to address affordability in the rest of the UK. The Chancellor, in his last budget, announced an increase in the stamp duty threshold to &pound;125,000, and this will specifically assist first-time buyers.</p>

This has resulted in improved communication and intelligence, allowing joint action to tackle serious incidents and serious offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.2/2">EHS, through its environmental crime team, has disrupted the activities of those engaged in the illegal waste trade. As a result, large illegal dump sites are being discovered less frequently. Officers are also discovering increasing amounts of shredded material, treated in this way to mask the point of origin.</p>
	<p pid="c.474W.2/3">On the evidence provided by EHS, the Public Prosecution Service took 47 successful prosecution cases to the end of June 2005, compared with 58 for all of 2005, and 24 in 2004. The 129 successful prosecutions to date have generated fines in excess of &pound;210,000. Around 100 further cases have been scheduled for hearing in the courts.</p>

	<p pid="c.478W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding whether the Department of Regional Development has plans to remove restrictions on the number of street lights in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.8/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.8/5" class="indent">The main criterion for providing street lighting in rural areas is based on the density of housing although we also take cognisance of night time injury accident statistics which indicate that the provision of lighting would contribute to a reduction in such accidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.8/6" class="indent">In June 2006, Roads Service Board agreed an extension to the rural lighting criteria to ensure a consistent approach to the lighting of important junctions on the strategic network. This additional criterion will apply when new junctions are provided, and existing junctions that meet the criterion shall be lit retrospectively over a number of years subject to the availability of funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.8/7" class="indent">However, in the course of its considerations, Roads Service has to seek a balance on the demand for additional lighting against the effects of increased urbanisation of the countryside and the environmental impact on wildlife, flora and the night sky.</p>

As we transform our services, other more efficient channels are now available to our customers, such as Jobseeker Direct, Interactive TV, or the Jobcentre Plus website, and these new options will greatly assist our customers living in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.487W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did not discuss these issues in detail during her recent visit to Brazil. However, we regularly raise such matters with the Government of Brazil, bilaterally and with our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.487W.2/2">Recently, at the Human Rights Council, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs discussed with Paulo Vannuchi, Brazilian State Secretary for Human Rights, ways in which our countries could deepen co-operation. In April, on his visit to Brazil, my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, also raised human rights with Paulo Vannuchi and agreed that the protection of human rights defenders was one of the key areas in which Brazil and the UK could co-operate.</p>
	<p pid="c.487W.2/3">Animal health is an issue taken seriously by the UK and the EU. In August last year, the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office sent an inspection mission to Brazil. The findings were discussed in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in Brussels and the committee was satisfied that no additional restrictions on imports were justified at that stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.487W.2/4">The UK has initiated a high-level dialogue on sustainable development with the Brazilian Government to promote action on sustainable development challenges&mdash;including deforestation, whether it is caused by soya production or cattle farming. The Government actively supports efforts in Brazil to promote agricultural practices that reduce environmental impact and levels of deforestation. For example, the UK, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Opportunities Fund, is supporting an Amazon Deforestation Soya Certification Project which aims to combat deforestation by developing and implementing an independent certification scheme for &quot;forest-friendly&quot; soya.</p>

	<p pid="c.488W.8/1">We have regular discussions with the Colombian Government at official level over our counter-narcotics co-operation. This co-operation is ongoing and is part of our commitment, together with international partners, to help the Government of Colombia tackle the scourge of drug production and drug trafficking which have such a devastating impact on many thousands of innocent Colombians. Clearly, we also have a strong interest in helping Colombia fight the illegal drugs trade, not least because an estimated 80 per cent. of the cocaine coming into Britain originates from Colombia. All the three major illegal armed groups in Colombia have been proven to be actively involved in the illegal drugs trade which fuels the internal armed conflict in the country, undermines political stability and contributes to human rights abuses. Furthermore, the vast international income from cocaine leads to extensive money laundering. Corruption and intimidation backed up by violence is rife in Colombia.</p>

	<p pid="c.492W.0/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore helps staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations in two circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.0/2">Children who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable standard. At posts where no suitable schooling is available free-of-charge locally, the FCO refunds the cost of local school fees to enable children to receive the level of education to which they would be entitled in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.0/3">Staff are liable to move at regular intervals, every 12-48 months, often to locations where schools offering English language education are unavailable or inadequate. Providing continuity of education can therefore pose real problems, particularly during the important examination years. The FCO therefore provides an accountable allowance to enable children to board at school in the UK, while their parents remain subject to the worldwide mobility obligation.</p>

It is not possible to give a further breakdown of departmental assessment of applications since this information is not recorded. All applications are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria, including against criterion 2, which deals with human rights concerns. Should there be a clear risk that the equipment on the application is a risk to human rights in the recipient country, the licence will not be issued. Human Rights, Democracy and Governance Group are asked to advise on applications where specific human rights concerns arise. Ministerial decisions are sought for finely balanced cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.493W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.493W.3/2">The Extradition Act 2003 divides the UK's extradition partners into two categories. Part 1 territories are those EU member states who, like the UK, operate the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) procedure. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.493W.3/3" class="indent">Austria; Belgium; Cyprus; Czech Republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Malta; the Netherlands; Poland; Portugal; Slovakia; Slovenia; Spain; and Sweden</p>
	<p pid="c.493W.3/4">Part 2 territories include those Members of the Council of Europe who are not in the EU and are party to the European Convention on Extradition; Commonwealth territories; and bilateral extradition treaty partners, such as the United States. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.493W.3/5" class="indent">Albania; Andorra; Antigua and Barbuda; Armenia; Argentina; Australia; Azerbaijan; The Bahamas; Bangladesh; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Botswana; Brazil; Brunei; Bulgaria; Canada; Chile; Colombia; Cook Islands; Croatia; Cuba; Dominica; Ecuador; El Salvador; Fiji; The Gambia; Georgia; Ghana; Grenada; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region *; Iceland; India; Iraq; Israel; Jamaica; Kenya; Kiribati; Lesotho; Liberia; Liechtenstein; the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; Malawi; Malaysia; Maldives; Mauritius; Mexico; Moldova; Monaco; Nauru; New Zealand; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Norway; Panama; Papua New Guinea; Paraguay; Peru; Romania; Russian Federation; Saint Christopher and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; San Marino; Serbia and Montenegro; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Solomon Islands; South Africa; Sri Lanka; Swaziland; Switzerland; Tanzania; Thailand; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; Turkey; Tuvalu; Uganda; Ukraine; United States of America; Uruguay; Vanuatu; Western Samoa; Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="c.493W.3/6">In 2005, under the EAW procedure, the UK extradited 77 people to other EU member states and had 66 people returned to this country. Under part 2 of the 2003 Act, the UK extradited 62 people last year and had 11 people returned to this country.</p>

The Government will take this into consideration when assessing any future export licence applications. The Government may also revoke relevant licence(s) and ask the authorities in the country concerned to investigate.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) consults the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) on issues concerning foreign geographical names. The PCGN is an interdepartmental body, whose principal function is to advise the Government on policies and procedures for the proper writing of geographical names for places and features outside the United Kingdom, excluding those of the Antarctic. The final decision on the appropriate name to use, however, rests with the lead section on geographical names within the FCO.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.0/2">The policy for the application of geographical names is to follow the practice of the supreme administering authority of the country concerned. It is the FCO's policy to recognise changes of geographical name where these fall within the sovereign competence of a particular foreign government. For example, in India the name change from Madras to Chennai has been made according to due processes within the Government of India and requires appropriate acknowledgement within the FCO. The name Madras would therefore now be considered a former name for this city, in the same way that Salisbury is a former name for Harare.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.0/3">However, there will be a number of occasions where a geographical name within the sovereign competence of a particular foreign government is already known in a traditional form in the English language and it would not be unusual for this form to be used within the FCO for ease of recognition. For example, the Burmese geographical name Yangon has long been known in the English language as Rangoon, and that form continues to be acceptable today. However, the use of English-language terms can also alter over time. This could be considered to have occurred in the case of Beijing, where the name Peking is today rarely encountered as the English-language name.</p>

	<p pid="c.502W.2/1">It was very disappointing that the UN Small Arms Review Conference failed to agree an outcome document, particularly as the UK had succeeded in agreeing a consensus text on the need for work at the national, regional and global levels to strengthen transfer controls. Fortunately, as the achievement of a consensus text indicates, all countries now recognise the need to address the issue of transfer controls within the UN Programme of Action. Over 100 states at the Review Conference expressed support for strengthening transfer controls. The UK will continue to work with all states to build support for agreement on common guidelines for small arms and light weapons transfers, building on the progress made at regional level in the past three years under the UK's Transfer Controls Initiative. The UK is also keen to work with Canada on its proposal for an informal meeting of states in 2007 focused on transfer controls.</p>

	<p pid="c.506W.5/1">We are working closely with the Department for Committees and Local Government to enable service personnel to qualify under the &quot;local connection&quot; provisions of the Housing Act 1996, in order to overcome the barriers common to both servicemen and their civilian counterparts in access to affordable or social housing. The Joint Service Housing Advice Office offers advice and information about mortgages and affordable home ownership solutions including shared equity schemes. For those single personnel in danger of homelessness, it can facilitate access to temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.5/2">The success of Service leavers who use the career transition partnership as part of their resettlement preparation in securing employment after discharge&mdash;over 50 per cent. within one month of discharge, rising to over 95 per cent. six months after departure&mdash;suggests that there are few barriers to employment of most service personnel. Coaching provided by the Partnership often gives service leavers a competitive edge over other candidates and many of the personal attributes inherent in service culture are highly prized by civilian employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.5/3">The Career Transition Partnership has an effective marketing arm that carefully targets prospective employers who can offer quality jobs to service leavers. Its marketing strategy includes dispelling negative misconceptions about service personnel and their ability to adapt to the civilian workplace. Employers who engage service leavers are seldom disappointed and tend to seek more when vacancies arise.</p>
	<p pid="c.506W.5/4">Individuals who depart under early service leaver arrangements may face more of a challenge. Those that discharge from recruit and basic professional training establishments before completing courses of instruction are unlikely to have gained the transferable competencies and professional qualifications of those service personnel who have entered productive military service. They therefore are more likely to have to contend with the same barriers to employment as confront civilians with a comparable lack of marketable skills. However, on discharge all ex-regular military personnel, regardless of age, have immediate access to the Department of Work and Pensions new deal, which includes occupational and basic skills training.</p>

The 1999 Clinical Guidelines address the use of methadone, buprenorphine (more recently with a marketing authorisation for use as Subutex) and naltrexone. The guidelines discuss the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine and methadone, but as naltrexone is licensed only for use to support relapse prevention, no direct comparison is feasible with the opiate substitute methadone and buprenorphine. The guidelines do support the use of all these drugs as potentially effective opiate misuse treatments when used appropriately. The Department's clinical guidelines are due to be updated in 2006-07 and this will take into account planned guidance on the use of all these drugs due to be published in 2007 by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.9/2">The Department of Health has asked NICE, within a package of work that they will be undertaking on drug treatment, to carry out a technology appraisal on oral methadone and sublingual buprenorphine as opiate substitute treatments. This appraisal will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these drugs as substitute opiates for the management of opiate misusers. The Department also asked at the same time for a similar technology appraisal for &quot;naltrexone as a treatment for relapse prevention&quot; for opiate misuse. This will include appraisal of its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Both these technology appraisals are scheduled for publication in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.9/3">All three of these drugs are currently prescribed for management of opiate dependence. Given that the NHS are obliged to implement guidance produced by NICE, the outcome of their work on drug treatment will be an important support in enhancing the effectiveness of drug treatment and in particular substitute prescribing.</p>

	<p pid="c.512W.2/2">Combating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other health care associated infections (HCAIs), continues to be a priority for Government. A target to reduce the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by half by April 2008 is in place and each trust has its own target. The total number of these infections in 2004-05 was 7,212, compared with 7,684 in 2003-04. Figures for 2005-06 will be published later this month.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.2/3">All acute trusts have signed up to a &quot;Saving Lives&quot; package of best practice measures. The Department continues to engage those trusts facing the most significant challenges and it will seek to work with trusts most likely to benefit from support tailored to their organisational needs. Additionally, the Health Act, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-19">19 July</phrase>, intends through the new code of practice, to give a statutory footing to what is already accepted as best practice&mdash;thus driving up standards of hygiene and infection control.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.2/1">Comprehensive information of the kind requested is not collected centrally. However, the most obvious example of savings of the kind described is when new systems, paid for under the programme, have replaced systems that local national health service bodies have previously been paying for. Across the whole of the NHS, and over the 10-year life of the national programme, these savings will be very substantial. In the case of the local service provider contracts, local savings are expected to offset nearly half the local costs over the lives of the contracts; a saving of some &pound;2.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.2/2">In the case of picture archiving and communications (PACS) systems, local savings are expected fully to offset the local costs of &pound;684 million. Smaller savings are also expected in other areas, for example, where local NHS bodies use N3 or NHSmail to replace services for which they are currently paying. The business case for NHSmail estimated such savings at &pound;185 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.2/3">Further savings as a consequence of safety and organisational improvements will also be cash-releasing, and are highlighted in the recent National Audit Office report into the national programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.2/1">National and local systems and services continue to be rolled out across the country in ever-increasing numbers, and every national health service location has already benefited under the national programme from delivery of software, hardware or the broadband connections that enable these to be accessed. We are on track to complete the national programme, as planned, by 2010.</p>

This includes many acute sector departmental systems supporting clinical specialties, though no systems designed specifically to support genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics, or other sexual health services, have yet gone live. We are not aware of any representations specifically on this matter. However, the programme's national &quot;Do Once and Share&quot; project, under the directorship of Professor Muir Gray, has engaged GUM and other sexual health clinicians, and consulted them on their future information management and technology needs. The results are being shared nationally with the support of the IM and T group of the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.2/3">We recognise that it is of enormous importance that systems and services delivered through the national programme should guarantee the very particular information security and confidentiality requirements of patients accessing GUM and sexual health services. Stringent security controls and safeguards have been incorporated to prevent unrestricted or uncontrolled access to personal information. Access is controlled via a unique user identity, involving a pass code and smart card, which can only be obtained on verification of identity and through a formal user registration process.</p>

	<p pid="c.519W.3/1">The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) provides that penalties levied on firms are allocated to the fee-block or blocks to which the activities relate&mdash;fee blocks group fee payers conducting similar activities. This ensures that the costs of undertaking enforcement actions are matched, as far as possible, with any penalties they might generate.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.3/2">FSMA sets out that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) must not take account of any sums it has received, or may receive, by way of penalties when fixing the level of its fees. This means that the FSA does not take financial penalties into account when calculating the level of its annual funding requirement and the fee rates resulting from the AFR. Neither does the FSA treat financial penalties as income&mdash;rather, they are a liability owed to fee payers.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.3/3">The FSA's rules in this area were set out in a policy statement in May (see annex 4 in particular): <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/policy/ps06_03.pdf">http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/policy/ps06_03.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="c.519W.6/4" class="indent">These estimates are based on the ONS analyses &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; which is published annually. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at http:// <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. It is based on the Expenditure and Food Survey, which has a sample covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. The analysis for 2005/06 is due to be published on the National Statistics website in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.6/5" class="indent">Gross incomes include income from employment, self-employment, pensions, investment income, and cash benefits. The median gross household income in 2004/05 was &pound;24,700 per year. The mean household gross income (which appears in table 14, appendix 1) was &pound;31,884 per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.6/6" class="indent">Analyses of the distribution of household income are based on equivalised household incomes. These equivalised incomes are standardised to take into account the different size and composition of households. The lower limit of the top decile for equivalised household gross income in 2004/05 was &pound;53,239 per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.519W.6/7" class="indent">Separate figures are published on the earnings of employees although they are not directly comparable with these figures on household income, which cover all sources of income (not just income from employment) and all households in the population.</p>

The Valuation Office Agency's advice is that the imposition of drought orders is a legal change that may restrict the ability to use a property and this should be regarded as a matter affecting the physical enjoyment of the property. Whether this will affect the valuation will depend on the individual circumstances of any particular property. It is unlikely that the drought itself constitutes a physical change to a property's locality or infrastructure.</p>

Valuation tribunals are charged with determining rateable values on appeal when ratepayers and valuation officers disagree.

	<p pid="c.538W.5/1">Consideration has been given on a number of occasions to the case for collecting centrally data on the type of offences committed by offenders residing at approved premises. Certain offenders are placed in approved premises, where they can be closely monitored by offender managers and by staff in approved premises. Since offenders are managed locally, it is appropriate that local offender managers should have comprehensive information on offenders, including the type of offence they have committed, it remains my view, therefore, that it is neither necessary, nor a prudent use of resources, for us to collect centrally data on the type of offence committed by residents in approved premises.</p>

	<p pid="c.539W.2/1">Part 4 of the Police and Justice Bill, currently before Parliament, will replace the existing five Chief Inspectors for the justice sector (police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts administration, prisons and probation) with a single Chief Inspector for Justice, Community Safety and Custody. We consider this reform essential to reflect recent reforms in the services inspected and to provide an inspection regime that is able to look more effectively at the system as a whole, especially at the joins where activities of agencies interface.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/2">We recognise the special nature and importance of prisons inspection in safeguarding human rights. We have therefore placed a special and separate duty on the new Chief Inspector to inspect prisons and other similar forms of custody and report to the responsible Ministers on the treatment of prisoners and the conditions in prisons. This duty continues and enhances the present statutory role of the Chief Inspector of Prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/3">Transitional arrangements will ensure that the new Chief Inspector will not take over the prisons inspection duty from the Chief Inspector of Prisons until Ministers are quite satisfied that he or she is ready to do so effectively. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has recently extended the appointment of the present Chief Inspector of Prisons until April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.2/4">We have, however, acknowledged concerns raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and expect to table some amendments to the Bill to address them.</p>

	<p pid="c.542W.2/1">The method of restraint authorised for use in young offender institutions is known as &quot;Control and Restraint&quot;. All prison officers receive initial training and annual refresher training in the use of Control and Restraint. The method of restraint approved for use in secure training centres is known as &quot;Physical Control in Care&quot;. Custody officers in secure training centres receive initial training and at least annual refresher training in these techniques. Secure children's homes are responsible for commissioning their own physical restraint training; these methods are not subject to approval by the Secretary of State.

	<p pid="c.542W.2/2">The Youth Justice Board has undertaken a wide-ranging review of behaviour management and the use of physical restraint. In February 2006, the board issued a Code of Practice on Managing Children and Young People's Behaviour in the Secure Estate. All establishments have been assessed for performance against the code and have drawn up improvement plans. The board is closely monitoring compliance with the code. As part of its review, the board also reassessed the techniques approved for use in secure training centres and is piloting a modified system of Control and Restraint for use in young offender institutions for under 18-year-olds. The overall review is still in progress; the Youth Justice Board is currently working to improve the quality and range of data relating to behaviour management across the estate for children and young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.552W.5/3">To this end we launched the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June</phrase>. The establishment of UKHTC came as a result of the success of Operation Pentameter, a national police led multi-agency operation which aimed to tackle trafficking for sexual exploitation and which led to 234 people being arrested. Of these, 132 people have been charged, to date, with offences connected to trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.5/4">Following on from the success of Operation Pentameter the UKHTC will support the overarching aim of moving the United Kingdom to a leading position in relation to the prevention and investigation of trafficking in human beings. It will also become a central point for the development of police expertise and operational co-ordination.</p>

	<p pid="c.553W.8/1">The Government takes the problem of identity fraud very seriously. There is no single offence of identity fraud. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase> we brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. These offences relate to a wide range of identity documents, including passports, driving licences, ID cards and immigration documents. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for an offence of possession with intent to use the document for establishing registrable facts about another person, such as name, address, date of birth and other personal details, and two years imprisonment for possession without reasonable excuse. Investigation of offences under these provisions are already underway and statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.553W.8/2">There is also a range of other criminal offences to combat identity fraud. These include, for example, the offences in the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978 of obtaining property by deception (property includes money), obtaining services by deception and obtaining a money transfer by deception. The number of these offences that were committed using a false or stolen identity is not recorded centrally. However, identity theft and identity fraud questions were incorporated into the British Crime Survey in 2005 and the results should give us more information on the number of victims and the types of fraud that are being committed.</p>

	<p pid="c.555W.11/3">Approximately 18,000 applications were received via EPA2 and all are expected to have been processed by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-14">14 July</phrase>. The IPS has issued 6.6 million passports this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.11/4">The EPA1 system advises applicants to allow four weeks to receive their passport. However, on-line applications are included in the IPS operating target to turn round 99.5 per cent. of straightforward applications for the standard service within 10 working days once we receive the completed and signed application (which for an EPA1 case will have been prepopulated and sent to the applicant for completion.) The IPS annual report and accounts, expected to be published later this month, will show that this target was met for the financial year ended <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.557W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/2">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) is engaged in a range of initiatives designed to enhance the security of the passport issuing process and the UK passport itself. Because of the nature of fraud and the way in which criminals operate in seeking to obtain passports illegally, IPS takes a holistic approach to enhancing security. The initiatives which are under way are therefore designed to ensure that each part of the passport operation contributes to the security of the whole system and ensures the integrity of the UK passport.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/3">The IPS corporate and business plan for 2006-16 which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-21">21 April 2006</phrase> describes these initiatives and sets out its strategic objectives for fraud prevention. This programme of work includes:-</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/4" class="indent">Introduction of more secure passports incorporating biometrics identifiers. The first UK e.Passport was issued on six March, and rollout to all customers should be completed by the end of August;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/5" class="indent">Introduction next year of mandatory interviews for first time adult passport applicants. Enhancement of management information, monitoring and sampling processes to enable the development of fraud reduction and identity authentication targets and objectives;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/6" class="indent">The application, from March of this year, of the social footprint approach to confirming an individuals identity through the personal identification process (PIP);</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/7" class="indent">Using facial recognition technology to identify fraudulent duplicate applications;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/8" class="indent">Continuing to improve the arrangements for the reporting of lost, stolen and recovered passports, and the storage and the sharing of that data with UK Border Control, and Interpol, and other agencies;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/9" class="indent">Building on the 80 per cent. reduction in losses of passports in the post through the use of secure delivery, the implementation of measures including improved address management to further reduce losses;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/10" class="indent">Continued development of PIP to deliver a more comprehensive biographical footprint check including on line access to UK birth and death records, and naturalisation/registration records;</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/11" class="indent">Further development of IT systems to build on the automatic checks of applications that already take place, to better link passport records to an individual; and</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/12" class="indent">Planning for the introduction of fingerprints in passports by 2009 including use of this technology to detect fraudulent duplicate identities.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/13">Data sharing and the positive validation of passport data is critical to the fight against fraud. The IPS has developed Omnibase which provides secure web access to passport information for FCO consular posts abroad, UK's Border Control authorities, The Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency, Criminal Records Bureau and other Government Departments. From July of this year, and building on successful pilots, IPS plan to extend this passport validation service (PVS) to financial institutions who receive passports as evidence of identity from customers opening bank accounts, seeking mortgages or undertaking other financial transactions. The pilots have already shown that PVS can support users in the identification of suspicious passports and prevent fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.3/14">Finally, supported by the powers in section 25 of the Identity Cards Act that target the misuse of identity documents, IPS is continuing to work closely with the police service, UK Border Control and other Government Departments in operations to tackle fraud.</p>

	<p pid="c.563W.5/1">In addition to the stringent requirements in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 regarding the use of non-human primates, the use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific experiments is subject to supplementary additional considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/2">We announced in 1997 that we cannot foresee any circumstances under which we would be prepared to issue licences under the 1986 Act for programmes of work involving the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans), and that exceptional justification would be required for the licensed use of other types of non-human primates taken from the wild.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/3">The 1986 Act provides that non-human primates, whether captive bred or wild-caught, can only be used when no other species are suitable for the purposes of the programme to be specified in the licence, or that it is not practicable to obtain animals of any other species that are suitable for those purposes. For the use of wild-caught primates to be exceptionally authorised, there must be no appropriate alternative, no suitable captive-bred animals available and the likely benefits of the programme of work would have to fully justify their use.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.5/4">In respect of applications to use wild-caught non-human primates, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and the Animal Procedures Committee provide advice on a case by case basis on whether and on what terms such use should be licensed. Application of these stringent criteria has meant that first time use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific procedures has not been licensed in the UK for some years.</p>

In certain prisons, up to 80 per cent. test positive for opiates on reception. A further study shows the breakdown of percentage drug misuse by age, in the 12 months prior to prison.

	<p pid="c.569W.3/1">Sefton Youth Offending Team (YOT) is receiving a total Youth Justice Board (YJB) prevention grant of &pound;347,222 between November 2005 and March 2008, which it is using to fund its existing Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP) and a new Youth Inclusion and Support Panel (YISP). &pound;177,222 of this comes from the additional 45 million funding and &pound;170,000 is part of ongoing YIP funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.569W.3/2">Two additional YISP staff will be recruited. These will be in addition to the existing YIP staff. Both new posts are located in the Sefton Centre for Restorative Practice in Stanley Road, Bootle.</p>
	<p pid="c.569W.3/3">The primary duty of the YISP co-ordinator is to be responsible for the development and implementation of the work of the YISP, in order to ensure that the YISP delivers effective services to address the needs of children referred to the panel, within a restorative practice framework.</p>
	<p pid="c.569W.3/4">The YISP key worker will be responsible for the management of a caseload and overseeing the delivery of intervention designed to address the needs of those children.</p>
	<p pid="c.569W.3/5">The YOT has an effective workforce strategy to manage the performance of individual members of staff that is integrated with the council's performance management framework. The YIP and YISP programmes in Sefton will be monitored and supported through the YJB's performance management framework which ensures YOTs provide quarterly data returns to the YJB to gauge outputs and outcomes, includes monitoring by YJB staff, and provides for mechanisms for supporting individual YOTs should there be poor performance issues.</p>
