The time taken to answer calls and the customer service elements of the calls were generally satisfactory or good. Overall 95 per cent. (Wave 2 result 93 per cent., Wave 1 result 88 per cent.) of the answers given were completely accurate and reflects an improvement across the regions but particularly for some of the long distance call types.

The proposed Directive should, over time, bring greater clarity to the market on this issue, which may be beneficial to the prospects for research and development.</p>

	<p pid=".307W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply</p>
	<p pid=".307W.6/2">In the short-term the EU Food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon the retail sector. In the longer-term, the impact of the Directive will depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.</p>
	<p pid=".307W.6/3">The proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products could have positive consequences for employment in the retail sector. The proposals would require traditional herbal remedies to meet standards as to quality, safety and product information, areas in which the current regime for unlicensed herbal remedies has significant weaknesses. More effective regulation, which would follow if there is a successful outcome to the negotiations, potentially could enhance the status and recognition of traditional herbal remedies. This in turn could help to maintain and increase public confidence and ultimately lead to an expansion in the sector. Our aim in the continuing negotiations, and in the implementation of the Directive if it is agreed, will be to ensure that the regulation is proportionate.</p>

	<p pid=".308W.6/2">The Director of the SFO is already entitled, under Section 1 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, to investigate any offence that appears to her on reasonable grounds to involve serious or complex fraud. Offences of corruption and money laundering are therefore already included in the range of offences open to the SFO to investigate provided they meet key criteria. Amongst others, these include where the sum at risk is estimated to be at least #1 million or the case is likely to give rise to national publicity and widespread public concern or the case has a significant international dimension. All or some of these factors can be present in an allegation of corruption or money laundering and if so then the SFO may investigate.</p>
	<p pid=".308W.6/3">The SFO has, in fact, successfully investigated and prosecuted 10 cases involving offences of corruption and/or money laundering since its inception in 1988. These cases have led to prison sentences or suspended sentences for the defendants, often coupled with disqualification from acting as a company director. The SFO is also currently investigating several similar allegations.</p>

	<p pid=".310W.0/2">Warm Front was launched in June 2000 and provides assistance to certain groups in receipt of a qualifying income or disability benefit by installing packages of insulation and heating measures.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/3">Warm Front does not promote products or sell energy from individual energy companies. Households are free to choose their own supplier and may, like any consumer, opt to change after 28 days. Two Scheme Managers, Eaga Partnership and TXU Warm Front administer Warm Front. Some of the heating measures offered under Warm Front may require the household to be connected up to an additional electrical supply for night storage heaters or mains gas for the first time.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/4">Following a tender exercise an agreement was entered into between Defra and two companies: Scottish Power and TXU Energi. For those requiring a gas central heating the preferred supplier was Scottish Power and for a combined electric and gas fuel supply from the Stay Warm tariff provided by TXU Energi. By August 2002 almost 4,000 homes had received a new gas supply. The majority of these households have not used the preferred suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/5">Neither Scheme Managers have received complaints about mis-selling of energy contracts. I cannot comment on behalf of OFGEM. The Department has received one specific complaint relating to Nestmakers, an independent organisation jointly and equally owned by Scottish Power and Eaga Partnership Ltd. The allegation was investigated and found to be unproven.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/6">Nestmakers also undertake home surveys for Warm Front in Eaga Partnership's catchment area. Nestmaker surveyors are aware that Warm Front is mutually exclusive to any energy supply contract. Nestmakers will take disciplinary action against any surveyor who is proved to have sold an energy supply contract on the conditional understanding that it was needed to access Warm Front.</p>

	<p pid=".311W.11/1">The Department has received a number of representations concerning the application by Greece to register ''feta'' as a protected food name. Throughout all the discussions on this issue (at official and Ministerial level), the UK has opposed the Greek application on the grounds that we believed that the name ''feta'' had become a generic and so not eligible for protection. The majority of Member States were in favour of registration but the required qualified majority was not reached either in the Regulatory Committee or subsequently in the Agriculture Council. However, because the Council was unable to act by qualified majority the Commission was able (under the terms of the original Regulation) to adopt the proposal. Feta was registered as a protected food name on <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".311W.11/2">I am conscious of the effect that feta's registration as a protected food name will have on UK producers. Officials have therefore written to these producers to see whether they might be eligible to benefit from a transition period within which the name ''feta'' could continue to be used.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.5/2">Current Eurostat figures show that between August 2000 and August 2001, EU youth unemployment (15&ndash;24) fell from 15.3 per cent. to a low of 14.6 per cent., before rising again to 15.3 per cent. in June 2002. Latest figures for each Member State are given below. The European Employment Strategy, the main instrument for action to increase employment, will operate in a revised form from next year, and will focus more clearly on reaching the employment rate goals agreed at Lisbon.</p>

	<p pid=".317W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/2">The Food Supplements Directive is likely to have a positive impact upon employment in the research and development sector. The Directive demands that the safety of concentrated sources of vitamins and minerals used as ingredients in food supplements be approved by the European Union Scientific Committee on Food before use, and is therefore likely to encourage related research.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/3">In the short-term the EU Food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon employment in the manufacturing, wholesale or retail sectors. In the longer-term, the impact of the Directive will largely depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/4">The possible impact of the proposed Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products on employment in the research and development sector is difficult to predict. Under the current regime in the United Kingdom for unlicensed herbal remedies it will not normally be clear to the purchaser of a remedy whether that remedy is brought to the market on the basis of evidence of efficacy of the product, of traditional usage, or some other factor. The proposed Directive should, over time, bring greater clarity to the market on this issue, which may be beneficial to the prospects for research and development.</p>
	<p pid=".317W.2/5">The proposed Directive potentially could have positive consequences for employment in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors. The proposals would require traditional herbal remedies to meet standards as to quality, safety and product information, areas in which the current regime for unlicensed herbal remedies has significant weaknesses. More effective regulation, which would follow if there is a successful outcome to the negotiations, potentially could enhance the status and recognition of traditional herbal remedies. This in turn could help to maintain and increase public confidence and ultimately lead to an expansion in the sector. The Medicines Control Agency's aim in the continuing negotiations, and in the implementation of the Directive if it is agreed, will be to ensure that the regulation is proportionate.</p>

	<p pid=".318W.7/1">Import liberalisation, properly managed, can contribute to sustainable and poverty-reducing economic growth. Cross-country evidence shows that trade liberalisation increases economic growth and that economic growth, in turn, tends to reduce poverty on average. Trade openness contributes to poverty reduction by stimulating productivity and reducing domestic consumer prices. However, the relationship differs substantially from country to country. Complementarity and sequencing of supporting policies within an overall long-term development strategy are essential to the success of trade liberalisation. A country will typically have to implement some or all of the following complementary policies:</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/2" class="indent">trade-related capacity building, to formulate a sound trade strategy, participate successfully in international trade negotiations and implement WTO requirements;</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/3" class="indent">private sector development, to improve the private sectors' productive capacity to respond to new markets abroad and to compete with imports;</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/4" class="indent">macroeconomic stabilisation, to obtain a business-friendly environment, in particular low inflation and interest rates and a stable exchange rate that is not overvalued;</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/5" class="indent">tax reform, to offset revenue losses from tariff reductions by increasing tax revenues;</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/6" class="indent">labor market reform, to ensure that workers can move between sectors to respond to trade-induced opportunities;</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/7" class="indent">and social safety nets, to support groups adversely affected by trade liberalisation.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/8">Domestic reform, however, will often not be sufficient. Developing countries face high tariff and non-tariff barriers in sectors of importance, notably agriculture and textiles and clothing. As tariffs are lowered, new forms of protection become more prominent, such as anti-dumping and excessive product standards and technical regulations. Such issues need to be addressed in future trade negotiations to ensure that international trade rules are more developmental.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/9">The Integrated Framework (IF) is a policy initiative by six international agencies, with participation by donors and developing countries. DFID is playing a prominent role in its implementation. It represents an attempt to respond to the need for trade reforms to be implemented carefully and with the appropriate mix of complementary policies. Under the Integrated Framework, existing trade-related policies in a country are assessed and further needs identified. The Integrated Framework tries to facilitate the formulation of a coherent trade policy that fosters sustainable and poverty-reducing economic growth.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/10">DFID has been at the forefront of developing and promoting trade policies that address the risks associated with import liberalisation. All our trade-related work is geared towards making trade work for the poorest. DFID is trying to raise awareness of the need for sound trade policies at all levels: within DFID itself, in our country offices, within Whitehall and at the WTO.</p>
	<p pid=".318W.7/11">DFID believes that the trade policy it has developed to address the challenges of trade liberalisation contains the kind of advice and experience that contribute to sustainable and poverty-reducing development ant that it can usefully recommend such policies to policy makers in developing countries. In general, developing countries have responded positively to DFID's trade policy, as is clear for example from the recent review of the Ghana Trade Policy Project.</p>

	<p pid=".319W.2/1">2001 was an atypical year for poppy cultivation because of a ban imposed by the Taliban regime. After the fall of the Taliban there was a resurgence in poppy planting, and estimates of area cultivated are only slightly less than that in 2000. This is in spite of a Decree by the Afghan Interim Administration in January 2002 banning the production and processing of opium, and an eradication and compensation scheme which destroyed an estimated 25&ndash;30 per cent. of the crop. We are hopeful that poppy cultivation will decline as the international community promotes efforts to create alternative livelihood opportunities for farmers, and to improve the interdiction capacity by the Afghan authorities charged with enforcing the ban. This is only likely to come about as security is maintained and the reconstruction process gathers momentum.</p>
	<p pid=".319W.2/2">My Department is committed to supporting measures that will help to develop alternative livelihood opportunities for poor people, including in poppy growing areas, in order that there is a consistent shift away from both poverty and poppy cultivation. I have already approved a #1m contribution to the UNDP National Area Development Programme and a #1m contribution towards the work of the Aga Khan Foundation in Badakshan. This is on top of a contribution of #2.8m to quick impact reconstruction projects, some of which are in drug producing areas. The World Bank funded National Solidarity Programme will also be a further significant contribution to community based development. My Department is also planning to provide assistance to the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development within Afghanistan to develop a sustainable approach towards generating alternative livelihoods, including in poppy growing areas. The UK is further committed to helping wider Afghan led security sector reform and reconstruction efforts.</p>

	<p pid=".320W.2/1">The Department for International Development currently supports three principal websites: the departmental site (<a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>), a site providing access to development education resources (<a href="http://www.globaldimension.org.uk">www.globaldimension.org.uk</a>) and a site relating to DFID's quarterly magazine, ''Developments'' (<a href="http://www.developments.org.uk">www.developments.org.uk</a>). For the launch of the 2000 White Paper on International Development, DFID supported the creation of an additional site (<a href="http://www.globalisation.gov.uk">www.globalisation.gov.uk</a>). All sites are active, although the 2000 White Paper site is treated as dormant for the purposes of uploading new information.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.2/2">The main DFID website and the 2000 White Paper are hosted by U-UNET; hosting of the Global Dimension website is contracted to a commercial company, Planet 56; the ''Developments'' website is hosted by Synergy, under a design contract encompassing both the design of the magazine and its associated website, and its costs are embedded in the budget for that magazine. The department is currently investigating a time-scale for bringing the hosting of directly-supported websites in-house.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.2/3">It would not be possible to list all start-up and annual running costs since inception without disproportionate effort. However, approximate budgets for each of the websites for the last three financial years are as follows:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid=".320W.2/14">The main DFID website was overhauled in November 2001: terms of reference for a post-implementation review, including the instigation of a formal user-evaluation process are currently being drawn up, with a view to completing a review of the website by early 2003. User-evaluation for ''Developments'' is undertaken in the form of an annual reader survey via the magazine, reinforced through a web-based survey. User-evaluation for the Global Developments website is planned as part of a mid-term review during 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".320W.2/15">Statistical information in relation to website users for all DFID-supported websites is supplied on a monthly basis to the Office of the e-Envoy, and published by them.</p>

	<p pid=".321W.2/2">The GWS Rural Water and Sanitation Programme receives #7.9 million from DFID to help selected hill village communities access safe water and sanitation, manage their water systems efficiently and, through hygiene education, use water effectively. NEWAH receives #2.7 million from DFID to implement a similar approach in the Mid and Far West for communities that would not be reached by GWS. Since January 2001, DFID has also provided approximately #1.5 million in short and medium term support to water related programmes of Helvetas that are designed to improve living conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged communities in Nepal. The location of physical investments through these programmes has been affected by the conflict, and there has been some movement, by NEWAH in particular, to safer districts. However expenditures overall are on target.</p>
	<p pid=".321W.2/3">DFID is also considering providing #1 million for short term support to the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Fund Development Board (RWSSFDP) to help the Board increase services to communities affected by conflict, adopt a more conflict-sensitive approach in the delivery of water and sanitation services and infrastructure, and to help shift the RWSSFDB programme to the Mid and Far West Regions of Nepal.</p>

	<p pid=".322W.2/1">I met with the High Commissioner for Refugees on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July</phrase> when we discussed UK support to Afghanistan and other issues. Our officials remain in close contact.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/2">My department has provided significant support to UNHCR to assist with the repatriation of refugees to Afghanistan. Since September 2001, the UK has contributed over #5 million to UNHCR for their programmes of assistance to Afghan refugees. In addition we have provided over #3.5 million to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees to Afghanistan. We are also supporting a number of other humanitarian programmes which will help to create an environment for the sustainable return of both refugees and IDPs.</p>
	<p pid=".322W.2/3">In addition, earlier this month the governments of Afghanistan and the United Kingdom and UNHCR signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) setting out a detailed framework for the voluntary repatriation of Afghans residing in the UK and their reintegration back in Afghanistan. Under the agreement, UNHCR will provide information and counselling to Afghans in the UK&mdash;to ensure that any decision to repatriate is taken in the ''full knowledge of the facts''. UNHCR will also monitor the voluntariness of the returns prior to departure, as well as other aspects of the agreement&mdash;a role that both states have pledged to respect. Similarly, once returnees are back in Afghanistan, the agency has guaranteed access to them from the moment they land at the airport. UNHCR believes that the MoU contains all the necessary safeguards to ensure that Afghans who still need international refugee protection continue to receive it and that returns under the agreement would be sustainable. A similar tripartite agreement had earlier been signed with the French government. It is hoped that the MoU will become a model for other countries who are interested in offering assisted voluntary repatriation for Afghans.</p>

	<p pid=".325W.3/1">Zambia is the only country which has refused so far to accept grain containing genetically modified material. The effect is to make it more difficult for the World Food Programme to meet emergency needs in the country. Over the months of October and November around 27,000 tonnes which are in the pipeline (about 40 per cent. of the food aid requirements for the two months) will not be distributed in Zambia if the current ban is maintained. In that case, it seems likely that the Government of Zambia would have to resort to more expensive and slower options in order to meet the needs.</p>

	<p pid=".329W.2/1">The Secretary of State is empowered under Section 110 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to pay grants to organisations in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with persons who are or have been asylum seekers and their dependants. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) may grant fund Regional Consortia for their enabling role in providing services and support for asylum seekers dispersed to their region. A grant agreement exists between NASS and the Regional Consortia to facilitate payment, a key element of which is to develop, implement and deliver a strategy for resettlement and integration for those who are granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.2/2">The enabling grant is payable for each financial year and is increased proportionately to cover the costs of the enabling authority.</p>
	<p pid=".329W.2/3">Additionally, the Home Office has distributed #1.5 million through the Refugee Integration Challenge Fund of which around #340,000 has been given to local authorities in order that they may implement pilot projects in the field of refugee integration. Around #1.7 million of the European Refugee Fund 2002, provided by the European Commission, has also been awarded to local authorities for similar projects. It is the intention that these projects will be robustly evaluated in order to identify good practice and so inform future policy making.</p>

	<p pid=".332W.5/1">The government are determined to reduce the flow of clandestine entry to the United Kingdom from Continental Channel ports in freight vehicles and, as a first step in a project, are procuring new detection technology equipment for the use of port/ferry operators in Calais to supplement the vehicle checks already conducted there. This is the first of a number of initiatives, which will provide a significant deterrent to clandestine entry to the United Kingdom and to strengthen our controls at the Channel ports.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/2">It is recognised, however, that these positive measures in Calais may initially result in displacement of clandestine traffic to other Continental ports. As a precaution extra freight searching operations have been conducted in Poole and Portsmouth by UK Immigration Service (UKIS) in respect of vessels arriving from France. Results of these extra searches revealed no indication of significant displacement of clandestine traffic into these ports. Consideration is also being given to the deployment of mobile detection units in order to respond more quickly to changing threats in respect of cross-channel illegal migration.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/3">Funding has also been made available for the procurement of additional equipment for deployment in those ports and considerable progress has already been made.</p>
	<p pid=".332W.5/4">In taking the project forward, Immigration Service officials have visited a number of ports to assess the risk of displacement, current security measures and the extent of their equipment needs. In all cases, port and other officials have welcomed the initiative and have voiced their willingness to participate. Cherbourg is amongst those ports already visited and further visits are planned to others, including St. Malo, Caen and Le Havre.</p>

This excludes the 900 places at Yarl's Wood removal centre, the operation of which has been suspended since March this year.

	<p pid=".333W.2/2">We remain committed to reaching the target of 4,000 detention places announced in the White Paper ''Secure Borders, Safe Haven''. The serious events at Yarl's Wood removal centre in February, and the subsequent need to suspend operations at the centre, were a severe blow to our programme to reach the target of 4,000 places. Plans to build a new removal centre (Logford) adjacent to the existing Harmondsworth Removal Centre, are in place and this will provide a further 300 detention places. We anticipate that the new centre will become operational in April 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".335W.2/1">Action to maintain and improve the quality of initial decisions on asylum applications is a continuous process. Recent initiatives include extra training on human rights and seminars by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture to better equip caseworkers to interview asylum applicants. Guidance to caseworkers and training needs are informed by, and updated in the light of, random sampling of initial decisions, emerging case law, policy changes, and feedback from internal and external stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".335W.2/2">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) achieved the 2001&ndash;02 target of deciding 60 per cent. of new substantive asylum applications within two months. Provisional, internal data indicate that IND is on track to meet this year's target of 65 per cent. and well placed to achieve next year's target of 75 per cent. within two months. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill contains a number of provisions to support faster asylum processes, particularly for clearly unfounded claims.</p>

We have taken a key role in speeding agreement to a common package jointly to handle Asylum issues. We have taken action, with our partners, to enhance border protection and tackle transit routes. We have drawn attention to the scope for enhanced co-operation on returns and readmissions. We have been instrumental in focussing on the need for enhanced co-operation with source and transit countries. Effective, targetted and intelligence-led joint operations to tackle the traffickers is also a keynote of the Government's approach that has been taken up across the EU.</p>

	<p pid=".347W.2/1">At the NATO Informal Ministerial Meeting in Warsaw in September 2002, the United States Defense Secretary proposed a NATO Response Force (NRF) to provide a rapidly deployable capability within the existing developments in the NATO Command and Force Structures. The United Kingdom strongly supports the NRF concept as a means of optimising the utility of the NATO Force Structure across the range of missions. It will also help to focus efforts to improve capabilities, and will therefore be coherent with and complementary to the European Security and Defence Policy. The NRF concept is currently being discussed within the Alliance, with the guiding principles expected to be put before Heads of State and Government at the November 2002 NATO Summit in Prague for their agreement.</p>

	<p pid=".348W.12/1">Challenger 2 is a very complex vehicle with many different component parts ranging from the engine to the electronic gunnery systems, necessitating a wide range of personnel from different trades and specialisations to work on them.</p>
	<p pid=".348W.12/2">Depending on the type of repair required, the damaged part can be fixed in the field, in a workshop or returned to the manufacturer. In many cases the part is replaced and the damaged part returned for repair. All Challenger 2 crewmen are able to replace parts as necessary provided the part is carried on board. Crewmen are not REME personnel.</p>
	<p pid=".348W.12/3">Vehicle Mechanics are those REME personnel trained to work on many of the Army's vehicles, including Challenger 2, both in the field and in workshops.

However, I have decided in this case, as an exceptional measure aimed at building confidence in Northern Ireland, that an extract from the relevant document should be published in the Library of the House. The extract is drawn from a more general guidance card and includes all the relevant guidance on the Rules of Engagement for the use of Baton Rounds by the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".351W.6/1">The independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC), chaired by Dr. Robert C Hubrecht, has recently published its sixth Report. The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee was set up in 1996 in response to parliamentary and public concern about the use of animals in defence research. Its purpose is to consult, inspect and make all necessary enquiries into all aspects of animal care and their use in establishments of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). It has also been agreed between the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and QinetiQ that the work at Alverstoke should remain within the Committee's remit.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/2">All work with animals undergoes an ethical review process and has to demonstrate that as much as possible has been done to replace the procedures with alternatives not using live animals; to reduce the numbers of animals used in particular studies; and to refine the procedures to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm prior to the issues of licences to undertake work.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/3">Formal licensing arrangements with the Home Office (in strict accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures Act 1986) seek to ensure that any experiments are fully justified and as humane as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/4">The Committee's report gives assurances that animals used in defence research programmes in the United Kingdom are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and that no special exemptions apply to MOD. The Committee's findings, acting as the eyes and ears of the public on matters relating to animal experimentation carried out by the MOD, are published in order to inform Parliament and the public of MOD practices.</p>
	<p pid=".351W.6/5">The research programme involving animals is concerned wholly with providing the United Kingdom's Armed Forces with safe and effective protection against hazards they may encounter while carrying out their duties. However, the MOD continues to place emphasis on seeking alternatives to animal use. The MOD welcomes the scrutiny by AWAC in this area and will continue to support AWAC's review into the care and welfare arrangements for animals used in defence research.</p>

	<p pid=".355W.6/1">Productivity has grown since 1997, even with rapidly falling unemployment. Productivity growth between 1997Q2 and 2002Q1 has averaged 1.3 per cent. p.a. (comparing each quarter with a year earlier). This is in the context of rising employment (increased employment of over 1&frac12; million since Spring 1997), while unemployment as measured either using the International Labour Organisation methodology or via the ''claimant count'' has been at its lowest since the 1970s over the past year.</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/2">The Government's long-term ambition is that Britain will achieve a faster rate of productivity growth than its main competitors, closing the productivity gap. The creation of a sustainable, stable macroeconomic framework since 1997 has provided the foundation for productivity growth in UK firms, and microeconomic reforms are supporting and encouraging further growth. These reforms include:</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/3" class="indent">the Competition Act 1998, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements and abuses of dominant market position;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/4" class="indent">the Enterprise Bill (introduced to Parliament in March 2002), which will build on the achievements of Competition Act by further strengthening our competition authorities;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/5" class="indent">Research &amp; Development tax credits&mdash;together the small and large company credits provide #500 million new support for business R&amp;D;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/6" class="indent">the largest sustained growth in spending on science for a decade, with the 2002 Spending Review committing some #1.25 billion additional spending by 2005&ndash;06 compared to 2002&ndash;03;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/7" class="indent">a Green Paper setting out a fundamental reform of the land-use planning system to ensure that it does not provide a barrier to economic growth and productivity&mdash;the 2002 Spending Review allocated the ODPM substantial additional resources to drive forward the reforms set out in the Green Paper;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/8" class="indent">a 10 year plan for transport, which sets out plans for public and private investment of more than #180 billion up to 2010, creating a modern transport network across the UK&mdash;the 2002 Spending Review continued the investment necessary to deliver the Ten-Year Plan, increasing public expenditure on transport from #7.6 billion in 2002&ndash;03 to #11.6 billion in 2005&ndash;06;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/9" class="indent">reduced corporation tax rates&mdash;the main rate has been reduced from 33 per cent. to 30 per cent., the lowest ever UK rate; the small company rate has been reduced from 23 per cent. to 19 per cent., and a new starting rate has been introduced, reduced in 2002 to 0 per cent. for profits under #10,000; average corporation tax bills for small companies have been cut by 30 per cent. since 1997;</p>
	<p pid=".355W.6/10" class="indent">increased investment to raise standards in education&mdash;spending per pupil was #2,700 in 1997, but rose to #3,500 last year; this could rise to #4,900 per pupil by 2005&ndash;06, which after inflation, is 50 per cent. more per pupil than in 1997;</p>

	<p pid=".355W.6/15" class="indent">Global Competition Review awarding the UK competition regime four and a half stars this year (compared with three and a half last year); this rating was bettered only by the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (5 stars);</p>

A similar project is underway for the Cluan Place/Clandeboye interface in the east of the city. Recently the police and army established a high profile presence on both sides of the community in East Belfast.

	<p pid=".368W.8/1">In Northern Ireland we are trying to tackle and confront the trade of counterfeit goods through the co-ordinated efforts of the Organised Task Force which I chair.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.8/2">One of the main objectives of the Task Force is to raise public awareness concerning the dangers of counterfeit goods. I am keen to highlight the menace of organised crime to the public, which is why I am undertaking to host regional awareness evenings, on the threat from organised crime and the dangers from counterfeit goods. The next awareness evening will take place on the 28 of October.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">23 September</phrase> the OCTF launched its web-site, which provides a further two way communication between it and the public. This is an important development, which will open a ''shop window'' for the task force. In addition it is a dynamic medium that will permit the Task Force to communicate its message and should both educate people and enhance information gathering.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.8/4">The Publicity Sub-Group which forms an integral part of the OCTF looks for every opportunity to highlight to the public the Task Force's three key messages:</p>
	<p pid=".368W.8/5" class="indent">Organised crime is dangerous; never victimless; and we need everyone's support to tackle organised crime.</p>
	<p pid=".368W.8/6">PSNI and Customs &amp; Excise are doing excellent work, every week to tackle the trade in counterfeit goods. There have been some tremendous operational successes this year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase> police found counterfeit clothing worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in Belfast. This is reported to be the biggest seizure ever found in Northern Ireland. Also at the Aul Lammas Fair in August 300k of counterfeit goods were confiscated following a request from the public to the Police Service of Northern Ireland for action.</p>

	<p pid=".369W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-23">23 May</phrase>, the Secretary of State launched the second annual Organised Crime Task Force threat assessment and strategy. The OCTF threat assessment provided an overview of the scale and scope of organised crime in Northern Ireland and highlighted trends and developments in the preceding year.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/2">The threat assessment tells us that oils fraud continues to be a problem although there is evidence that the position has stabilised and slightly improved. The latest figures show that deliveries of legal product to Northern Ireland have risen for the first time in five years.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/3">The Government believe however that oils related fraud remains unacceptably high. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July</phrase> as chair of the OCTF, and on behalf of the Financial Secretary to the treasury too, I opened an Oils Fraud Expert Group Seminar. This drew together a wide range of agencies with an aim to develop a multi-agency strategy for tackling oil frauds in Northern Ireland. This group will meet again on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".369W.2/4">There have been some tremendous operations this year in this field. In June Customs &amp; Excise detected a fuel laundering plant, seized 137 vehicles, including taxis, commercial and private vehicles and three filling stations all using illegal fuel.</p>

However, the security forces established a high profile on both sides of the community and the adoption of a number of physical security measures and the introduction of CCTV have brought a measure of calm to these troubled areas.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.8/1">To investigate the links between additional educational needs (AEN) and deprivation indicators, the department commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to research the incidence of pupils with AEN and the costs of meeting their needs. They found that the number of pupils eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) was the strongest factor explaining variation in reported social need. They also found that the number of pupils with English as an additional language was strongly linked to non-social measures of AEN. They also looked at several ward based measures such as Long term unemployment, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and the Access domain from the IMD, but found that these indicators were not as good at explaining variations in reported need as the standard FSM data.</p>
	<p pid=".375W.8/2">The department also considered a number of other measures of deprivation: from the 1991 census, such as rented accommodation or low social class; and from the Labour Force Survey, such as the proportion of working age adults with no qualifications. Many of these measures showed some statistical relationship with low attainment suggesting they could be used as a proxy for AEN. However, they are also all highly related to parental take up of income support, which is the most consistently strong factor explaining variation in low attainment between different authorities, schools and pupils.</p>

Periodic valuations of the scheme are carried out by the Government Actuary to establish the liabilities and notional assets of the scheme. The valuation determines the contribution rate paid by the employers of TPS members.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.2/3">With the agreement of Treasury, I am currently consulting teacher and employer representatives and other interested parties on changes to the valuation methodology. Under the existing provisions of the Teachers' Pensions Regulations, the notional fund is deemed to have delivered the average rate of return achieved by the largest invested pension funds. However, likely interest returns to the stock market performance of notional assets is unlikely to produce a stable assessment of the cost of providing public service pensions, particularly over the short to medium term, or to reflect the risks and costs to government of financing the pensions in payment. The Government wishes to reflect these costs more appropriately, remove the financial uncertainty about the performance of notional assets, and provide greater stability in employer contribution rates. I am, therefore, consulting on the proposal that, instead of tracking the returns of invested pension funds, the method of crediting investing returns to the notional fund should be based on a rate of returns which the Government Actuary advises as being appropriate for the valuation of a public service pension scheme.

However, there may be some circumstances, for example, if a child has severe or complex Special Educational Needs that would be met more appropriately through provision available in a special school; or a child fluent in English who could benefit from the education available in a mainstream school; when the learning needs of a child requires provision to be made available outside the centre.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.5/1">The Computers Within Reach Scheme closed on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase> having delivered over 24,000 recycled computers to people in 22 pilot areas, at a cost of #7.1 million over two years. Those eligible were in receipt of certain working age benefits or a State Pension with minimum income guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/2">An evaluation was conducted, and a copy has been placed in the Libraries. Positive findings included:</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/3" class="indent">83 per cent. of recipients surveyed were satisfied with their computer;</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/4" class="indent">the average weekly usage of the computer by recipients stood at just over 8 hours per week; and</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/5" class="indent">on average 3 other individuals, besides the recipient, were making use of the computer in each household.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/6">However, the report also highlighted difficulties with the scheme, which included:</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/7" class="indent">there being no cost-effective solution for delivery of units to individuals;</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/8" class="indent">even though 83 per cent. of recipients surveyed were satisfied with their computer, just under half had experienced problems with it and nearly 75 per cent. of those people said they were not supported to overcome the difficulties; and</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/9" class="indent">only 51 per cent. were satisfied with the level of service provided.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/10">In view of these difficulties, we considered carefully whether to repeat the scheme against alternatives that might provide more effective access to ICT and learning opportunities for those currently without access.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/11">We concluded that we should not run another phase of the Computers Within Reach Scheme but channel the remaining #7.9 million into purchasing wireless technology equipment and laptops for Adult and Community Learning Centres serving deprived wards around the country. This will open up access to equipment and training for an estimated 335,000 learners over a three year period&mdash;far more than the number who would have benefited from an extension of the Computers Within Reach Scheme. These learners will be offered regular, supported access to the learning potential of the Internet and the communication potential of e-mail. Access to the Internet will mean that, for the first time for many, access to e-Government and e-Democracy can be a reality.</p>

Well thought-out commercial support can add value to school life and provide welcome additional resources. Last Autumn, we issued guidelines&mdash;''<i>Commercial activities in schools: Best practice principles</i>''&mdash;so that schools can make informed and sensible decisions about the nature of business involvement. The guidelines make clear that schools should satisfy themselves that the educational benefits of the commercial activity outweigh the potential disbenefits; that it is free of incentives to children to engage in unhealthy, unsafe or unlawful activities; that explicit sales messages are avoided wherever possible; and that the level of any branding is appropriate to the activity.</p>

Friend David Miliband, in his written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-19">19 September</phrase>, outlined the ways the Secretary of State aims to ensure that children's mental health needs are being met. In June 2001 the Department issued guidance, <i>Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings</i>. This is strongly recommended and we would expect schools to have regard to it.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.3/2">The guidance is designed to help teachers and others working alongside mental health professionals to identify children and young people's mental health needs, and sets out useful approaches for how these needs might be met. The advice in the guidance is backed up by illustrative case studies.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.3/3">The guidance also includes a section on the work of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). The Department commissioned a research project into effective collaboration between schools and CAMHS which will be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".383W.0/1">The aims of Behaviour and Educational Support Teams (BESTs) are to promote emotional well-being, positive behaviour and school attendance among children and young people. They help in the identification and support of those with, or at risk of developing, emotional and behavioural problems, through the provision of multi-agency support in schools and to individual families.</p>
	<p pid=".383W.0/2">BESTs will take part in training which covers many areas of multi-agency working and related subject areas. This will include children's mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid=".383W.0/3">There are a number of professional disciplines which may be appropriately represented within the BEST. The precise skills balance will be decided locally, in line with the priorities agreed for the BEST, provision already available in schools and the resource available across the LEA and partner agencies. DfES guidelines suggest teams should contain a complementary mix of education, social work and health skills in order to meet the multi-faceted needs of children, young people and their parents.</p>

	<p pid=".388W.11/1">My right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister has made no specific assessment of the use of vacant land and unused buildings by local planning authorities within council house estates in Wandsworth or London. However, a national survey of brownfield land published in September 2002 showed that in 2001 some 4590 hectares of brownfield land were available for development in London. Planning Policy Guidance note 3 (Housing) states that all Local Planning Authorities should undertake urban housing capacity studies, coordinated by the Regional Planning Body. The studies should provide information about vacant land and properties in each authority's area. Detailed good practice guidance on capacity studies is provided in the PPG3 companion guide ''Tapping the Potential''. The last capacity assessment for all the Boroughs in London was supervised by the London Planning Advisory Committee and published by the GLA in September 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".388W.11/2">PPG3 also requires authorities to promote mixed and balanced communities both through their plans and in deciding individual planning applications. This includes securing an appropriate mix of dwelling size, type, and affordability.</p>

	<p pid=".390W.2/1">The total Government expenditure on research into individual diseases, including cancer and different types of cancer, is not normally specifically allocated in advance. Expenditure is related to many variables, such as the quality of research proposals received and the relevance to National Health Service priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/2">The Government supports health related research through three routes. The Medical Research Council (MRC), which is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, is the main agency through which the Government supports research into the causes and treatment of disease including cancer. Some of the other research councils, especially the biotechnology and biological sciences research council, also fund relevant research.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/3">The Department and its equivalents in the devolved administrations meet the NHS support costs of the research councils' and charities' projects. The Department also funds research into policy development and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. The higher education funding council for England and its equivalents in the devolved administrations fund the university academic base.</p>
	<p pid=".390W.2/4">Access to all these different forms of funding is by various means, with the mechanism depending on the nature and purpose of the research funding stream involved. The Government set up the national cancer research institute (NCRI) in April 2001, in partnership with the charities and the pharmaceutical industry. The NCRI is providing strategic oversight of cancer research across the United Kingdom. This will help to ensure that the nation's total investment in cancer research is directed to best effect.</p>

Professor Richards has been asked to report to Ministers later this autumn.</p>

Friend, the Secretary of State for Health announced on <phrase class="date" code="">2 October</phrase> that we are making available an extra #10 million for specialist palliative care services in 2002&ndash;03. It will be for local health communities, with their voluntary sector partners, to decide how this funding should be deployed in support of the Cancer Plan objectives.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.2/2">The Department has not commissioned any recent surveys to identify and itemise the costs of these independent contractors, which will vary from practice to practice. In negotiating the National Health Service sight test fee, the Department and the representative bodies for optometrists and ophthalmic medical practitioners put forward the factors they consider should be weighed in determining an appropriate fee level. For the Department, these are the state of recruitment, retention and motivation within the general ophthalmic service, together with affordability.</p>

	<p pid=".398W.2/2">The Forrest report, on which the National Health Service breast screening programme was based when it began in 1988, recommend that women aged 50 to 64 should be invited for breast screening. The Forrest report found that, in view of poor response rates, there was insufficient benefit to be gained by actively offering screening to women aged 65 or over. Women aged 65 and over are able to self-refer for breast screening every three years. Women who have participated in the programme are informed of this right at the age of 64.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.2/3">Government funded pilot studies have now shown that extending routine invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 is both feasible and cost-effective. The NHS Cancer Plan gave the commitment that the programme will be extended to women aged 70 by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".398W.2/4">There is little research evidence to show whether population screening in the over 70s is effective in reducing mortality. What little evidence there is suggests that screening in this way may not be effective and could even do more harm than good to some women. However, for some individual women there will always be a clear benefit in screening. Women aged over 70 will be offered free three yearly screening on request, as are women aged 65 and over now.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.0/1">In recent years the Department has supported a number of initiatives taken by professional bodies and other agencies to raise awareness of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. These include an evidence-base briefing for clinicians on the use of stimulant medication (1999) and factsheets for parents, teachers and young people on attention deficit problems and hyperactivity, both produced by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. We have also collaborated with the Department for Education and Skills in issuing guidance for teachers on promoting children's mental health, including attention deficit/hyperactivity, within early years and school settings, in 2001. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), at the suggestion of the Department, undertook an appraisal of the use of the drug methylphenidate for ADHD in children and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including information for patients, in 2000. This guidance was circulated widely among professional groups involved with attention deficit disorders. The Department has also grant-aided the ADHD national alliance, an organisation which helps to co-ordinate voluntary sector activity and development work in this field.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.0/2">In general the content of professional training is a matter for the relevant professional bodies. However the Department's requirements for social work training from September 2003 will include elements covering child development and mental health and communication skills with children.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.6/1">The main Government agency for research into the causes and treatments of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC spent about #5 million in 2000&ndash;01 on hearing research generally, much of which is basic in nature but some of which may well have a bearing on the causes and treatment of tinnitus. Included in this figure is a major investment in the MRC Institute of Hearing Research.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/2">The MRC is independent in its day-to-day research funding decisions, which take account of both health needs and scientific vision and opportunity. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for financial support into any aspect of biomedical research and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. The MRC does not, as a rule, earmark funds for particular topics; research proposals in all areas will compete for the funding available.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.6/3">The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. The Department's research programmes are not funding any projects related to tinnitus, and there are no current plans to commission such work. The Department does, however, provide National Health Service support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that takes place in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.0/1">The Department has received no representations concerning the efficiency of systems to report results from radiotherapy, X-rays and other diagnostic tests using ionising radiation. The use of ionising radiation in healthcare is governed by legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.0/2">The Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-01">1 January 2001</phrase>, require that all exposures to ionising radiation are justified and that a clinical evaluation of each exposure is recorded. A major intention of the legislation is to minimise the inappropriate use of ionising radiation in patients' exposures.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.0/3">The regulations also require that where an employer, such as a trust, believes that a person may have been exposed to a dose of radiation greater than intended, from a repeat diagnostic test or other error, it must report such an incident to the appropriate authority. In England this authority is the Secretary of State's Inspectorate for the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000.</p>

	<p pid=".406W.0/1">The age of each linear accelerator in service in the National Health Service in January 2001 was published at <a href="http://www.canceruk.net">www.canceruk.net</a>. This lists each linear accelerator installed in the NHS along with the dates when each machine was commissioned. This database is expected to be updated in the next few months and will provide comprehensive details of equipment installed since the introduction of the NHS Cancer Plan, including those provided under the new opportunities fund cancer initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.0/2">The criteria for replacement of radiotherapy equipment will take into account age and whether spare parts can still be supplied by the original equipment manufacturer. There is no formal recommended replacement age for linear accelerators within the NHS in England. Older equipment is capable of delivering safe and appropriate treatment to many cancer patients. Careful maintenance can ensure that radiotherapy equipment can remain in service for periods in excess of 11 years and this is reflected in the age of some machines identified in the survey. It is recognised however that equipment older than 11 years may not be capable of providing the latest treatment techniques.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.0/3">Standards regarding maintenance and safety of equipment are high in the United Kingdom and these are met by a combination of local scientific and technical staff and manufacturers providing servicing and quality assurance systems.</p>
	<p pid=".406W.0/4">The Department is aware of the high cost of radiotherapy equipment and has initiated a number of central purchasing initiatives designed to exploit economies of scale. The new opportunities fund, announced in September 1999, funded 42 replacement and 15 additional linear accelerators. The NHS Cancer Plan, published in September 2000, made a commitment for a further 20 replacement and 25 additional linear accelerators to be installed in the NHS by 2004. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the location of these machines in July 2002. Others will be replaced through local means. The 20 replacement machines under the Cancer Plan have been allocated to the 17 trusts identified in the table.</p>
