On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1035W.2/1">Improving the stability of looked-after children's lives, and thus reducing the number of placements which they experience, is one of the Government's key objectives. The Department for Education and Skills has a public service agreement target that, by 2008, 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 years or more will have been in the same placement for at least two years or be placed for adoption. We are working closely with local authorities to ensure that this target can be met: we have issued a range of tools and guidance to help authorities commission placements for children more effectively; we have a programme of work in place to improve the support received by foster carers; we are looking at ways in which to encourage better use of friends and family placements; we are working to reduce unnecessary delays in public law cases; and we have introduced independent reviewing officers to chair individual children's reviews. These all have important contributions to make in securing improved stability for looked after children.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.2/2">Kent Child Protection Committee sent the Department a report on child and public protection issues in Thanet at the end of June. We are currently considering the report carefully and will respond to the Committee in due course. At the same time, we are also considering a national report, commissioned by Ministers last year, on identifying ways of helping local authorities both to reduce their dependence on out-of-authority placements for looked after children, and to improve support for children who are placed out-of-authority.</p>

	<p pid=".1036W.6/1">The major indigenous diseases of UK wheat and barley crops are favoured by wet weather, particularly in spring and summer. With current production systems and cereal varieties, high temperatures and low rainfall reduce the incidence of cereal diseases. Other risks are monitored as part of the UK's surveillance programme for plant quarantine diseases. Generally, these risks are unlikely to increase as a result of high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.3/1">In January 2005, the Government of Ethiopia launched a programme to provide anti-retroviral therapy (ART) free of charge for people living with HIV and AIDS . Under this programme, 200 health care facilities will provide ART free of charge to 41,000 people living with HIV and AIDS by the end of this year; by the end of 2006 it is expected that an additional 100,000 patients will benefit from free ART provided by over 300 health care facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".1044W.2/1">UK support for anti-malarial drugs is through bilateral and multilateral channels&mdash;which includes UN agencies. We do not keep specific data on the volume on value of the anti-malarial drugs that go through these different channels.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.2/2">DFID is a major donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). We have pledged more than &pound;259 million through to 2008. Approximately 31 per cent. of GFATM funds go to malaria&mdash;and 49 per cent. of all GFATM funds are used for drugs and commodities, including anti-malarial treatments. These funds support both government and NGO programmes. The UK has provided &pound;48.5 million to the Roll Back Malaria Partnership since 1998 and we are also a major donor to the World Bank which has recently announced the Booster programme for Malaria Control programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.2/3">Our bilateral programme supports malaria control in two ways. First there are malaria specific programmes&mdash;and some of these provide anti-malarial drugs. Second, national malaria control programmes (and thus anti-malarial drugs) are funded through our broader health sector programmes and poverty reduction budget support.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.2/4">From 1998&ndash;99 to date, UK support at country level to specific malaria programmes was approximately &pound;58 million. In addition we have provided approximately &pound;59 million for projects targeted on malaria and other diseases that impact on malaria control. This funding is part of over &pound;1.5 billion committed by the UK to health programmes since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.2/5">The UK does not have a specific policy on which anti-malarial drugs it funds through its different programmes. We look to developing countries to determine anti-malarial policies appropriate to local resistance patterns and also to the World Health Organisation as the international technical health agency to work with these countries to develop their policies. Recently many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have moved to a policy of recommending Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) as first line treatment for malaria.</p>

	<p pid=".1045W.5/2">The UK very much hopes to ratify the UNCAC by the end of this year. Ratification now depends on Orders in Council.

Orders in Council are also required under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 and should be introduced by December 2005.

These issues have been formally raised in the High Level Group of senior stakeholders which we established to monitor the implementation of the 2003 Act and identify actions to help ensure a smooth transition. As a result of discussions at the High Level Group, I recently wrote to all chief executives of local authorities to express the Group's hope that authorities would look favourably at using or amending existing plans and, where necessary, be as flexible as possible about allowing alternative scales.</p>

His work will assess the effects of potential new infrastructure such as a North-South high speed line. At this very early stage, what technology might be appropriate is yet to be decided. Affordability, value for money and deliverability will be key considerations.</p>

	<p pid=".1058W.5/1">The Government are determined to improve the UK's payment culture. That is why we introduced legislation giving suppliers a statutory right to claim interest on late paid bills. The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 provides a useful tool for companies suffering from late payment to use 'if they wish' to claim compensation and interest on late debts. The legislation sets a default period of 30 days if there is no other agreed credit period. The default period does not constitute a statutory credit period and therefore its strict application cannot be enforced.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/2">The interest rate, at 8 per cent. over the Bank of England base lending, rate is the highest in Europe for late payment legislation. In comparison the EC directive on late payment sets a rate of 7 per cent. over the ECB rate. The legislation also allows for a compensation amount up to &pound;100 to be claimed in addition to the interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/3">In a recent survey the Credit Management Research Centre of Leeds university found that overall, 62 per cent. of firms reported that they do specify their rights to customers under the late payment legislation and that 75 per cent. of large firms are more likely to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1058W.5/4">The Government want more companies to agree credit terms and define payment periods up front, using the legislation as a backup measure to their normal trading relationship.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.3/1">In 1999 most banks and building societies had agreements with a subset of other banks and building societies from which their customers could obtain free ATM withdrawals. If customers used any other ATMs they would be charged by their bank or building society. There were no independently owned LINK ATMs as only banks and building societies were able to access the LINK network directly.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.3/2">Since 1999, virtually all UK banks and building societies have made a commitment to offer their ATMs free of charge to customers of other UK banks and building societies. There are now over 30,000 free ATMs in the UK. In 2000 LINK was opened up to independent ATM operators. Some of the ATMs deployed by these operators charge for ATM withdrawals. The majority of these charging ATMs are in new locations where previously there was no cash machine. In October 2002 LINK figures show that there were 10,066 charging ATMs in the UK and in October 2004 there were 19,659. However, less than 4 per cent. of withdrawals are made at charging cash machines.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.3/3">The Government have responded to the Treasury Committee's recent report on Cash Machine Charges (Treasury Committee's Fifth Report of Session 2004&ndash;05) and the Treasury Committee is expected to publish the response shortly, once it has been re-appointed following the General Election. The Government's response sets out policy on the issue in more detail.</p>

	<p pid=".1062W.5/2">The National Criminal Intelligence Service has previously published estimates of the amounts of heroin and cocaine smuggled into the UK annually. It is likely that imports of heroin and cocaine during the period you refer to fell within the range of these estimates: 25&ndash;35 tonnes of heroin and 35&ndash;45 tonnes of cocaine. No similar estimates have been produced for cannabis imports.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.5/3">Reports on the prevalence of the use of illegal drugs during this period suggests that, since 1998, quantities of heroin imported have probably remained broadly stable and amounts of cocaine imported have increased.</p>

	<p pid=".1062W.8/1">The methodologies used to estimate the amounts of illegal drugs imported do not currently enable us to identify year on year changes.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.8/2">The National Criminal Intelligence Service has previously published estimates of the amounts of heroin and cocaine smuggled into the UK annually. It is likely that imports of heroin and cocaine during the period you refer to fell within the range of these estimates: 25&ndash;35 tonnes of heroin and 35&ndash;45 tonnes of cocaine. No similar estimates have been produced for cannabis imports.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.8/3">Reports on the prevalence of the use of illegal drugs during this period suggests that, since 1998, quantities of heroin imported have probably remained broadly stable and amounts of cocaine imported have increased.</p>
	<p pid=".1062W.8/4">In the case of cannabis, research into the UK cannabis market suggests that levels of imports have remained broadly stable or even declined as cultivation within the UK has increased.</p>

	<p pid=".1066W.0/1">The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) is an independent body that adjudicates consumer complaints against FSA authorized firms. It does not have a fixed set of criteria to use when determining whether a financial advisor has mis-sold a product. Rather, the FOS considers what is fair and reasonable to all parties, having regard to the individual circumstances of the case, the law, and any regulatory rules or advice in place at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.0/2">The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is the statutory compensation fund of last resort, which can provide compensation to eligible claimants where the investment firm responsible for the liability is itself unable to do so (usually because it has ceased to exist or is insolvent). With mortgage endowment claims, as with other mis-selling claims, FSCS looks to see whether there has been a breach of obligations giving rise to a civil liability for actual financial loss.</p>

	<p pid=".1066W.9/4" class="indent">The attached table shows the estimates you have requested.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.9/5" class="indent">The most reliable source of public sector employment estimate&mdash;using the National Accounts definition of the public sector&mdash;is based on returns made to ONS by public sector organisations. The first two columns of the attached table show figures from this source for the number and proportion of people employed in the public sector in the UK respectively for the period 1996 to 2004. These estimates were published previously in a web-based report in March 2005 entitled Public Sector Employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.9/6" class="indent">A disaggregration of public sector employment by region is currently only available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) households on the basis of respondents' own self-classification of whether they work in the public sector. However this produces an overestimate of the proportion of total employment which is in the public sector as seen by comparing the second and third columns. Nevertheless if this degree of overestimation is similar in each region the regional differences shown in the table are meaningful. The third to sixteenth columns of the table show the UK and regional figures for the proportion of public sector employment from 1996 to 2004 on this basis. ONS has work in hand to improve the public/private sector classification of employment in the LFS. Data from the LFS, as with any statistical sample survey, is subject to sampling variability.</p>

	<p pid=".1077W.8/1">From the Department's perspective, the Royal United Services Institute 5th Annual Future Combat Vehicle Conference was extremely successful since it enabled us to engage with a wide audience of allies and industry, including the major defence contractors and many small and medium enterprises. Through presentations by the Chief of the General Staff, Capability Manager (Battlespace Manoeuvre) and the Director of Equipment Capability (Ground Manoeuvre), we were able to set out our thinking on future armoured vehicle requirements, particularly in the context of Medium Weight Capability, and explain the position, challenges and future plans for our current programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".1091W.6/1">There are three early release schemes: the Home Detention Curfew Scheme, the Early Removal Scheme for foreign national prisoners subject to deportation and parole for prisoners serving a determinate sentence of four years and over. There are no plans to abolish the Home Detention Curfew Scheme or the Early Removal Scheme. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, offenders are sentenced according to the risk they present to the public. Sexual and violent offenders who present a significant risk will receive an extended sentence, under which the entire custodial period set by the court may be spent in prison if the Parole Board believes it is necessary: or an inter-determinate sentence, under which the offender must spend a minimum period of time in prison, and can be kept in prison indefinitely if the Parole Board believes it is necessary. Other offenders, who do not present this risk, are released on licence halfway through the sentence. Offenders must now remain on licence until the end of sentence, under reforms brought in under the Act.</p>

	<p pid=".1092W.6/2">Under the current law the provisions governing claims for trespass against the person mean that a claim for child abuse must be brought within six years of the date on which the cause of action arose, although this period will not start to run until the child reaches the age of majority. Under the proposals in the Law Commission's 2001 report &quot;Limitation of Actions&quot;, a claim in relation to child abuse would have to be brought within a period of three years from the date on which a claimant knew (or ought reasonably to have known) the facts giving rise to the cause of action, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. The court would have a discretion to disapply this limitation period if it considered that it would be unjust not to allow the claim to proceed. In July 2002, the Government announced their acceptance in principle of the Law Commission's recommendations subject to further consideration of certain aspects. Legislation will be introduced to implement those recommendations which are accepted when an opportunity arises.</p>

	<p pid=".1094W.5/2">Parenting is strongly relevant to juvenile antisocial and criminal behaviour and can be associated with increased risk or it can be a factor which protects children and young people from being involved in such behaviour. There is evidence, however, particularly from the United States, that parenting interventions which include the improvement of parenting skills can be effective in reducing antisocial and criminal behaviour. An independent evaluation of the Youth Justice Board's parenting programme published in 2002 found that most parents valued the parenting programmes they had undertaken and wished they had received such support earlier. The study observed a reduction in offending but the lack of a comparison group meant that this could not be attributed to parenting programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.5/3">Youth Offending Teams have adapted programmes underpinned by evidence of effectiveness and some have developed their own programmes based on such evidence. Since 2002 the Youth Justice Board has introduced an effective practice quality assurance review process as part of a management system to improve the quality and volume of parenting interventions being delivered by Youth Offending Teams.</p>

	<p pid=".1098W.2/1">The importance of physical education in prisons is well recognised. All prisons are required to deliver PE that meets the need of the regime, supports the delivery of education and vocational training, contributes to the resettlement of prisoners and delivers programmes that have been specifically developed to support offending behaviour interventions. The percentage, balance and contents that each PE programme contains will depend upon national and local needs. In 2004&ndash;05 some 7.9 million hours of PE were delivered within prisons in the public sector. The total number of hours achieved in contracted establishments is not centrally held, although all prisoners in contracted prisons are offered the opportunity to undertake PE on a frequent basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1098W.2/2">The importance of team games is well recognised and each prisons PE programme should include a range of team sports that are delivered in line with the respective sports governing body guidelines. A wide range of governing body coaching and performance awards are delivered across the prison estate to encourage participation in team sports. In addition each prison should have a nominated Community Sport Liaison Officer. Part of their role is to encourage participation, where this is appropriate, in local sports leagues.</p>

	<p pid=".1105W.11/1">The National Probation Service business plan for 2005&ndash;06 makes clear the priority to be attached to meeting the needs of the courts. The importance of delivering good quality court reports on time had already been made clear in two probation circulars issued in the second half of 2004&ndash;05 and it will remain a priority for the service in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.11/2">The 2005&ndash;06 business plan requires probation chief officers to ensure that good liaison arrangements exist with sentencers and court staff so that any difficulties in relation to the provision of reports can be identified and tackled. At the end of March 2005 there were 818 National Probation Service staff allocated to court duties.</p>

	<p pid=".1107W.5/1">Local probation boards have a statutory duty to work with victims of sexual or violent offences where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. Victims are provided with a single point of contact with the Probation Service, through Victim Liaison Officers (VLOs), from whom they can receive information and make representations about key stages in an offender's sentence, such as temporary leave and release on licence.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/2">When an offender is being considered for release on temporary licence, a prison governor will seek information from the supervising probation officer about appropriate licence conditions. The probation officer, having consulted the VLO, may recommend that there be conditions not to contact the victim or not to enter a specified area where the victim resides.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/3">Prior to the offender's conditional release, the supervising probation officer, having taken into account the victim's representations, may recommend that conditions be imposed forbidding contact with the victim, members of the victim's family or other named individuals, or may prevent the offender entering a specified geographical area.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/4">During the period of the licence, the VLO will maintain contact with victims and their families. If, after offenders have been released, victims have concerns about offenders breaching conditions not to contact them or entering an exclusion zone, they should inform the VLO. The VLO will, in turn, notify the offender's supervising officer of this breach and the offender may either be warned about his/her behaviour or recalled to custody.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/5">The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), introduced in April 2001, play an important role in assessing and managing the risk of harm an offender presents to a specific person, such as a victim of his/her previous offending. A VLO will liaise with the MAPPA Responsible Authority, which in turn has a duty of care to existing victims, and should take all reasonable steps to protect people from being re-victimised.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/6">Once statutory supervision of an offender ends, the conditions put in place to protect victims will no longer apply. Where, however, an offender is regarded as posing a risk of harm to an individual, such as a victim of a previous offence, MAPPA may recommend that the police continue to monitor that offender.</p>
	<p pid=".1107W.5/7">The probation VLO should also provide victims with information about voluntary organisations, such as Victim Support, which may offer support once statutory supervision of the offender comes to an end.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1120W.8/1">The Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will give assistance not compensation to people whose defined benefit occupational pension schemes started to wind up underfunded, with insolvent employers, before the start of the Pension Protection Fund. The aim is not to replace all members' losses, but to give significant help to those most seriously affected, and the Government believe that its commitment of &pound;400 million of public funds over 20 years is an appropriate provision for that. The &pound;400 million figure reflects information available, at the time of the original announcement on FAS in May 2004, about the extent of relevant pension scheme failures. It also reflects a judgment on what it was reasonable to provide from public funds.</p>

Following the publication in February 2004 of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems, we advised all primary care trusts (PCTs) to offer a minimum of one cycle of IVF by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria, giving priority to couples with no children living with them, and to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid=".1146W.3/1">Of the 100 responses received, about one third were supportive of the proposal, one third opposed and one third were not opposed but raised issues. This was the position put to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which also had access to the full responses when giving its advice. The consultation raised no issues not already considered by the CSM when their advice to consult on making simvastatin 10 milligrammes (mg) available over the counter was formulated. An error in the summary placed on the website following the announcement of the decision to allow simvastatin 10 mg to be sold in pharmacies had no bearing on the robustness of the deliberations of the CSM.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.3/2">Responses received to the consultation on the proposed reclassification of simvastatin as an over-the-counter medicine have been made available electronically or summarised on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) website at:</p>

	<p pid=".1146W.6/1">In 2003&ndash;04, the United Kingdom health departments provided &pound;400,000 funding to Cancer Research UK to run the &quot;SunSmart&quot; sun awareness campaign from 2003&ndash;04 for an initial three year period. The campaign aims to raise awareness of skin cancer, the symptoms to look out for and the simple steps on how to prevent it. Posters and information cards have been distributed to health professionals, all general practitioners' surgeries and schools, to reach as many people as possible with the five point &quot;SunSmart&quot; message:</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/2" class="indent">Stay in the shade between 11.00 am. and 3 pm.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/3" class="indent">Make sure you never burn</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/4" class="indent">Always cover up</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/5" class="indent">Remember to take extra care with children</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/6" class="indent">Then use factor 15+ sunscreen</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/7">&quot;SunSmart&quot; encourages people to protect themselves in the sun, thereby reducing their risk of skin cancer. This public education approach using primary care stakeholders has been very successful in Australia, where changes in attitude towards sun exposure and symptom recognition have reduced skin cancer mortality.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/8">The &quot;SunSmart&quot; campaign works primarily through the distribution of materials, public relations and strategy development, underpinned by research to provide an evidence base.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/9">As Cancer Research UK does not use paid advertising in newsletters or papers as a primary communication tool, costs reflect activities such as promotional merchandise, web presence, sun awareness week activities, purchasing of distribution opportunities and conference presence. Estimates of the value of the coverage and reach generated by the campaign in 2004 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/10" class="indent">Number of articles generated: 932</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/11" class="indent">This is an increase of 485 articles&mdash;more than double that generated in 2003</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/12" class="indent">76 per cent. of all United Kingdom adults were reached</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/13" class="indent">The advertising equivalent rate is &pound;6, 687,296</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/14" class="indent">494 million people with an opportunity to see</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/15" class="indent">Reach stayed the same as 2003 at 76 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/16" class="indent">Frequency of message increased from 10.4 to 13.9 per adult</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/17" class="indentitalic">Note:</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/18" class="indent">The above does not include reach of free resource materials, but to print and radio coverage at nil cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1146W.6/19">Costs of materials include components for their development and design, printing, storage and distribution. Other costs relate to staff, including on costs, are shown in the table.</p>
