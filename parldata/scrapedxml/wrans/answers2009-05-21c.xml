The outcomes of these prosecutions could be ascertained only by examining individual case records, which would incur disproportionate cost. More serious assaults on police officers may result in other offences being charged, but the nature of the victim is not sufficiently identified by the CPS records.</p>

	<p pid="c.1490W.2/2">However, the Department recognises that the Disability Discrimination Acts have driven greater improvements to the accessibility of railway stations, both through infrastructure improvements, such as those funded through the Department's &pound;370 million Access for All programme, as well as through improvements in the policies and practices in place for the delivery of rail services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1490W.5/2">The Disability Discrimination Acts have required rail station operators to make reasonable physical alterations at stations since 2004, so that disabled people do not find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to access rail services. What is reasonable is for the Courts, not the Department for Transport, to determine.</p>
	<p pid="c.1490W.5/3">In addition, since 2002 new infrastructure works at stations have been required to follow the standards set out in the Department's code of practice on accessible train and station design for disabled people.

Friend the Foreign Secretary said at the UN on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-11">11 May 2009</phrase>, we are appalled at the recent reports of civilian casualties. The ongoing conflict makes it difficult to be certain of the facts of the present situation, which is compounded by the lack of access for international agencies and the media, so it remains difficult to confirm the exact number of casualties. Estimates vary wildly, depending on the source. We have made clear to the Government of Sri Lanka our concerns over the disturbing reports of the continued use of heavy weapons and civilian casualties. Following the Foreign Secretary's discussions with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-12">12 May 2009</phrase>, they released a joint statement calling for the Government of Sri Lanka to abide by its commitment of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase> to end major combat operations and the use of heavy weapons. They called on all sides to end hostilities immediately and allow for the safe evacuation of the tens of thousands of civilians trapped within the safe zone.</p>

	<p pid="c.1502W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.6/2">The UK is committed to the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, to protect the rights of women and girls in areas suffering conflict, and to incorporate their perspectives in conflict resolution and peacekeeping planning. In Afghanistan, the impact on women is routinely considered as we take forward our military, stabilisation, governance and reconstruction activity. In support of this resolution the UK is funding various programmes to promote women's equal participation in governance and to build awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy makers. This includes two bilateral programmes that address issues of violence against women. The Government contribute &pound;737,000 to the UN Development Fund for Women (UNTFEM)'s Elimination of Violence against Women Special Fund. Through this programme, Government partners and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are being supported to improve protection and assistance to women at risk and victims of violence. The UK is also supporting a five-year Women's Empowerment programme from 2005-10, implemented by the NGO Womankind. This &pound;500,000 initiative focuses on promoting women's equal participation in governance; building awareness of women's rights among civil society and policy makers; and on providing educational, health, community and counselling support for victims of violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.6/3">Despite the challenges, progress has been made:</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.6/4" class="indent">Over a third of children now enrolled in school are girls.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.6/5" class="indent">We have committed over &pound;35 million to support the Afghan government's micro-finance programme, giving women in particular better access to finance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1502W.6/6" class="indent">Following the adoption of a quota system, 27 per cent. of seats in the lower house of the Afghan Parliament are now held by women.</p>

	<p pid="c.1506W.3/1">The UK operates two basic variants of Merlin helicopter; the Merlin Mk1, which entered service in 1999, delivers a variety of maritime roles and the Mk3/3a, which entered service in 2000 (Mk3) and 2008 (Mk3a), is operated in a battlefield support role. Since introduction into service, the Merlin helicopter has proved itself to be a very capable modern operational platform, having already provided excellent support to operations in Iraq and ongoing maritime and anti-piracy operations. We expect to deploy the Merlin to Afghanistan later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1508W.3/2">The pre-Budget report announced the Government's commitment to providing timely, targeted and temporary support to the economy by bringing forward &pound;3 billion of capital spending from 2010-11 into 2008-09 and 2009-10. This additional investment is already supporting a number of industries and employing people across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1508W.3/3">As the update on the capital fiscal stimulus provided at Budget showed, the majority of the public sector capital projects being brought forward involve construction activity. It is therefore expected that the bulk of the resulting employment impact will be in the construction sector. There are no centrally-prescribed rules for how the additional jobs will be allocated: the Departments concerned are responsible for determining how the funding is most effectively spent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1508W.3/4">As set out at Budget 2009, the total announced policy support for the UK economy is expected to protect up to half a million jobs through the fiscal stimulus, together with MPC decisions to cut the Bank of England interest rate and quantitative easing.</p>

	<p pid="c.1510W.2/1">The 2008 pre-Budget report announced the Government's commitment to providing timely, targeted and temporary support to the economy by bringing forward &pound;3 billion of capital spending from 2010-11 into 2008-09 and 2009-10.

	<p pid="c.1516W.2/1">Overpayments will be written off where there has been a mistake by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the customer has met all their responsibilities, or where the practicality of collecting overpayments does not provide value for money for the taxpayer. On this last set of grounds, HMRC currently intends to write off &pound;230-240 million of debt for the tax year 2003-04 to date. This will be reflected in the Department's Annual Accounts, which are published annually. A breakdown by tax year is not currently available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1520W.2/1">The Government are doing all they can to help those who become unemployed to get back into work as quickly as possible. Although the claimant count is rising that does not mean people are not also moving off benefit&mdash;in April, 290,900 people flowed off unemployment benefits. Most people leave jobseeker's allowance quickly: over half of new claims last less than three months and around three quarters last less than six months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1520W.2/2">In November we invested an extra &pound;1.3 billion to ensure that through Jobcentre Plus we continue to provide personal help and advice to everyone who needs it&mdash;help in finding a job, filling in job applications and in writing CVs and advice on re-training and skills. In the Budget we committed a further &pound;1.7 billion to support Jobcentre Plus and providers so that everyone can continue to receive high quality support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1520W.2/3">Furthermore, on April 6 we introduced new support for newly unemployed customers who require support to update their job search skills. The new support will be available to customers following their initial interview at Jobcentre Plus, and can be tailored for those who have recently left a professional or executive job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1520W.2/4">In addition, also from April, we have increased funding to the Adviser Discretion Fund (ADF), making it available from day 1 to any new customer who has made a successful claim to jobseeker's allowance. The ADF allows personal advisers to make discretionary payments to help jobseekers overcome barriers to applying for jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1520W.2/5">The Government have also increased their engagement and access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies to help unemployed customers find work. People who have been out of work for more than 13 weeks may also get help with paying the interest on their mortgage.</p>

	<p pid="c.1522W.2/2">The Department does not publish an official forecast for claimant unemployment, whether in total or separately for the contributory, income-based and credits-only sections of the caseload.</p>
	<p pid="c.1522W.2/3">The Budget report published HM Treasury's planning assumption for the UK claimant count, which is used for public finance projections. This is based on an average of around 30 forecasts by academic and City institutions, and is audited by the National Audit Office, but does not constitute an official Government forecast. The numbers within this assumption which are assumed to be income-based cases in Great Britain are shown in the following table.</p>

Information regarding Northern Ireland is a matter for the Northern Ireland Office. They are rounded to the nearest thousand claimants, and include the impact of welfare reform measures, which will bring additional claimants onto jobseeker's allowance from other benefits.<br/> 2. The figures for 2009-10 are lower than the total claimant count published by the Office for National Statistics since those figures related to the United Kingdom, and include people who only receive contributory jobseeker's allowance or national insurance credits without any benefit being in payment. Similarly, both figures quoted are lower than the claimant count assumption published in the Budget report.<br/> 3. The figures presented above include 31,000 claimants in 2009-10 and 38,000 claimants in 2010-11 who are also claimants of contributory jobseeker's allowance. These are claimants who receive an income-based top up to their contributory allowance.<br/> 4. These figures are the average number of claimants over the financial years shown.<br/> 5. The figures quoted in the Budget and pre-Budget reports are for seasonally adjusted claimant unemployment in the UK. This is a cautious assumption based on the average of external forecasts and is not the Treasury's economic forecast.<br/> 6.

	<p pid="c.1522W.5/14">These figures are affected by changes in the overall composition of claimant unemployment, which during periods of rising or falling unemployment can dominate any changes in the average length of time that individuals can expect to remain on the count. Recent changes in the median duration of jobseeker's allowance off-flows will have been influenced by increases in claimant unemployment that have mainly reflected higher inflows to jobseeker's allowance. This has had the effect of reducing the median duration of the stock of jobseeker's allowance claimants and of the off-flows from that stock.</p>

	<p pid="c.1524W.0/2">The Code of Conduct is an integral part of the Department for Work and Pensions Commissioning Strategy which was published in February 2008. Although both the Strategy and supporting Code were published by the time Pathways contracts were implemented, the procurement process did not include formal compliance with the Code, as was subsequently the case with the flexible New Deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1524W.0/3">Flexible New Deal will be the first provision commissioned fully under the Commissioning Strategy. Wherever possible, the Department has been working to the standards set out in the Strategy in advance of flexible New Deal implementation. Although the Code of Conduct formally forms part of the flexible New Deal contracts, the principles of the Code apply to all our supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="c.1524W.0/4">Effective working arrangements between prime contractors and their sub-contractors are important to the Department in the delivery of Provider Led Pathways. All providers and their sub-contractors have a routeway for any complaints via the Department for Work Pensions website direct to the supplier inquiry team. We currently do not classify complaints by whether they are from providers or subcontractors but deal with them on an individual basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1526W.5/2">Prisoners convicted of a criminal offence and given a term of imprisonment do not get benefits. An exception is made in certain cases of housing benefit and council tax benefit where the overall absence will not exceed 13 weeks, on the grounds that loss of the home or falling into arrears of council tax in these circumstances would be an indirect and unjustified consequence of the punishment. Additionally payment of certain War Pensions and Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits is suspended for up to a year and paid on release, the reason being that these particular benefits are paid by way of compensation rather than to meet specific or general needs or to provide a measure of income-maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1526W.5/3">Details of all newly convicted prisoners in England, Scotland and Wales are sent weekly to the Department for Work and Pensions to check if any are receiving benefits or national insurance credits and for the appropriate action to be taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1550W.9/1">We will look closely at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee's recommendations and respond formally in due course. However, it should be remembered that the Licensing Act 2003 has already made it easier for licensed premises to provide live entertainment by removing the need for a separate 'public entertainment licence', with its annual renewal exercise and widely variable fee levels. The Act also introduced a new, light touch system for small temporary events.</p>
	<p pid="c.1550W.9/2">However, we recognise that some stakeholders, including those that gave evidence to the Select Committee, see opportunities for further liberalisation and we will continue to seek ways to reduce burdens as part of our commitment to better regulation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1551W.2/1">As I have previously discussed with the hon. Member, a number of simplification measures we are pursuing in relation to the Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act), such as the minor variation process which is currently before the other House, should benefit circuses which require permissions under the 2003 Act. In addition, I remain committed to looking at possible options for a portable licence for travelling circuses and I will write to the hon. Member very shortly, in response to his previous correspondence, to set out how I think we should progress this matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.1556W.2/1">We are fully committed to ensuring that everyone in the UK can be part of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We aim to do this through cultural events across the country, more opportunities to take part in sport and to be physically active, and a range of volunteering, jobs and skills initiatives as well as business opportunities. The Legacy Action Plan which I published in June last year sets out more details on how we propose to deliver this vision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.2/2">I am also keen for regions to identify what is important to them. At a regional level this work is being taken forward by the Nations and Regions Group (NRG) who are working hard to optimise local benefits of the games. Additionally, the Local Government Association (which is represented on the group) is supporting local authorities across the UK in the lead up to the games.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.2/3">Cllr Stephen Castle, who is the regional representative on NRG, chairs the Nations and Regions East (NRE) Board. This board has representation from each of the six county areas in the East of England and each county has a 2012 working group. In Essex a strategic board has been set up and is supported and led by Essex county council. The board is chaired by Gary Sullivan, also chair of the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership. The board has the full involvement and representation from both Thurrock and Southend unitary authorities and provides relevant and appropriate activity to maximise the benefits from 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.2/4">In March 2009 I was delighted to award Essex county council a Beacon Award for its work on Olympic and Paralympic Legacy. This award recognised the council's excellent efforts to use the opportunity of hosting the games to encourage local communities to be more active.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.2/5">Furthermore, East of England will be experiencing first hand the excitement of the games as Hadleigh Farm in Essex will be hosting the mountain biking competition.</p>

Regular reports, received from the Commission for Rural Communities and Regional Development Agencies, continue to suggest that the impacts on rural areas are very similar to those in urban areas and, when compared to urban areas, the emerging picture in rural England is of lower risk, higher resilience and higher recovery prospects.</p>

However, the Commission confirmed in its December 2008 Green Paper on biowaste management that anaerobic digestion may be classified as recycling when digestate is used on land for the production of growing media. The UK's response to the Green Paper asked the Commission to clarify whether all biowaste from households consigned to anaerobic digestion may be classified as recycling, where part of the output is biogas from which energy is recovered.</p>

However, the effect on the overall provision of welfare beds will depend upon the decisions made by the providers of the remaining homes about the number of welfare beds they wish to provide, taking into account likely demand from local authorities. DCSF is working closely with the YJB and the providers of the homes to monitor future developments and the YJB has made funding available to support those homes who lost contracts to help them develop sustainable provision of welfare beds.</p>

School governing bodies and proprietors of independent schools are responsible for ensuring that their establishment has effective policies and procedures in place to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in accordance with guidance issued under sections 157 and 175 of the Education Act 2002. Guidance in Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education 2007 makes clear that a senior member of the school's leadership team should be designated to take lead responsibility for dealing with child protection issues. In some schools it may be necessary to have more than one designated person, and in all schools a deputy should be available to act in the designated person's absence.</p>

The Sexual Offences Act 2003 significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual exploitation. This makes direct comparisons with previous legislation very difficult. Many new offences created by the Act will not have a direct equivalent under the old legislation.</p>

Offenders who committed such offences before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> will have been sentenced under previous legislation and do not appear in the table: therefore the increased numbers over the years reflect the transition to the new legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1577W.2/3">The proportion of those given various disposals is shown as a percentage of those sentenced. Lags in time between conviction and sentencing may mean that the total numbers convicted and sentenced in a year may not match. Data held by the Ministry of Justice records the age of the offender at the time of sentencing, the figure's show all offenders aged over 21 and over at that point.</p>

	<p pid="c.1586W.3/1">When a young person is remanded or sentenced to custody by the courts, the Youth Justice Board (YJB) places him or her in the most appropriate accommodation, taking account of a number of factors including his or her age, sex and any known vulnerabilities such as mental health problems or drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.1586W.3/2">More-vulnerable young people are normally placed in secure children's homes or secure training centres, but young offender institutions are able to care for some young people identified as vulnerable. For example, the Keppel Unit at Wetherby young offender institution is a special unit providing 48 places for more-vulnerable 15 and 16-year-old boys.</p>
	<p pid="c.1586W.3/3">Placement decisions are based on information provided in the young person's ASSET form. The information asked for is not available in the form requested. Vulnerability includes a wide range of possible factors and it would be necessary for the Youth Justice Board to search through each young person's record; that would be a large exercise, involving disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1587W.0/2">Any proposals regarding use of custody for young people under 18 who offend would be considered in the light of the Government's overall approach to youth justice, which focuses on prevention; reducing offending and reoffending; and public safety, with custody available as a last resort where no other option is realistic. It would also be necessary to look at the capacity of the under-18 secure estate and the likely future demand for places in it.</p>

They have provided a list of the main specialty of consultants for each episode, not just paediatricians.<br/> <i> Consultant Main Specialty</i><br/> This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Care is needed when analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &quot;acute&quot;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br/> A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> * The following ICD-10 codes have been used:<br/> Q20&mdash;Congenital malformations of cardiac chambers and connections<br/> Q21&mdash;Congenital malformations of cardiac septa<br/> Q22&mdash;Congenital malformations of pulmonary and tricuspid valves<br/> Q23&mdash;Congenital malformations of aortic and mitral valves<br/> Q24&mdash;Other congenital malformations of heart<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.1598W.8/1">Antiviral drugs are effective so long as they are administered within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Currently, patients showing symptoms of swine influenza who contact their local general practitioner (GP) or call NHS Direct are prescribed antivirals from stocks held at local Health Protection Agency (HPA) health protection units. National health service organisations have arrangements in place to handle collection of antivirals from the HPA and to ensure patients can readily collect them. The algorithm for diagnosing swine influenza and rapidly accessing and prescribing antiviral drugs where appropriate has been sent to all GPs and is also in use by NHS Direct.</p>
	<p pid="c.1598W.8/2">We have provided detailed guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the setting up of the antiviral collection points which will be used by 'Flu Friends' on behalf of symptomatic individuals. All PCTs have received an initial supply of antiviral drugs. PCTs and strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been identifying the number and location of antiviral collection points that would be appropriate to their local health economy. PCTs and SHAs are reviewing existing plans to enable an immediate local response if required.</p>
	<p pid="c.1598W.8/3">An essential element of the mitigation phase will be a system for ordering and distributing antivirals. The 'Flu Line' is a groundbreaking system and the first of its kind in the world. It will be able to assess people via either the internet or telephone, co-ordinate the distribution of antivirals and feed back to local health services. The 'Flu Line' will be ready for the autumn and will have been thoroughly tested so that staff, patients and the public can have full confidence in its efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1598W.8/4">In the event of a need to distribute antivirals more quickly, an interim service is being put in place to supplement the assessment and authorisation processes. This system is being thoroughly tested and we expect the online aspect of it to be fully operational as soon as it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1598W.8/5">In the present containment phase, antivirals are being provided as post-exposure prophylaxis to the close contacts of confirmed cases. We will keep this under review as the situation develops.</p>

	<p pid="c.1599W.2/1">The &quot;National framework for responding to an influenza pandemic&quot; sets out the potential impact of a pandemic on the United Kingdom and makes it clear that flexible strategies will be needed in deciding how best we respond, irrespective of where the virus actually originates. A copy of the framework has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1599W.2/2">There continues to be on-going collaboration between Department of Health and Department for International Development (DFID) officials. Last year both Departments worked closely in producing the first cross-government &quot;UK international preparedness strategy&quot; for pandemic influenza (a copy of which has been placed in the Library). One of its objectives is to support detection and surveillance activity in countries at risk so that accurate reporting data can be provided and, where feasible, humanitarian assistance can be provided. Officials of both Departments are working closely together to now take this forward, including on-going engagement with the Pandemic Influenza Contingency team in the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1599W.2/3">At a series of international conferences since 2006, the UK has pledged to date &pound;37 million to help improve preparedness for avian and pandemic flu. The World Health Organization has set up an emergency fund for the current swine flu outbreak and DFID has announced a donation of &pound;5 million towards this.</p>

The agreements could provide enough vaccine to protect the most vulnerable groups in our population before a pandemic is likely to arrive. In the event of a pandemic, the Advanced Purchase Agreements previously signed with Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline will be activated; these will enable the United Kingdom to purchase enough vaccine to cover 100 per cent. of the UK population.</p>

	<p pid="c.1603W.5/1">From <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>, no one should wait more than 18 weeks from the time they are referred by their general practitioner to the start of their consultant-led treatment unless it is clinically appropriate to do so or they choose to wait longer. Key to this is clear communication between the patient and the hospital at all stages of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1603W.5/2">As set out in the published 18 weeks rules, a patient's 18-week waiting time clock can only be paused when a patient, who will be admitted for treatment, decides in discussion with their clinician to delay when they have their treatment. This might be for personal or social reasons, for example, to fit around work commitments or school holidays, or perhaps attend an important family event such as a wedding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1603W.5/3">National health service performance against the 18 weeks waiting time standard is measured against the published minimum operational standards of 90 per cent. for admitted patients and 95 per cent. for non-admitted patients. The tolerances of 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively allow for patients who choose to wait longer than 18 weeks or where this is clinically appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1604W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-14">14 May</phrase> the Government announced the signing of agreements with vaccine manufacturers for up to 90 million doses of a pre-pandemic vaccine based on the current H1N1 strain. The agreements could provide enough vaccine to protect the most vulnerable groups in our population before a pandemic is likely to arrive. In the event of a pandemic, the Advanced Purchase Agreements (APAs) previously signed with Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will be activated; these will enable the United Kingdom to purchase enough vaccine to cover 100 per cent. of the UK population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1604W.0/2">The plans for the implementation of a mass vaccination strategy are set out in guidance published by the Department for primary care trusts (PCTs) in December 2008. A copy has been placed in the Library. It sets out the key national responsibilities of the Department and the arrangements needed to be put in place to administer vaccinations through local national health service organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1604W.0/3">The guidance referred to above assumes that the vaccination will be delivered at PCT level through general practitioner surgeries or mass vaccination centres. The currently identified groups for pandemic influenza vaccination include: frontline health and social care workers, children under 16, older people and those clinically at risk. Persons eligible within those groups may include overseas visitors and illegal migrants. However, the priority groups will be reviewed in light of emerging evidence on the virulence and severity of the new virus in different groups.</p>
