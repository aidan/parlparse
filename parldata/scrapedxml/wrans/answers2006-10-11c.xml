<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-11c.84134.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-11c.741W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="741W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061011/text/61011w0001.htm#06101336007903">
	<p pid="c.741W.6/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government's (DCLG) principal areas of responsibility regarding planning issues relating to casinos are planning legislation, planning policy, development plans and planning applications. We are working with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to ensure that the licensing and planning regimes, though separate, work well together.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/2">The Department has recently been responsible for introducing changes in secondary legislation to tighten the controls in relation to changes of use of existing premises. Prior to April 2006, casinos were classified as part of Class D2: &quot;Assembly and Leisure&quot;. This meant that any use within Class D2 could undergo a change of use to a casino and would not be considered as development, and would not therefore need planning permission. In April 2006, we amended the regulations for casinos, removing them from class D2 of the &quot;Use Classes Order&quot;, so that planning permission is needed for changes of use to a casino.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/3">The Department also has lead responsibility for developing national planning policy. Relevant policy statements include Planning Policy Statement 6 &quot;Planning for Town Centres&quot; and Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: &quot;Transport&quot;, and the two joint DCMS/DCLG policy statements of August 2003 and June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/4">In relation to development plans, Regional Planning Bodies in developing draft revisions to Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) will need to consider possible broad locations for a regional casino within their region, taking into account national planning policy. Following a statutory process of consideration of the draft RSS proposals, the final RSS is issued and approved by the Secretary of State, except in London where the Mayor is responsible for preparing and publishing the London Plan, subject to reserve powers of direction by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/5">The identification of specific sites for casinos will be for local planning authorities in their local development frameworks, having regard to national policy and the Regional Spatial Strategy. The Secretary of State has reserve powers to direct changes to be made to local development frameworks.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/6">Local planning authorities are also responsible for deciding planning applications for casino developments, unless the application is called in for decision by the Secretary of State. Such a decision would be made in the light of the Government's policy on calling in planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.741W.6/7">The advice that DCLG gave DCMS, on the development, location and potential economic impact of regional casinos is reflected in the Government's national policy statement on casinos announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>. This statement sets out DCLG's policy on regeneration associated with regional casino development.</p>

	<p pid="c.743W.3/1">The Government's policy on altering Green Belt boundaries remains as set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 2 (PPG2), Green Belts. PPG2 explains that once the general extent of a Green Belt has been approved, it should be altered only in exceptional circumstances. If such an alteration is proposed, the Secretary of State will wish to be satisfied that all opportunities for development within the urban areas contained by and beyond the Green Belt have been considered. Similarly, detailed Green Belt boundaries defined in local development plan documents or earlier approved development plans, should be altered only exceptionally.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/2">Any proposals to alter the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt must be brought forward through the London Plan or, for Green Belt land outside London, the Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) for the South East and East of England.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/3">There are no current proposals to alter the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt in London or the South East Region.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/4">In the East of England, the Government are currently considering the report of the independent Panel which recently held an Examination In Public into a draft RSS produced by the Regional Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/5">The Panel recommends that the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt in Hertfordshire and Essex is appropriate and should be maintained. However it recommends that strategic reviews of Green Belt boundaries are needed at certain locations to ensure that development needs during the period to 2021 and thereafter are provided at the most sustainable locations. These reviews would remove only a very small proportion of the total area currently designated as Green Belt. The Panel also recommend that reviews consider the potential for compensating extensions to the Green Belt. The implication is that areas proposed to be added to the Green Belt would be larger than the sum of areas removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/6">The Government intend to publish for consultation Proposed Changes to the East of England RSS towards the end of 2006, taking account of the Panel's recommendations and earlier representations on the draft RSS.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/7">The detailed boundaries of any areas to be removed from the Green Belt are matters for local planning authorities as part of the preparation of local development documents.</p>
	<p pid="c.743W.3/8">There are no plans to alter the status of the Metropolitan Green Belt.</p>

	<p pid="c.748W.5/1">Healthy&mdash;'functional'&mdash;families create and sustain an environment that promotes emotional and physical health and psychological well-being for their members. The idea of 'dysfunctional' families refers to a broad and complex range of different circumstances and processes which interfere with healthy family functioning. Because of this complex interplay between different factors, it is not possible to produce one simple statistical 'measure' of the number of dysfunctional families. Equally, there is no simple measure of the number of lone-parent families who might be categorised as 'dysfunctional'.</p>
	<p pid="c.748W.5/2">What is clear from research is that, while being a member of a lone-parent family often brings additional challenges such as greater likelihood of living in poverty, many lone parents are able to function very effectively and to bring up their children to be happy, healthy and productive members of society.</p>

	<p pid="c.753W.6/1">The Department has not produced a formal definition for each production type listed. In principle, it is for the poultry keeper to identify the production type applicable to the birds on their premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/2">However, in the case of those production types applicable to shooting, the ordinary meaning of the terms used may be taken as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/3" class="indent">1. Breeding for shooting&mdash;production system where cock and hen birds are accommodated in captivity, generally either in groups (pheasants) or in pairs (partridges), for the purpose of egg production.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/4" class="indent">2. Rearing for shooting&mdash;production system where chicks are reared in captivity, either indoor in permanent buildings or in outdoor enclosed pens. The birds may be sold on to a number of other premises for releasing for shooting, or gamekeepers may rear their own birds and release them for shooting on the same premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/5" class="indent">3. Releasing for shooting&mdash;system where birds are held in large pens for a period of acclimatisation ranging from a few days to a few weeks before release.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/6">For all production types, the poultry keeper is required to state when the premises is usually stocked during the year and is instructed not to include any bird in more than one category.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/7">There are a number of factors involved in the difference between the number of birds identified as being reared for shooting and the number released for shooting. It is estimated that approximately 50 per cent. of birds are reared on recognised game farms and subsequently sold on to a number of shoots. These game farm premises would fall into definition (2) above. The remaining birds are either reared and released by gamekeepers on their own premises, so falling into definition (2) above, or purchased and brought onto the shoot premises for a short captive period of acclimatisation prior to release for shooting, so falling into definition (3). There may be premises practising a combination of the above, for example, rearing a certain number of birds and also purchasing birds for release.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/8">Despite an instruction not to include any bird in more than one category for the purposes of the Great Britain Poultry Register, a number of keepers 'double-counted' by including the same birds in more than one production type. This error has now been rectified.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/9">Another form of double-counting has occurred where the same birds have been registered by the game farm at rearing, and by the shoot following purchase. This has produced an overestimate in total bird numbers.</p>

I will arrange for officials to place a copy of the FCO response in the Library of the House and to also send a copy to my hon. Friend. The plan focuses on improving the diversity of our work force in senior and middle management. The percentage of women in the Senior Management Structure (SMS) in April 2005 was 14.9 per cent. (69 officers). This percentage has been rising steadily but is still very low. This reflects historical practices and having started from a very low base. The 2008 target of 25 per cent. would represent an additional 26 officers out of a reduced SMS of 382 in 2008. This is an ambitious and stretching target but one the FCO is committed to meeting.</p>

UK funding has so far helped to provide healthcare, food, water and sanitation. We have committed over &pound;1.5 million to clear spent and unexploded munitions.

We continue to support the Transitional Federal Institutions, which represent the internationally recognised process for restoring peace, stability and good governance to Somalia. We welcome the fact that the Union of Islamic Courts and the Transitional Federal Institutions have engaged in dialogue in Khartoum under the auspices of the League of Arab States. We urge both sides to honour the commitments they have given in Khartoum and to continue the search for a workable agreement between them. Stability will only be attainable through a political solution to Somalia's governance.</p>

	<p pid="c.777W.11/2">We have a number of representations about funding provided for the development of sexual health services in genito-urinary (GUM) clinics.</p>
	<p pid="c.777W.11/3">It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission services to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations. PCTs and strategic health authorities (SHAs) received funding for implementing the targets in the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier&quot; in their mainstream allocations and we will be monitoring the outcomes through the local delivery plan data lines from this investment. The revenue allocations separately identify funding to support the implementation of Choosing Health. A copy of the White paper is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.777W.11/4">Sexual health is one of the top six priorities for the national health service in 2006-07. In particular, by 2008 everyone should be offered an appointment within 48 hours of contacting a GUM clinic. SHAs have submitted plans to meet this target. This increased priority for sexual health should significantly strengthen the incentive for local investment and service modernisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.778W.2/1">We are not convinced that it is for the Government to tell manufacturers what pack sizes they should produce. Further, any European Union (EU) law implications of such a measure would need to be considered. In any event, standardisation of sizes of packs manufactured in the United Kingdom would not solve the problem of pack size variety, as packs imported from other EU countries could be of any size.</p>
	<p pid="c.778W.2/2">A consultation on simplification of reimbursement arrangements for national health service dispensing contractors was issued last year. This included measures designed to further promote patient pack dispensing such as allowing pharmacists a limited dispensing discretion with regard to the quantity prescribed to be able to dispense a full patient pack on more occasions. We are currently considering responses to this consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.779W.0/1">The Chief Medical Officer's action plan for tuberculosis (TB) was launched in October 2004 and the Department has been developing a toolkit to help the national health service to implement the key points of the action plan through effective commissioning and delivery of services. The toolkit provides models of good practice for laboratory services and surveillance as well as service delivery and is expected to be finished by December 2006. TB services should always follow the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guidelines, published in March 2006, when treating patients. We will be working with the Healthcare Commission to ensure that TB services are monitored. Changes in TB services in the NHS will take time to come into operation and it is too early to assess the impact of the action plan or whether the targets are being achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.782W.5/1">The four photographs meet the requirements set out in the passport guidance leaflet. The heads meet the minimum and maximum size requirements, which state that the measurement from the bottom of the chin to the crown of the head must be no less than 29mm and no more than 34mm. For children aged under 11, the minimum head size requirement is 21mm.</p>
	<p pid="c.782W.5/2">The leaflet stipulates that subjects must have a neutral expression. Photographs showing any facial distortion as a result of grinning or frowning are not acceptable as the facial biometric subsequently captured will be similarly distorted. The photographs depicted all display neutral expressions, but also demonstrate that this means a natural expression rather than an unnaturally sombre one.</p>

	<p pid="c.783W.4/1">Effective implementation of alternative livelihoods programmes in Helmand is dependent on a secure operating environment for partners implementing those programmes. Many of those prospective partners are currently networking in Helmand, due to the perceived risks to their staff. Through its deployment of troops to the province, as part of the NATO engagement in Afghanistan, the UK is looking to create the secure environment which is needed to allow development to happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.4/2">DFID is though, through its &pound;30 million Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme, supporting the Government of Afghanistan to roll out its National Priority Programmes in Helmand province; for example, providing clean water and sanitation, and small loans. We believe that doing this through the Government of Afghanistan provides a more sustainable solution and may help mitigate some of the security risks. We have also seen some impact in Helmand from the work undertaken through the Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund programme, particularly in terms of speciality crops and potential export of those to European markets.</p>

	<p pid="c.783W.7/1">Reproductive health commodity supplies are normally provided as an integral part of broader programmes to promote sexual and reproductive health and prevent HIV. DFID's data-capture systems do not, therefore, allow us specifically to isolate expenditure on them.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/2">However, DFID supports a number of projects which combine reproductive health commodity procurement and distribution whilst encouraging behaviour change and capacity-building. Some current examples include;</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/3" class="indent">&pound;0.5 million for adolescents to access reproductive health services in Nicaragua;</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/4" class="indent">&pound;3.93 million for condoms and hormonal contraceptives in Ethiopia;</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/5" class="indent">&pound;0.462 million for a social marketing programme to maintain family planning services in DRC;</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/6" class="indent">&pound;1.8 million for maintaining access to family planning services for women with HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.7/7">DFID is one of the leading bilateral providers of condoms and other reproductive health commodities to developing countries. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that some 1 billion condoms supplied by donors were used in developing countries in 2001. Nearly half of these were provided by the UK. For the past 10 years DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million of them annually. DFID supports the work of UNFPA and The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), as well as other organisations working to promote reproductive health and family planning, including HIV prevention services. We are currently providing &pound;80 million to UNFPA over four years, and &pound;19.5 million to IPPF between 2004 and 2006.</p>

This means that the database does not contain information on the medical condition of customers starting Pathways in later months; or IB data from the NBD is based on a six-weekly snapshot, which means that some short-term IB claims of less than six weeks never appear on the database. This means that we do not have medical condition information for some customers who have claimed IB for less than six weeks. 8. The National Benefits Database only includes information on a customer's primary medical condition despite the fact that often people will have more than one medical condition.</td> </tr>

However, as an indication of scale the total forecast expenditure for 2006-07 on winter fuel payments is &pound;2,027 million and on free television licences is &pound;482 million.
