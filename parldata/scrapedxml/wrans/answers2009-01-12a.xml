	<p pid="a.14W.5/1">The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is responsible for administering National Curriculum tests. The NAA has provided the following table of marks required in Key Stage 2 English and mathematics tests to achieve Level 4 and 5. NAA uses a range of statistical and judgmental procedures to ensure that the standards of performance required for the award of each level are maintained consistently from year to year. The content of each test changes every year, therefore different numbers of marks may be required in different years to achieve a certain level. Levels are anchored to the National Curriculum so that a level 4 achieved in one year represents the same level of performance as a level 4 achieved in any other year.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.0/1">The Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) steering group was established in March 2008 and had its final meeting in October 2008, at which it signed-off its report and recommendations to Government. Steering group members were reimbursed travelling expenses, but were not paid a fee for participating in the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/2">To inform its consideration of the issues, the steering group commissioned:</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/3" class="indent">Two on-line surveys: one seeking young people's views on the SRE they had received at school; and the other seeking teachers' views on what was preventing more effective delivery of SRE. The young-people survey was supplemented with a residential event with a small group of UK Youth Parliament members to discuss issues in more detail. The administration of the surveys, the analysis of the results and facilitation of the residential event were undertaken by the Sex Education Forum, which was paid &pound;13,625 to carry out this work; and</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/4" class="indent">Two literature reviews: one which reviewed the existing evidence on parents' views on SRE; and one which reviewed the international evidence on the impact of SRE. These reviews were carried out free of charge by Professor Roger Ingham, from the Centre for Sexual Health Research, Department of Psychology, University of Southampton, who was a member of the SRE review steering group.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/5">The total cost of the review was &pound;18,630.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/6">Presentations were made to the steering group, summarising the key findings of the on-line surveys and literature reviews. A copy of each presentation will be placed in the House of Commons Library. In addition, a number of individuals and organisations submitted evidence to an 'SRE Review' e-mail account that was established to allow those who were unable to be accommodated on the steering group itself, to submit views. These submissions were circulated to the SRE review steering group for their consideration. Copies of these submissions will also be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/7">Oona Stannard, Chief Executive of the Catholic Education Service was a member of the SRE Review steering group and was in full agreement with the group's report and recommendations. Other than the SRE Guidance published in 2000, and the non-statutory programmes of study for Personal Well-Being issued in 2007, the Government have not issued guidance to Catholic or other schools on SRE delivery. The resources that schools use to support delivery of their SRE programmes are determined by each individual school.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.0/8">The Government published their response to the report by the SRE review steering group on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October</phrase>. A copy of both the group's report and the Government response are available at:</p>

We have set up a National Advisory Council for children's mental health and psychological well-being to advise us on implementing the recommendations of the independent review of CAMHS report and hold us to account on progress. Services for vulnerable children have been identified as a key priority area for the implementation of the CAMHS review's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.22W.2/5" class="indent">Information on the number of uncleared cases is routinely published in Tables 1 and 2.1 and the Summary and Target sections of the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics, the latest copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library or online at:</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/7" class="indent">Table 1 provides the available information on old scheme cases, by quarter from May 1999, information prior to this date is not available. Table 2.1 provides the information requested for current and old scheme cases but not including cases cleared clerically, from March 2003 when the current scheme was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/8" class="indent">Under its three year Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency committed to reduce the number of current scheme applications to 90,000 by the end of March 2009. As of September 2008 the Agency had reduced the number of uncleared current scheme cases by 66% from 220,100 cases in March 2006 to 75,700 including cases cleared clerically.</p>

	<p pid="a.26W.2/1">The Department takes very seriously its responsibilities to safeguard personal and other sensitive data. In the last 12 months, a number of major changes have been made in the way that data is handled and stored, especially insofar as items of removable equipment (such as laptop computers and memory sticks) are concerned. Significant improvements have been introduced, including the widespread deployment of encryption.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/2">The information about lost and stolen equipment, given in response to the question referred to, was obtained from centrally maintained records of security incidents. Detail is not available from these central records to indicate the nature of disciplinary action that was taken in individual cases. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost, given that the bulk of these incidents occurred a number of years ago. However, the Department is currently reviewing its disciplinary policies to better reflect the importance which it attaches to the security of valuable assets and information.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/3">Following the Cabinet Office review of Data Handling Procedures in Government, the Department has designated senior staff as Information Asset Owners, who are personally accountable for providing assurance in relation to the information assets within their respective business areas. Additional steps taken to reduce future losses include measures which prevent employees from copying information to removable media, except where this has been encrypted.</p>
	<p pid="a.26W.2/4">Information on the costs of seeking to recover earlier lost or stolen equipment and which of such items had software protection installed is not available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.27W.11/1">DWP treats temporary and permanent employees in the same way. All employees are paid on the basis of an annual salary and not an hourly rate. The appropriate starting salary is determined by grade and employees are normally recruited onto the minimum of their pay band. Progression up the pay band is based upon the annual pay review. It is possible for employees within a grade to be on different rates of pay but this is normally due to factors such as individual length of service or the effects of pay increases following previous promotion.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what steps Jobcentre Plus is taking to assist people recently made redundant back into work. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/4" class="indent">A person who is made redundant and makes a claim to Jobseeker's Allowance is interviewed by one of our Personal Advisers, to explain the help and support available which is then tailored to their individual needs. They are helped to draw up a job plan and Jobseeker's Agreement, which is reviewed fortnightly. Jobseekers can also access job vacancies on our website and our electronic jobpoints, as well as contact our Jobseeker Direct telephone helpline.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/5" class="indent">We have also recently introduced a &quot;Finding your way back to work&quot; leaflet to help people understand what help is available, and a &quot;Jobkit&quot; to help those made redundant in preparing to find a new job.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/6" class="indent">Where a business announces a number of redundancies we provide our Rapid Response Service to support the employer and employees. This can involve a range of support, such as workplace briefings by Jobcentre staff, skills assessments, and advice on how to look for a new job. The budget for this service was doubled this year, from &pound;3m to &pound;6m, and will be doubled again next year to &pound;12m. This will enable us to deal more effectively with situations involving 20 or more redundancies, or where there is a group of smaller redundancies in one locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/7" class="indent">We have also announced that more people who are made redundant will get help through Programme Centres. These provide people with different kinds of help such as help in CV-writing and gaining jobsearch skills. Access to Programme Centres was previously restricted to those furthest from the labour market. Advisers will now have the discretion to allow any customers to access this help as soon as they become unemployed. This will be useful for people who have been in work for a long time and have no recent experience of job hunting.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.2/8" class="indent">We are also extending the successful Local Employment Partnerships to provide help for newly redundant people. Through these, Jobcentre Plus is already working successfully with over 13,000 employers, and has helped over 70,000 people into work.</p>

Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br/> 2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br/> 3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 4. Data are unrounded.<br/> 5. Figures cover only those vacancies advertised through Jobcentre Plus, and so will not capture all available vacancies. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.31W.6/20" class="indent">In common with most large, modern organisations the great majority of our services are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have more than half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. We remain the largest office network in Government with 747 modern Jobcentres which are supported by 31 contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

This exercise will be completed by early 2009. As an immediate measure, I have decided to suspend proposed further Jobcentre closures while the current economic uncertainties exist, which will allow us to increase our capacity to deliver services to those in need of help.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.0/2">Actively seeking work means that a person must carry out a reasonable number of activities, normally a minimum of three, every week in trying to secure work. At the beginning of a claim and at regular intervals thereafter, the customer will discuss with their adviser what employment they are looking for. They will then be required to actively seek work in whatever way is most appropriate for that type of employment and their individual circumstances. These activities will be agreed by both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.0/3">When considering the reasonableness of the activities, the adviser will take into account the customer's skills, qualifications and abilities, along with any personal limitations they may have. They will also consider how long the customer has been unemployed and the current availability of that work in the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.0/4">Examples of the types of activities a person may engage in are: speculative enquiries with employers; using all means available to locate suitable work, such as Jobseeker Direct, Jobpoints, internet, newspapers and magazines; registering with appropriate recruitment and employment agencies; and applying for all suitable jobs by the most appropriate means. This list is not exhaustive.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many new cases were brought to the Child Support Agency (CSA) in the last 12 months; and in how many of these cases the CSA has started maintenance payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.2/8" class="indent">It should be noted that in July 2008 compulsion to use the Agency was lifted for all new parents with care claiming income based benefits. Prior to this a proportion of new applications received from Jobcentre Plus were in fact change of circumstances to existing cases or are actually closed prior to a maintenance schedule being set up. These applications are included in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.37W.2/9" class="indent">As there can be a delay between the time an application has been assessed, and maintenance requested and the receipt of the first payment of maintenance a larger proportion of applications made in recent months will therefore not yet have started payment. The number of applications resulting in a payment for recent months will therefore increase over time, and these figures will be revised in future versions of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics.</p>

The Government have accepted her recommendations and will be developing the first ever cross government National Strategy for Mental Health and Employment, which will help us improve work outcomes for people with mental health problems across the spectrum.

	<p pid="a.43W.8/1">The proposal to change the allowed length of backdating from 12 months to three months was part of a wider package of pensions measures to increase take up and make benefit processes simpler. Older people will be able to claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in one phone call without having to fill in, sign or return any claim forms. This will benefit thousands of pensioners often put off by complicated claim forms and the fear of large amounts of personal information being required. Over the long-term the package results in extra expenditure for pensioners, rising to &pound;250 million per year by 2050.</p>

Details of the estimated costs and savings associated with the original proposals in the wider package of measures can be found in the SSAC report.</p>

	<p pid="a.47W.5/1">We do not collect information about voluntary work, aside from when it is done as a mandatory part of a New Deal programme, so we are not able to supply the figures requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.5/2">The Government believe that voluntary activity can play an important role in helping unemployed people to keep in touch with the labour market. Voluntary work can also provide benefit recipients with skills and experience that may improve their chances of finding paid employment, and can improve social cohesion. However, there must be a proper balance between allowing benefit recipients to pursue voluntary activity, while at the same time encouraging them to retain a clear focus on moving off welfare into paid employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.47W.5/3">Recent research has looked at volunteering in the context of mandatory options in the New Deals, including &quot;The Longer Term Impact of the New Deal for Young People&quot; (DWP working paper 23, 2008) and changes to benefit rules related to volunteering, &quot;Volunteering and Availability for Work: An evaluation of the change to Jobseeker's Allowance regulations&quot; (DWP working-age research report 190, 2004).</p>

	<p pid="a.48W.2/1">The Government are doing all they can to support people who become unemployed and through Jobcentre Plus and the New Deal we are offering more support to help individuals move back into work as quickly as possible. The pre-Budget report made available to DWP an additional &pound;1.3 billion of funding which will ensure that over the next two years, through Jobcentre Plus and our private and voluntary providers, we not only maintain, but increase, the support we offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.48W.2/2">We have already doubled the resources available to the rapid response teams who offer advice and support to those affected by redundancy. These funds will be doubled again from April 2009. The support provided by these teams can include information about sources of alternative jobs within the labour market or help with applying for existing vacancies; on-site job shops and fairs; helping people draw-up CVs or brush-up their job search skills; and, where appropriate, job-focused training to help individuals develop skills needed within the local labour market or other support to overcome barriers to taking up a specific job offer, such as travel to work expenses.</p>
	<p pid="a.48W.2/3">The Government are also increasing their engagement with employers. Through Local Employment Partnerships, Jobcentre Plus is already working with employers across the country to help them meet their recruitment needs locally, and to help long-term unemployed customers find work. As announced in the pre-Budget report, LEPs will now be extended to cover the newly redundant and the Prime Minister will chair a National Employment Partnership comprising major private and public sector employers who will work with the Government to agree what more employers can do to help tackle rising unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.48W.2/4">The publication of the White Paper 'Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future' on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, CM 7506, also demonstrates the Government's commitment to further reform to reduce welfare dependency and support more people into work. There are still many new job opportunities coming up all the time. Last month Jobcentre Plus took an average of 10,000 new vacancies every working day, with many more coming up through other recruitment channels. Together with the advice and support provided through Jobcentre Plus, this means that most of those who become unemployed can find another job quickly; over half of new claimants leave jobseeker's allowance within three months and around three quarters leave within six months.</p>

These fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.5/4" class="indent">The Rapid Response Service was introduced in April 2002 and has been delivered through Jobcentre Plus in conjunction with a range of partners such as Regional Development Agencies, local authorities and the Learning and Skills Council in England, and equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales, to help employees facing redundancies. As you know the Secretary of State announced recently an extension of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.5/5" class="indent">Employers are made aware of the service in three main ways. First, Jobcentre Plus is informed by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform when employers notify redundancies of 20 or more employees. We contact each of those employers to discuss the range of support that Jobcentre Plus is able, with its partners, to offer employees, and to decide which measures will be helpful. Second, we provide information through channels that employers use regularly, including: the Jobcentre Plus website <a href="http://www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers">www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers</a>, the websites of organisations who help to deliver the Rapid Response Service to employers and a range of leaflets and business/trade media. Third, some employers receive an account management service from Jobcentre Plus in return for their commitment to helping our individual customers to find work. In that context, employers facing difficulties may discuss their needs directly with Jobcentre Plus and appropriate levels of support will be offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.5/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus now aims to contact and offer support to every employer which we learn is making 20 people or more redundant. We also make efforts to identify situations where employers are making fewer than 20 people redundant and to offer Rapid Response Service-style support whenever we consider this likely to be the most effective way of helping the people involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.3/1">Each year, before winter fuel payments are made, the DWP carries out a complex data matching process involving around 18 million records. The aim is to determine or confirm personal circumstances and calculate the payment amount due.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.3/2">The data matching exercise identifies any issues, including those relating to household arrangements. Issues often arise when customers provide incomplete addresses, for example they may omit a flat number. If DWP identify large numbers of people residing at the same address action is taken to try to identify if it is a multiple dwelling address.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.3/3">If a customer contacts the Department because they feel their winter fuel payment is for the wrong amount, the position is checked and the payment corrected if necessary. Out of 12 million payments in 2007-08 less than a quarter of 1 per cent. of individuals received a top up due to incorrect payments.</p>

We are working with the Government Actuaries Department and representatives of the various pension's schemes to establish the details for every member of staff affected by this transfer.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.6/1">We are currently engaged in the most substantial peacetime naval shipbuilding programme since the first world war. This is centred on the Type 45 destroyers, the Astute class submarines and the future aircraft Carriers. Following on from these we will have the future surface combatant and successor class submarine. This programme will provide the capability the Royal Navy needs to remain one of the world's most powerful maritime forces. As the House knows we have announced that the in-service dates of the carriers will be delayed by one to two years allowing closer alignment for the entry into service of the aircraft which will fly from them. HMS Daring, the first of class of the T45 destroyers, is expected to enter service next year with its five successors at a rate of approximately one a year thereafter. The House will also know that there has been some delay to the Astute programme. We are re-baselining the programme and I will make an announcement in due course. The future surface combatant will follow-on from the carriers, but it is far too early to announce an in-service date. The future surface combatant and the successor class submarines are at the very early stages of design.</p>

These are all very important programmes for current operations and the nation's future defence capability. We have been able to do this by re-profiling the carrier build programme without any loss to defence capability. Although the in-service dates of the new carrier have been delayed, of which the House is aware, this has allowed us to more closely align their entry into service with the aircraft which will fly off them.</p>

It provides excellent mobility and firepower and is well adapted for manoeuvring in the Afghan desert. Heavy firepower in Iraq has been effectively delivered by Warrior and Challenger, both of which are well adapted to the Iraqi terrain. No Jackals have therefore been deployed on operations in Iraq.</p>

In very exceptional circumstances service personnel may be retained if their drug use is considered to be uncharacteristic and their retention would be in the interest of the service. In these cases retention is subject to the successful completion of a special programme, which is designed to re-educate and give training in cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>

The Ministry of Defence does not collect on a national basis data on the numbers of homeless veterans. We have however estimated that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population, at least in London, has fallen over the last 10 years. Independent research by the university of York published this year has shown that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population in London in 2007 was about 6 per cent. This is a much lower proportion than in the mid-1990s when separate research reported a figure of 20-25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.0/1">There are currently four voluntary 'Turtlewatch' groups operating on the SBAs. Three groups in the Western Sovereign Base Area (WSBA) and one group in the Eastern Sovereign Base Area (ESBA).</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/2">Of the three WSBA groups, Episkopi patrols and monitors beaches focused around the Episkopi station area, which includes non-military and military controlled land. This group is predominantly led by British ex-pats and consists of 80-100 members with some serving military personnel assisting in their own time. In addition some beaches in the Episkopi area are monitored by Pissouri turtlewatch, and both Pissouri and Episkopi turtlewatch work together in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/3">Akrotiri turtlewatch monitors beaches around the Akrotiri peninsular, which includes military and non-military controlled land. This group has a larger proportion of military personnel contributing and the key co-ordinators are serving. Akrotiri turtlewatch is also working with Glasgow university and up to 12 students assist with monitoring every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/4">In the ESBA there is one turtlewatch group at Dhekelia that monitors the local station beaches. This is co-ordinated by serving military/civilian personnel in their spare time.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/5">Patrols are undertaken by these groups on an almost daily basis on known or potential turtle nesting grounds between May and September to identify turtle tracks and nest sites. Once a nest is located it is protected from stray dogs and foxes by placing a metal cage and tape around the general area of the nest. Around hatching time the nest is observed from a distance and after three days following the first hatch, the nest is excavated to ensure all the hatchlings can escape to the sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/6">The active members of Turtlewatch are licensed by the SBAA's Environment Department to undertake these activities following appropriate training.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.0/7">Since 2007 all data relating to turtle nests, hatches and deaths etc. are collated by the Sovereign Base Area Administration (SBAA Environment Department) for use in developing SBA environmental policy and assessing the impact of foreshore activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence and its Agencies have several hundred computer systems in use ranging from corporate IT systems serving thousands of users across the Department and its Agencies, to business area systems serving smaller communities. The following data covers those systems within the MOD and its Agencies where accreditation is centrally controlled by Defence Security and Standards Assurance (DSSA), which are either connected to the MOD networks, or are stand alone above Secret, or are systems that contain significant value to the MOD e.g. those systems that contain particularly sensitive or personal data. It does not include those systems where authority for accreditation has been delegated e.g. stand alone systems with no onward connectivity, and where a further breakdown of information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.2/2">58 per cent. of systems have been through the accreditation process. Of these, 27 per cent. of systems are classed as fully accredited and are being operated in a manner within the MOD's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)'s risk appetite; 31 per cent. of systems are currently classed as having conditional or interim accreditation with constraints placed on the operation of the system to ensure that identified risks are adequately managed within SIRO's risk appetite.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.2/3">The balance of systems (42 per cent.) are in the process of being accredited; this represents the significant workload undertaken to plan and develop solutions for new equipment systems or platforms; this also includes applications from legacy systems, many of which will be migrated onto the developing Defence Information Infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is committed to improving energy efficiency of the defence estate and the latest performance confirms that the Department is on target to meet, and possibly exceed sustainable operations on the Government estate (SOGE) energy related targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.5/2">The MOD's consolidated, weather corrected performance for 2007-08 relative to 1999 to 2000 levels as reported by the Sustainable Development Commission in December 2008 was:</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.5/11">This significant reduction has been achieved through a combination of estate rationalisation, greater focus and co-ordination of effort to increase energy awareness and the development of effective local initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and improvements in data management. In addition, the MOD continues to identify opportunities to further reduce energy consumption for example, investing in our infrastructure to improve building energy management and efficiency, installing more energy efficient lighting, automated metering and making available funding for energy efficiency/carbon reduction projects.</p>

No widespread DU contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel has been found in these surveys.

	<p pid="a.104W.6/3">We have reviewed the Fleet Tanker element of the MARS programme and have concluded that there is scope for considering alterative approaches to its procurement. We expect to determine a way forward in 2009, after which the main investment decision will be taken. The later classes of MARS ship, Fleet Solid Support and Joint Sea Based Logistic, are at an earlier stage of their procurement than the Fleet Tankers. It is, therefore, too early to determine when their main investment decisions will be taken.</p>

Support costs are currently being examined. When it comes into service, the MRA4 will carry Stingray torpedoes but through life it can be adapted to carry an extensive range of weapons and equipment including anti-ship and anti-submarine weapon systems.

	<p pid="a.108W.9/1">Removal of waste arising from the UK nuclear weapons test programme on the island of Kiritimati was undertaken between 2005 and 2008. Previous survey work had identified elevated levels of radioactivity associated with the presence of radium-226, commonly used to luminise vehicle instruments at the time of the test programme, but no other elevated levels of radioactivity substances were identified during the 2005 and 2008 programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.9/2">The materials (including non-radioactive) comprised approximately:</p>
	<table>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.108W.9/13">A total of 111 individual locations were identified where elevated levels of radioactivity associated with radium-226 were present. Removal of the radium required both the actual instrument and a small quantity of soil to be taken from the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.9/14">The highest radioactive material fell into the low level waste category.</p>
	<p pid="a.108W.9/15">All of the sites were extremely localised with radium-226 restricted to an area of no more than a few square metres.</p>

	<p pid="a.109W.8/1">The information requested is not held. I can confirm that in preparation for Operation TELIC in 2003 large numbers of Reservists were called out, some at very short notice. This was because the rapidly developing situation in Iraq at that time required us to act quickly and we were not able to give as much notice to Reservists as we would have wished. Since then, the mobilisation process now ensures that Reserve units receive advance notice that they will be required to provide individuals to support a specific operation (this can be up to six months notice). More importantly, once Reservists have been selected for mobilisation, we have tried to ensure that, whenever possible, a minimum notice of 28 days is given to the individual and his employer before the Reservist reports for duty. In many cases it is far more than 28 days. However, it must be accepted that the nature of military operations means that inevitably individuals may receive less notice of mobilisation due to rapidly changing requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.3/1">The Trident II D5 ballistic missile is the delivery system for the UK's nuclear deterrent that is carried by our Vanguard-class submarines. It is an evolutionary development of the Trident IC4 missile that the UK originally planned to procure but was superseded by a decision in 1982 to procure the Trident II D5 missile. As we made clear in the December 2006 White Paper: &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994), we are participating in a programme to extend the life of the Trident II D5 missile until around 2042.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.3/2">With regard to the new class of submarines to replace the Vanguard-class, as we have previously stated, the first of class is forecast to enter service in around 2024. Also, as explained in the December 2006 White Paper, a final decision on the number of submarines that will be procured will be made when we know more about their detailed design. That decision will determine the timetable for entry into service of further submarines.</p>

	<p pid="a.120W.8/1">Warm Front is an ongoing process. We are aware that the Scheme Manager eaga plc, did, with the Department's knowledge, stop allocating work for a five day period between 3 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-09">9 November</phrase> while a new computer upgrade was being implemented. This is now fully operational and work is being allocated an usual.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.8/2">The over seventies scheme in Essex is almost certainly part of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), which commenced in April and operates throughout Great Britain. CERT places an obligation on energy suppliers to meet targets through encouraging households to take up energy efficiency measures. It is at suppliers' discretion how they meet their targets, but they will typically use subsidised offers to promote key measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation, and high-efficiency lights and appliances.</p>
	<p pid="a.120W.8/3">Suppliers must focus 40 per cent. of their activity on a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households, which includes those over 70. All six major household energy suppliers currently offer priority group households free loft insulation (where less than 60mm already exists) and free cavity wall insulation, subject to a survey of the property.</p>

It was necessary to provide the contractor for this facility with a nuclear indemnity but before doing so I am told that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) approached the private nuclear insurance market in 2007 in connection with insurance for nuclear liability claims to courts outside the UK and not party to the Paris and Brussels Convention. It became clear from these discussions that commercial insurers were not prepared to quote on these potential liability claims. This established an insurance industry position in principle, in light of which the NDA and its professional advisors concluded that the position that insurers would take on the specific issue at Sellafield was clear and therefore no additional conversations were required.</p>

	<p pid="a.124W.8/1">The aim of the DTZ study is to provide an initial assessment of the potential economic impacts of proposed Severn Tidal Power schemes, including a Cardiff-Weston barrage, on the regional economies of Wales and the South West of England. In assessing economic impact the study has focused on those sectors that are expected to be most significantly impacted by tidal power development. Where possible, impacts have been quantified in terms of employment and gross value added variances.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.8/2">I plan to consult on the interim findings of the Severn Tidal Power feasibility study early in the new year; the DTZ report will be published at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.134W.2/1">The operating framework for the national health service, which sets out the specific business and financial arrangements for the NHS in any given year, first made specific references to supporting carers in the 2008-09 report. The recently published operating framework for 2009-10 goes further. It requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to work with their local authority partners and publish joint plans on how their combined funding will support breaks for carers, including short breaks, in a personalised way.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/2">&pound;150 million will be included in PCTs allocations over the next two years. &pound;50 million will be provided in 2009-10 and &pound;100 million in 2010-11. This money will support all carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/3">The 2006 White Paper 'Our health, our care, our say' announced the New Deal for Carers. It included Caring with Confidence (CwC)&mdash;a training programme for carers. The first training commenced in August 2008 and distance-training modules will be available from January 2009. It is being run by a consortium led by the Expert Patients Programme and includes the three main carers' organisations (Carers UK, Crossroads and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers) and Partners in Policymaking. &pound;4.4 million per year has been allocated to fund this programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.134W.2/4">The delivery of CwC will be through existing local providers of services&mdash;whether from the third or statutory sectors. Local providers have been invited to become part of this delivery process, through a nationally advertised tendering process; from this work CwC will put in place a national network of local providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.145W.9/1">Health Resource Group version 4 (HRG4) has been designed over a number of years specifically for Payment by Results (PbR), with substantial clinical involvement. The Department is planning for HRG4 to be introduced for payment of tariff from April 2009. The changes underpinning the new tariff have already been extensively discussed and tested with a wide range of stakeholder groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.145W.9/2">The new tariff is currently being 'road tested' by the NHS, the purpose of which is to support early service and financial planning and invite comments on the clarity and comprehensiveness of guidance. The Department is also using the exercise to identify whether the new tariff has any unintended consequences. Following the road testing exercise, the final tariff is expected to be confirmed in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.145W.9/3">The Department has already determined though, that in order to help trusts adjust to the new tariff, the full range of potential changes will not be introduced in 2009-10. Tariffs for accident and emergency services will remain based on the current tariff structure, and although HRG4 has the capability to generate HRGs for procedures in outpatients clinics, there will not be a mandatory tariff for these procedures next year. The full benefits of the new design will be realised gradually, as the quality of underlying activity and cost data improves.</p>
	<p pid="a.145W.9/4">The Department has undertaken an analysis which shows that because funds are directed more accurately to specialised services under HRG4, the number of services requiring specialised service 'top-ups' is reduced from nine to two. The only two services requiring top-ups in 2009-10 are orthopaedics and specialised services for children, and in both cases the level of top-ups is lower than in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.12/2">Holistic health initiatives include the Healthy Schools Programme, the developing Healthy Further Education Programme and the development of a new Child Health Promotion Programme for five to 19-year-olds, as well as the availability of the NHS Teen LifeCheck (a quick quiz-style online questionnaire for 12 to 15-year-olds).</p>

A copy of &quot;The Youth Alcohol Action Plan&quot; is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.147W.12/4">All these activities are aimed at supporting young people throughout England. Each Government office, primary care trust and local authority receives support and guidance from the Department to ensure optimum implementation across their local area. In addition, the Department funded the two-year Teenage Health Demonstration Sites pilot to examine ways of delivering better health information, advice and guidance to young people. Northumberland was one of the four demonstration sites. The evaluation report will be available in the new year, and early results look promising.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.2/2">Private companies selling hearing aids to people with hearing impediments are regulated by the Hearing Aid Council Act 1968, as modified 1989. The Act makes it a statutory requirement that hearing aids may only be sold by a dispenser who is suitably qualified and who is registered with the Hearing Aid Council (HAC)&mdash;which was established by the Act to set standards of professional training, performance and conduct for individuals and companies involved in the assessment of hearing loss and subsequent sale of hearing aids in the private sector.</p>

It is for individual primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide the level of funding they allocate to end of life care services, including hospices, based on assessments of local needs and priorities. The level of funding a hospice receives is a matter for negotiation between the local PCT and the hospice.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.2/2">However, the Department has made available an additional &pound;27 million over three years to be given to hospices as grants. 36 grants were awarded in 2006, 40 more in 2007 and a further 40 in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.157W.5/1">Suppliers have responded to the Invitation To Tender for antiviral medicines to increase the stockpile which was published in the <i> Official Journal</i> in August 2008, and these have now been evaluated. Orders have not yet been placed. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, it is not yet possible to make any announcements on the speed of the stockpile build. I will arrange for a copy of the tender documents to be placed in the Library when public procurement procedures allow.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.5/2">There is ongoing discussion at scientific and policy level of antiviral household prophylaxis. For example, the Department has completed modelling which indicates that this is an effective strategy. We have also sought scientific advice on the issue from the Scientific Advisory Group on Pandemic Influenza (SPI), our external scientific advisory committee. This has concentrated on issues such as the size of the stockpile needed and the strategic approach to prophylaxis when the stockpile contains more than one type of antiviral. We are currently considering the delivery implications of a policy based on household prophylaxis, and the procurement approach to be followed. We are not currently considering other forms of prophylaxis.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.5/3">Experts from the British Thoracic Society, British Infection Society and Health Protection Agency developed Clinical Management Guidelines for patients with pandemic influenza. These include proposals for antibiotics to be used for the treatment of bacterial complications. The guideline suggests antibiotics active against <i> Heamophilus influenzae</i>, <i> Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> the bacteria, which most commonly cause respiratory infections. These include penicillin based products such as co-amoxiclav or a tetracycline such as doxycycline. For those allergic to penicillin, a macrolide such as erythromycin or clarithromycin is recommended. Complications requiring antibiotic therapy would be treated with a cephalosporin such as cefuroxime, which are administered with IV fluids.</p>

	<p pid="a.161W.2/1">My previous answer highlighted the importance of gloves and aprons in supporting good hygiene practices in an influenza pandemic. The quantities and type of gloves and aprons, based on the number and type of patient interactions, are currently being investigated. The large numbers required and the need to ensure availability at point of use strongly favours the creation of a pandemic stockpile (without impacting on the Business As Usual requirement for these products). We are currently considering the most appropriate commercial options for building this stockpile.</p>

In common with other Government Departments the Department applies the Cabinet Office's Baseline Personnel Security Standard. That Standard includes a check on Criminal Record Declaration of 'unspent convictions' by the applicant. The Department's Human Resources division then decide on a case-by-case basis, making a judgment based on that conviction and the post applied for, and considering whether there would be any conflicts of interest in employing that individual.</p>

These declarations are checked by the Department's Security Vetting Team against police records who then make a decision whether to grant security clearance.</p>

A number of proposals have been put forward in consultation issued by the Department and extending the expensive prescription fee to DACs has been raised by respondents and will therefore be considered.

	<p pid="a.178W.6/1">One of Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) objectives is to help to reduce avoidable health inequalities through resource allocation. To achieve this objective, a separate health inequalities formula has been developed which targets funds at the places with the worst health outcomes. This is a more transparent way of contributing towards the reduction in health inequalities through resource allocation, and highlights our commitment to tackling the issue of health inequality.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/2">ACRA could not determine the proportion of allocations to apply the health inequalities formula to and left it to ministerial decision. Ministers decided to apply the formula to 15 per cent. of the allocations, excluding the mental health component of the formula (which already includes an adjustment for unmet need) and HIV/AIDS. This keeps the distribution of funding between the most and least deprived areas in line with the previous formula.</p>

A six-month public engagement process was established this year in order to gather views and comments from stakeholders, service users and members of the public which will help inform next year's Green Paper. In addition, we achieved media coverage both national and regional, and worked with stakeholders to obtain coverage in their communication channels, including newsletters and websites.

	<p pid="a.186W.2/1">The responsibility for delivery of social care and ensuring that social care needs are met rests with local authorities. The Department provides the policy framework to support local authorities in meeting their statutory requirements.</p>

The vision for social care is laid down in &quot;Putting People First&quot;, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library. This document was signed by six Secretaries of State and a range of key stakeholders from local government and partner bodies. The Department is now working with all of these stakeholders to support the delivery of that vision. The Department is investing more than half a billion pounds in developing more personalised care services through the Social Care Reform grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.187W.5/1">The number of agency staff working in social services departments by local authority is not held centrally. The Local Government Association estimated in 2006 that the average percentage of agency staff working in posts for adults within local authority social services departments in England was 5.2 per cent. This was estimated to equate to around 8,800 agency staff covering a range of roles including field social workers but also residential care workers and administrative staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.188W.0/1">In July 2008 the Department published a response to the strategic review of Third Sector Funding and Investment consultation, undertaken between December 2007 and March 2008. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/2">The vision for future funding of the third sector included: investment in strategic partners; support for innovation excellence and service development; promote and support volunteering; and contracting for expertise required at national level. There was strong support for this vision and the principles underpinning this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/3">From the feedback on the proposals we have developed a funding framework that underpins a wider third sector investment programme. The programme will be developed over time as more funding schemes in the Department are brought into the framework. For 2009-10 the third sector investment programme will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/4" class="indent">Innovation Excellence and Service Development Fund - this replaces the Section 64 General Scheme of grants - project funding; and</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/5" class="indent">Strategic Partner Programme - this replaces the Section 64 General scheme of grants-core funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/6">We anticipate that from 2010-11 a new volunteer investment fund, building on the existing Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme, will form part of the Third Sector Investment Programme. Moving forward, policy specific funding schemes and initiatives will be drawn under the banner of the wider programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.0/7">This process will result in transformation of previous piecemeal arrangements for funding the third sector into a strategic portfolio of investments that will more explicitly support delivery of the Department's objectives and priorities supporting a fundamental step change in the Department's funding relationships with third sector organisations.</p>

The WHO recommendation appears to be largely based on the USA Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin B12 published in 2000. The Institute of Occupational Medicine recommendation was based on a review of evidence some of which was not available to COMA in 1991.</p>
