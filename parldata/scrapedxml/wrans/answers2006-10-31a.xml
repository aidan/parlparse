	<p pid="a.256W.5/29">However, as noted in superscript 5 to the table, it is difficult to make comparisons across different periods due to:</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/30" class="indent">Changes to accounting practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/31" class="indent">Changes in functional responsibility leading to transfers of money between the NHS and other Government Departments</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/32">Such changes occur on a regular basis so calculations based on absolutes can quickly become out of date. Also, comparison based on absolutes does not take into account inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/33">Therefore, generally, in NHS publications, real growth in expenditure is quoted rather than changes to absolute expenditure. This is calculated by comparing consecutive year expenditure adjusted into the same currency (to adjust for accounting changes and transfers of function) and deflated by GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.5/34">Across the whole Labour administration, from 1997-98 to 2007-08, the cumulative real terms increase in expenditure will be 95.7 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.257W.3/2">As partner nation for counter narcotics, the UK has supported the Afghan Government in developing and updating their National Drug Control strategy, launched at the London Conference on Afghanistan in January 2006. In developing their strategy, the Afghan Government considered the counter narcotics efforts of regional partners, including Pakistan, as well as countries in the Golden Triangle. With respect to the Golden Triangle, I refer the right hon. Member to the reply I gave him today (UIN 96353). The Afghan Government has also drawn from the experience of Pakistan which achieved drug free status through a balanced strategy focused on development and law enforcement, including eradication where legal livelihoods exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.3/3">There have also been exchanges between the Governments of Afghanistan and Colombia in relation to Colombia's counter narcotics experience, particularly in relation to coca production. This includes a recent visit from Colombian law enforcement officers to assist the Afghan Government develop their counter narcotics law enforcement capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.3/4">The Afghan Government has also considered experiences of licit opium cultivation in India and Turkey. In doing so they have concluded that Afghanistan does not currently possess the necessary central government and law enforcement mechanisms to guard against the diversion of opium into illicit channels. They have therefore ruled out licit cultivation as a means of tackling the illicit trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.258W.2/1">The Department for International Development envisages capacity building support to the African Union (AU) in two main areas over the next 12 months: assistance to the African Union Commission (AUC) to build its own institutional capacity; and support for specific programmes with which the African Union is involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.2/2">On the former, we are working closely with other donors and our support is likely to focus on helping to build the AUC's capacity for effective financial management, procurement and management of human resources. DFID is already providing support on procurement, which has been recognised by the AUC and the European Commission (EC) as a pre-requisite for the disbursal of funds from the EC's own Support Programme to the AUC. DFID is also considering support to help build the capacity of other African Union institutions, including the Pan-African Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.2/3">On the latter, we are considering contributing to two major AU programmes to build African capacity in land policy, and in climate change adaptation. The Land Policy Initiative will be jointly managed by the AU, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA). This Initiative aims to build consensus for land reform among AU member states and Regional Economic Communities and to establish a framework for common actions, partnerships and peer learning. The Climate Information for Development Needs in Africa programme (ClimDev Africa) will be led by the AU and jointly implemented by AfDB and ECA. It aims to strengthen the capacity of AU member states to obtain and use information on climate variability and change for development eg by identifying services to help reduce rural poverty in semi-arid zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.2/4">DFID continues to provide support to the African Union on peace and security issues, working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool. As part of this, the UK Government have just signed an agreement with the AU to provide &pound;300,000 to support the development of the Continental Early Warning System and the Panel of the Wise, to help prevent and mediate conflicts in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.0/2">We have regular discussions with the African Union (AU) Commission on a range of environmental issues. Like many AU member states, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a signatory to international agreements on the protection of wildlife, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which lists the hippopotamus as a species requiring protection under Appendix II.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.0/3">We have urged the DRC Government to do more to control the activities of militia groups who are reportedly killing these hippopotami. My hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Jim Knight, lobbied the Congolese Minister of the Environment on the need to protect vulnerable species when he visited Virunga National Park in September 2005. We will continue to raise with the DRC Government their duty to protect their wildlife.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.3/1">The Government of Iraq, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners estimate there are now more than 1.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Iraq. Many of these people (between 700,000 and 1.1 million) left their homes under the previous regime. The UNHCR report that there are 424,000 newly displaced who have left their homes and communities since the bombing of the Samarra shrine in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/2">The majority of internally displaced persons in Iraq are either living with relatives, friends or extended family, or renting accommodation in other neighbourhoods. However, thousands of displaced without family links or money, are living in public buildings and schools, improvised shelters and Government camps run by the International Federation of the Red Crescent.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/3">UN agencies are delivering food and emergency assistance in central and southern Iraq together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM). Since February, the ICRC has distributed food and emergency relief to 150,000 people. EC member states have recently agreed to give 10 million euros to the UN for the provision of additional shelter and other basic needs for IDPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/4">The UNHCR also estimate that there are up to 1.6 million Iraqis living outside their country, most of them in Jordan (500,000) and Syria (450,000). Some have been outside for a decade or more, but many have moved since 2003. The UN Assistance Mission Iraq is currently conducting an assessment of these people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.3/5">Since 2003, DFID has contributed over &pound;100 million to humanitarian agencies working in Iraq, including &pound;85 million for the UN Humanitarian Appeal and &pound;32 million to the ICRC for emergency humanitarian assistance. This includes &pound;4 million for their 2006 Appeal. In 2004, DFID also provided &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). IRFFI has already spent over $18 million on supporting the return and reintegration of IDPs in Iraq. We are in close touch with UN humanitarian agencies so that we are able to respond quickly where unmet needs are identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.5/2">The majority of our humanitarian funding for Darfur, &pound;49 million, goes through the Common Humanitarian Fund, a pioneering multi-donor mechanism giving the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) the ability to allocate funding to the top humanitarian priorities across the country and respond speedily and effectively to unforeseen needs.

	<p pid="a.260W.5/3">The humanitarian situation in Darfur is of grave concern. As I saw during my recent visit to Sudan, the UN and non-governmental organisations are doing an excellent job, but they are severely stretched by the sheer scale of needs. Many tens of thousands cannot be reached because of banditry and insecurity. That is why in my meeting with President Bashir I urged him to do all he could to stop the fighting, implement fully the terms of the Darfur peace agreement, and accept the deployment of a multinational UN peacekeeping force.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.3/2">The Government's strategy for tackling child poverty is set out in 'Opportunity for all' and the Child Poverty Review, published alongside the 2004 Spending Review White Paper. We plan to complete and publish our review of this strategy later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/3">In 1997 there were 4.2 million children living in poverty and almost 5.5 million people on benefits, three million more than in 1979. Compared with 1979, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 50 per cent., while the number claiming incapacity benefits had more than tripled.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/4">Today we are achieving growth with fairness. Since 1997 incomes have grown strongly for all groups but the poorer two-fifths have seen greater proportional increases in incomes than the better off. As a result of this progress there were 800,000 fewer children living in low income households in 2004-05, after housing costs, than in 1997 and we have lifted two million children out of absolute poverty.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what advice and training on dealing with customers with autistic spectrum disorders is available for employees of Jobcentre Plus and what provision has been made to assist people with autistic spectrum disorder under the Jobcentre Plus Customer Management System. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has two training products for equipping its staff with the skills and knowledge to deal effectively with disabled customers, including autistic spectrum disorders. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/5" class="indent">Working with Customers with a Health Condition and Disability [developed in consultation with external partners, including Mencap and Mind]; and</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/6" class="indent">Skills to Help Customers with a Health Condition and or Disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/7" class="indent">To support their training advisers have a number of templates they can refer to when dealing with customers, the Autistic Spectrum Disorders template provides details about autistic spectrum disorders; the effects they have on individuals, the implications for work and the possible types of support an individual might need in employment. This information was approved by the National Autistic Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/8" class="indent">In addition, all Jobcentre Plus staff have access to information about autistic spectrum disorders through guidance on our Intranet.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/9" class="indent">The Customer Management System (CMS) is part of the Jobcentre Plus modernisation programme. Jobcentre Plus prefers customers to claim benefits by telephone but CMS also supports face-to-face and postal contact.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/10" class="indent">First Contact Officers work in our contact centres, they receive training to help them identify customers who are unable to use the phone and offer them alternative methods of contact. Customers can be represented by a third party (including an appointee) who would provide information on the customer's behalf either by phone, or whilst accompanying the customer to the office for a face-to-face meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.262W.5/11" class="indent">Alternatively, a claim form can be issued. Our Standard Operating Model, including the facility to use clerical claim forms, should be used by all staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.263W.2/5" class="indent">All staff who work directly with customers are provided with training and development to ensure they deal professionally with all customers including those with a mental illness.

	<p pid="a.265W.6/2">The Department received representations from the Confederation of British Industry, Association of British Insurers and Institute of Directors in response to the Government's consultation on the directors' annual Business Review at the beginning of this year. The CBI and IOD did not support the introduction into the review of any additional reporting requirements from the former statutory Operating and Financial Review (schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985), but made no particular comments about contractual and other relationships. The ABI thought that companies should in any case be reporting the matters included in the previous legislation to the extent relevant for an understanding of the company and its capacity to succeed in the creation of shareholder value. The more pressing concern that these organisations raised was in relation to liability in respect of reporting and I subsequently introduced amendments to the Companies Bill to clarify the liability regime. We also received a recent representation from the IOD expressing concern about the timing, intent and effect of the Government's amendment to the Business Review. As I made clear at Report, it remains for the directors' judgment to decide what is material to report. Furthermore, the Bill includes a confidentiality exception in relation information about impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation. I am meeting representatives from the IOD, CBI and other industry organisations this week to discuss their concerns about amendments 821 and 822.</p>

	<p pid="a.267W.4/2">REACH will identify hazards and enable any risks to human health and the environment to be more effectively controlled. This is necessary as there are around 30,000 substances manufactured or imported in quantities above one tonne in the European Union, but we have adequate data on the environmental and health effects of only a small proportion of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/3">However, within this context, one of the key objectives of REACH is a minimisation of animal testing. Where there is no suitable, validated alternative to animal tests, they will be kept to the minimum necessary to provide the information needed for the protection of human health and the environment. Several provisions are included in the Council Common Position to ensure that this is the case. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/4" class="indent">(i) there is an obligation for companies to work together through a system of &quot;one substance, one registration&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/5" class="indent">(ii) all available animal test data must be shared with other companies and tests must not be repeated;</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/6" class="indent">(iii) there is a requirement to use wherever possible alternative sources of information (for example, computer modelling tools or in vitro tests);</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/7" class="indent">(iv) any proposals for testing using animals will be subject to regulatory review by the European Chemicals Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.267W.4/8">Against this background of measures, it is not possible to estimate the number of animal tests that might be necessary as a result of REACH.</p>

	<p pid="a.268W.5/1">Council Directive 96/23/EC requires member states to monitor for the presence of certain substances and residues in food producing animals and animal products. This included antibiotics in milk with effect from January 1998. Commission Decision 97/747/EC stipulated that raw bovine milk should be tested, and sets out other criteria, such as:</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.5/2" class="indent">the number of milk samples to be collected, based on forecast production;</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.5/3" class="indent">the proportion of those samples that must be tested for authorised antimicrobial substances, such as antibiotics; and</p>

	<p pid="a.268W.5/5">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate is the competent authority for the surveillance programme in the UK. Member states are required to send their annual plans for surveillance, containing the above information, to the Commission. Details of the validated analytical methods used in the UK, which in the case of milk screens for a wide range of antibiotics, are also included. The results are also sent to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.5/6">The results of the testing of UK cows' milk are given in table 1. This shows since 1997, in a total of some 18,000 analyses for antibiotics, only 5 samples were found to contain residues of antibiotics above the relevant statutory limit. All of these were of authorised veterinary medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.5/7">The VMD carries out additional testing of dairy products, such as cheese and cream, under its non-statutory surveillance scheme. The results are given in table 2. From a total of some 700 analyses since 1997, only one sample of imported cheese contained a detectable residue.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.5/8">The results of this surveillance have been published on the VMD's Annual Reports on Surveillance from 1998-2000, which can be found at <a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk/publications/annreps/annreps.htm">http://www.vmd.gov.uk/publications/annreps/annreps.htm</a> and from 2001 onwards in the annual reports of the independent Veterinary Residues Committee which can be found at <a href="http://www.vet-residues-committee.gov.uk/">http:/www.vet-residues-committee.gov.uk/</a>.</p>

Defra is providing EST with around &pound;28 million funding in 2006-07 to help support its work of promoting energy efficiency through advertising programmes, advice centres and the endorsement of energy saving products.

The overall campaign theme is &quot;Commit to Save Your 20%&quot;, and Energy Saving Week contributes to this by promoting the idea that ordinary actions make extraordinary things happen. The EST are aiming to highlight that through everyday, &quot;normal&quot; actions, consumers are able to make an enormous difference&mdash;both to help the environment and save themselves money.</p>

	<p pid="a.271W.3/2">The Carbon Trust administers the Enhanced Capital Allowance (EGA) scheme for energy-saving plant and machinery and considers the technical merits of further technology classes for inclusion in the scheme. I understand that the trust has carefully considered an application for the inclusion of thermal mass and night time ventilation technologies. On the details provided to the Carbon Trust it appears that rather than comprising plant and machinery covered by the scheme, the primary components of these technologies are flooring and roofing. However, some equipment which is occasionally used with thermal mass or night time ventilation installation is included in the EGA scheme and can already qualify for the accelerated allowances.</p>

Our current assessment is that, by removing ordinary incandescent light bulbs (GLS bulbs) from the UK market and encouraging sales of the most efficient alternatives, we could avoid approximately one million tonnes of carbon emissions per year by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.2/2">The UK cannot unilaterally ban or prevent the free trade in products such as incandescent light bulbs on the basis of their energy efficiency. However, the Government are pressing the European Commission to make light-bulbs a priority for regulatory action under the recently agreed Eco-Design for Energy Using Products (EUP) framework directive. We are also discussing with retailers and manufacturers how we can remove inefficient lighting products from UK shelves in advance of regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.2/2">The Environment Agency regulates the nuclear sites owned by the Nuclear Decomissioning Authority (NDA). The Environment Agency and the NDA have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), accessible on the NDA website at <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/mou_nda_and_environment_agency.pdf">www.nda.gov.uk/documents/mou_nda_and_environment_agency.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/3">The MOU commits the NDA to:</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/4" class="indent">(a) develop and maintain a constructive working relationship with the Environment Agency and respond positively to criticism and challenge;</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/5" class="indent">(b) engage as appropriate in joint working with the Environment Agency, other nuclear regulators, site licensees/operators and other stakeholders to resolve issues of substance;</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/6" class="indent">(c) do nothing which inhibits the Environment Agency or the other nuclear regulators in the exercise of their statutory powers, functions and duties (including taking enforcement action);</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/7" class="indent">(d) take appropriate action as and when it is made aware of any concerns the Environment Agency might have about the operation of any designated site, installation or facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.2/8">By agreement, and through working in co-operation with Health and Safety Executive, the Environment Agency has exercised regulatory scrutiny over Nirex's arrangements for 'Letters of Compliance' in relation to proposals from nuclear site licensees for radioactive waste treatment, and scrutiny of Nirex's generic performance assessment for a phased geological repository concept which underpins the LoC system. The Environment Agency will continue to scrutinise nuclear site licensees' proposals for conditioning radioactive wastes, together with the underpinning technical work that will now be undertaken by NDA, as recently announced by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="a.281W.12/1">The Government have no intention of seeking to regulate genuine prize competitions under gambling law. However, the Government are also firmly committed to maintaining the longstanding convention that lotteries should only be held for good causes and not for private gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.12/2">The Gambling Act 2005, which will come into force in September 2007, will introduce a new definition of a lottery and a complex lottery.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.12/3">Subsection 14(3) of the new Act provides that: an arrangement is a complex lottery if:</p>

	<p pid="a.281W.12/7" class="indent">(d) the first of those processes relies wholly on chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.281W.12/8">Ultimately only the courts will be able to decide whether or not certain television phone-in quizzes constitute lotteries under the new Act.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-31a.96198.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-10-31a.283W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="283W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/text/61031w0006.htm#06103178001518">
	<p pid="a.283W.5/1">Higher Education Institutions and student unions operate money advice services. Most institutions provide a range of student services for their students, and specifically for those students from poorer backgrounds who need particular help, including advice on managing their finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.5/2">Advice and support on money and debt management is also offered by a wide range of other organisations. For example, as part of the Financial Services Authority's financial capability initiative, Roehampton university have piloted their money doctors scheme helping students to become financially competent, to confront debt and take control of their own finances; and 18 other institutions will be developing the piloted approaches. UNIAID provide tools, including a new student calculator, to develop budgeting skills and increase understanding of finance. Graduates have access to the same debt advisory services as other adults including citizens advice bureaux, the Financial Services Association and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service; the Money Advice Liaison Group; and the Money Advice Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.5/3">It is important to recognise that the student loan debt incurred while at university or college is repaid by the student only after leaving the course and when they are earning &pound;15,000 or more; and then only at a rate of 9 per cent. on earnings above that threshold. The Government are providing more in upfront loan and grant support than ever before, particularly for low income students. Full-time eligible students are now entitled to maintenance grants of up to &pound;2,700, with HE institutions also providing bursaries of typically &pound;1,000. Managing debt has to be seen in that broader context.</p>

	<p pid="a.284W.2/1">The Increased Flexibility for 14 to 16-year-olds Programme (IFP) was introduced in 2002. The aim of the programme was to create enhanced vocational and work-related learning opportunities for 14 to 16-year-olds of all abilities who can benefit most&mdash;this included supporting provision of the GCSEs in vocational subjects. A fifth cohort of students embarked on the programme this September.</p>
	<p pid="a.284W.2/2">The young apprenticeship programme for 14 to 16-year-olds offers pupils the opportunity to pursue, alongside their core curriculum, industry-specific courses of study involving extended work experience. Young apprentices combine the practical application of skills in a vocational context with studying for qualifications that relate to particular occupational sectors. There are currently 5,500 pupils on the young apprenticeship programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.284W.2/3">Apprenticeships are the main programme for young employed people seeking vocational qualifications at Level 2 and Level 3. Other opportunities are also being developed, including a pilot programme that started April this year aimed at encouraging 16 to 18-year-olds in jobs without training to gain a Level 2 qualification, whether academic or vocational.</p>
	<p pid="a.284W.2/4">The first five specialised diplomas will be available from September 2008 and will offer young people a real alternative to traditional learning styles by offering a high quality, innovative blend of general education and applied, work related learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.289W.6/1">The zebra mussel population in Lough Neagh has not yet reached the point where we would expect to see ecological impacts and it is too early to judge what the impact may be over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.6/2">The colonisation of Lough Erne was rapid reaching maximum population levels within four years. It is not possible at this stage to predict exactly how quickly the colonisation in Lough Neagh will progress but it may be slower than in Lough Erne. Lough Neagh has a lower proportion of hard grounds such as rock and gravel, which are the areas initially favoured by zebra mussels, and more of the less suitable sand and mud which may remain zebra mussel free for longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.289W.6/3">As population levels of zebra mussels increase the nature of the lake bottom will change and their filter feeding activity will reduce the amount of algae in the lake increasing water clarity. This will have as yet uncertain implications for fish, birds, water abstraction, navigation and other interests. The Inter-Departmental Zebra Mussel Control Group will continue to work closely with the Lough Neagh Advisory Committee in relation to monitoring the spread of mussels, advising on mitigation measures and keeping the public aware of the issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.9/1">Professional qualifications are sought where they are a pre-requisite for the post in question. Most Cabinet Office recruitment however is based on competence (skills and experience) rather than formal qualifications. Potential recruits are requested to provide details of their formal qualifications when they apply for a Cabinet Office vacancy as part of their background information on educational attainment. Applicants are therefore welcome to detail their International GCSEs. No vacancies in the Department have been specifically advertised requiring GCSEs in English and mathematics in the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.5/2">The Social Exclusion Unit was set up in 1997 on a time-limited basis and was reviewed in 1999. This review was conducted by a small group of key stakeholders from inside and outside Government and chaired by the Head of the Economic and Domestic Secretariat within the Cabinet Office. The review concluded that the Unit had been a success and should continue until at least 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.5/3">In 2004 the SEU carried out a major stocktake of the Government's approach to tackling social exclusion&mdash;published in the report, &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot;.
