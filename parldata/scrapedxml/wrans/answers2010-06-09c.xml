The reductions will be achieved through a range of measures including a recruitment freeze, reduction in discretionary spend, and a freeze on major new IT spending.</p>

Local authorities also have powers under the Noise Act 1996 (as amended) to take enforcement action against night noise emitted between 11pm and 7am from licensed or domestic premises that exceeds the permitted level, which may be in the form of a fixed penalty notice.</p>

	<p pid="c.151W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/2">In England and Wales, under section 8 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, each local authority must appoint an to be electoral registration officer, responsible for maintaining the electoral register in the local authority area. Under the Representation of the People Act 1983, each local authority in the UK must also appoint a returning officer for local elections in that area. Local authority chief executives are often appointed as electoral registration officer and returning officer for their local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/3">Under section 36 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, all expenditure properly incurred by a returning officer in administering local authority elections must be paid by the local authority (in so far as it does not exceed any scale fixed by the local authority).</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/4">In England and Wales, the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides for the duties of a returning officer in respect of the conduct of a UK parliamentary election to be discharged by the electoral registration officer for the constituency as &quot;acting returning officer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/5">The amounts which returning officers receive for the services rendered and expenses incurred in administering UK parliamentary elections are paid from the Consolidated Fund under section 29 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. The overall maximum amount which a returning officer is entitled to recover is set out in the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officer's Charges) Order 2010. This order also sets out the maximum amount a returning officer may recover in respect of specified services and expenses.</p>
	<p pid="c.151W.2/6">The order provides different amounts for when a parliamentary election is conducted on its own, or when a parliamentary general election is taken together with the ordinary day of election of councillors in some constituencies in 2010. The fee which each acting returning officer may receive for his services is set out under column 2 of the table contained in schedule 1 (in the case of a parliamentary election conducted on its own) and schedule 2 (in the case when a parliamentary general election is taken together with the ordinary day of election of councillors in some constituencies in 2010) to the order.</p>

	<p pid="c.166W.8/1">The Government monitors the maritime security situation in areas that present a risk to critical UK trade routes, including the Gulf of Aden. There is a continued risk of pirate attack to those transiting the region, and we are aware of other maritime activity including smuggling and drug trafficking. The threat level in the area increased from the end of 2008 and early 2009 when pirate activity in the Gulf of Aden increased. The Ministry of Defence has conducted maritime security operations in the region since 2001 through the Combined Maritime Force and offers shipping advice to international shipping transiting through the region via the UK Maritime Trade Operation. Moreover, specific North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, EU, and Combined Maritime Force counter piracy operations have been effectively coordinating shipping activity along an internationally recommended transit corridor since mid-2009. As a result of these operations, combined with increased shipping industry adherence to UN endorsed best management practices, the number of successful attacks has significantly reduced with only three on vessels following this guidance since 2008. The Government are concerned, however, by the recent spread of pirate activity into the wider Indian Ocean. The multi-national operations are currently considering options on how best to address this.</p>

	<p pid="c.181W.3/2">If a proposed development raises potential low-flying concerns, MOD will always do everything practical to work with the developers to find mutually acceptable solutions wherever possible. That said, military aircraft do not usually operate in close proximity to wind farms and will always maintain the appropriate minimum separation distance.</p>
	<p pid="c.181W.3/3">Since 2001 the Department has objected to 14 wind farm planning applications on the basis of low-flying concerns, none of which fall within North Carmarthenshire. It is not possible to identify from available records the number of cases where low-flying concerns have been overcome as a result of mitigation discussions.</p>

In pursuit of this, the Electoral Commission recently ran public awareness campaigns in the lead up to the general election to encourage people to register to vote. The campaign was targeted at groups less likely to be on the electoral register, particularly 18 to 24-year-olds and led to more than half a million electoral registration forms being downloaded from the Commission's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.0/3">The campaign included work on social networking websites as well as advertising on television, radio and in the press. The Electoral Commission has also funded other organisations working to increase democratic participation among young people, through its partnership grants programme.

	<p pid="c.186W.8/1">The Government are committed to reducing expenditure on recruitment advertising across the Civil Service. We have implemented a recruitment freeze across the Civil Service, which tightly restricts external recruitment to the Fast Stream, business critical posts and other frontline posts that should save up to &#163;145 million for 2010-11. We have also implemented restrictions on marketing and advertising spend, which includes recruitment campaigns, and are expected to deliver savings in the region of &#163;160 million in 2010-11. These restrictions will take effect immediately across all government departments, agencies and NDPBs.</p>

The West Midlands Joint Strategy and Investment Board (JS&amp;IB) has however requested a meeting to discuss how they can help rebalance the regional economy and I hope to meet them in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.196W.5/2"><i> </i>The information requested is available for tuition fee loans, but not available in the format requested for maintenance loans.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.5/3">European Union (EU) nationals are generally eligible for tuition fee support only, provided that they have been ordinarily resident in the European economic area (EEA) or Switzerland for the three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of their course. EU nationals have been eligible to apply for tuition fee loans since they were introduced in the 2006/07academic year.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.5/4">EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for the three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of their course may also qualify for maintenance loans. Additionally, certain EEA and Swiss migrant workers and specified family members, children of Swiss nationals, and children of Turkish workers in the UK may be eligible for the full support package provided that they satisfy specific residence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.196W.5/5">By June 2009 there were 4,800 EU borrowers who had studied in England who had become liable to repay tuition fee loans. Of those, 600 were considered to be in arrears. The majority of this 600 are borrowers who are known to be overseas, have not provided details of their income, and have therefore been set up with repayment schedules and put into notional arrears in order that the Student Loans Company can commence tracing and possibly legal action where appropriate. This is an essential step in the overseas collection process. This figure does also include those accounts where borrowers have defaulted on their loan repayments.</p>

	<p pid="c.198W.0/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will seek to drive up the skills levels of the workforce by directing public funding where it will bring the clearest benefits. We will also make sure that employers and individuals have the information they need to make the best choices about investing in training. We have begun to rebalance skills provision by redeploying &#163;150 million of Train to Gain funding to create 50,000 high-quality Apprenticeship places, focused on small and medium sized enterprises. We are also taking action to set colleges and training organisations free from excessive bureaucracy and direct state control, to give them the freedom to respond better to local needs.</p>

In excess of &#163;6 million of public funding will be supporting skills training delivered in Hartlepool in 2010-11 covering a diverse range of programmes to meet the needs of individuals and employers, including apprentices. This is supplemented by a range of other Teesside programmes which are accessible to many of those living in Hartlepool.</p>
