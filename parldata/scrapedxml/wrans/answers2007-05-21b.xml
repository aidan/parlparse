	<p pid="b.1027W.3/1">DFID (and formally the Overseas Development Administration) has been providing substantial core funding to Book Aid International (BAI) for over 30 years. In 2004 BAI were made aware that DFID planned for a phased reduction in its support. However to allow BAI time to continue its efforts to diversify its sources of funding, we agreed, exceptionally, to provide further funding amounting to &pound;0.85 million over three years in support of their three-year business plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.3/2">This time-bound grant funding has now come to an end. However, we have in the past few years regularly encouraged BAI to apply for DFID funding that is available to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) through our Civil Society Challenge Fund and Partnership Programme Agreements. While we recognise that there is strong competition among NGOs for the resources available we do hope that BAI will apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.3/3">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said in his reply to the hon. Member for Ludlow on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-05-10.287"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 287-88</phrase>, this Government have doubled the amount of money invested in schools, teachers, books and education generally in areas of Africa where BAI operate. We believe that BAI's knowledge and experience of books provision and library services in Africa after many years of DFID funding will continue to help Governments develop library and information services, and that they will remain an important development partner in the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1028W.5/1">At the core of DFID's mission is a commitment to support developing countries to realise the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Action on child hunger and malnutrition is reflected in the first goal. Much current bilateral and multilateral aid will impact positively on child nutrition, investment in education, primary health care, water and sanitation, job creation, and rural livelihoods. DFID multilateral contributions in 2005-06 which impact positively on child nutrition include contributions to the UN Development Programme (UNDP)&mdash;&pound;52.7 million, UNICEF&mdash;&pound;32.4 million, World Food Programme&mdash;&pound;5 million, and to the Food and Agricultural Organisation&mdash;&pound;4.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1028W.5/2">DFID strongly encourages other donors to fulfil the commitments made at Gleneagles and the UN Millennium summit to provide more aid to achieve the MDGs, including MDG 1 (which includes child hunger and malnutrition).</p>

Recent research indicates that more species of common moths are in decline than are increasing in numbers, probably largely due to changes in land use and the effects of climate change. The roles that moths play in the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity are known to be significant, because moths are generally abundant, and they have important food chain links with plants, bats and birds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1032W.12/3">In order to encourage the greater uptake of anaerobic digestion, I am also pleased that the Environment Agency has agreed to develop a standard for digestate in 2007-08. This will allow modern regulatory principles to be applied to the use of this material and bring certainty to when it is considered to be &quot;fully recovered&quot;. This should help to facilitate the development of markets for digestate.</p>

An Investment Appraisal concluded that a single outsourced model offered the Agency more flexibility to determine the size of future apprentice intake and also offered long term financial savings. Following Management Board approval, my endorsement of the proposal in December 2002, and TU Consultation, an Invitation To Tender (ITT) was, therefore, issued.

	<p pid="b.1063W.11/2">Mobile phone theft is a key driver for robbery. The Government, police and industry have developed a strong partnership which has been working together to tackle escalating mobile phone theft. The Mobile Phone Crime Reduction Charter was launched by industry leaders in July 2006 and successfully achieved its target of blocking stolen handsets within 48 hours, meaning they will no longer work in the UK. The Government and Metropolitan police fund a National Mobile Phone Crime Unit to provide a national centre of excellence and operational support around the country. We have robust legislation in place to target criminals who re-programme stolen handsets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1064W.6/1">Academies are charitable companies limited by guarantee, and are subject to the same regulatory framework as applies to all such organisations and to company law generally. The governors of an academy are also its charitable trustees.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/2">The Charity Commission approves the governing documents of all companies proposed to be registered as charities prior to granting registration, to ensure that any provisions conferring authority on the charity to make a payment to one of the governors&mdash;or a company associated with a governor&mdash;deal with potential conflicts of interest in a transparent manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/3">All academy trusts use the Department's model memorandum and articles of association as a basis for their own, and these include standard conflict of interest provisions recommended by the Charity Commission. These typically require any governor/trustee of the company, who has an interest in a particular contract, to withdraw from discussions and voting in relation to such a contract. In order to comply with these provisions, a sponsor of an academy trust or a sponsor-appointee with an interest in a sponsor company would, for example, be required to withdraw from any meetings at which a discussion took place on the proposed remuneration of either themselves, or a company with which they are associated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/4">Furthermore, charity and company law place an obligation on charitable trustees and governors of academy companies to act at all times in the best interests of the company, and allowing the academy company to contract with another company in the knowledge that this might not be on the best terms available, would obviously be contrary to this obligation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/5">In addition, the general requirements relating to the procurement of goods and services are set out in the Academies Financial Handbook, which the Department issues to all academies. This includes the requirement for probity in procurement, to demonstrate that all parties are dealt with on a fair and equitable basis and to ensure that there is no private gain In particular, the Financial Handbook requires governors, including sponsor governors, to make formal declarations of their interests in external businesses and to withdraw from any discussions regarding potential contracting with that business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/6">In addition to any advice&mdash;or indeed directions&mdash;which the Department may give to academy trusts in relation to the procurement of goods and services, the law also precludes the payment of any charitable trustee unless and to the extent that legal authority for that payment is given in the charity's governing documents, or otherwise granted by a court or the Charity Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/7">Advice and guidance is also provided through the designated Project Lead within the Department and academies must also comply with the Public Contract Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.6/8">The Department cannot waive rules relating to the letting of contracts by academies, and does not keep a record of contracts that each academy enters into. However, academies are obliged by law to lodge their accounts with the Charity Commission and Companies House each year and these records are open to public scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.1067W.0/1">The Department makes use of various methods for monitoring educational performance. Ofsted inspections, national curriculum tests and public examinations provide a framework for national and local analysis of performance against critical learning milestones. They provide measures which allow us to track changes in performance over time nationally, locally and at school level, to compare the progress of children in different schools, and to compare the performance of different groups of pupils. At local level, the National Strategies and Government Offices provide ongoing monitoring and challenge of the performance of local authorities and schools as a basis for supporting them to improve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079W.5/1">New statutory arrangements for school inspections came into effect in September 2005, including a new cycle of inspection. All maintained schools must be inspected under these new arrangements between September 2005 and August 2009 and thereafter within three school years from the end of the school year in which their last inspection took place. Ofsted is on course to meet the first of these requirements. Before September 2005, schools were inspected on a six year cycle.</p>

While there is no specified minimum period between inspections, Ofsted does, for example, seek to avoid scheduling survey visits to schools which have recently had a school inspection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1080W.5/1">We do not currently collect data on the detail of how local authorities spend their extended schools funding. Of the &pound;840 million allocated for extended schools services, &pound;250 million will go direct to schools. The remaining &pound;590 million will be distributed by local authorities who will be able to prioritise the allocation of resources according to local need and their plans for the development of extended services. We would expect local authorities and schools to plan for necessary toilet provision according to the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999. These set out the requirements regarding washrooms in schools.</p>

We are now thoroughly evaluating the financial implications and are working to allocate funding as effectively as possible to ensure the maximum benefit to children and young people. We recognise that forward planning is essential for public services&mdash;this is why we are committed to delivering multi-year budgets&mdash;and are making it a priority to ensure allocations are made as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1089W.6/5" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.6/6" class="indent">You asked what the evidential basis was for the statement made by Ofsted in its report, Time for Change? Personal, Social and Health Education (HMI 070049), that teenage magazines are a positive source of advice for young people, and whom Ofsted consulted before making this statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.6/7" class="indent">In our report we reported the views expressed by young people that their parents were often reluctant to discuss sexual matters; and that some parents were concerned about the suitability of information that young people receive from other sources, such as magazines, even when these could be useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.6/8" class="indent">The report explains that whilst magazines aimed at young men sometimes reinforce sexist attitudes, they can also provide a source of information and advice. Young people told us during the course of 350 inspections that the 'problem pages' in magazines are a positive source of advice and reassurance for many of them. Notably, a large proportion of these magazines now stress the importance of safe sex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.6/9" class="indent">The report also commented that some magazines communicate, inaccurately, the perception that all young people are sexually active. Additionally, difficulties can arise if the messages in these magazines clash with parental and cultural norms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1089W.6/10" class="indent">The report does not quote specific magazines but was intended to refer to a range of magazines suitable for different age groups. Our report was based largely on visits to schools over a three year period, backed by research in the area of teaching and learning PSHE.</p>

	<p pid="b.1092W.0/1">Iran is defying calls by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, made mandatory by the UN Security Council, to suspend all uranium enrichment-related, reprocessing and heavy water-related activities. These activities are of proliferation concern because they would enable Iran to develop the capability to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/2">Iran has produced very small quantities of enriched uranium at its pilot fuel enrichment plant at Natanz and is now installing centrifuges in the Fuel Enrichment Plant. The IAEA reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> that,</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;During meetings in Iran in January 2007, Iran informed the Agency of its plan to....continue progressively with the installation of the 18 cascades of the 3,000-machine hall and to bring them gradually into operation by May 2007&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/4">Most recently, in a letter to the Iranian representative to the IAEA on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April</phrase>, the IAEA reported the information Iran had provided to inspectors that</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Iran has put into operation eight cascades at the Fuel Enrichment Plant in Natanz and that some UF6 is being fed into those cascades&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/6">We now await the Director-General of the IAEA, Mohamed El Baradei's, official report on Iran's compliance with UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747 which will give a further update of Iranian progress at the fuel enrichment plant, which is due on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/7">Enriching uranium is a complex technical process which requires diagnostic testing and the running of multiple cascades over a sustained period. It remains our assessment that Iran has not mastered the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1092W.0/8">We will consider next steps in light of the Director-General's upcoming report on compliance with UNSCR 1747. UNSCRs 1696, 1737 and 1747 make it mandatory that Iran suspends its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities before negotiations aimed at a long-term agreement can commence. We remain committed to a negotiated solution. We continue to urge Iran to take the steps required by the Security Council and IAEA Board, and to return to talks on the basis of the proposals presented to Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June 2006</phrase> by EU High Representative Javier Solana on behalf of the 'E3+3'.</p>

These national reports will be placed in the Library of the House. The UK has one of the best records in the world on implementation of UNSCR 1540 and we work constantly to ensure that all aspects of the resolution are fully implemented, including on proliferation finance. In addition, the standards agreed within the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), of which the UK is a member, help to promote the international legal framework necessary to combat illicit finance of all kinds. In February, G7 Ministers called specifically for the FATF to examine the risks involved in weapons of mass destruction proliferation finance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.12/1">The building regulations and the code for sustainable homes are both key components of the Government's strategy tackling climate change and its effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.12/2">The amendments made in 2006 to Part L of the Building Regulations have, for example, increased the energy performance standards for new buildings by around 40 per cent. compared with pre-2002 levels. We have also recently consulted on making all new homes zero carbon by 2016 through further changes to Part L. These actions, together with the Code for Sustainable Homes and the draft planning policy statement on climate change&mdash;should save between five and seven million tonnes of carbon by 2020. Further details on the Department's climate change policy can be found at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk">www.communities.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.12/3">Building to the standards set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes will help new homes mitigate for many of the effects associated with climate change including possible water shortages, increased rainfall and flooding. Building Regulations already help address many of the impacts of climate change and will be kept under review as necessary to ensure that they continue to do so effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.12/4">We are also working closely with stakeholders on what could be done to further reduce the impact of non-domestic new buildings and existing buildings on climate change.</p>

	<p pid="b.1101W.8/2">Development must normally be started within three years of the granted planning permission and a completion notice cannot be served until this period has expired; a completion notice does not take effect unless and until it is confirmed by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.8/3">Completion notices enable local authorities to seek to ensure that development projects with planning permission are not just started but finished. Local planning authorities also have powers under section 97 and section 102 of the 1990 Act to make an Order revoking planning permission, prior to it being implemented, where they consider it expedient to do so, or to make an order requiring that any use of land shall be discontinued or continued subject to conditions, or that any buildings or works shall be altered or removed. Such orders must usually be confirmed by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.8/4">Difficulties often arise if a developer experiences financial problems in implementing a project, and a completion notice in these circumstances may be of limited practical effect. Much depends on the land ownership position as to whether an uncompleted project is transferred to another developer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1103W.8/4">PPS3 was strongly informed by the work of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission.

	<p pid="b.1113W.5/1">UK Sport is the Government's high performance sports agency, investing both Exchequer and lottery funding to prepare and support our Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes in the years leading up to each Games. It is therefore UK Sport's role to lead the development of high performance sport in this country, and to create the environment in which our sports and athletes can succeed in the build up to London 2012 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.1113W.5/2">Through its &quot;no compromise&quot; approach, resources are targeted at those sports and athletes most likely to succeed and win on the world stage. UK Sport is currently planning to invest an average of &pound;100 million every year through to 2012, supporting around 1,500 athletes in 24 Olympic and 19 Paralympic sports. Their leadership role in terms of athlete preparation also extends to the provision of dedicated support services and the development of specialist areas such as its Elite Coach and Technology and Innovation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1113W.5/3">To succeed in leading sport to world class success, UK Sport works in partnership with the other Home Country Sports Councils and Institutes, as well as the British Olympic Association (BOA) and the British Paralympic Association.</p>
	<p pid="b.1113W.5/4">The role of the BOA is solely focused on delivering success at the Olympic Games (with the British Paralympic Association playing a similar role at the Paralympics). It has the role of preparing Team GB for a unique competitive environment every four years and of maximising the potential of the athletes when they arrive. The BOA is responsible for selecting the athletes that comprise Team GB in conjunction with the governing bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1113W.5/5">The BOA has no role in the preparation of the athletes in the years building up to an Olympic Games, nor does it have any influence over the way in which funding is invested across the sports through UK Sport's World Class Performance Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1113W.5/6">Operationally officials of UK Sport and BOA work together with the National Governing Bodies to ensure that there is a seamless transition between athlete preparation and Games-time preparation. It is vital for the success of our high-performance operations that the work of the two organisations does not cut across or duplicate the other.</p>

Since the Cabinet Office began recording comprehensive waste data in 2002-03, 100 per cent. of waste paper generated is recycled. This is achieved through encouraging Cabinet Office staff to use the recycling facilities provided. In addition, the Cabinet Office materials recovery facility is able to capture and recycle any paper that is placed in general waste bins.</p>

	<p pid="b.1132W.5/1">No. We do not believe that such an assessment would serve any useful purpose at this stage of the project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.5/2">The aim of a privacy impact assessment is to ensure that privacy is considered at every stage of a project involving the handling of information, and that action is taken to mitigate against identified risks to the privacy of individuals. While this is clearly a useful tool for many projects where these matters might otherwise be neglected, the need to safeguard privacy and confidentiality is a necessary deliverable of any health record system, and the management of risk in this area has been a core deliverable of the national health service care records service (the spine project).</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.5/3">The security safeguards around access to patient data held within the new care records will provide an unprecedented level of assurance compared with existing electronic and paper systems. The Department has also produced what we believe is the most comprehensive privacy statement of any public service in the form of the NHS care record guarantee for England, setting out 12 commitments the NHS makes to patients in order to protect their confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.5/4">The Information Commissioner has confirmed that, properly deployed, the new systems have the potential to allow the NHS to better meet the various informational and privacy challenges which it faces than the systems currently in existence, and that he is content with the general approach being taken with the care records service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1135W.8/1">Prospective parents may desire to know the sex of a foetus for a variety of reasons. However, antenatal sexing of the foetus is not a routine part of antenatal care nor has the Department issued any guidance to hospitals on whether or not parents should be told the sex of their baby. The Government recognise that there is concern that the availability of information about the sex of their foetus could lead some women to seek an abortion if the foetus is of a particular sex. However, there is no evidence that this is happening in the United Kingdom. The grounds on which abortion may lawfully be carried out are set out in the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended). These do not include foetal sex alone. Although the Government are aware of companies offering foetal sex identification through genetic tests they have received no recent representations relating to this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.8/2">The availability of tests on samples collected privately also raises important questions of privacy. The Human Tissue Act 2004 makes it an offence to use a person's tissue for DNA analysis without their consent. The Government continue to keep the developing area of genetic tests under review but have no current plans to bring forward further legislation in this area.</p>

The time waited groupings are mutually exclusive. To calculate the total or percentage for e.g. those waiting over three months, the values for 'Over three to six months', 'Over six months to one year' and 'Over one year' should be added together.<br/> 5. A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 6. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br/> 7. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br/> 8. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1138W.5/1">Social care is currently facing a number of major challenges, particularly around demographic change and rising public expectations. As a result, the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report 2006 that the Treasury would be assessing proposals for the future of social care put forward by Derek Wanless for the King's Fund, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and others. The criteria for assessing these proposals are whether they are affordable, whether they are consistent with progressive universalism and whether they promote independence, dignity, well-being and control. The Treasury is currently assessing the proposals and the Department will continue to work with them to take this work forward and consider the strategic direction of social care.</p>

	<p pid="b.1141W.5/1">In 2005-06, the Department for Constitutional Affairs spent &pound;15.6 million&mdash;0.43 per cent. of its budget on consultancy. This included expenditure by its executive agencies as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1141W.5/4"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1141W.5/5"> <td>DCA HQ</td> <td>10.1 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1141W.5/6"> <td>Her Majesty's Courts Service</td> <td>5.0 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1141W.5/7"> <td>Tribunals Service</td> <td>0.4 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1141W.5/8"> <td>Public Guardianship Office</td> <td>53,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1141W.5/11">While details of expenditure on other professional services were held by individual business managers, they were not collected centrally for this period. The Department for Constitutional Affairs bought a range of such services across its many business areas. An exercise to identify and collate such expenditure could be conducted only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1144W.8/1">The latest published figures indicate that there are over 6,200 offender managers in post across the 42 probation areas. The total caseload is over 170,000 in the community with an additional 59,000 in custody. Most offender managers will have a mixed caseload of community and custodial cases. A detailed breakdown cannot be provided without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/2">Caseload sizes vary depending upon the nature of the cases being supervised. An offender manager responsible primarily for complex, high risk cases will have a much smaller caseload than an offender manager primarily responsible for less complex, low risk cases. The range of caseload sizes within a probation area may therefore be a wide one, perhaps from under 20 to over 80.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/3">The number of offender managers appointed is a matter for probation boards to decide from within their overall allocation of resources. Decisions have yet to be made about resource allocations to probation boards for 2008-09 onward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1146W.6/3">Prisoners who are assessed under the Mental Health Act as being too severely mentally ill for prison are transferred to hospital. The Department and Home Office issued joint guidance in October 2005 to mental health trusts and prisons in order to improve this process. In 2006, 961 prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison, were transferred to hospital, 33 per cent. more than in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1146W.6/4">We are also addressing the length of waits for these transfers. A survey taken by the Department for the quarter ending December 2006, showed that 38 prisoners recommended for transfer were waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer to hospital. This situation is improving, as 62 such prisoners were waiting at June 2005 and 44 at June 2006.</p>

In addition HSE and local authority stakeholder engagement and inspection activity highlighted the likely health problems associated with manual handling activities, in particular back problems and the remedies that could reduce them. Looked at over the longer-term, HSE has campaigned around musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), including back pain, for many years and the period 2001-02 to 2005-06 has seen a drop in estimated working days lost to MSDs from 11.8 million to 9.45 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.2/1">The extension to the FAS announced in March means that we will be helping many more members over a greater length of time. Because of the extension the payment assessment rules may need to be revised to help ensure we determine FAS payments consistently for all members. We intend to ensure that the cap retains its value, even where assessments are made for members who will not be eligible for payment until many years into the future. We are looking at the best way to achieve this objective and details will be published in draft regulations for consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.5/1">There are two ASW pension schemes that qualify for the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS). FAS cannot make annual payments at 80 per cent. until the ASW pension schemes have completed the wind up process. In the meantime, initial payments at 60 per cent. of expected core pension are being made to 31 members of the ASW Pension Plan (Cardiff) and three members of the ASW Sheerness Steel Group Pension Fund. The current Pensions Bill will raise the level at which initial payments are made to 80 per cent. with immediate effect from Royal Assent. No payments are being made at the rates of 80 per cent., 65 per cent. and 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.5/2">As FAS payments commence at age 65, (except in special circumstances where early access to payments can be applied for by scheme trustees for terminally ill qualifying members or to the survivor of a qualifying member), under the current scheme no-one would be expected to start receiving payments at the rate of 65 per cent. or 50 per cent. until at least <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-15">15 May 2011</phrase> or <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-15">15 May 2015</phrase> respectively. However our announcement of increased funding for FAS will ensure that by then all will receive 80 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.2/1">Fatal and non-fatal accidents in industries for which the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the enforcing authority, including agriculture, are reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). Records show that one fatal accident involving a worker supplied by a gangmaster was reported in 2005-06. No work-related fatal accident involving a worker supplied by a gangmaster was reported in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/2">RIDDOR does not require employers to record an injured worker's employment status when reporting an accident, so it is extremely difficult to identify injuries to casual and temporary workers supplied by gangmasters from accidents reported to HSE with any degree of accuracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/3">There is no specific evidence of the extent to which gangmasters are moving to unregulated sectors. However, there is clear evidence that some gangmasters supply into several sectors. There is also evidence that gangmasters whose Gangmaster Licensing Authority (GLA) licences have been revoked are still trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/4">The GLA has commissioned work to measure the impact of the licensing arrangements, including impact on the number of gangmasters. The initial results will be published in late 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162W.0/1">The Health and Safety Executive has undertaken a thorough investigation of the fire at Sonae (UK) Ltd. on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February 2007</phrase> and has determined that this fire was caused by the catastrophic failure of either a mechanical seal or an impeller on pump number two in the thermal oil manifold room. This resulted in hot oil being discharged into the manifold room and the oil was ignited when it came into contact with a hot surface, either the handle on one of the pump valves or the impeller casing. Sonae's fire precautions were effective in limiting the consequences of the fire, despite the existence of a previously unknown void between the wall of the manifold room and the external cladding. The damage to the plant control room resulted from smoke and hot gases breaching this void, although such damage was limited to plant and equipment. There was no loss of life or injury.</p>

			<tr pid="b.1163W.0/33"> <td colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br/>  1. Original planned completion date and originally planned completion costs are the date and costs agreed to by the relevant departmental management committee at the time the project or programme passed through Gate zero (or an equivalent process) of the Department's governance procedures. We expect these to change as costs and timelines become clearer through the lifetime of the project. We continually review costs at the appropriate governance points to ensure that they continue to deliver value for money.<br/>  2. The costs above represent the costs of implementing the particular project and programme. Costs of running the solutions implemented by the projects and programmes are not included above as they are more than compensated for by the savings they generate. These savings are demonstrated in the recent NAO report &quot;The Efficiency programme: A Second Review of Progress&quot;.<br/>  3. In addition to the above projects and programmes Electronic Registered Files is undertaking a pilot and a review of this project will be carried out once the pilot is completed.<br/>  4. When first conceived the Pensions Transformation Programme was to be funded by way of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) arrangement. During the early stages of development, best practice for financing the programme indicated that PFI was no longer the appropriate financing method and thus it was decided to use departmental funds. Financing the development using departmental funds has the effect of increasing the development costs of the programme while reducing the operating cost of the programme by a similar amount. Thus the actual amount of money committed to the programme is broadly the same.<br/>  5. The Child Support Agency Operational Improvement Plan is a business recovery programme and is not a change project in the normal sense of the word. The focus of the programme is the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency to deliver significant performance improvements and get more money to parents, it specifically aims to tackle the key area of debt, compliance and enforcement. Over a three year period the programme will design, develop and implement, process and organisational change underpinned by continuing remediation of existing computer systems and the introduction of further IT enhancements.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1168W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of mystery shopper exercises at Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/4" class="indent">Mystery Shopping is an established method, used by thousands of businesses across the UK, to provide an independent assessment of customer service. It is an important way in which Jobcentre Plus assesses the service it provides to customers, but it is not the only approach used. For example, the Average Actual Clearance Times target measures customer service in terms of benefit clearance times and Jobcentre Plus also conducts customer surveys and acts upon feedback received from individuals, partners and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/5" class="indent">The Mystery Shopping programme is one part of the Customer Service Target, which measures performance against the Jobcentre Plus Service Standards. It includes measures of the quality of service provided in key face to face and telephone contacts. The timing of calls to sites is random and can be at any time during business hours so staff do not know when they may be visited or called. Results from the Mystery Shopping Programme are published on the Jobcentre Plus website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/6" class="indent">The effectiveness of the Mystery Shopping Programme is regularly assessed within Jobcentre Plus and with the contracted supplier, GfK. The assessment process includes listening to telephone calls and carrying out a series of six accompanied visits per quarter with the independent assessors. This may result in changes to the wording of particular questions to increase clarity and understanding. In addition, when new programmes are introduced, or in response to customer or stakeholder feedback, new scenarios may be developed to test staff knowledge. As a result of these reviews the number and range of scenarios used by the independent assessors was gradually increased in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/7" class="indent">Results from the mystery shopping programme are used to identify areas for improvement and where further learning and development may be required, either nationally or in particular sites. In the first quarter of 2006/07 national Customer Service Target performance was 1.2 percentage points below profile and, to address this, a number of measures were put in place that had been identified by the Mystery Shopping process. These included the introduction of an A to Z guidance tool which provides information on the policies and programmes that customers (or mystery shoppers) may enquire about, which we expect our staff to understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/8" class="indent">It is still Jobcentre Plus' intention to provide feedback to sites at the earliest opportunity, via the supplier's (GfK) website. Feedback is an important part of mystery shopping as it helps staff and managers to understand where they need to do better in the service they provide dealing with customer enquiries. It enables Business Delivery Unit/District Performance Managers to identify local learning and development needs, or other remedial action, to ensure that the best possible service is maintained for all customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/9" class="indent">For 2007/08 further changes have been introduced to strengthen and improve the &quot;mystery&quot; element by further increasing the number and range of scenarios, varying the way the questions are asked and changing the way feedback is provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1172W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase> I signed this convention on behalf of the United Kingdom at a signature ceremony organised by the United Nations at its New York headquarters. A total of 92 countries, nearly half of all UN member states, have now signed the convention. The objective of the convention is to secure for the estimated 650 million disabled people around the world their human rights on an equal basis with non-disabled people. Our signature of the convention signifies the UK's strong support for human rights at home and abroad and our intention to ratify the convention without undue delay.</p>
