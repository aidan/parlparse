The UK Government will cut waste and has made tough choices in order to put public services and the welfare system on to a sustainable footing, while protecting the most vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="b.176W.7/1">Recommendation 4 of the report of the Speaker's Conference on parliamentary representation recommended that the objectives of the Parliamentary Education Service should in future include encouraging a wider range of people to become candidates for election to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.176W.7/2">The Management Board responded to this recommendation (in HC 449 2009-10) as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.176W.7/3" class="indent">School children visiting Westminster reflect a cross-section of society, and thus represent a powerful opportunity to encourage broader engagement with Parliament. It is not an objective of Parliament's Education Service (or the Parliamentary Outreach service) explicitly to encourage people to stand as candidates, but rather to explain the party system and the representational role in the context of effective engagement with parliamentary processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.176W.7/4">There are no plans to amend the objectives beyond this, but attention is drawn to the high-quality resources available which contribute directly to raising awareness and understanding of the role of Members. &quot;MP For a Week&quot; is an award-winning online game which explores the role of Members and features MPs describing their work. Also now available is a new film &quot;The General Election Explained&quot; which follows the fortunes of prospective candidates in a specific constituency through to the results of the 2010 election. Other activities such as the Youth Parliament are also aimed at improving the understanding and appreciation of the work of Members and thereby encouraging a diverse range of people to consider a future role as a parliamentarian.</p>

	<p pid="b.178W.4/1">By way of a statement it is with great pleasure that I can confirm to the hon. Member that the DCMS has announced as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review, that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will survive beyond March 2011, albeit in the reduced form which was announced as an interim measure on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-07">7 October</phrase>. This is very good news for all those volunteers who look after our churches. This was, in part, the result of representations made to Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Treasury by the Bishop of London, the chair of the Church Buildings Council, and the Church of England Parliamentary Unit and others over the last few months.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.4/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-04">4 January 2010</phrase>, listed places of worship will not be able to recover VAT on professional fees for works and repair works to organs, bells, clocks, and pews, but they will still be able to claim for repairs to their buildings, up to a capped total of just over &#163;12 million in 2011-12, rising to just over &#163;13 million in 2014-15. However, from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-04">4 January</phrase>, the scheme will match up to the full VAT paid out on those items which remain eligible including the increase to 20%.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.4/3">We also note with great disappointment following the Comprehensive Spending Review, that English Heritage's grant from Government will be cut by 32%, considerably more than the DCMS's overall cut of 25%. We have offered to work closely with English Heritage staff to try and ensure that the invaluable support that our churches have received from English Heritage both in the form of technical expertise and grant-aid will be maintained at its current high standard and level.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.4/4">The National Lottery good causes review is welcomed warmly which we hope means that heritage, arts and sport will again each get the share of total proceeds originally set out when the Lottery was created in 1994-20% -amounting to an extra &#163;50 million each every year. The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has given great support to places of worship. Between April 1994 and March 2010, the HLF has awarded &#163;390m to over 3,800 projects supporting over 3,200 individual places of worship. Altogether, HLF has awarded &#163;519 million to 4,300 faith-related projects. We look forward to working with the Heritage Lottery Fund to look at ways that some of this extra money can be used to help those who look after our churches to maintain them and to open them up for the use of the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.4/5">The Big Lottery Fund is launching a new Community Buildings Programme in later autumn 2010. This is building on the very successful Communities Buildings Programme run by the Big Lottery in 2008. The Cathedral and Church Buildings Division of the Church of England has been part of a stakeholders group made up of organisations that have responsibility for community buildings who have been consulted over the last few months on the aims and objectives of the programme as well as the criteria and application process. We have ensured that faith buildings that meet the criteria will be eligible under the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.4/6">The Cathedral and Church Buildings Division is also currently responding to a further DCMS consultation on the change to the direction of the Big Lottery. We welcome the proposal that the Big Lottery Fund should be directed to focus its funding on projects that benefit people and local communities in the voluntary and community sector, exactly the sort of projects that our churches are very experienced at running.</p>

	<p pid="b.187W.9/1">The Department recognises the importance of helping disabled people, including those with visual impairments, to travel on public transport more confidently and independently. We are taking a number of steps to ensure that levels of accessibility continue to improve on public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/2">The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR) as amended require buses to have accessibility facilities such as low floor boarding devices, visual contrast on step edges, handholds and handrails among others. Such improvements on buses are continuing, with all vehicles used on local or scheduled services required to be fully PSVAR compliant by 2015, 2016 or 2017, depending on the type of vehicle. All rail vehicles are required to meet modern standards by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/3">Currently, 62% of buses and 45% of heavy rail comply with the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/4">A large number of stations being funded from the Access for All Programme to make accessibility improvements will continue to have direct benefit to visually impaired passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/5">Audio-visual passenger information systems can be a key source of information to many disabled passengers. Such systems are already available on trains. On buses, however, the levels of provision vary outside London. The Department is therefore undertaking a project to consider ways of increasing the uptake of audio-visual systems. The project is due to report shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/6">We are currently working to improve the accessibility information available to the public; the Transport Direct journey planner enables disabled people and people of reduced mobility to plan their journeys and will do so, for example, during the Olympic games. The Department also continues to work with the Association of Train Operating Companies to improve the Assisted Passenger Reservation Service for queries from disabled people on facilities and booking journey assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/7">For those who are not confident using public transport, the Department champions increased levels of travel training by local authorities, and is aiming to produce a website of good practice by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.187W.9/8">In addition, we are working with industry to ensure that the training of transport staff continues to improve, as they are an obvious first point of contact for disabled people. To further this, we are extending the Certificate for Professional Competence (CPC) for driver training to include a disability module.</p>

	<p pid="b.195W.8/1">People are living longer and healthier lives. Helping them to stay in work longer offers benefits to the economy, businesses and individuals themselves. Extending working life by one effective year could increase GDP by up to 1% (worth &#163;13 billion). A single man who works a year beyond the current state pension age could increase his income in retirement by between 3 and 10%. Our Age Positive initiative is therefore working with business lead organisations to provide employers with guidance on the benefits of employing older workers and offering flexible approaches to work and phased retirement. Many people over 65 still want to work and can provide a valuable contribution by doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.8/2">Additionally, we have consulted jointly with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills on the phasing out of the Default Retirement Age (DRA), which prevents some people from working for longer.

	<p pid="b.196W.5/4">In addition we have announced plans for a universal credit which will merge out-of-work benefits with in-work tax credits and housing benefit into a single system. The universal credit will improve incentives to work, especially for low earners, by a combination of earnings disregards and a single withdrawal rate when earnings exceed the disregard. This will make it easy for people to see that it is always worth going to work. We expect significant numbers of people to move into work as a result.

	<p pid="b.206W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-21">21 October 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/2">The 1997 Krebs report included a large number of recommendations, the vast majority of which have been implemented. The recommendations fall into four categories, and actions taken in each of these categories are summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/3" class="italic"> Research to better understand the causes of herd breakdown</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/4">DEFRA has put in place a wide-ranging portfolio of research to examine this issue. Since 1997, approximately 40 research projects have been funded in this area, the reports of which are available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/5" class="italic"> Work to evaluate the effectiveness of the current available strategies to reduce herd breakdowns</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/6">The main recommendation was implemented through the establishment of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in 1998. This study compared the effectiveness of no culling, proactive and reactive culling policies. DEFRA has also funded over 20 research projects to evaluate available strategies including, as recommended in the Krebs report, examining the effectiveness of proactive husbandry measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/7" class="italic"> Work to develop improved strategies to reduce herd breakdown</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/8">This has involved the development of vaccines to protect badgers and cattle against tuberculosis (TB) and a diagnostic test to distinguish infected from vaccinated cattle. Total investment in vaccine development from 1998 has now reached more than &#163;30 million and includes over 20 research projects. An injectable vaccine for badgers was licensed in March 2010. An oral badger vaccine is at the research stage and may be available from 2015. We aim to have a licensed BCG cattle vaccine and a validated differential diagnostic test by the end of 2012. However, due to the need to change EU legislation before cattle can be vaccinated for TB, we anticipate that a cattle vaccine could not be used in the field before 2015 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/9" class="italic"> Other recommendations</p>
	<p pid="b.206W.9/10">These covered a range of issues and have been implemented through increasing the use of modelling, making more data available to researchers, whenever possible using open competition to select research contractors, working collaboratively with other funders, increasing the spend on TB research from &#163;1.7 million in 1998-99 to &#163;7.9 million in 2010-11 and liaising with the Health Protection Agency in monitoring bovine TB incidence in humans.</p>

	<p pid="b.211W.3/1">Existing EU rules on intra-Community trade in all livestock, including horses, places responsibility on the consigning member state to control disease on its territory and to certify that any consignments for movement to another member state are safe. The rules do not permit extensive or blanket checks carried out by the importing member state. Such measures would be a burdensome restriction on trade, disproportionate to the risk and would fall foul of EU trade rules. The UK is a major beneficiary of the open market and these trade rules facilitate our thriving trade in the movement of livestock and their products. As a further assurance to the importing member states, the rules do allow them to carry out checks for compliance with certification on a proportion of consignments. As such, we currently have in place enhanced post import checks for certain consignments of horses.</p>

	<p pid="b.212W.5/1">Spending on higher level stewardship (HLS) will continue to grow throughout the remainder of the lifetime of the Rural Development Programme for England, and will be 83% higher in 2013-14 than in the current financial year. HLS schemes remain open for applications for agreements which will start from April 2011 or later. Natural England has temporarily suspended approvals of HLS agreements with a start date prior to April 2011 while the impacts of the spending review outcome are being assessed. We hope to confirm the situation shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.6/1">Enforcement of an individual court order is a matter for the independent judiciary. Her Majesty's Courts Service does not collect general statistics on enforcement of orders made in the family courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/2">Enforcement arises most often in cases concerning children and financial arrangements, where a range of enforcement mechanisms already exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/3">In ancillary relief cases, the courts can register the judgment and enforce the amount payable by means of remedies available for debt, for example by attachment of earnings, placing a charge upon property or requiring payment from a person holding money owed to the person in breach of the order.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/4">In cases concerning the payment of child maintenance, various provisions are available to enforce the debt and an application can be made to court for a person who refuses to pay to be sent to prison. The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 strengthened the range of enforcement and debt management powers available to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/5">In relation to child contact, the courts were given wider powers in December 2008 to enforce orders by imposing unpaid work, or awarding financial compensation, where a person breaches a contact order without reasonable excuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/6">The family courts also have an inherent power to treat breach of an order as a contempt of court, with the sanction of a fine or imprisonment, although this is rarely used in family proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/7">The family justice review is currently considering whether there are better alternatives to court in appropriate cases, such as mediation. Mediation can be quicker, cheaper and can help to maintain ongoing parenting relationships, avoiding the need for enforcement action later on.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.15/1">There are currently no plans to undertake a review. The retirement age for magistrates is 70 and is set in statute under section 13 of the Courts Act 2003. This is in line with the retirement age for the vast majority of other judicial offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.15/2">The contribution of magistrates of all ages is invaluable. However, it is important that magistrates reflect the diverse communities they serve. While there has been positive progress on ethnic and gender diversity, 82% of magistrates are 50 or over and the average age is 57. As well as taking magistrates out of step with other judicial offices, increasing the retirement age would reduce the number of available vacancies and thus reduce opportunities for younger people to become magistrates.</p>

However, I recognise the need for numbers of magistrates to be commensurate with workload and we expect advisory committees to take this balance into account as they think about possible future appointments.</p>

	<p pid="b.237W.2/1">At the end of August 2010, a total of 1,501 IAC orders had been imposed since the IAC pilots began in 2008. Of these 1,501 orders, 29.7% (446) have been terminated and the offender re-sentenced. Of those re-sentenced the vast majority, 72% (319), received immediate custodial sentences, with 8% (37) receiving suspended sentences. The remainder have been given or are awaiting another disposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/2">Figures for the number of breaches which result in termination of an IAC order and the re-sentencing of an offender are not collected separately. Therefore the figures above also include offenders who have had their order terminated because they have been sentenced for an additional offence committed prior to or following the start of their IAC order. Some of these offenders will therefore have had their IAC order terminated even though they had complied with its conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/3">Information is not collected centrally on previous court disposals for offenders sentenced to an IAC.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/4">IAC orders are imposed using existing legislation and are subject to the same National Standards as all other community orders. If an offender fails to comply twice without providing acceptable evidence they will be in breach within 10 days and returned to court where their IAC order may be revoked and a custodial sentence imposed. Alternatively the court may make the IAC order more onerous to mark the seriousness of the breach.</p>

	<p pid="b.238W.2/1">The powers for the Attorney-General (and the Solicitor-General) to refer a Crown court sentence to the Court of Appeal on the grounds of undue leniency are working well. It has been the practice of successive Governments to deal with any proposals to add individual either way offences to the scheme on their own merits. The coalition Government currently have no plans to apply the scheme to all offences.</p>

	<p pid="b.252W.15/1">The available evidence suggests that current instances of personation are relatively low. Data are not as yet available for the 2010 UK General Election, though the report by the Electoral Commission and the Association of Chief Police Officers, Analysis of allegations of electoral malpractice at the June 2009 elections, found that there were 13 cases of personation at the June 2009 elections. These figures should be put in the context that more than 22 million votes were cast in the June 2009 elections across the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.252W.15/2">The Government are committed to tackling electoral fraud and have announced that it will legislate to bring Individual Electoral Registration into force in 2014, ahead of the next general election. Individual Electoral Registration will require each voter to register individually and to provide three personal identifiers; signature, date of birth and National Insurance Number, the last two of which will be cross checked with the Department for Work and Pensions before anyone is added to the electoral register. This will make the electoral register more accurate and more secure, and thus should strengthen the integrity of the voting process at elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.252W.15/3">The Electoral Commission's report on the administration of the May 2010 General Election published in July explained that the Commission had worked with the Association of Chief Police Officers to ensure that cases of alleged electoral malpractice reported to the police have been consistently and comprehensively recorded across the UK since the beginning of 2010. The Electoral Commission will publish verified data and analysis on the extent and nature of cases of electoral malpractice at the General Election in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.252W.15/4">We will consider the Electoral Commission's report carefully when it is published together with what action may be necessary to address any issues that may highlighted by the report.</p>

We are looking at how training and support available through a wide range of routes could be harnessed to prepare people for this opportunity, and at whether it may be necessary to create specific, designated pre-apprenticeship training. Indeed, our recent consultation on the future direction of skills policy sought views on what form of pre-apprenticeship training might be appropriate and how we could ensure it was a first step towards ongoing learning. However, the details of what these routes may look like have not yet been determined. Consideration of funding arrangements is a key element in the development of our policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.3/2">The previous Government announced the provision of &#163;5 million of training support to Tata Steel (then Corus) in June 2009. &#163;2.5 million of that funding was delivered by the Regional Development Agencies (Yorkshire Forward and One North East) in December 2009. A further &#163;2.5 million was also earmarked to be provided to the company in those regions through Train to Gain. The offer of assistance was intended to contribute to training the work force, retain capacity in the UK and to help the company through the downturn and to recover more strongly as economic conditions improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.3/3">Almost 100 learners at Corus TCP undertook training in Business Improvement Techniques, using Train to Gain funding, with learning delivered by Gateshead College in 09/10. The Skills Funding Agency continues to work constructively with Tata Steel across a number of its sites in different regions to identify training opportunities that are eligible within the current Train to Gain rules and within future funding arrangements, and which are consistent with state aid requirements.</p>

The review did not locate sufficient information to make an estimate of HFC emissions from air source heat pumps.</p>

	<p pid="b.282W.5/1">Due to the complexity of the sites, storage cost of spent fuel and intermediate level waste cannot be easily apportioned because each stream shares common resources, management arrangements and facilities. The total expenditure on Magnox reactor sites (for the year ended <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>) was &#163;590 million. This included the operational cost for the two generating sites, Wylfa and Oldbury, of &#163;164 million and power generating revenue of &#163;324 million. The cost to maintain safe compliant condition on non operational sites is approximately &#163;159 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.282W.5/2">DECC, through NDA, continually drive cost efficiency into the decommissioning and waste management programme through stringent oversight and developing appropriate commercial arrangements. Cost reduction is ultimately driven through by reducing hazards at the sites by retrieving and packaging waste so that it can be stored passively and safely. Early remediation, within funding constraints, is the key to reducing ongoing liability. DECC are currently considering, as part of the current spending review, a programme that will not only meet funding constraints and accelerate hazard remediation, but also reduce the long term Nuclear Liability Estimate (NLE) at Magnox Sites by between &#163;l billion and &#163;1.2 billion.</p>

	<p pid="b.283W.6/1">Funding for the Warm Front scheme was announced in the spending review through to 2012-13. Government will work to improve the cost-effectiveness of Warm Front by ensuring that the scheme is best targeted to help the most vulnerable receive free or subsidised heating and insulation measures, through a more focused programme. We will be consulting to ensure that the eligibility criteria support this objective.</p>
	<p pid="b.283W.6/2">At the same time, we are working towards a further package of measures that will help support more of the most vulnerable and fuel poor households to keep their homes warm at an affordable cost. Through the CERT extension, from April 2011, we have introduced a greater focus on targeting energy efficiency measures at the most vulnerable households by introducing a Super Priority Group. And we intend to introduce mandated Social Price Support in April 2011, to replace the existing Voluntary Agreement in order to provide direct energy bill support to a large number of vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="b.283W.6/3">From 2012, the Green Deal is expected to dramatically increase investment in energy efficiency for households and businesses across the country. It will help protect people against price rises through greater energy saving, with special support for the most vulnerable. The new Energy Company Obligation, which will take over from current schemes from the end of 2012, will run in parallel with and serve to underpin parts of the Green Deal programme. It is intended to focus particularly on households who cannot achieve financial savings without additional support, including the poorest and most vulnerable and those in hard to treat homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.284W.6/1">The Fifth Annual Independent Academies Evaluation Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers found that there is evidence of academies increasing collaboration with neighbouring primary schools and secondary schools. It also found that neighbouring schools have increasingly realised the benefits they can derive from academies with some adopting policies introduced by academies-the report found that this had a positive impact on other local schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.6/2">More recently, the National Audit Office report on Academies did &quot;identify effective examples of partnership working with other schools, particularly 'feeder' primary schools&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.6/3">All outstanding schools that convert will be expected to partner and provide support to weak schools to help improve standards. Currently, the former and existing city technology colleges are sponsoring over 20 academies or are supporting weaker schools. We will continue to monitor the progress and performance of academies and ensure that they remain accountable against the results and outcomes they are expected to deliver.</p>

This is a key indicator of whether looked after children are being appropriately safeguarded. The Department collects information on the number of looked after children absent for more than 24 hours from their agreed placement. However it is the responsibility of local authorities to safeguard and promote the well-being of children in care and they will hold more detailed information on each child who has gone missing from their care.

	<p pid="b.288W.5/1">There are no plans to recruit new staff into the Department for Education to undertake duties previously carried out by non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). There are likely to be existing staff in NDPBs who will transfer into the Department, under Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment (TUPE) regulations or in accordance with the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice (COSOP) on staff transfers in the public sector. It is not possible to say how many staff will transfer into the Department, or give the numbers of existing departmental staff who will change their responsibilities to undertake work previously carried out by our NDPBs, at this stage of the reform programme.</p>

Some activity formerly undertaken by BECTA will return to the Department and will result in staff transferring into the Department under TUPE/COSOP arrangements. No decisions have been made about transferring activity undertaken by QCDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/3">The number of staff to be made redundant due to the closure of these NDPBs is not known. There are consultations under way or about to commence with staff which could result in some staff retiring or leaving under voluntary severance terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/4">The current cross-Government recruitment freeze also means that staff who leave are not replaced unless they are considered critical to continuous effective delivery until closure.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase> the Cabinet Office announced the initial findings of the coalition Government's pledge to increase the transparency and accountability of public bodies. The announcement gave an update on Government-wide plans to abolish, merge, reform or review 901 NDPBs. The work to review and reform public bodies continues in the Department and its outcome will inform decisions about the future of its other NDPBs. This, combined with the outcome of the comprehensive spending review, is likely to mean further staff reductions across the Department and its NDPBs, but it is not possible to give an indication of the numbers at this time.</p>

Its purpose is to ensure that future capital investment represents good value for money and strongly supports the Government's ambitions to reduce the deficit, raise standards and tackle disadvantage. The independent capital review team is working with building companies on a pilot proposal to rebuild Campsmount Technology College in Doncaster. There is a good prospect that the new school could be built ahead of the original schedule and with significant cost savings. The funding of academies in Doncaster will be considered on a case-by-case basis. However plans for all other schools in Doncaster in line for BSF funding for refurbishment and rebuilds have been stopped at present while we await the outcome of the capital review which will report at the end of this calendar year.</p>

However, the guidance makes clear that contractors do need to undergo a CRB check if they are going to be left unsupervised on school premises or if they are going to come into contact with children. Of course, the vast majority of contractors will not come into contact with children because, for health and safety reasons, children should not be allowed in areas where builders are working.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.6/1">The Department does not maintain an annual record of the cost to the national health service of treating people with such illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.6/2">Academic research has indicated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating people with tobacco related-illnesses in England is &#163;2.7 billion per annum (Callum C.) (2008), The cost of smoking to the NHS in Health Economics, Policy and Law. This report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.6/4">There has been no recent estimate of the annual cost to the NHS of treating alcohol-related illnesses; however, a review into the total cost of alcohol harms was carried out by the Department in 2008. The cost of alcohol harm to the NHS in England estimates that the total cost of alcohol harms to the NHS is around &#163;2.7 billion a year. A copy of this review has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.6/5">Earlier this year, Policy Exchange estimated that the wider cost to society of tobacco use is almost &#163;14 billion per annum. In their report, 'Cough up', they looked at the cost of early death or retirement due to sickness, payment of benefits to support widows and families, the costs of sickness at work to employers, the human and financial costs of smoking-related fires, smoking breaks at work and cleaning up cigarette butts. A copy of this report has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.6/6">Department statistics show that, in England in 2007-08, there were estimated to be 945,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions, which is 7% of all hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.6/7">It is estimated that up to 35% of all Accident and Emergency attendance and ambulance costs may be alcohol-related.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.6/8">The National Audit Office has carried out an audit of NHS spend on alcohol treatment. Its report, Reducing Alcohol Harm: health services in England for alcohol misuse, was published in November 2008 and found, that where primary care trust expenditure on alcohol services was known, an average of &#163;600,000 was spent on commissioning alcohol services in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.305W.6/1">No central assessment has been conducted by the Department of cost-effectiveness of national health service expenditure on radio advertising by the NHS. Since local NHS organisations are responsible for the mix of channels which are selected for any advertising they deem necessary some NHS organisations may have carried out such research. However any such assessments are not held centrally by the Department and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. We do nevertheless expect NHS organisations to seek the best value for money from their advertising and to evaluate the effectiveness of any campaigns as a whole.</p>
