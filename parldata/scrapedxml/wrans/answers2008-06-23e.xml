	<p pid="e.4W.11/1">There are no proposals to give residents eligible for concessionary travel the monetary value of a concessionary bus pass as an alternative to taking it up. The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 preserves the flexibility of Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) to enhance their schemes locally at their own expense. At its discretion a TCA can choose to offer its residents travel vouchers or tokens for local use in taxis. The offer of any such enhancement and the monetary value of it is entirely a matter for the TCA as vouchers or tokens are not part of the statutory entitlement to concessionary travel.</p>

	<p pid="e.6W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="e.6W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what factors are taken into account by the Child Support Agency when calculating the repayment of arrears.</p>
	<p pid="e.6W.2/5" class="indent">There are a number of factors to consider where child maintenance debt is outstanding and the non-resident parent is not able to offer full repayment immediately. Before deciding whether it is appropriate to collect arrears of child maintenance the Agency will consider the welfare of any child likely to be affected by an agreement. There is also a requirement for each parent to make adequate financial provision for their children which is a basic principle of the Child Support Act 1991. The actual negotiation process will establish the relevant facts, request further details where necessary and review representations made by the non-resident parent. The aim is to achieve the best possible agreement on behalf of all parties.</p>
	<p pid="e.6W.2/6" class="indent">If the Agency cannot secure immediate repayment in full from the non-resident parent, it aims to reach agreements that will see arrears paid back within two years wherever possible. Before forming an opinion about accepting a repayment offer, the Agency will take into account the circumstances of the case and all other relevant considerations.</p>
	<p pid="e.6W.2/7" class="indent">In some cases where an agreement cannot be reached which takes appropriate account of the welfare of the children affected, the non-resident parent's obligations and other relevant circumstances, it may be necessary to pursue recovery through legal enforcement methods. This is a key feature of the Operational Improvement Plan, launched in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.6W.2/8" class="indent">The Agency collected or arranged more than &pound;1 billion in maintenance in the twelve months to March 2008, of which &pound;126m was arrears. This is almost twice the &pound;68 million of arrears collected in the year to March 2006 before the full introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>

	<p pid="e.8W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-23">23 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/4" class="indent">;</p>

	<p pid="e.8W.2/6" class="indent">What representations he has received on the retention of staff by Vertex Data Science Ltd at the Child Support Agency's offices in Bolton.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/7" class="indent">Vertex Data Science Ltd. manages the CSA Bolton site, a unit the Agency established to deal with cases which for technical reasons can not be processed on the new computer system (CS2) and therefore need to be administered clerically. By moving all the clerical work undertaken by the Agency to this one site from September 2006, the Agency was able to release people to focus on other improvement work outlined in the Operational Improvement Plan, including reducing the number of uncleared applications and strengthening enforcement. This has contributed to the Agency meeting or exceeding all of its 2007/08 Secretary of State targets and collecting over &pound;1 billion in child maintenance for over 750,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/8" class="indent">Since September 2006, Vertex has arranged and collected more than &pound;40 million of maintenance payments. While the arrangement has contributed to the Agency's improvement, there have also been some operational issues which have impacted on client service. The Agency took steps to ensure that our service to clients improved by renegotiating the contract with Vertex to allow them to focus on keeping maintenance flowing to children. The Agency also increased its resource dedicated to progressing clerical cases by retaining responsibility for new clerical cases until first payment stage.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/9" class="indent">In addition, all complaints with MP or Independent Case Examiner involvement, as well as those cases that require a review are now being dealt with by specialist caseworkers within the Agency. Clerical cases represent less than three per cent of all assessed cases. While the administration of these cases will continue to present a challenge, the Agency is continually working with its contractors to improve the service to these clients.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/10" class="indent">The Agency is committed to implementing an IT upgrade which will introduce a series of system checkpoints, reducing the number of stuck cases which currently need to be administered clerically.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/11" class="indent">The retention of employees at CSA Bolton is a matter for Vertex Data Science Ltd as they are responsible for employing the people required to deliver the service, under the contract which currently runs to September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.8W.2/12" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="e.14W.3/2">The main sources of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in the UK in 2006 were energy supply (40 per cent. of total UK CO2 emissions in 2006), transport (24 per cent.), business (17 per cent.) and residential (15 per cent.). The main sources of methane emissions (CH4) in the UK in 2006 were waste management (41 per cent. of total UK CH4 emissions in 2006) and agriculture (38 per cent.). The main sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the UK in 2006 were agriculture (68 per cent. of total UK N2O emissions in 2006) and transport (15 per cent.). The primary source of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the UK is release of refrigerants. The primary sources of Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are from aluminium smelting and electronics manufacture. The primary sources of Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in the UK are from magnesium smelting and from the release of SF6 used in electrical insulation.</p>
	<p pid="e.14W.3/3">In 2006, emissions of UK carbon dioxide were 554.4 million tonnes. This figure includes emissions from the Crown Dependencies and those Overseas Territories that have joined the UK's ratification of the Kyoto protocol. This figure includes emissions and removals from land-use, land-use change and forestry, as accounted for under the Kyoto protocol. Our Kyoto target is to ensure emissions of the six greenhouse gases controlled under the protocol throughout the period 2008-12 are no higher than 3.412 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This equates to average emissions of no higher than 682.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. UK emissions in 2006 were 652.34 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent. This figure does not take into account additional emissions savings delivered through UK participation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) which was estimated to be 34 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.16W.8/2">In 2000 a decision was reached under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that 'terminator'-type seeds should not be approved for field trials or commercial release without an appropriate assessment of their possible impact. As a party to the CBD we support that decision. There are no terminator seeds in commercial use anywhere in the world at present, and as far as we are aware there are no plans for any to be introduced in the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="e.28W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June</phrase> the UK Government launched their updated AIDS strategy &quot;Achieving Universal Access&mdash;the UK's strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world&quot;. The strategy sets out the UK's response to tackling HIV and AIDS in developing countries to 2015, including access to treatment. Working with others, the UK will work to reduce drug prices and increase access to more affordable and sustainable treatment over the long-term. This could yield cost efficiency savings of at least &pound;50 million per annum, enough to fund medicines for an additional one million people every year.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.0/2">The UK Government launched the Medical Transparency Alliance (MeTA) in May. By disclosing information on the price, quality and availability of medicines, MeTA will help to increase public accountability and improve access to medicines, including HIV treatment. The UK will also continue to support UNITAID, the international drugs purchase facility, to reduce the cost of HIV treatment.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.0/3">Starting in 2008, the Department for International Development will support a new regional programme on Access to Medicines in Southern Africa. The programme will spend &pound;10 million over the first three years to deliver more affordable, quality medicines and diagnostics, including for HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.0/4">A copy of the updated strategy and supporting evidence paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. These are also available on the Department for International Development (DFID) website:</p>

	<p pid="e.28W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/2">The UK takes all allegations of misconduct by UN and other peacekeepers extremely seriously and we believe strongly that UN personnel must uphold the highest standards of behaviour. The vast majority of UN peacekeepers uphold those standards while doing important work in difficult and dangerous circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/3">The UN is responsible for tackling allegations of misconduct directly with troop contributing countries. We will continue to work closely with the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other partners to ensure that its 'zero tolerance' policy towards incidents of abuse is implemented in full.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/4">We are providing support to the UN's efforts to assess, prioritise and respond to the sexual exploitation and abuse of children by UN peacekeepers and aid workers. This includes taking concrete measures to address both the military and civilian branches of peacekeeping support operations. One such measure, the UN's Conduct and Discipline Units, is funded by the UK's Conflict Prevention Pool. These teams work to ensure that all peacekeeping personnel undergo training on UN standards of conduct relating to sexual exploitation and abuse, and that all allegations of wrongdoing are reported upon and followed up with appropriate action. In the UN Mission in Liberia, for example, the number of cases reported to the UN was reduced by half from 2006 to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/5">We have been successful in working with the UN to instigate policy changes aimed at preventing and tackling sexual exploitation and abuse. These include: a Victim's Assistance Strategy to provide assistance to survivors of sexual violence perpetrated by UN personnel; a more robust Model Memorandum of Understanding between the UN and Troop Contributing Countries; an upgraded Welfare and Recreation Strategy for peacekeeping and related personnel; and a resolution on 'Criminal accountability of UN officials and experts on mission'.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/6">The UK supports efforts to protect the world's most vulnerable children from sexual abuse. To further strengthen the UN's approach, the UK supported the UN Secretary-General's recent recommendation to include, where appropriate, child protection advisors within the mandates of peacekeeping missions. As an active member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, we will continue to work to improve the effectiveness of existing UN monitoring, reporting and disciplinary mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="e.28W.3/7">Through its Conflict Prevention programme, the UK also helps to train military personnel for peacekeeping operations. Good conduct and respect for human rights is an integral part of all training courses. The UK will continue to provide training on peace support operations for troops from other countries, which covers conduct and discipline, particularly the importance of protecting civilians in accordance with international law.</p>

Our main conclusion was that businesses and consumers have been using the freedoms provided but that more could be done to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour. There are, however, limits to the impact licensing law can have on the personal behaviour in terms of consumption. We have therefore announced, in the Youth Alcohol Action Plan, measures which are designed to tackle binge drinking among young people. The Government also expect to consider further action when the ongoing Alcohol Price, Promotion and Harm review reports this summer.</p>

	<p pid="e.34W.14/2">I have received a number of representations on the campaign for safe standing areas. I have discussed this matter with the Football Association, local authorities, the police and the Home Office. The consensus among all parties is that there is no wish to re-introduce any standing areas at grounds in the top two divisions.</p>

	<p pid="e.34W.17/1">I have had a number of meetings and telephone conversations with my hon. Friend, the Minister for Crime Reduction, about concerns relating to the regulation of lap dancing and similar establishments. He has agreed to consider, along with relevant ministerial colleagues, whether we need to do more to support local communities in controlling these establishments. As a first step, I have recently written to chief executives of local authorities to clarify the powers available under the Licensing Act and to seek their views on whether these, and other controls, are sufficient to respond to the concerns of local people. I am arranging for a copy of my letter to be deposited in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.46W.5/2">The MOD is committed to maintaining HMS Victory in a sound material state for the nation for generations to come. To achieve this, a planned maintenance regime is in place that includes regular whole ship surveys.</p>
	<p pid="e.46W.5/3">In the late 1990s a new technique was adopted to ascertain the extent of rot in the ship's timbers and in particular the ship's hull planking. A survey in 2002 identified an increase in the rot in the hull planking; it also enabled the Department to predict the rate of decay. Subsequent surveys have confirmed these findings.</p>
	<p pid="e.46W.5/4">As a result of the 2002 survey, we started work to secure legal and sustainable hull planks to replace the rotten ones. Sufficient material has now been obtained and work on the hull is scheduled to start towards the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.46W.5/5">A system for monitoring the movement and form of HMS Victory has been in place since the 1970s, with an improved system being installed in 2005 that allows accurate measurements to be taken on a monthly basis. The movement of the ship is well understood and there is no evidence of any movement of the ship as a result of the degradation of the hull planking.</p>

	<p pid="e.46W.8/2">Since HMS Victory's restoration was completed for Trafalgar 200 in 2005, returning the ship to its 1805 Battle of Trafalgar condition, only essential repair work has been carried out. Since then, MOD has undertaken detailed research to develop a full understanding of the structural condition of the ship and its construction. This has enabled the Department to select the correct materials for future repairs and to fully understand where and how repairs are to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="e.46W.8/3">The most significant task to be completed is the replacement of much of the hull planking. In addition, a structure in the After Hold that was removed many years ago, before restoration commenced, is to be reinstated to improve the structural integrity of the ship.</p>
	<p pid="e.46W.8/4">The work is expected to take several years due to the complex nature of the task, but will enable its condition to be assured for several generations.</p>

	<p pid="e.47W.11/1">I will write to the hon. Member</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Ann Winterton:</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/3" class="indent">My Rt hon. Friend the Defence Secretary undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-19">19 February 2008</phrase>, (Official Report, column 569W) about replacement and alternative winches for Chinook helicopters. I am sorry that it has taken so long to respond.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/4" class="indent">Researching the answer to this question has required an examination of detailed Supply Chain records to provide information on the question of the availability of specific items of lifting gear within theatre. Regrettably, this work took longer than expected.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/5" class="indent">I have taken your question to arise from the incident in Kajaki, Afghanistan in September 2006 during which Corporal (Cpl) Mark Wright GC was killed. This incident was the subject of an internal Board of Inquiry (BOI), the results of which were given to the next of kin of those involved. The BOI found: that a number of British soldiers entered an unmarked minefield; that multiple mine detonations over a short period of time followed; and, that the injured were eventually extracted by a US helicopter. The BOI also found that the arrival of this helicopter was delayed by mechanical problems, and although a British Chinook helicopter arrived at the scene earlier it did not attempt to extract the soldiers, in part, because it was not fitted with a winch&mdash;all such items having been withdrawn from the Chinook force some months earlier.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/6" class="indent">The BOI concluded that no winches were available for the Chinook but the more recent Supply Chain investigation found that not all winches were affected by the maintenance issue that resulted in those fitted to Chinooks in Afghanistan being withdrawn back to the UK. In fact, a small number were available to the Chinook force at around the time of the Kajaki incident.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/7" class="indent">On first inspection it seems odd that winches could have been available to the Chinook force but not deployed forward immediately to replace the winches which were recalled. This seems particularly odd in the light of the media reporting that had the Chinook which was called to assist in the incident had a winch, it would have been able to rescue those trapped in the minefield.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/8" class="indent">The reason that the replacement winches were not deployed forward immediately can be explained by the fact that, in September 2006, there was no formal requirement for UK Chinooks in Afghanistan to be fitted with winches. Chinooks have &quot;role equipment&quot; which can be taken off or put on the airframe as and when it is considered necessary by the military chain of command. The aircraft that went to Afghanistan did have winches already fitted when they deployed but without a formal requirement for them, once the winches had been removed there was no immediate pressure to replace them, and there were no requests from the military chain of command in Theatre for the winches to be replaced.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/9" class="indent">This can be further explained by the fact that using helicopters to extract personnel from minefields is widely recognised as being an extremely hazardous undertaking, only to be used in exceptional circumstances; our preferred approach to minefield extraction is either through the use of Explosive Ordnance Disposal assets or through self-extraction using techniques in which all deployed personnel are trained. Given this, it is understandable that no Standard Operating Procedures existed in theatre at the time governing the use of Chinook helicopters in extracting injured personnel from minefields, and that Chinook crews are not routinely trained in winch operations in such circumstances. Indeed, the Chinook crew involved in the incident has confirmed that, even if a winch had been fitted to their Chinook they did not consider it safe, either for those on the ground or in the aircraft, to attempt a winch extraction.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/10" class="indent">It is worth pointing out however that even though the UK Chinook fleet at the time did not have a formal requirement for winches there was a winch capability available to UK forces in Theatre. Coalition helicopter assets were pooled and winch capability was available from US assets&mdash;through both a US Combat Search and Rescue capability with a HH-60G helicopter, and a US Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Team, also with a HH-60G. And it was the US Combat Search and Rescue capability which successfully extracted Cpl Wright. That it did so successfully was testament to the ability and courage of the crew who the Board of Inquiry found &quot;acted with complete disregard for their own safety.&quot; In fact, this was such an exceptionally brave manoeuvre that their actions were recognised by Her Majesty with a Queen's Commendation for Bravery in the Air.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/11" class="indent">Thus there was an available winch capability in theatre but not through a formal requirement placed upon UK helicopter assets, and replacement winches were not requested. Moreover, the introduction of other temporary alternatives would not have been a practicable proposition as they would have required detailed testing to be carried out and appropriate clearances to be obtained; a process which typically takes approximately six months to secure.</p>
	<p pid="e.47W.11/12" class="indent">You would wish to be aware that all Chinooks, Merlins and Sea King helicopters deployed on operational Immediate Response Team tasks now have a winch capability to provide greater flexibility of response to the different kinds of incidents they face.</p>

	<p pid="e.51W.6/1">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 gave sentencers more options and greater flexibility in imposing adult community sentences which provide a tough and effective alternative to custody. The Government are allocating further funds, including &pound;40 million to probation in 2008-09, so that sentencers can be confident that the resources are in place to deliver effective community punishments. In addition the Government are also providing &pound;13.9 million to fund at least six intensive alternative to custody projects over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="e.51W.6/2">We have also revised the community sentencing structure for young people to provide disposals that offer sentencers a strong community alternative to custody. We have introduced the referral order which is the main disposal for young defendants pleading guilty and convicted for the first time, the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme which caters for serious and persistent young offenders and Intensive Fostering, both of which can be attached to community orders. Intensive fostering is being piloted by the Youth Justice Board in three areas and provides a highly intensive programme for serious and persistent young offenders whose home environment is contributing to their offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="e.51W.6/3">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introduces a new generic community sentence for young people, the Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO). The YRO is designed to increase the options available to deal with young offenders in the community with effective and tailored interventions. Under the new order intensive supervision and surveillance and intensive fostering are set out as specific alternatives to custody.</p>

	<p pid="e.67W.11/1">The dedicated schools grant (DSG) guaranteed unit of funding per pupil for 2008-09 for Bournemouth local authority is &pound;3,820. As the DSG is distributed through a single guaranteed unit of funding per pupil, a primary/secondary split is not available; this figure covers all funded pupils aged three to 15 and is in cash terms (rounded to the nearest &pound;10). This figure covers funding through the DSG only and so does not represent the totality of 'education' funding; there is also funding from the Learning and Skills Council and other grants that support the schools budget where allocations have not yet been finalised for 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="e.70W.5/1">With regard to schools, legislation prohibits the interviewing of children or parents to determine admission to a maintained school (except where an interview is used solely to assess the suitability of an applicant for a boarding place). This includes admission to the school at year 12. However meetings can be held to provide advice on options and entry requirements for particular courses, both for new applicants to the school, and for those transferring within the school from year 11 to year 12.</p>
	<p pid="e.70W.5/2">As independent bodies, colleges are responsible for determining their own mission and managing their own affairs. This includes managing their own assets; being responsible for the employment of their staff; and setting their own policies and admissions criteria.</p>
	<p pid="e.70W.5/3">Our prime concern is that every young person is able to access the programme of learning that is best suited to their abilities and aspirations. Diplomas are an important part of ensuring the right choices are available to young people. The decision over whether a young person takes a diploma will be driven by what the young person wants to do, and what is in the best interests of that young person. The introduction of diplomas does not change the existing arrangements for admissions either to schools or colleges. It is a longstanding and common practice for both schools and colleges to have meetings with their students to advise them and help them choose the right courses of study for their needs. This is separate from admissions.</p>

	<p pid="e.71W.2/1">No guidance specifically on the capital funding of school swimming pools has been issued to local education authorities by this Department in the last five years. There are no barriers to schools or authorities using schools capital funding for capital maintenance of existing pools, or to construct new ones where this is their local priority.</p>
	<p pid="e.71W.2/2">In our non-statutory area guidelines for schools, Building Bulletin 98, &quot;Briefing Framework for Secondary School Projects&quot; (2004), indoor swimming pools fall into the category of supplementary net area which is not included where the Department uses these guidelines as a funding model, for instance for Building Schools for the Future. Our guidance suggests that swimming pools will therefore normally need other sources of funding, such as local authority leisure service, Lottery or Department of Culture Media and Sport funding.</p>
	<p pid="e.71W.2/3">This guidance is repeated in &quot;Inspirational Design for PE and Sports Spaces&quot; (2005).

	<p pid="e.71W.5/1">The number of incidents of assaults towards staff in schools is not collected centrally. My Department does collect information on the reasons why pupils have been excluded, either for a fixed period or permanently. This includes a category for &quot;physical assault against an adult&quot; although this is not broken down by category of assault.</p>
	<p pid="e.71W.5/2">Local authority and region level tables for the last three years showing the number of permanent and fixed period exclusions by reason have been placed in the Library. For 2005/06 this information is only available for secondary schools due to underlying changes in the data collection. For 2006/07 this coverage will extend to also include primary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="e.72W.5/1">The Department has commissioned a six-year longitudinal study of teachers' experiences of initial teacher training and early professional development. The project, &quot;Becoming a Teacher&quot;, started in 2003 with a sample of trainees in their final year of initial teacher training and is ongoing as it follows them through their early career. 91 per cent. of survey respondents who were currently teaching or planning to be in teaching in the following term indicated that they expected to still be in teaching in four years' time. At the time of the survey there were 106 participants who had worked as a teacher since completing their training but were not now working as a teacher and were not looking for a teaching post. Reasons cited included being unable to find a job, behaviour of pupils/pupil discipline, deciding to move into another career, family reasons/commitments and workload. However, over half the respondents anticipated returning to teaching in the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.72W.5/2">This area has been researched extensively, and the Department has also commissioned a series of reports by Smithers and Robinson, published in 2003, 2004, 2005 to investigate teacher turnover, wastage and destinations.</p>
	<p pid="e.72W.5/3">It should be noted that many teachers return to service after a break. In 2005-06, the latest year for which figures are available, around 10,000 qualified teachers returned to service in the maintained sector (all school types) after a break of at least one year.</p>

	<p pid="e.83W.11/13">Time on patrol on its own does not provide an accurate picture of frontline police activity. In 2006-07 Essex police officers spent 64.8 per cent. of their time on frontline duties. The measurement of time on patrol only refers to the time when an officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Any activity that an officer responds to while on patrol (such as street crime or a burglary) is recorded separately against the other activity and not shown as patrol. In the last three years the Essex police has returned 1,000 police officers to frontline duties from back office functions.</p>
	<p pid="e.83W.11/14">We are committed to reducing the time spent on paperwork by police officers, as is Essex police. The force has made a pledge to attend the scene of every crime and take a full witness statement from all victims, dependent on their individual needs which may contribute to the extra time spent on paperwork.</p>
	<p pid="e.83W.11/15">I am told by Essex police that comparing 2007-08 with the previous year shows 8,000 fewer victims of crime in the county, 1,000 more crimes detected, 13,500 fewer incidents of antisocial behaviour, and an additional 3,500 persons arrested. This is welcome and shows that the force is making Essex a safer place in which to live.</p>
	<p pid="e.83W.11/16">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has already accepted Sir Ronnie Flanagan's recommendation to remove lengthy Stop and Account forms, and will also consider more proportionate and streamlined stop and search and crime recording forms. We are continuing with consultation on reforms of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, streamlining the Criminal Justice process, and investing &pound;50 million in new mobile data technology.</p>

	<p pid="e.85W.3/1">In response to requests from some companies in the communications industry for a Home Office view on targeted online advertising and the applicability of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), a note was issued in February this year. The note was produced without reference to any particular technology or application. It was not intended for publication, but was disseminated by one of the companies. It can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="e.85W.3/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/ukcrypto/2008-March/083561.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/ukcrypto/2008-March/083561.html</a></p>
	<p pid="e.85W.3/3">The note expressed a generalised view on whether RIPA was relevant to targeted online advertising. However, it was not formal guidance nor was it a definitive statement of the law. The Home Office has subsequently received a number of representations and reports from interested parties who have expressed their view on this matter. Those representations have not changed the Home Office view, as set out in the note.</p>
	<p pid="e.85W.3/4">The Home Office has not undertaken any investigations into any targeted online advertising services. Investigations of this nature would be a matter for the police, although we are not aware of any such investigations.</p>

	<p pid="e.86W.9/2">The Security Service is the UK's security intelligence agency. It works to protect the UK against covertly organised threats by obtaining, collating, analysing and assessing secret intelligence relating to threats to national security.</p>
	<p pid="e.86W.9/3">Section 1 of the Security Service Act 1989 establishes the functions of the Security Service as:</p>
	<p pid="e.86W.9/4" class="indent">&quot;... the protection of national security and, in particular, its protection against threats from espionage, terrorism and sabotage, from the activities of agents of foreign powers and from actions intended to overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means ...&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="e.86W.9/5" class="indent">&quot; ... to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom against threats posed by the actions or intentions of persons outside the British Islands ...&quot;; and</p>
	<p pid="e.86W.9/6" class="indent">&quot; ... to act in support of the activities of police forces, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime ...&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.86W.9/7">It is on these functions that it is appropriate for the Service to advise the Government, normally in private. This in no way conflicts with the duty placed on the Director General, by section 2(2)(b),</p>

There might from time to time be circumstances in which a statement is made for public information. It is for the Director General to decide when and in what circumstances to issue such a statement in consultation with the Secretary of State, other agencies or Departments, or the police, as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="e.96W.9/2">Operation Safeguard is an arrangement between the National Offender Management Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers. The estimated cost to NOMS of the provision of police cells under Operation Safeguard in 2007-08 is in the region of &pound;53 million. This includes staff costs. The number of police officers who have taken part in Operation Safeguard is an operational matter for police authorities and chief officers and the information is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="e.97W.5/1">The IMPACT Programme, which is now part of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), has made considerable progress on its three main work streams:</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.5/2" class="indent">The programme is helping forces to implement the requirements of the Code of Practice and supporting Guidance on the Management of Police Information, which together provide a national framework for improved and more consistent processes for managing information. As part of this, two sets of peer reviews have been completed, the results of which show that forces are making good progress towards the target of implementation across all business areas by 2010. A third set of reviews is ongoing and is due to be completed later this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.5/3" class="indent">The programme delivered the IMPACT Nominal Index (INI) in December 2005. This provides a means for an investigating officer in one force or other policing agency to quickly and efficiently establish which other policing agencies might hold information on an individual of interest to their inquiries. The system has now been deployed to 67 organisations across the United Kingdom and currently holds over 61 million records. Over the 12 months from April 2007, use of the INI tripled, with around 36,000 searches being conducted in March 2008. Since its deployment, around half-a-million searches have been conducted in total, an estimated 11 per cent. of which have led to requests to other agencies for access to information they hold.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.5/4" class="indent">The programme is in the process of selecting a commercial partner to design, build, deploy and run a Police National Database (PND). Having established the Police Services' requirements, a Contract Notice was published in the <i> Official Journal</i> of the European Union in May 2007. From the 14 consortia that formally responded, the Programme selected three to participate in detailed negotiations. It is anticipated that, following completion of these negotiations and the evaluation of the final tenders, a contract will be awarded to the successful supplier before the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.5/5">It is planned to roll out the system in phases, with the first phase focusing on sharing and linking information that is currently held in local systems across the main United Kingdom police forces. Most of the first phase of capabilities are expected to be deployed during 2010, although it is possible that some early functionality might be delivered during 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.97W.5/6">Subject to affordability in the next spending period, the second phase will focus on broadening the user base for the PND and securing the long term future of the current Police National Computer. Deployment of phase two is expected to commence after 2012.</p>

	<p pid="e.104W.2/1">In April 2003, the Government introduced a new right for parents of children up to six and disabled children up to 18, to request flexible working and put a duty on the employer to consider their request seriously. The Work and Families Act 2006 extended this right to carers of adults from April 2007. Most carers will be given the right to request to vary their contract of employment to enable them more flexibility to carry out their out of work responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="e.104W.2/2">Last week, we published the new cross-government carers' strategy. This included significant new measures to enable carers to be better able to combine paid employment with their caring role through enhanced flexible working opportunities and increased skills training opportunities. The strategy announced some &pound;38 million of new investment to help deliver these commitments.</p>
	<p pid="e.104W.2/3">We will be working with employers to develop and disseminate a good practice guide for supporting carers in the workplace&mdash;a guide that will not only considerably help individual carers themselves, but which will also point up the strong economic argument for enabling employers to retain the valuable skills that their employees have developed over time.</p>

	<p pid="e.118W.3/1">Over the last 10 years, the main part of the Department's total expenditure on health research has been devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. Details of individual NHS supported research projects undertaken during that time, including a number concerned with migraine, are available on the archived national research register at:</p>
	<p pid="e.118W.3/2" class="indent">https://portal.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/NRRArchiveSearch.aspx</p>
	<p pid="e.118W.3/3">Implementation of the Department's research strategy &quot;Best Research for Best Health&quot; (copies of this publication are available in the Library) and the establishment of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has resulted in an expansion of our research programmes and in significant new funding opportunities. The NIHR funded University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre is for example undertaking research on headache and pain. A five-year budget of &pound;3.7 million has been allocated to this work.</p>
	<p pid="e.118W.3/4">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is one of the main agencies through which the Government support medical and clinical research. The MRC, an independent body, receives its grant-in-aid from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="e.118W.3/5">Since 1998 the MRC has funded three research projects relevant to migraine, at a total cost of &pound;1.7 million.</p>

	<p pid="e.121W.9/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) commission health services on behalf of their local population, and are performance managed by strategic health authorities (SHAs). The Department launched a nationally consistent commissioning assurance system in June 2008 to strengthen performance management of PCT commissioning. This system will be managed locally by the SHAs, and will hold PCTs to account for commissioning and reward improved performance against three areas of commissioning&mdash;health outcomes, commissioning competencies and board governance. Detailed information about commissioning assurance is provided in the 'Commissioning Assurance Handbook'. Copies of the handbook have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="e.122W.0/1">Very occasionally patients who receive botulinum toxin injections in the forehead experience a drooping of the eyelids or eyebrows, although this is temporary and will resolve itself when the effects of botulinum toxin wear off. Double vision or blurred vision can occur in rare cases.</p>
	<p pid="e.122W.0/2">In respect of dental whitening, the use of tooth whitening products containing over 0.1 per cent. hydrogen peroxide may carry risks to health these are the irritation of the soft tissues in the mouth and in the gastric tract if swallowed. Conditions such as a pre-existing tissue injury or the concurrent use of alcohol and/or tobacco, may exacerbate the toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
	<p pid="e.122W.0/3">The use of fake tanning sprays may cause allergic reactions for some people and their use is not advised during pregnancy when the skin can become more sensitive. The Government strongly discourage the use of ultra-violet tanning for cosmetic purposes because of the increased risk of skin cancer.</p>
	<p pid="e.122W.0/4">Health complications for clients arising from tattooing, piercing, acupuncture and electrolysis are usually minor and self-limiting, such as local wound infections and swelling. Serious complications appear rare. There is a risk of blood-borne virus infection for staff and customers, if the procedures are not carried out hygienically. Customers with certain health conditions, such as for example a heart condition, should seek medical advice before having such procedures undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="e.122W.0/5">No professional assessment has been made regarding the effects on staff who carry out these treatments.</p>

	<p pid="e.127W.12/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.127W.12/2">Over the last three years, the Government's main support for the production of biofuels has been in the form of the 20 pence per litre duty rate reduction for biodiesel and bioethanol. Since April 2008, support has been focused through the renewable transport fuel obligation. This support has been available to both domestic and imported biofuels and information is not available on the amount spent on each category.</p>

	<p pid="e.129W.5/2">In its statement of business principles, published in December 2000, ECGD stated that its activities would</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;take into account the Government's international policies, including those on sustainable development, environment, human rights, good governance and trade&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/4">ECGD set out in its case impact analysis process (CIAP) how it would assess the environmental and social impacts of the goods or services to be exported and the overseas projects for which it has received applications for support. This document describes ECGD's approach to assessing those impacts and states that projects which comply with the relevant international standards will normally be considered to be acceptable on environmental and social impact grounds.</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/5">In the 'Sustainable Development and Human Rights' section of its statement of business principles, ECGD stated that it would:</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/6" class="indent">&quot;press for the establishment of a multilateral framework of common guidelines for assessing environmental and social issues related to project implementation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/7">ECGD played an instrumental role in securing agreement within the OECD in 2004 to the OECD Council Recommendation on Common Approaches on the Environment and Officially Supported Export Credits (the Common Approaches). This recommends that OECD members, before taking decisions on officially supported export credits, should apply common approaches for identifying and evaluating the environmental impacts of projects and existing operations that benefit from officially supported export credits. The text of the Common Approaches was revised in June 2007; this brought the OECD recommendation closer into line with ECGD's existing practices.</p>
	<p pid="e.129W.5/8">In 2006, ECGD was also instrumental in obtaining agreement at the OECD on improvements in the terms under which OECD export credit agencies can provide support for exports to renewable energy projects.</p>

Using 2005 data, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global energy consumption subsidies are likely to be in the magnitude of US$250 billion per year. As highlighted in the June 2008 Treasury paper 'Global Commodities: a long-term vision for stable, secure and sustainable global markets', subsidies inhibit the automatic stabilisation that should occur through changes in consumption as a result of price movements, while resulting in deterioration of Government fiscal positions.</p>

	<p pid="e.146W.8/1">A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is a requirement for all offshore commercial projects that form part of a plan or programme e.g. offshore wind farms. However, in order to design a suitable SEA for commercial marine renewable, adequate knowledge of pre-commercial marine renewables needs to be acquired. There are insufficient data available at present to test different scenarios under an SEA. Therefore, an SEA would be unlikely to provide much helpful information at this stage as it would be very difficult to predict impacts of marine renewable technologies prior to their deployment for demonstration. This position is set out in our &quot;Guidance on Consenting Arrangements in England and Wales for a Pre-Commercial Demonstration Phase for Wave and Tidal Stream Energy Devices (Marine Renewables)&quot; <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/filel5470.pdf">http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/filel5470.pdf</a> . Once sufficient data becomes available from demonstration projects we will review the need to publish an SEA of sites for tidal stream generation. Completion of an SEA will be a pre-condition for the start of any plan or programme for a commercial phase and will be subject to full public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="e.150W.5/2">At the spring European Council in March 2007, EU Heads of Government agreed to a target to supply 20 per cent. of the EU's energy&mdash;heat, electricity and transport&mdash;from renewable sources by 2020. Agreement has not yet been reached on the contribution that each member state will make towards this EU target. The Commission has proposed a UK target that 15 per cent. of its energy should come from renewable sources but agreement has not yet been reached.</p>
	<p pid="e.150W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December 2007</phrase>, the Government announced the launch of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) on a draft plan for up to 25 GW (installed capacity) of new offshore wind farms by 2020. Depending on the results of the SEA and the magnitude of impacts identified, the Government take a decision on what the acceptable level of offshore wind development is.</p>
	<p pid="e.150W.5/4">Developers would then be required to bid for site leases through leasing competitions to be held by the Crown Estate and, if successful, conduct their own site evaluations and undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment before applying for the necessary development and environmental consents to build an offshore wind farm.</p>
	<p pid="e.150W.5/5">The number of offshore wind turbines therefore required up to 2020 will depend on the outcome of the SEA, a future decision by the Government on the level of offshore wind generation, and on the size of turbines selected by developers for specific sites.</p>
