	<p pid="a.1131W.3/3">Earlier this month we announced that we are developing a cross Government mental health strategy. This will cover children and young people as well as adults and older people. The identification and treatment children and young people with mental health problems is particularly important as half of all lifetime mental health problems begin by age 14. The new strategy will set the direction for service improvement for all children and young people experiencing poor mental health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1150W.3/1">After an initial award of ESA has been made, the customer is sent an ESA50 medical questionnaire, which they have 28 days to complete. The customer is then invited to a work capability assessment at a medical examination centre. This takes place within the first 13 weeks of the claim. After the customer has attended the work capability assessment, a Jobcentre Plus decision maker decides whether they are fit for work and therefore not entitled to ESA, entitled to the work related activity component of ESA, or entitled to the support component of ESA. From the date the ESA50 is issued to the final decision being made takes on average 42 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.1150W.3/3">Before the ESA50 is issued, the customer will be telephoned by a member of staff from Jobcentre Plus to give information and advice about the reassessment process. This contact is not included in the target of 42 days for the reassessment process.</p>

The contents of the ESA50 and any other evidence will be used to decide if the customer needs to attend a work capability assessment. If they need to attend an assessment, Atos Healthcare will call them to arrange an appointment. The work capability assessment is the main assessment for employment and support allowance.

	<p pid="a.1154W.0/2">First with respect to DLA, the Chancellor announced in the Emergency Budget that the Government will introduce a new, objective assessment for DLA from 2013-14. The new assessment will be transparent, objective and simple.</p>
	<p pid="a.1154W.0/3">The Department is currently in the process of developing options for the new assessment in consultation with an independent group of experts comprising of disabled people, relevant health professionals and others with expertise in this area.

	<p pid="a.1154W.0/5">With regard to the employment and support allowance and the associated work capability assessment (WCA), that assesses entitlement to the benefit, we will continue with the current practice of carrying out medical assessments for the purpose of determining entitlement to the benefit.

	<p pid="a.1154W.0/6">Any evidence provided by either the customer, their representatives or healthcare professional will be given consideration and will be taken into account as part of the decision making process. Additionally, a customer is welcome to bring a representative of their choice to their medical assessment. There are also existing arrangements for a third person to claim and act for a customer who is unable to act or communicate on their own behalf. Medical assessments will continue to take account of the severity of a customer's condition or disablement, as well as the expectation of improvement or a worsening of that condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158W.5/1">In respect of nuclear new build, the provisions set out in Part 3, Chapter 1 of the Energy Act 2008 (&quot;Nuclear Sites: Decommissioning and Clean-up&quot;) are designed to ensure that the private sector meets the full cost of decommissioning and their full share of waste management costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.5/2">In respect of sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), these are in the public sector and the costs of decommissioning them are therefore met fully from the public purse, from a mixture of commercial income and direct government funding. The NDA was established to bring renewed vigour to decommissioning, using competitions for the management of its sites to drive efficiency and innovation. Together with maximising profits from its commercial operations, this ensures that the cost to the public purse of the mission is kept to the minimum necessary and delivers value for money. The NDA is also actively reducing its own management and administrative costs, through an ongoing organisational effectiveness review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158W.8/1">Neither the renewable energy directive (RED) nor fuel quality directive (FQD) explicitly require that fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) be included in gas oil. However, the directives do require an increase in use of biofuel and a reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuels used in transport and non-road mobile machinery. The Department for Transport is carrying out research which will be looking in detail at the barriers associated with increased deployment of all types of biofuels, including infrastructure costs and vehicle capability issues. DFT will be consulting soon on proposals to implement the RED and FQD, which will include draft impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.8/2">Fuel containing FAME has a higher risk of outbreaks of bacterial growth and it is important that good housekeeping practices are adhered to in the storage of fuel, in particular ensuring fuel storage tanks are free from water. DFT is currently discussing the costs of fuel storage tank cleaning/water removal with stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.8/3">The consultation introducing sustainability criteria for bioliquids into the renewables obligation (RO) as required by the renewables energy directive (RED) proposes that fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) should be eligible for support. Work is ongoing to develop costs of this change and will be considered as part of the proposed banding review to determine future levels of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.8/4">As part of the consultation on the RHI last February, the costs of all technologies for which a tariff was proposed were assessed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1159W.2/1">The UK's National Renewable Energy Action Plan, based on the 2009 Renewable Energy Strategy and submitted to the European Commission in July 2010, estimated that by 2020 biomethane injection into the gas grid could account for around 1.5% of all renewable energy (that is, heat, electricity and transport biofuels).</p>

Replacing the regional development agencies (RDAs) with local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) will ensure that these partnerships better reflect the natural economic geography of the areas that they serve.

	<p pid="a.1163W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-14">14 July 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced the end of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. In local authority areas where financial close has been reached, the initial BSF projects are continuing, as are repeat projects which had outline business case approval prior to <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>. In a local authority area where financial close has not been reached but where very significant work has been undertaken, to the point of appointing a preferred bidder at &quot;close of dialogue&quot;, sample projects (the first due to be taken forward) are also continuing. The school-by-school impact of this decision in Coventry and the value of each school's project are set out in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.8/3">The decision on BSF has not been taken lightly. The Secretary of State is seeking to secure best value for the taxpayer, while recognising existing contractual commitments. This decision will have an impact on schools and on the construction industry, but this is not the end of capita! investment in schools. The Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> a review of all capital expenditure by the Department for Education. This review will conclude by the end of 2010. Its outcome will help to determine the way in which future capital funding will be invested by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.1166W.5/1">The Department for Education does not hold this information. I have asked Anthony Douglas, chief executive of CAFCASS, to write to the hon. Member. A copy of his letter has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from <i> Anthony</i> Douglas, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-06">6 September 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/3" class="indent">I am writing to you in response to Parliamentary Questions that you tabled recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/4" class="indentitalic"> To ask the Secretary of State for Education what information his Department holds on the average number of years of post-qualification childcare social work experience of (a) children's guardians employed by the Children and Family Court and Advisory Service (CAFCASS), (b) self-employed contractors employed by CAFCASS and (c) independent social workers acting as expert witnesses in family proceedings; and if he will make a statement. [<i> 13197</i> ]</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/5" class="indent">The average length of post qualifying experience in Social work (Child related) within Cafcass is 9.17 years. This is based on the length of service within Cafcass plus the requisite 3 years post qualifying social work experience needed to become a Cafcass practitioner. The minimum 3 years post qualification rule is strictly applied and most practitioners join Cafcass with approximately 5 years post qualifying experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/6" class="indent">It is difficult to provide a precise figure given the nature and deployment of self employed contractors. We can evidence that every contractor goes through the same pre-employment checks as permanent staff including the post qualification experience (no less than three years required). From this we can confirm that all self employed contractors (currently around 350 available for use) have a least three years post qualification experience in child related social work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/7" class="indent">Cafcass does not collect information for independent social workers acting as expert witnesses in family proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/8" class="indentitalic"> To ask the Secretary of State for Education how much was paid by (a) the Children and Family Court and Advisory Service (CAFCASS) England and (b) CAFCASS Cymru to self employed contractors in family cases, (i) in total and (ii) for travel expenses in each year from 2002 to 2010; and if he will make a statement<i> . [</i> 13196]</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/9" class="indent">Please find below a table showing the total paid by Cafcass England to self employed contractors in each year from 2001/02.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166W.5/10" class="indent">Self employed contractors are responsible for meeting travel, office and all other expenses related to their work; therefore Cafcass does not collect this information.</p>

	<p pid="a.1168W.0/2">We are exploring the practicality of an alternative national signposting service which would help practitioners find out whether a colleague elsewhere is working, or has previously worked, with the same vulnerable child. The approach would particularly take account of the needs of children who move between local authority areas or who access services in more than one local authority. Social workers in particular, and potentially other key services like the police or accident and emergency departments, may need this information very quickly and any new approach would seek to strengthen communication between these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.0/3">Critical to the success of any new service must be that it provides a modern, effective tool that supports the frontline and supports the broader aims of Eileen Munro's review to improve child protection and social work practice. It is also important that we keep the information held on any new service to the minimum necessary to allow effective identification of the individuals involved. We would also seek to keep development and implementation costs to a minimum and deliver a service that can demonstrate greater value for money than ContactPoint. We will continue to draw on the views, experience and expertise of frontline staff and managers to assess the feasibility and affordability of such an approach.</p>

This will reduce the Departments occupied space by 7,119 square metres and more than double the density of occupied space in Sheffield.</p>

	<p pid="a.1171W.5/1">The Department embarked on shared service arrangements which saw us outsourcing our back office transaction processing to DWP and beginning to use their Oracle Resource Management (RM) system to facilitate improvements in our working practices and generate savings of &#163;8 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.5/2">The RM system enables the Department for Education (DfE) staff to carry out many more finance, procurement and HR tasks on-line, and this has resulted in both a substantial reduction in the size of the Department's central functions (and therefore a net reduction in costs) and improvements in the speed and quality of our corporate services provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1171W.5/4">In addition the Department has rationalised our property usage and holdings, including moving our Sheffield operations into smaller, more efficient (and cheaper to run) buildings and increasing the density of use of the London and Runcorn buildings (by sharing the space with OGDs and arm's length bodies).</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.5/5">We have implemented policies across the Department to reduce costs still further, for example in areas such as travel (where the DfE board has made a commitment to travel standard class, and encouraged all staff to travel standard class. In addition the board has asked staff to review the need to travel for meetings rather than utilising other communication media.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.5/6">DfE is also working with the Department for Transport and its Government car and despatch agency to effect the transition to new arrangements detailed in the Ministerial Code published <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-21">21 May 2010</phrase> to reduce the number of ministerial cars within the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.1180W.5/1">The details of this commitment from our coalition programme are still under consideration. I want to ensure teachers are protected against false allegations, but I also need to consider the impact on other school staff and on those working in the wider children's workforce. All allegations need to be taken seriously, regardless of the alleged offence, whether it takes place in the school they are employed in, at another school or off the school premises. While it is an imperative that we continue to safeguard children, it is also the case that some allegations are false and maliciously intended. The impact of such allegations on teachers' careers and even their lives can be devastating and I am determined to afford those affected the best protection possible. I will announce my plans and further details of how we intend to improve anonymity for teachers facing allegations in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1181W.11/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to my hon. Friend and a copy of her response has been placed in the Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/3">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/4" class="indent">There are considerable variations in attendance rates for schools in similar, challenging contexts, with high levels of pupil mobility, and these are often related to the quality of their strategies to reduce absence and promote regular attendance. Regular attendance is a critical factor in ensuring that pupils are able to learn effectively, make good progress and stay safe. While there is a clear statistical link between attendance and levels of social deprivation, it is important that this does not detract from the school's determination to secure good attendance however difficult the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/5" class="indent">Inspectors exercise professional judgement when considering the extent to which overall attendance rates are affected by the poor attendance of a transient group of pupils. Inspectors evaluate the impact of the school's efforts to improve the attendance of pupils who are frequently absent and this is likely to be reflected in their judgement about the quality of the care, guidance and support provided by the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/6" class="indent">Many parents take extended family holidays during term time. Inspectors cannot ignore this type of absence and there are wide variations in how well this is managed by schools. When schools have built strong and productive partnerships with parents which help them to support their children's learning, holiday absence is less likely to be a serious problem. Positive and proactive action on the part of the school may then reflect favourably on the judgement about the school's leadership and management, including the specific judgement about the effectiveness of its engagement with parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/7" class="indent">Inspectors are sensitive to the particular circumstances of schools which include the children of service personnel. It is Ministry of Defence practice to grant a two-week period of rest and recreation for personnel returning from active deployment. For those with young families, this usually means them wanting to take their children out of school for all or part of this. Inspectors take account of the impact these arrangements when making a judgement on attendance in such schools. They also take account of unusual weather conditions, such as the prolonged periods of snow experienced in some areas during December 2009 and January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181W.11/8" class="indent">Detailed guidance on judging attendance is available on the Ofsted website at:</p>

Under Articles 23 to 46 of the TEU these types of decision are now in the form of Decisions of the Council. Like joint actions, council decisions are legally binding between the 27 member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.1188W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) came into existence in May 2007, merging the former Department for Constitutional Affairs and part of the Home Office. This means comprehensive and comparable data are only available for 2007 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/2">The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) collates data on consultancy expenditure as part of its Consultancy Value Programme which assists departments in driving greater value from consultants. The MoJ is currently collecting data on consultant expenditure for 2009-10. The results will be sent to the OGC in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/3">The Department's expenditure on consultants in 2008-09 was &#163;50 million. This figure is based on a manual data collection exercise completed for the period April 2008 to March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/4">The Ministry's expenditure on consultancy for 2007-08 was &#163;56 million and can be found in the link:</p>

	<p pid="a.1188W.5/6">Both the 2007-08 and 2008-09 figures reflect expenditure by MoJ headquarters, HM Courts Service, HM Courts Service Estates, Tribunals Service, Office of the Public Guardian, and the National Offender Management Service (except for the Probation Service). Refinements in the methodology for classifying expenditure in accordance with OGC taxonomy means that the 2007-08 and 2008-09 figures are not directly comparable at a detailed level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1188W.5/7">The OGC definition of &quot;consultancy&quot; is very broad. It can include professional services provided by lawyers, surveyors, architects et cetera and the employment of specialists on an interim basis, to implement project solutions, providing expertise for a defined period of time that is not available in-house.</p>

	<p pid="a.1189W.0/1">HMCS systems do not identify how much of the value of the outstanding balance relates to fines, penalty notices or compensation, this information could only be provided at disproportionate cost as it would require a manual search of all fine accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1189W.0/2">However HMCS systems can identify the total amount imposed within the last five years and the total value outstanding. The total value outstanding can relate to fines imposed in any previous period and includes financial penalties imposed a number of years ago during the period when fines could not be cancelled (2004-06) and financial penalties which are being paid by instalments. The total amount imposed and balance outstanding includes fines imposed in the magistrates and Crown courts, compensation, costs, victims surcharge and the value of unpaid fixed penalty notices that are transferred to HMCS for enforcement as a fine. The outstanding balance has risen through the application of a strict policy that only allows fines to be written off in certain circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.1190W.9/1">The aim of the tender process as stated in the Legal Services Commission's (LSC) response to consultation &quot;Civil Bid Rounds for 2010 Contract: A Consultation Response&quot; included the objective to</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.9/2" class="indent">'commission services that maintain service standards and ensure easier client access to advice'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.9/3">The LSC published a full impact assessment alongside its consultation response. Like the final policy, the full impact assessment was informed by responses to the LSC's formal 12-week consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.9/4">As part of the tender process for civil contracts starting later this year, matter starts have been made available equal to those used in the period September 2008 to August 2009. The tender process is not yet complete, however it is expected that over one million acts of assistance will be delivered during the current financial year and overall as a result no reduction in access to advice for clients is expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.9/5">Together with representative bodies (the Advice Services Alliance, the Legal Aid Practitioners' Group and Resolution) the LSC will be conducting a review of the outcomes of the tender process and will consider in detail any areas of concern identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1190W.9/6">Through the new Criminal Defence Service contract, the LSC has secured sufficient contracted providers to ensure that the safety net used by those that do not have their own solicitor-that is the duty rota scheme-at every police station and court are adequately staffed. Therefore, the most vulnerable will continue to gain access to legal advice and representation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1191W.2/1">Through the Access to Justice Act 1999, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) is tasked with maintaining the Community Legal Service for the purpose of promoting the availability to individuals of and, in particular, for securing (within the resources made available, and priorities set, in accordance with the Act) that individuals have access to services that effectively meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1191W.2/2">The recent tender process for civil legal contracts has sought to meet this objective. The tender process has not yet concluded and final numbers of legal aid providers delivering work under the new contract will only be known after the appeals and pre-contract verification processes are complete and as such no final assessment on the impact on the legal profession has taken place. Expenditure on civil legal aid is expected to remain unchanged as a result of the tender process and it is therefore not anticipated that this process will significantly affect the number of legal advisers employed overall although as not all organisations have been successful in their tenders it is likely that there will be some movement of legal advisers from unsuccessful organisations to successful ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.1191W.2/3">The new Criminal Defence Service (CDS) contract came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-14">14 July 2010</phrase>. The number of providers contracted to undertake general CDS work across England and Wales remained stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1191W.2/4">This contract introduced new standards for undertaking prison law work, to ensure that only those firms with suitably experienced fee earners would qualify for the contract. This has led to a reduction in the number of providers that are able to undertake prison law work. It should be noted that the vast majority of those that did not qualify for a contract had undertaken minimal numbers of cases in the past. The LSC are confident that the remaining contracted providers are more than able to meet the demand in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1202W.2/1">In 2006 the Prison Service settled 197 claims from prisoners who claimed that their drug detoxification treatment was inadequate. The claims concerned medical practice in prisons dating back to the late 1990s. Legal advice was that the standard of care they received fell short of acceptable medical standards and the Prison Service's guidelines for dealing with opiate dependent prisoners. On the basis of strong legal advice it was decided to settle these cases out of court in order to minimise costs to the taxpayer. If the claims had proceeded to trial they would have resulted in considerably more expense to the public purse. Each case was settled for &#163;3,807.10 (a total of &#163;749,998.7).</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.2/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and UKBA work closely together to ensure that those foreign national prisoners who have no right to remain in the UK are removed at the earliest opportunity. In 2009 NOMS and UKBA concluded a Service Level Agreement aimed primarily at better managing the number of time served foreign national prisoners (or immigration detainees) in prison and focused on improving the process for the management and removal of foreign national prisoners who met the criteria for deportation. A major element of this Service Level Agreement was the concentration of these prisoners within the male, category C estate. Foreign national prisoners with more than three months but less than three years to serve are allocated, where possible, to designated hub and spoke prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/2">The main aim of this policy is to improve joint working throughout the removals process by embedding UKBA staff in &quot;hub&quot; prisons, who in turn service &quot;spoke&quot; prisons. Reducing the number of prisons with small FNP populations allows for more effective case-working of the identified group by UKBA and creates centres of expertise in the prison system for managing those foreign national prisoners who are most likely to be removed. Prisoners also benefit from improved information and access to UKBA, as well as earlier resolution of their cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/3">In June 2008, the number of foreign national prisoners held in England and Wales stood at 11,498 (14% of the prison population). In June 2010, the number had fallen to 11,135 (13%). During the same period the total prison population rose from 83,194 to 85,002.</p>

	<p pid="a.1205W.8/1">The telephone calls of all prisoners are recorded and may be monitored, other than calls between prisoners and their legal advisers and the courts. Prisons refer to a range of guidance (as set out in the following list) when deciding whether to monitor the calls of a prisoner who has been convicted of a sexual offence. Some calls are monitored because of the offence the prisoner committed in order to protect the public. However, some telephone calls are monitored randomly or because of concerns about the risk that the prisoner poses to prison security. All of these situations may apply to a prisoner convicted of a sexual offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1208W.11/1">In October 2009, the Ministry of Justice began a site search for sites suitable for 1,500 place prisons in the priority areas of North West England, North Wales, West Yorkshire and Greater London. A number of sites in the North West have been put forward, including in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208W.11/2">We will look in detail over the coming months at the sentencing frameworks for adult and young offenders, as well as the full range of penalties available in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208W.11/3">Long-term decisions on prison capacity programmes will be taken in the light of these policy developments. We will ensure that we meet prison capacity requirements more efficiently to improve value for money for the taxpayer and contribute savings to help reduce the budget deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1210W.0/50">Reoffending rates shown here should not be used to make direct comparisons between different groups of offenders as there is no control for differences in offender characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1210W.0/51">Data on reoffending by ethnicity should be treated with caution as the ethnicity data are derived from an operational policing system and reflect the officer's view of the offender's ethnicity.

	<p pid="a.1213W.2/2">Destitute asylum seekers still awaiting a determination on their asylum claim are eligible to receive cash support under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. All asylum seekers whose applications have been fully determined and have exhausted their appeal rights are required to leave the UK as soon as possible. Those failed asylum seekers who are destitute and unable to leave the UK immediately due to circumstances beyond their control are provided with more restrictive cashless support under section four of the 1999 Act. It is section 4 for which the Azure card is provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.2/3">The system of section 4 support is integral to the maintenance of a fair and consistent system of immigration control. The limitations on section 4 support reflects its temporary nature, and are necessary to avoid creating an incentive for failed asylum seekers to remain in the UK and placing additional pressure on limited public funds.</p>

	<p pid="a.1213W.5/2">Where immigration officers are planning a visit all factors are considered.

	<p pid="a.1227W.2/1">The Government recognise that the use of security scanners may engage issues relevant to human rights. However, such rights are not absolute and the Government believe that the use of security scanners as an aviation security measure at UK airports is necessary, proportionate and legitimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.2/2">Security scanners have, been deployed in the interests of protecting national security, public safety and the prevention and detection of crime, and the Government believe that their use is consistent with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.2/3">The Government have received several responses from religious-based organisations to the public consultation on the interim code of practice for the use of security scanners in aviation security, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-19">19 July</phrase>. The Government are examining all of the responses before deciding on the next steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.2/4">The Code of Practice forms part of a Direction on airport operators made under the Aviation Security Act 1982. The penalties for failing to comply with a directed requirement are set out in the 1982 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.2/5">The Government assess that the only alternative that would reveal carefully concealed items would be an intimate hand search, conducted in private and which may involve the loosening and removal of clothing. The Government believe that this, by its nature, would be far more intrusive, and a much greater invasion of privacy, than the use of a security scanner. Such searches raise issues about the training, staff and resource burdens that carrying out such searches would impose on airport operators, and the impact on passenger throughput times at security checkpoints. However, this issue is being carefully considered in light of the public consultation before decisions are taken on the future use of security scanners.</p>

	<p pid="a.1236W.11/1">The British Dyslexia Association (BDA) made representations in summer 2010 regarding the introduction of 'independent driving' in to the practical driving test. The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has also received similar written representations from driving instructors who teach candidates with special learning needs. The agency then worked BDA to ensure that implementation arrangements will not discriminate against candidates with dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid="a.1236W.11/3">When developing proposals for independent driving DSA commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to conduct the independent trials, which included non-English speaking participants and participants with a disability. The majority of the participants perceived the independent driving exercises to be socially inclusive, but the participants who considered themselves dyslexic reported that they had found the independent driving exercises more challenging.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.11/4">DSA took into account potential difficulties that these groups may face when designing the independent driving tasks and further engaged with the BDA, who advised on the formatting of the supporting diagrams.</p>

The Railways for All programme, launched by the previous Government, is currently installing level access routes at 148 priority stations across the railway network, and this is in addition to major programmes of investment and the commitments in rail franchises. Coventry station itself has not been identified for enhancement, as lift access to platforms is already provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.1241W.0/3">The Government remain committed to improving access to rail travel. However, in common with other Departments we are carrying out a spending review which requires that we reassess a number of programmes for affordability.

Copies are available in the Libraries of the House. This indicated that the proposal would be likely to place a significant cost on the industry which could be. passed on to passengers through higher fares. There would also be enforcement costs which are expected to fall to the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.1241W.3/2">Since then the Transport Council of Ministers agreed significant changes to the original proposal which should reduce the cost to industry.

	<p pid="a.1243W.0/3">HS2 Ltd's proposals assume a potential maximum future line speed of approximately 250 miles per hour (mph), where route topographical, train performance and sustainability considerations would permit. However, the journey times and modelled benefits included in its report are based on current train technologies and therefore assume a maximum speed of 225 mph (subject to the same topographical and other considerations).</p>
	<p pid="a.1243W.0/4">This approach is broadly in line with current practice in Europe and Asia, where most major lines currently under construction or recently completed have been designed for a maximum line speed of 225 mph, but lines in development are being designed for eventual speeds up to 250 mph and 275 mph respectively. Shorter 'in-fill' sections of high speed route linking conventional lines generally continue to be designed for 160-200 mph.</p>

	<p pid="a.1246W.2/1">The Department for Transport has researched the effects of the introduction of widespread 20 mph limits in Portsmouth and has published some preliminary findings. These are at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http</a>://<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme4/interimeval20mphspeedlimits.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme4/interimeval20mphspeedlimits.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/3">The preliminary findings include that, in the areas covered by the 20 mph limits, recorded injury accident numbers have reduced from an average of 165 per year, during the three years before the speed limits were introduced, to 144 during the first year afterwards. This reduction of 13% is greater than the percentage fall in accident numbers nationally during the same period. A longer period after the introduction of the speed limits is likely to improve the robustness of the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/4">The Department has more recently received accident information for the second year after the implementation of the 20 mph limits. This indicates that the annual average of the number of recorded personal injury accidents during the two years after the limits were introduced was about 21% less than the average during the three years beforehand. Again, nationally the number of accidents has fallen during that period, but by a smaller percentage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/5">The Department has also assessed the reduction of actual speeds in the areas of Portsmouth covered by the 20 mph speed limits. On average the mean speeds have fallen by about 1.3 mph. Previous research has indicated that such falls in average speeds in urban areas are typically associated with reductions in the numbers of injury accidents of about 7% (5% per mph of average speed reduction), which is consistent with the accident numbers recorded in Portsmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/6">Further findings about the Portsmouth scheme are likely to be published soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1246W.2/7">The Department has not made an assessment of the effects on accidents of the Oxford scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.1246W.5/3">The Act places a duty on authorities to ensure that their land, or land for which they are responsible, is kept clear of litter and refuse in so far as is practicable. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Highways Agency has not met time scales for the cleanliness of its roads and verges, as time scales do not apply under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.1247W.8/2">The Highways Agency is responsible for managing the strategic road network in England. It carries out annual road surface condition surveys, principally to measure the levels of rutting, the ride quality, general surface condition and the skid resistance provided by the road surface in the wet. In addition, visual surveys and inspections are conducted regularly throughout the year to identify emergency repairs and to support future planned maintenance. Sections requiring potential maintenance are also further investigated to identify the road material quality and the overall structural aspects, as guided by the agency's standards and codes of practices. The agency also takes account of any maintenance issues raised by members of the public. Survey information is recorded either centrally in the agency's asset management systems and/or by the managing agents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1256W.5/3" class="indent">&#163;6.8 million for the Face-to-Face Debt Advice project (&#163;2.8 million in 2008-09, &#163;2 million in 2009-10, &#163;1.9 million in 2010-11);</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.5/4" class="indent">&#163;5 million in 2009-10 to the umbrella bodies for the Citizens Advice Service in England and Wales and in Scotland to increase bureaux opening hours to help meet an increase in the recession-driven demand for advice. Although advice is provided on all manner of issues, at least 50% relates to debt, benefits and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.5/5">Since 2005, BIS has provided around &#163;128.6 million (&#163;23.8 million in 2005-06, &#163;21.4 million in 2006-07, &#163;21.4 million in 2007-08, &#163;21.4 million in 2008-09, &#163;21.4 million in 2009-10 and &#163;18.9 million in 2010-11) of core grant in aid funding to the umbrella bodies for the Citizens Advice Service in England and Wales and around &#163;18.8 million (&#163;3.2 million in 2005-06, &#163;2.9 million in 2006-07, &#163;3 million in 2007-08, &#163;3.3 million in 2008-09, &#163;3.3 million in 2009-10 and &#163;2.9 million in 2010-11) in Scotland. This funding enables the umbrella bodies to provide business services to their customers-the national networks of Citizens Advice Bureaux-which in turn enable bureaux to provide front-line services to the public. BIS funding also enables both organisations to provide online advice direct to the public through the Adviceguide website. Again, although advice is provided on all manner of issues, at least 50% relates to debt, benefits and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.5/6">In addition BIS provides funding for Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) which gives advice on employment rights and responsibilities to both employers and employees. This includes its collective conciliation function, as well as individual conciliation, the ACAS Helpline and other training and advice. The allocation for 2010-11 is &#163;49.4 million, and spend so far is &#163;17.5 million. Over the previous four years spend has been:</p>

	<p pid="a.1256W.5/16">BIS also funds the unified Pay and Work Rights line, established in 2009, which provides information and advice about the national and agriculture minimum wage, employment agency regulations, gangmaster licensing and working time. Expenditure on the helpline in 2009-10 was &#163;1.2 million, including set up costs. Prior to 2009-10, advice on these issues was provided by a number of individual helplines run by different agencies across Government as part of their compliance and enforcement work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.5/17">In addition, BIS spent minimal staff costs on providing and maintaining information on the businesslink.gov and direct.gov websites.</p>

Because of the need for deficit reduction, we have also made a saving of &#163;200 million in HE budgets. We have refocused the University Modernisation Fund, announced by the pr places initially offered. We are also making efficiencies at university level. But the total funding we are making available to HEFCE for this year is still higher than that announced in the Council's Grant Letter of December 2009.</p>

Higher education courses provided by private institutions in the UK may be specifically designated to attract student support on an individual basis. They must all be accredited by a recognised UK awarding body such as a university, with the exception of the University of Buckingham which has its own degree-awarding powers. English-domiciled students attending these courses can apply for student support. The table which shows the number of approved student finance applications by English-domiciled applicants planning to study at private higher education institutions in academic year 2009/10 will be placed in the Library of the House.

	<p pid="a.1267W.2/1">Our proposals are for restructuring the delivery landscape for economic development. Replacing the regional development agencies (RDAs) with local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) will ensure that these partnerships better reflect the natural economic geography of the areas that they serve. Reorganising the delivery of economic development will ensure a focused targeted delivery of policy in areas where it can have the most benefit, allowing those locations which stand to benefit most from offshore wind to focus their attention on supporting the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1267W.2/2">We are currently considering proposals for LEPs, which were submitted in early September. In the meantime, we are working closely with the RDA network during the transition to minimise the impact on priority programmes including those supporting the offshore wind industry. Growing the offshore wind industry remains a priority for this Government and we will act to ensure that both inward investment and domestic firms wishing to move into this area continue to be supported.</p>
