	<p pid="a.1389W.6/1">We are currently consulting on the transposition of the EU batteries directive. When transposed, the directive will reduce the quantity of hazardous and non hazardous waste batteries going to landfill and increase the recovery of the materials they contain. Collection targets set by the directive for portable batteries are 25 per cent. by 2012, rising to 45 per cent. by 2016. The prohibition of incinerating or landfilling industrial and automotive batteries implies a 100 per cent. collection and recycling target for industrial and automotive batteries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.6/2">The consultation is due to close on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase> and the UK, along with all other member states, has a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">26 September</phrase> this year to transpose the Directive's provisions into national law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.6/3">Research and trials to provide evidence for the consultation and to investigate the best ways of implementing the batteries directive have been carried out on portable batteries. The waste and resources action programme (WRAP) is currently working in partnership with a range of local authorities and not-for-profit organisations that already run recycling collection services to pilot portable waste battery collection trials in the UK. Trials include establishing 'drop off' points at places such as supermarkets, as well as other methods of collection including at the kerbside.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.6/4">Supported by funding from DEFRA through the business resource efficiency and waste (BREW) programme and the devolved administrations, the trials form part of a wider effort to develop cost-effective ways for the UK to meetthe targets of the batteries directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1389W.6/5">The results of the various trials will be used to help Government identify the best mechanisms and most efficient methods of collecting batteries in line with directive targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1393W.6/1">There are no proposed new charges for domestic rubbish collection. The Government intend to allow five local authorities to pilot waste incentive schemes. Under these schemes those who make the most effort to reduce or recycle their waste would earn a rebate. For schemes which include a charging element, those throwing away the most residual waste could pay more. The impact on families with children could depend on several factors, including the design of individual schemes, the size of the household and, of course, the amount of waste each family throws away.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.6/2">DEFRA has not made any estimates of how waste incentive schemes will affect families with children. For illustrative purposes, the Impact Assessment, which is available on the DEFRA website, presented a distributional analysis which gives an example of how one type of scheme, in a local authority with particular characteristics, would impact upon families of different sizes and income levels. This assesses how financial transfers might feel to different types of households, with poorer households valuing these more highly. It does not present actual financial flows, as it was primarily included to show local authorities how they might account for impacts of the distribution of financial burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393W.6/3">The actual impact on the tax burden faced by families will depend on how the scheme is set up and how well families are able to respond to the price signal provided by the scheme. The example distributional analysis in the Impact Assessment was based on a separate study showing that larger households (e.g. families with children) tend to produce more waste overall. As can be seen in the Climate Change Bill, local authorities piloting a waste incentive scheme must take account of disadvantaged groups. It would be up to local authorities to decide whether families with children (and any other group in society) should be treated differently under a waste incentive scheme and, if so, how. My Department intends to work with stakeholders to develop guidance on this issue.</p>

In November 2005, we established the Creative Economy Programme which brought together DCMS, DTI (as it then was), industry representatives and government bodies such as the Arts Council, the UK Film Council and the Design Council. We will shortly launch a strategy document for the creative industries which will set out the challenges that government and industry will need to address in order to sustain and grow this vitally important sector of the economy.</p>

This group is developing a regional &quot;Creative Industries Manifesto&quot;, which will help raise the profile of the sector nationally and internationally; it will also work to bring key initiatives to the region, such as national centres of excellence or major events.</p>
	<p pid="a.1400W.8/4">In addition, since 1997, funding from the European Regional Development Fund has supported a number of projects, including business support and venture capital projects, related to the development of the creative industries in the region.

A copy of this letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.5/2">The definition of sport will continue to measure sport and active recreation such as recreational walking and cycling. From April 2008 the definition of sport will also include measurement of some lighter intensity sports and physical activities such as yoga, bowls and pilates for those aged 65 or over; as these activities place a degree of physical demand on that age group.</p>

Whether or not to run services on Christmas day and Boxing day is primarily a matter for the commercial judgment of Network Rail and train operators who are best placed to assess the potential costs and revenue.

An over three day injury is one where the injured person was required to be absent from normal (work) duties for more than three whole days (including week ends).

This contains details of the administration expenditure in Jobcentre Plus over the past four years since 2003/4. Not all costs can be accurately split between customer facing and non customer facing activities. However, the proportion of staff deployed on customer facing activities provides a good approximation of the proportion of costs spent on customer facing activities. This is because most costs are either staff or staff related.</p>

	<p pid="a.1422W.6/2">It is estimated that the more generous crediting arrangements will mean up to one million more people (around 90 per cent. of whom are women) will be accruing state second pension.</p>

HRP is awarded to people who receive child benefit for a child under six years old, carers who receive carer's allowance, and certain other carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1422W.6/4">The latest figures available (2003-04) show that in that year just under 1.9 million people in the UK qualified for state second pension because they had caring responsibilities.

	<p pid="a.1423W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-05">5 January 2008</phrase> the Bundu dia Kongo (BdK) announced that it wished to replace the elected political leader of Seke Banza territory in western Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with one of its members. The police arrested three members of BdK in the territory on the same day. Unrest followed as a group of about three hundred BdK members, some armed with stones and sharpened sticks, confronted the police in the town of Seke Banza. During this incident the BdK attacked the vehicle of a police commander. As the vehicle left the area it ran over and killed four members of the BdK. A police officer was killed during the violence and twenty-two other people were injured and treated in hospital. The area has been calm since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-05">5 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423W.9/2">The Government are concerned by these events. The UK supports the effective function of legitimately-elected political leaders in DRC. As the anniversary of the violent clashes in 2007 between DRC security forces and the BdK in the same region approaches, it is hoped that further violence can be avoided through a professional and well-planned response.</p>

I was encouraged by an exchange of prisoners between Israel and Hezbollah in October 2007 and hope that this will lead to more progress in the negotiations for the release of these soldiers.

During meetings between Syrian and UK Ministers since then we have consistently called on Syria to play a helpful role in Lebanon and the middle east more broadly.

Statements by Hizballah since the conflict appear to confirm Israel's claims that Hizballah has significantly rearmed. The UK remains seriously concerned by these reports and calls on all countries in the region, including Syria and Iran, to abide by their obligations under UNSCR 1701.</p>

However, you have requested data analysed by nationality and this is the basis on which this PQ has been answered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1431W.9/1">The trivial commutation limit is currently &pound;16,000 and will rise in stages to &pound;18,000 in 2010. The cost of raising the trivial commutation limit would depend upon a number of behavioural factors, though independent research by the Pensions Policy Institute published in June 2007 suggests the cost to the Exchequer from significantly raising the current limits would most likely be very high. Figures from the ABI show that many annuitised pots are below the &pound;16,000 ceiling for trivial commutation, which suggests the limits are already very generous.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431W.9/2">At PBR 2006 the Government announced that HMRC would discuss with interested parties concerns raised regarding the administration costs of paying trivial commutation lump sums under current rules. The Government is exploring how the current rules impact on the interests of individual pensioners, pension savers, and pension providers and how they fit with its wider objectives of encouraging pension saving to provide people with an income in retirement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1449W.5/1">Guidance issued to the national health service requires the provision of single sex accommodation, which can take a number of forms. NHS trusts may provide single rooms, single sex bays within a mixed ward, single sex wards or combinations of these types. We do not collect information on the number of trusts who have mixed sex wards per se.</p>
	<p pid="a.1449W.5/2">The NHS Operating Framework for 2008-09 includes a requirement for primary care trusts to agree, publish and implement stretching local plans for improvement, with identified time scales and monitoring mechanisms. The NHS Institute for Improvement and Innovation published guidance in December 2007 to support the NHS in delivering this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1468W.11/1">Since 1996, we have made good progress towards our targets on fuel poverty. Most recent figures show there are approximately 2.5 million households in fuel poverty in the UK in 2005. This is around four million fewer than in 1996, but represents an increase of 0.5 million households since 2004, reflecting the impact of rising energy prices on fuel poverty. While initiatives to tackle fuel poverty have helped millions of households, recent trends in energy prices present a significant challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.1472W.8/1">The Office of Fair Trading and Trading Standards Services will have a duty to enforce the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (CPRs) implementing the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. The Government believe that these enforcement arrangements suffice to adequately enforce the CPRs, including in relation to misleading copycat packaging design. OFT and Trading Standards Departments will have to act in a manner consistent with their duty to enforce the regulations. Indeed the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property notes that in this context the Local Authority Coordinators of Regulatory Services have said that once the UCPD is in place they will act on behalf of consumers by pursuing businesses who act improperly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1472W.8/2">For this reason the Government do not propose to allow businesses to enforce the regulations. However, it will review the position three years after the regulations come into force.</p>

	<p pid="a.1481W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's statement referred to plans made specifically by the FCO to recruit more specialists who speak Afghan languages and understand tribal dynamics. The FCO is currently looking at various options for recruiting and deploying such specialists. It is also training its political officers in local languages and is looking at how the UK-based Afghan diaspora might help contribute to reconstruction in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1481W.6/2">DFID Afghanistan does, however, recognise the importance of these skills for work in the south of Afghanistan and is talking to the FCO, MOD and Stabilisation Unit about the future staffing of Helmand, which will include provision of such specialists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1481W.6/3">DFID is also already working with organisations which have expertise in both areas. These include the Tribal Liaison Office (an Afghan NGO) which deploys a network of Afghan tribal experts across the southern provinces and a number of long-standing Afghanistan academic experts. These experts help inform the design and implementation of elements of DFID conflict prevention and governance programmes using both their knowledge of tribal dynamics and their Dari or Pashto language skills with the local population. DFID is also funding the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies (an Afghan NGO) to conduct tribal analysis and mapping to inform their work within each province.</p>

	<p pid="a.1482W.2/1">The Department for International Development is strongly committed to reversing the upward trend in carbon emissions. As a Department, we have undergone significant growth in recent years, and this has resulted in increases in our carbon emissions from DFID operations. We did, however, achieve a small overall reduction in kWh usage for 2006-07, relative to 2005-06 before weather correction. Allowing for weather correction, the increase was 1 per cent. over the previous year, the smallest increase since the baseline year of 1999-2000. We are investigating further investment to reduce our carbon emissions further.</p>

The UK worked hard throughout 2007 with Japan to raise the profile of water and sanitation, and will continue to do so during 2008.

	<p pid="a.1485W.0/1">The UK Government believe that the proposed industrial zones can help economic recovery given the right conditions. However, the capacity of the six Israel-West Bank crossings will need to be sufficient for processing both the eventual industrial estate traffic and existing trade, including by small and medium businesses. The World Bank is currently assessing the capacity of those crossings and we hope this will clarify whether any of the crossings will be a bottleneck for trade.</p>
