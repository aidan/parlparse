	<p pid=".207W.6/1">The aggregation of many of the Ministry of Defence's resources into central and tri-service budgetary organisations makes it impossible to provide a comprehensive picture of Royal Naval resources used on deployments such as those cited by the hon. Member. The number of personnel and amount of equipment used are, moreover, constantly changing in the course of a deployment lasting several months. It is estimated that around 180 RN personnel and their equipment were assisting the United Kingdom community at the height of the foot-and-mouth crisis. The bulk of the cost of RN resources will have fallen to the two distinct naval budget areas, those of the Commanders-in-Chief Fleet and Naval Home Command, which between them incurred additional expenditure of around &pound;200K. MOD recovered these additional costs from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.6/2">An estimated 3,000 RN personnel and their equipment were deployed on a typical strike day during the firelighters' industrial action in November 2002. It is too early to estimate how much the military assistance has cost to date, because the costs incurred since November have yet to be fully captured through the Ministry of Defence's central cost reporting system. The additional costs for the two budget areas referred to in the first part of this statement are expected to be of the order of &pound;800K for the period to <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November</phrase>. These costs will be recovered from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

The provision of such a facility is not currently assessed to be a high priority against other welfare needs or against the size of the service population who might benefit. The erection of such a mast could, in any event, only proceed with the prior approval of the Italian authorities, for both its construction and the use of a viable radio frequency.

	<p pid=".217W.1/2">DEFRA has commissioned the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to evaluate and further develop the ICE test (Immunocapillary Electrophoresis Test) with a view to its potential use in the pre-clinical diagnosis of BSE and scrapie. Work on this test has also been funded since September 2002 by the EU Commission with EU laboratories and the VLA under the Framework 5 Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.1/3">The technology has been transferred from the USA and the test is still in the development phase. It has not yet been applied to field samples on a larger scale commercial level. Technical issues have had to be resolved, further improvements are envisaged, and the implementation of field case testing has been delayed by Foot and Mouth Disease.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.1/4">To date the ICE method has been used on sheep within a controlled scrapie-infected flock. The test has been shown to identify positive animals at certain stages of infection before clinical disease develops. Further work is being done to determine the exact age range in which positive animals can be identified. Scrapie-free animals give negative results with the test. The method therefore shows promise as a diagnostic tool but its use on a wide scale will be determined by the final characteristics of the test, in particular the optimum time for the test to be used to identify TSE positive sheep. Further validation will be required when the final test protocol is defined.</p>
	<p pid=".217W.1/5">In the absence of other validated confirmatory pre-clinical tests, the results from ICE testing are being correlated with biopsy materials and eventual post-mortem confirmation of infection in the tested sheep. Facilities to expand the use of the test for field sampling are in place at the VLA and sample materials have been collected to use in a validated test. The preparatory stages for samples in this test are relatively complex and require several days to process; this may limit the number of samples that can be processed and the scale of use of the test. Currently the ICE method remains the only non-invasive live animal test that has been developed to the potential for identifying TSE-infected sheep or sheep flocks.</p>

	<p pid=".219W.0/2">There are 223 internal drainage boards (IDBs) in England, of greatly varying size, whose role is to secure the effective land drainage of their area. I believe that they generally perform this role well.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/3">The great majority of IDBs have produced policy statements setting out their approach to flood defence issues. IDBs have also generally played a full role in inspecting flood defences and watercourses, reporting the results to the Environment Agency as required under Defra's High Level Targets.</p>
	<p pid=".219W.0/4">The institutional arrangements for flood and coastal defence are currently being considered in the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review. While I see a continuing role for internal drainage boards I shall wish to ensure that their activities are compatible with wider Government policies and that they are organised in a way well fitted to the 21st Century.</p>

Our goal is to achieve an Israeli state free from terror, a viable Palestinian state based on 1967 boundaries. The Quartet is working on a roadmap to realise President Bush's goal of a final status agreement within three years. It represents best current chance of securing peace. I was pleased with the progress made at the London meeting, intended to support the Quartet's efforts, on Palestinian reform.

If North Korea begins to re-process the spent fuel rods at Yongbyon, it is possible that they could be used to produce nuclear warheads within a matter of months.</p>

Missiles are North Korea's most significant export and, by channelling profits back into the programme, an almost self-sustaining missile industry has been developed, supporting the requirements of both the domestic programme and the export market. North Korea has provided No Dong missile technology to Iran and Pakistan, enabling them to acquire their own versions. SCUD technology is also available for export, and has been sold to Iran, Syria, Egypt, Libya, UAE and Yemen. Over the last 15 years North Korea has exported at least 400 missiles</p>

We are working to ensure that Iraq becomes, in the Foreign Secretary's words, &quot;a stable, united and law abiding state, within its present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and providing effective and representative government for its own people.&quot;</p>

Bilaterally, we have informed the Russian Government that the suspension of food, water and energy supplies to the camps constituted, in our view, a forced closure and reminded Russia of her obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. The UK has also initiated and helped draft a number of EU demarches, calling for the closure of the camps to be stopped. We were therefore encouraged by President Putin's statement last month that the closures should be halted.

However, this is a humanitarian issue on which the UN Committee on Missing Persons, established in 1983, leads. We support the actions of the Committee and urge full co-operation with it.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.6/3">Such humanitarian concerns are among the many reasons why we urge both sides in Cyprus to achieve a settlement, based on the UN Secretary-General's proposals of <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-10">10 December</phrase>, by the UN deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February</phrase>.

	<p pid=".226W.3/2">The recommendation in the Working Group report is not that member states' bilateral embassies should work under the authority of the High Representative, but that the Commission's delegations should be re-badged as EU embassies/delegations, staffed by officials of the Commission, Council Secretariat and seconded national diplomats. These officials would work formally under the authority of the High Representative on Common Foreign and Security Policy issues, and under the authority of the Commission for other aspects of external action.</p>

No clear information is available on the quantities of match funding obtained by projects, nor the source of such match funding. However, a study by Glasgow Caledonian University for Entrust, the Scheme's regulator, has estimated that on average waste management and recycling projects have levered in approximately 34 per cent. funding in addition to Landfill Tax Credit Scheme funding. The Government recognises that the change from a tax credit scheme to public spending may reduce the availability of match funding but decided that the benefits of converting funding on waste management and recycling from tax credits to public spending outweigh any loss in match funding.</p>

The lack of transparency in the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee's report on the scheme in July 2002, and both the PAC and the National Audit Office have criticised the lack of information on the scheme.

	<p pid=".249W.12/2">The &pound;11.25 million Capital Modernisation Funding project to provide electronic registration systems in over 500 secondary schools with high truancy rates is a key initiative in the continuing drive to tackle truancy. There is no tender involved as schools are allocated funding through the Standards Fund and are free to contract with any suitable supplier.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.12/3">Since the first round of funding was released last May, schools have been working together with local education authorities to purchase and implement suitable systems in schools subject to the approval of the Department for Education and Skills. Currently a third of the targeted schools have had their proposals to implement systems agreed and we expect the remainder to be approved by August.</p>

	<p pid=".257W.12/1">There is no single measure of pensioner poverty. Poverty is a complex issue with various elements which affect many aspects of people's lives, including their income, living standards, health, housing and quality of environment.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.12/2">A report was commissioned by Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) as part of the research and evaluation strategy for the Government's New Targeting Social Need (New TSN) initiative. This report was published in May 2002. The primary aim of the report was to assess the potential of establishing a baseline of poverty. The report utilised data from the Continuous Household Survey and estimated that there were 81,000 individual pensioners living in households in the bottom 30 per cent. of gross household incomes.</p>
	<p pid=".257W.12/3">Ensuring that pensioners have a decent income is a key measure in combating pensioner poverty. At present, no pensioner has to live on less than &pound;98.15 a week under the minimum income guarantee (&pound;149.80 for couples). From April 2003 these rates will increase to &pound;102.10 for single pensioners and &pound;155.80 for couples.</p>

The protected rights balance is shown separately as well as being included in the total balance on your statement.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/11" class="italic">Illustration Assumptions</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/12" class="indent">The pension illustration overleaf is based on certain assumptions, which are that Contributions to Flexiplan continue at the current rate;</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/13" class="indent">the pension bought is guaranteed for five years, has an attaching 50 per cent partner's pension and increases in line with price inflation up to 5 per cent a year (up to 3 per cent a year on any protected rights):</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/14" class="indent">the average annual rate of inflation over the period to retirement is 3 per cent, investment returns over the same period will exceed your salary increases by2.5 per cent a year, and the cost of the pension at retirement is calculatedassuming future investments yields 3 per cent ahead of inflation; and</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/15" class="indent">for members who are a long way from retirement, the cost of the pension iscalculated using the assumptions described above and for members who areclose to retirement, the cost is in line with current market prices.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/16" class="italic">Future Events</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/17" class="indent">The assumptions used relate to the future. As this is uncertain, your actual Flexiplan benefits could differ significantly from this illustration. For example, you may leave Emap before reaching retirement, in which case your contributions would stop, oryou may simply alter the level of contributions to Flexiplan. The financial assumptions about the future (see note five) all have &quot;a significant effect on the level of the pension illustration. The investment return achieved by your account before retirement is very important, particularly for younger members. For example an average return of just 1 per cent per annum ahead or behind the illustration assumption could increase or decrease the resulting pension percentage by as muchas a quarter. It is important for older members nearing retirement, where volatility of returns becomes an important issue. This is when your account is switched graduallyinto special &quot;retirement units&quot; to provide more certainty of pension level.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/18" class="italic">Lump Sum Death Benefit</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/19" class="indent">The person to whom the lump sum death benefit is payable is at discretion of the Trustees so that inheritance tax does not have to be paid. It is therefore important that you complete a nomination form to let the trustees know to whom you would like the benefit to be paid. If you have not completed a form or would like to make a change, please contact the Benefits helpdesk.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/20" class="italic">Inland Revenue Maximum Benefits</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/21" class="indent">Flexiplan is approved by the Inland Revenue which means that all contributions and investment income are free to tax. This also means that the benefits provided underFlexiplan and contributions paid into your account are subject to Inland Revenue limits. Where practicable these limits have been taken into account in preparing thisstatement. However, if you have benefits retained in a pension arrangement of aprevious employer, it may be necessary to restrict the amount quoted.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/22" class="italic">Updates</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/23" class="indent">Regular updates of the projections are important, so an illustration of your Flexiplan benefits will be prepared for you at least once a year, even if you leave Emap. If you would like any further details please contact the Benefits Helpdesk.</p>

	<p pid=".262W.5/48">1. These figures show very little difference in the first four quintiles to those</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/49">published in the Pensioners' Incomes Series, which include pensioner units with earnings. Gross and investment income for pensioners without earnings in quintile five and the overall mean are slightly lower than for those with earnings, and these pensioners also contribute a higher proportion of their gross income to benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/50">2. The estimates are from the Family Resources Survey 1994&ndash;05 and 2000&ndash;01, which is the latest year for which results are available. The survey covers Great Britain and does not include people living in residential care or nursing homes.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/51">3. As with data from any survey, these estimates should not be treated as exact as they are subject to sampling error. In particular, great care should be taken when comparing groups with similar incomes, or looking at changes in income over a short time period, since random sampling fluctuations mean that estimates should be regarded as a broad indication of trends only.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/52">4. Incomes are in &pound; per week and are at 2000&ndash;01 prices.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/53">5. Estimates have been rounded to the nearest &pound;1. Estimates of less than &pound;0.50 are labelled '*'.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/54">6. The distribution of income is based on net unequivalised income (unequivalised income refers to the actual cash amount directly received by pensioner units), and has been calculated separately for singles and couples, i.e. estimates for pensioner couples show income for each quintile of the pensioner couples' income distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.5/55">7. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women). Pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.</p>

	<p pid=".269W.2/1">Planning Policy Guidance Note 3, &quot;Housing&quot;, introduced a series of tough new measures designed to meet the country's future housing needs in the most sustainable way possible, including a sequential approach which gives priority to re-using brownfield sites in urban areas in preference to developing greenfield sites. Local planning authorities should revise their plans to take account of the guidance in PPG3 and Regional Planning Guidance, and they should seek to do so as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".269W.2/2">In considering planning applications for housing development in the interim, before development plans can be reviewed, local authorities should have regard to the policy contained in PPG3 as material considerations which may supersede the policies in their plan.</p>

This includes &pound;500 per year towards travelling costs incurred during practice placements. The student's assessed liability for tuition fees will also be met.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.2/1">The national treatment agency, which was set up by Government in April 2001 to increase the quality and availability of drug treatment services, has recently published the models of care (MOC) guidance, which is in effect a national service framework for drug treatment services. The MOC proposes a whole-systems approach, which includes a role for education, training, employment and housing as key elements of care.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.2/2">As the target audience includes employers discussions took place between officials from the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that the guidance contained in the MOC is in line with guidance issued by the other government departments.</p>
	<p pid=".276W.2/3">Funding has also been specifically allocated for the re-integration of substance misusers into employment. The Department for Work and Pensions allocated &pound;40 million in 2001, spread over three years, to help drug users find employment in 31 pathfinder areas in England and Wales. In practice most drug treatment programmes should include help and advice on re-entering employment, where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".285W.5/1">The 2002&ndash;03 target of 30,000 removals per year was based on the public service agreement (PSA) to enforce the immigration laws more effectively by removing a greater proportion of failed asylum seekers. Latest information on performance against this target will be published in the &quot;Asylum Statistics Q4 2001 United Kingdom&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.5/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has always made it clear that, the target for 30,000 removals set for 2002&ndash;03 was aspirational and hugely ambitious. In order to reach and exceed 30,000 removals per year, we needed to remove about 2,500 people per month. This target was not attainable.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.5/3">The PSA in 2003&ndash;04 remains the same, ie to enforce the immigration laws more effectively by removing a greater proportion of failed asylum seekers. The proportion is measured by comparing the total number of refused asylum seekers (including dependants) removed from the UK with the total number of refused asylum seekers (including dependants) who have either exhausted all appeal rights or not appealed within 15 working days of the despatch of the refusal decision or meet the criteria for non-suspensive appeals.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.9/2">The CRB has a set of published customer service standards in relation to its response times for disclosure applications:</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/3" class="indent">Timeliness of service 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures issued within three weeks;</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/4" class="indent">95 per cent. of standard disclosures issued within one week.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/5">The CRB has so far been unable to meet these service standards.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/6">However, the Bureau's Service Improvement Plan is steadily delivering improved results. Over the last six full weeks before Christmas the CRB has been averaging around 45,000 disclosures per week, which is over double the weekly output issued by the police under the previous arrangements and compares to a weekly average of 24,000 in August and an average intake of 40,000 applications per week.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/7">The average turnaround time for disclosure applications is now about five weeks but it is recognised that there are a significant number of older outstanding applications which have taken much longer than this to process.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/8">A factor that is contributing to the bureau's inability to meet its service standards is that a small number of police forces have been unable to keep pace with the increase in the volume of applications. As some 90 per cent. of applications received by the bureau are for enhanced disclosures requiring a local police check, the capacity of the police to carry out their local searches has a significant impact on the overall process. To deal with this situation the police are recruiting and training additional staff. While this is well advanced the problem will persist for a while.</p>
	<p pid=".286W.9/9">The CRB is working with the police to address the situation. Pending the recruitment and training by the police of new permanent staff, the CRB has offered to provide staff to assist those small numbers of forces that have the greater need to improve capacity, and this assistance has been taken up in some cases. These additional local checks are not needed for standard disclosures whose processing times are therefore steadily falling.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.5/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) reviews its services continuously and uses market research and analysis of errors and complaints to shape its services.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/2">The guidance notes that accompany the Disclosure Application Form have just been reviewed and some fundamental changes have been made to simplify the process of completion. The notes are now in a graphical format and rely less on text; this has shortened the notes from 25 pages to six. It is envisaged that the improved guidance notes will make the Disclosure Application Form easier to complete. The new guidance notes will be issued in February.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/3">We have also recently taken a decision to no longer ask applicants to complete all sections of the Disclosure Application form. The relevant sections are E and F, which include details of applicants' bank account numbers, marital status. The Registered Bodies are being kept fully informed of the changes being made, and the CRB is providing ongoing guidance and advice to them to ensure they fully understand their role of ensuring that Disclosure Applications Forms are correctly completed before onward transmission to the CRB.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.5/4">An independent team, led by Patrick Carter, have taken a fundamental look at the strategy and operations of the CRB and its private-sector partner, Capita, and recently submitted their conclusions and recommendations to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. Depending on decisions taken on these recommendations changes made in application processes and related business processes may affect the Disclosure Application Form. However, there is no project under way at present in relation to the layout of the form pending the outcome of these deliberations.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.8/22">Many of the outstanding applications at any time will be the subject of requests to applicants for registered bodies for future information&mdash;for example, out of the number shown for end of December, 98,960 were back with customers for this reason. Others will have been recently received&mdash;for example, within the December total, 59,960 had been in the CRB less than three weeks and were hence not overdue.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.8/23">Unfortunately, it has not been possible to provide a breakdown between the different levels of disclosure because there are no IT procedures at present to extract this data from the CRB database. It is expected that this functionality will become available in subsequent system releases. As a general rule of thumb, 13 per cent. of all applications received are standard.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.8/24">The Criminal Records Bureau has neither received nor processed List 99 applications. There was a process initiated during summer 2002 where a manual off-line check was conducted on persons who were applying to work within the education sector. The CRB examined its systems and issued letters to employers in advance of the issue of disclosures to individuals. This exercise was conducted to assist education authorities with their recruitment and it was completed at the end of July. There were no service standards involved and therefore no question of these checks being outstanding at any time.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.2/18">Many of the outstanding applications at any time will be the subject of requests to applicants for registered bodies for future information&mdash;for example, out of the number shown for end of December, 98,960 were back with customers for this reason. Others will have been recently received&mdash;for example, within the December total, 59,960 had been in the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) less than three weeks and were hence not overdue.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/19">Unfortunately, it has not been possible to provide a breakdown between the different levels of Disclosure because there are no IT procedures at present to extract this data from the CRB database. It is expected that this functionality will become available in subsequent system releases. As a general rule of thumb, 13 per cent. of all applications received are Standard.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.2/20">The Criminal Records Bureau has neither received nor processed List 99 applications. There was a process initiated during summer 2002 where a manual off-line check was conducted on persons who were applying to work within the education sector. The CRB examined its systems and issued letters to employers in advance of the issue of Disclosures to individuals. This exercise was conducted to assist education authorities with their recruitment and it was completed at the end of July. There were no service standards involved and therefore no question of these checks being outstanding at any time.</p>

The CRB also wished, in line with the Modernising Government agenda, to place less reliance on paper documentation and greater reliance on electronic access to private and public sector databases. It has also sought to depend on face-to-face identity checks by registered bodies wherever possible.</p>

The volume of correspondence received by the Home Office is large and, regrettably, on occasions individual letters may become detached from the files. However, this is not a common occurrence, and when it happens we recognise that it causes inconvenience and delay and reflects poorly on the high standard of service that we normally provide.

	<p pid=".298W.0/1">There are two public offices at Croydon, the first being that of the Public Enquiry Office (PEO), which enters through the main entrance at the front of Lunar House.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.0/2">There are no records kept of the numbers of those who are initially queuing for the PEO when it opens at 8 am but the covered waiting area can hold between 500 and 600 people at any one time. However, between 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-08">8 January 2003</phrase> respectively there were 1,146, 1,153 and 827 people who attended PEO, of which 63, 80 and 72 people on each respective day could not have their cases dealt with immediately.</p>
	<p pid=".298W.0/3">The other queue is that of the Asylum Screening Unit (ASU), which currently enters through a temporary entrance at the rear of the building. According to figures initially compiled for ASU management, at 8 am on 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-07">7 January</phrase> there were respectively 120 and 300 people waiting in the ASU queue. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-08">8 January</phrase>, the date of the introduction of new asylum support arrangements, 80 applicants were waiting in the queue at 8 am. Around 75 applicants (most with addresses) were asked to return the following day.</p>
