	<p pid="c.472W.5/1">The information as requested is not readily available, and as such what information is available is given as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/2">On joining the EU, the new member states only received very limited allocations of quotas related to any fish stocks involving the waters within British fishery limits. Based on the information reported by these new and the existing member states on the activity by the new member states vessels in 2004, no reported catches of quota stocks involving the areas covered by British fishery limits took place. UK fisheries Departments have details related to activity by such vessels when it results in landings of fish at a UK port. For 2004, these show that while there were landings by some Polish vessels into the UK, they did not involve any activity within British fishery limits.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/3">Information is available from the UK fishing vessel monitoring system, which records observations of UK and fishing vessels registered in other countries while present within British fishery limits. These observations are based on satellite monitoring information for larger vessels and also aerial and naval sightings of vessels. The satellite reporting system does not cover the full fleets of the member states in question, but does cover the larger vessels that are more likely to make the journeys required to fish in UK waters. Similarly the system records the location of vessels but not if they were actually fishing at the time of the report. Based on the overall vessel monitoring reports available, since the accession of the new member states on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, there have been only three vessels from the new member states observed as present within British fishery limits&mdash;one each from Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.</p>

	<p pid="c.473W.0/1">The Environment Agency are responsible for enforcing the new regulations and it has confirmed that, in some circumstances, it will consider sub-contractors working at construction sites to be mobile service operators. The agency would normally expect a construction company producing hazardous waste at a construction site to notify those premises. However, where a producer is genuinely carrying out a mobile service at a site, such as a painter and decorator, the mobile service provisions would apply as long as that person produces less than 200kg at those premises in any period of 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.0/2">As far as the tenure restriction (i.e. that the operator of the mobile service neither owns nor occupies those related premises) is concerned, the interpretation of the regulations is ultimately a matter for the courts. The term &quot;occupies&quot; is not defined in the regulations and it will therefore carry its ordinary meaning. In the Government's view, it would normally refer to the person in occupation and in many cases that will be the tenant or licensee of the premises. The effect would be that any contractor who is a tenant or a licensee would not satisfy the mobile service tenure restriction and would need to notify the premises. However, a sub-contractor attending a site to carry out a specific task (without occupying the site) would be able to operate under the mobile service provisions as long as they produced less than 200kg of hazardous waste at that site in any period of twelve months.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.0/3">The final regulatory impact assessment which assessed the impact of the regulations on a range of businesses and industry notes that the Environment Agency estimated that there would be 110,000 notified sites in year one. This estimate is based in part on the number of sites producing and consigning special waste under the previous regime. In so far as construction sites consigned special waste under the special waste regime, they will be included in the estimate of notifications under the hazardous waste regulations.</p>

The need for urgency is underlined. Reflecting the Gleneagles communiqu&eacute; on Africa, the Document reaffirms the central principle that developing countries must take primary responsibility for their own development.

On the G8 proposal for 100 per cent. debt stock cancellation, the International Development Association (IDA) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) components of this were agreed by the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF, and the approval process is under way in the African Development Bank. Progress continues on full implementation and financing of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.

	<p pid="c.478W.5/1">DFID has not made its own assessment of the 2004 locust infestation, but an independent review of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) regional control operation is being planned and will include an assessment of the appropriateness of the technical response, which will be important for the preparation of future campaigns. DFID provided &pound;1.5 million to the operation, which covered Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Chad.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.5/2">Fortunately, cold weather in North Africa earlier this year has helped to diminish breeding capacity so there has not been a repeat of the large swarms seen in 2004, but we will of course, continue to monitor the situation carefully. The FAO recently stated that the risk in the Sahel this year is low.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.5/3">In Southern Africa and the Horn, DFID is pioneering longer-term safety net programmes as a means of combating structural, predictable hunger. We hope that the lessons emerging from these experiences can provide pointers to steps that could be taken in West Africa by Governments and development donors.</p>

	<p pid="c.480W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. Michael Meacher, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-12">12 October 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.480W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the average income of each decile of earnings has been in each year since 1996&ndash;97; and what the real terms annual growth in income of each decile was between 1996&ndash;97 and the latest date for which this information is available. (16358)</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.3/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). Prior to 1998 average earnings were estimated from the New Earnings Survey (NES), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for ASHE and NES tables. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.3/5" class="indent">Table 1 attached below contains statistics on earnings from the NES from 1986&mdash;1998 and from ASHE for the years 1998&mdash;2004. In table 2, the figures from table 1 are expressed in 2004 prices by uprating with the Retail Price Index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.3/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.491W.8/1">Her Majesty's Prison Service does not tolerate corruption by its staff and is totally committed to eradicating this wherever it occurs. A professional standards strategy was introduced in February 2003 in order to promote and support a culture that is hostile to corruption. The strategy includes a system that enables the reporting of wrongdoing and provides support for individuals who do so. It also lays out a policy framework and practical advice for gathering information and developing intelligence on staff suspected of wrongdoing. The Prison Service also has in place robust policies setting out how wrongdoing must be investigated and how staff disciplinary matters are to be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="c.491W.8/2">In order to ensure that these procedures are effective, two comprehensive reviews are currently being undertaken. The first is a review of current arrangements and performance on professional standards issues. The second is a review of the Code of Discipline with particular focus on improving the quality and timeliness of all of the service's investigations. Both reviews are due to report in December 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.503W.7/1">Business Link provides information and impartial support to new and existing businesses. It provides quick and easy links to a broad range of private, public and voluntary business support services. In 2004&ndash;05, Business Link provided support to over 670,000 businesses. Nearly 500,000 of these were existing businesses, the remainder, individuals thinking of, or in the process of, starting up a businesses. Business Link services are available locally in England by calling 0845 600 9 006.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/2">The national website <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a> provides free access to all relevant information, guidance, funding and training from Government and the business sector. As one of the leading sites for small business, it has more than 750,000 visits every month from individuals involved in business.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/3">In addition, a range of specific business support products is in place aimed at small and medium size companies. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/4" class="indent">The small firm loan guarantee which underpins loans to businesses lacking sufficient collateral to access commercial loans;</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/5" class="indent">The grant for research and development which is available to help businesses carry out R and D that could lead to a technologically innovative produce or process; and</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/6" class="indent">Support for implementing best business practice, taking the form of a free diagnostic run by a Business Link adviser, with subsidised consultancy for selected projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/7">Regional venture capital Funds have been set up in each of the nine English regions to address the equity gap encountered by small businesses with high growth potential. Government have also published&mdash;in print and on-line&mdash;a &quot;No-Nonsense Guide to Government rules and regulations for setting up your business&quot;, and separate no-nonsense guides to &quot;Small Business Funding and Finance for High Growth Companies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/8">Following the devolution of the local management of Business Link to the nine regional development agencies in April, the small business service is working with the agencies to develop a national framework to ensure the continued delivery of an effective Business Link service. Essentially, this is being developed as a strong national brand, delivered locally, and managed at regional level. A core set of Business Link branded services will be offered to businesses, regardless of their location. Once agreed, these will be rolled out in each region during 2005&ndash;06. At the same time, RDAs will be making regional decisions about business support priorities and structures for the future, to ensure these core services are delivered in a way which meets local and regional priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/9">One example is the manufacturing advisory service which has proved popular with manufacturers, has helped make significant improvements in the productivity of many firms, and is managed by each regional development agency, with primary access via the local Business Link.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/10">In addition, Government are:</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/11" class="indent">Enhancing the on-line services available on <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink. gov.uk</a> to include a &quot;start-up journey manager&quot; which will provide guidance on the processes required to start up and develop a business;</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/12" class="indent">Establishing a pathfinder round of enterprise capital funds to improve the availability of risk capital to small but potentially high growth businesses;</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/13" class="indent">Launching a supplier route to Government web portal which will improve small business access to public sector procurement opportunities by advertising lower value procurement contracts on line; and</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/14" class="indent">Targeting the small firms loan guarantee at start-ups and early stage businesses in improvements to the scheme which will be implemented later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/15">We are also taking steps to promote new businesses and enterprise by supporting the second national enterprise week in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> to raise enterprise awareness among 14&ndash;30 year olds and pointing people to sources of further advice. In addition, a national council for graduate entrepreneurship has been established with its &quot;Flying Starts&quot; programme aimed at inspiring students and recent graduates about enterprise. By the end of the year, around 3,000 will have participated in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/16">We are working with leaders in key industry sectors to promote ambition and excellence, there is close co-operation between regional development agencies and new regional skills partnerships, and the Department for Education and Skills is investing &pound;60 million each year in enterprise education for 14&ndash;16 year olds. We are also promoting social enterprise which now makes a significant contribution to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.7/17">Small businesses make a major contribution to the health of the economy, helping to boost productivity, increase competition and innovation, and generating employment, which is why the Government's aim is to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business.</p>

	<p pid="c.511W.5/1">The Department is monitoring the situation. There is a generally accepted view that, with no changes to the existing refineries, Europe will be short of about 50 million tonnes of diesel per year after 2012. Existing UK refineries have been developed to meet the demand for mainly petrol that was prevalent in the 1980s. Europe already has an excess of petrol and other market outlets are limited. Further investment in existing refineries could address some of the imbalance.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.5/2">A further solution to the problem is to develop refineries to process heavy oil. This not only makes more diesel and jet fuel, relative to gasoline, but also gives access to oil supplies that are more readily available and cheaper than light, sweet crude.</p>

	<p pid="c.512W.2/2">Since 2000 we have focused on the priorities set out in the DTI SD strategy, for example the Energy White Paper of 2003 set out four new goals for energy policy, including to put the UK on a path to cut carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.2/3">Other priorities drawn out in the strategy were sustainable consumption and production (SCP), corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Greening Government.

Work on Greening Government is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.2/4">SD is being integrated into regulatory impact assessments (RIAs). RIAs are produced and published for all new proposals with significant public or private sector impacts. The National Audit Office will start to look at the SD aspects included in RIAs from 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.8/1">The transmission issues working group (TIWG) report issued by the DTI in June 2003 contained a number of scenarios for connecting renewable energy generation to the GB network. It assumed that no more than 1.1GW of onshore wind generation would be built onshore in England and Wales. It therefore estimated connection costs for a range of renewable generation scenarios in Scotland. The costs for 2GW, 4GW and 6GW (of all renewable technologies) were estimated at &pound;520 million, &pound;1235 million, &pound;1495 million respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/2">In addition the Carbon Trust and DTI renewables network impacts study published in April 2004 estimated the costs of reinforcing the network in Scotland and the Scottish-English interconnector to connect 72 per cent. of the 2010 target to be in the order of &pound;1.0 billion to &pound;1.4 billion.</p>

	<p pid="c.515W.3/1">&quot;Playing with sounds&quot; is a set of phonics teaching materials designed to support teachers and practitioners working with children in the foundation stage and year 1. It emphasises phonics as the first approach to decoding and encoding, and primarily supports blending of different sounds to support reading and segmenting to support independent spelling and writing.</p>
	<p pid="c.515W.3/2">It is split into seven steps, beginning with early phonological and rhyme awareness training, moving on to teaching phoneme-grapheme (sound letter) correspondences through sounding and blending for reading, and segmenting for spelling and writing, and progresses to the long vowel sounds including the fact that some vowel sounds can be represented in more than one way and that sometimes the same grapheme is used to represent different sounds.</p>

	<p pid="c.516W.5/1">The Department has commissioned an independent five-year evaluation of the Academies Programme from PricewaterhouseCoopers reporting finally in September 2007. The Second Annual Report from the Evaluation of the Academies Programme demonstrated that academies are overwhelmingly popular with parents and pupils, and that they have made a significant difference to the teaching and learning culture from their predecessors. We also have evidence from examination results and Ofsted, including Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools who has said that</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;in some cases, what has been achieved in a short time is nothing less than remarkable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/3" class="italic">(a) Pupils:</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/4" class="indent">12 out of the 14 academies with students taking GCSEs in 2005 improved their results compared with the last year of the predecessor school;</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/5" class="indent">The average annual increase in the percentage of pupils gaining five grades A*-C at GCSE in academies is over 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/6" class="indent">At Key Stage 3, the rate of increase in pupils gaining level 5+ between 2004 and 2005 is higher in each subject than schools nationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/7">In addition, Ofsted have conducted 13 monitoring visits to academies finding that five academies were making good progress and most were making at least satisfactory progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/8" class="italic">(b) Teachers:</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/9" class="indent">The PwC Second Annual Report found that three quarters of staff agreed that &quot;the principal encourages teachers to develop themselves professionally&quot;, though staff work load was found to be generally heavier in academies.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/10" class="italic">(c) Local communities:</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.5/11" class="indent">PwC found that it is too early to assess the effect academies have had on community involvement, though academies had the clear intention to bring about community involvement and regeneration. Some academies have established pupil-run commercial enterprises, providing a range of services directly to the local community. It is also clear that academies are popular locally and the majority are over-subscribed. In September 2005 748 parents applied as first choice for the 180 year seven places at the City of London Academy, Southwark and 3,246 named the academy as one of their choices.</p>

	<p pid="c.525W.2/1">The recent 14&ndash;19 Education and Skills White Paper clearly states that the reforms it sets out are vital to our economy by equipping young people with the skills employers need and that all learning programmes should have clear progression routes to further learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/2">We believe that a strong grounding in functional English, maths and ICT are essential skills that all young people need to participate effectively in everyday life, including the workplace. To secure these skills we are toughening GCSEs so that, in future, no-one will be able to get a higher grade in English and maths without achieving mastery of the functional basics. We are also introducing a new general diploma to recognise the achievement of those who achieve five good GCSEs or equivalent&mdash;including English and maths.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/3">We are continuing work to reform mathematics, as proposed in our response to Professor Adrian Smith's inquiry, improving motivation and progression to advanced level. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/4" class="indent">a newly structured GCE introduced for first teaching from September 2004;</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/5" class="indent">replacing the three-tier mathematics GCSE two-tier qualification to enable all learners to have access to a grade C pass;</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/6" class="indent">development work on a curriculum and assessment &quot;pathways' model that covers entry level to level 3 of the National Qualifications Framework; and,</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/7" class="indent">trialling of guidance material for an extension curriculum at KS3 and KS4.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/8">The Ten Year Science and Innovation Investment Framework published last year set out the our strategy for sustaining a strong supply of scientists and engineers. The new programme of study for science at Key Stage 4 being introduced from next September will help pupils to understand key scientific concepts and scientific and technological developments in society.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/9">To ensure that this is successful, the key stage 3 review will:</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/10" class="indent">strengthen the emphasis on English and mathematics, in particular by expecting schools to focus systematically on those who arrive from primary school without having reached the expected standard in the Key Stage 2 literacy and numeracy tests, continue to publish national test results and introduce a new on-line test of ICT skills;</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/11" class="indent">introduce similar changes in science by slimming down the science Key Stage 3 curriculum to make it more manageable and focus on the key conceptual underpinnings of science, as well as its excitement and relevance.</p>

For this, head teachers and teachers need the right mix of skills and knowledge, and the confidence to use them.</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.2/2">Our Make The Difference anti-bullying conference programme which ran from 2003&ndash;04 in each of the nine Government Office regions was targeted at head teachers. The conferences celebrated and shared good practice in preventing and addressing bullying and offered all schools an opportunity to learn at first hand from the very successful. The conference workshops supported schools in addressing aspects such as homophobic bullying, which many schools can find especially challenging.</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.2/3">The Department has also developed a Personal Social Health Education Continuing Professional Development video which shows good teaching practice, this covers the handling of sensitive issues including sexuality and homophobia.

	<p pid="c.527W.5/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) funds all learners at published national rates up to but not exceeding the maximum contract value that each learning provider negotiates for each academic year. The LSC fulfilled its obligation to fund all learners through the contracts agreed at the start of 2004/05. However, it became clear earlier this year that some providers would exceed their maximum contract value due, in the main, to larger programmes for learners, better retention and higher than planned levels of achievement. The LSC was keen to reward providers for the improvements made and a further &pound;38 million was made available by the Department to the LSC. As a result the LSC was able to make additional payments to providers who exceeded their agreed maximum contract value calculated at 50 per cent. of the published national rate for existing learners and in addition to fund new apprentices aged 16 to 18 at the full rate. Although we are aware that some providers were not content with this, we are confident that the LSC has treated them fairly.</p>

	<p pid="c.528W.2/1">A Contextualised Value Added (CVA) measure is being, introduced for all DfES and Ofsted school improvement and accountability purposes. In addition to prior attainment, CVA also takes account of a range of other factors that impact on performance but that are outside a school's control, such as gender, ethnicity, SEN status, and levels of pupil mobility and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="c.528W.2/2">The model has been developed in consultation with schools, local authorities, Ofsted, and academics and other professionals in the field. Taking account of a much broader range of factors improves the way we measure school effectiveness by allowing us to consider the impact each school makes despite the particular circumstances of its intake.</p>
	<p pid="c.528W.2/3">CVA has been incorporated into the 2005 Pupil Achievement Tracker and Ofsted's PANDAs for Key Stages 2, 3 and 4. Also we are currently piloting its inclusion in the Achievement and Attainment Tables.</p>

	<p pid="c.531W.0/1">The cost of transforming the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) to the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), with an expanded remit, was &pound;85,222. This includes research, re-branding and new office signage. Some additional cost was incurred in taking legal advice. The benefits deriving from the TDA's new remit, which now includes responsibilities for training and development of the whole school work force, are considerable.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.0/2">The TDA has also taken on the functions of a Sector Skills Council. The cost of setting up a distinct Sector Skills Council would have been significant. The re-branding of the TTA has therefore saved a considerable sum of public funds.</p>

	<p pid="c.537W.2/1">Vaccine specifically against a pandemic strain of influenza virus needs to be developed to match that particular strain. This work can only be done once that strain has emerged and been identified, although preparation can shorten the lead-in time. We are working closely with manufacturers, the World Health Organization, the European Commission and other countries to ensure that a vaccine can be developed as quickly as possible once a pandemic flu strain emerges. Departmental officials have met with representatives from six major manufacturers to discuss how to minimise the delay in production and secure early access to vaccine for the United Kingdom population.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.2/2">Maintaining health services will be key in reducing the impact of a possible flu pandemic and healthcare workers may need to be prioritised for vaccine. As part of our ongoing work on preparedness we have invited manufacturers to tender for a contract to supply a limited amount of H5N1 vaccine. This vaccine would be based on the strain currently circulating in South East Asia and could offer some protection against an H5N1 flu strain. This strategic stockpile could be used as a first line of defence for priority groups, such as NHS workers, while a vaccine against the exact flu strain is manufactured. Experts will also be able to carry out further clinical studies on the H5N1 vaccine to learn more about how it works against the virus.</p>

	<p pid="c.537W.5/1">Avian influenza (bird 'flu) is continuing to circulate in South East Asia and other countries. In the period of December 2003 to September 2005, this H5N1 strain of the flu virus has infected 115 people in four countries, 59 of whom have died. In order for the avian flu to develop into a pandemic, the virus would need to mutate to become more transmissible between people. To date, there have been very few examples of person-to-person spread. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the evidence suggests that &quot;the viruses are continuing to evolve and pose a pandemic threat&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.5/2">Once a pandemic has emerged and spread beyond the source country the likelihood of the United Kingdom remaining unaffected is extremely remote. That is why we published the UK influenza pandemic contingency plan in March 2005 and are continuing to develop preparedness plans. We are also working with countries and institutions internationally to share and develop our planning.</p>

	<p pid="c.539W.8/1">The United Kingdom Government works closely with international partners, including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to tackle infectious diseases. It has implemented WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), which were agreed in 1969 and subsequently amended and which are designed to prevent the international spread of infectious disease. In common with other WHO members it is currently considering implementation of the new IHR adopted by WHO in May this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.8/2">In addition, the UK Government have participated in exercises with international partners to test plans for the handling of outbreaks of infectious disease such as smallpox and plague. Exercises on the handling of smallpox and pandemic influenza will take place with European Union partners later this month and in November.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.8/3">There are no powers in health legislation to ban entry to the UK. Once an infected or infectious person has reached a country, there could be risks to other travellers in merely banning his entry and taking no action to prevent his infecting others. Accordingly, the current IHR provide, among other things, for the medical examination of travellers (Article 36) and for infected travellers to be isolated (Article 38) or put under surveillance (Article 39). Those provisions are reflected in England (and Wales) in the Public Health (Aircraft) Regulations 1979 and the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1979.</p>
	<p pid="c.539W.8/4">Repatriation of UK nationals is a matter for my right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary (Mr. Straw). If a serious outbreak were to occur, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in close consultation with the Department would issue travel advice offering guidance to UK nationals on travel to and from the affected country.</p>

	<p pid="c.545W.2/1">The proposed regulation seeks to address the use in the labelling and advertising of foods of nutrition claims, such as &quot;low fat&quot; and &quot;sugar free&quot;, and health claims such as &quot;helps maintain a healthy heart&quot; and &quot;good for your bones&quot;. Such claims can be useful in helping consumers make healthy eating choices, but only if the claims are true and not presented in a way which undermines advice on healthy diets and lifestyles. At a time when there is increased concern over obesity and diet related diseases, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, an appropriate level of control over nutrition and health claims is of clear public health benefit.</p>
