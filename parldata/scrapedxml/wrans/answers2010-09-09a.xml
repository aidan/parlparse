This already includes guidance encouraging the use of lower rolling resistance tyres. The increased availability of objective information on tyre rolling resistance, as required by EU Regulation 1222/2009, will help support these decisions. Purchasing decisions are ultimately a matter for individual Departments and agencies to take bearing in mind their own budgets and the benefits of different technologies within their specific operation.</p>

Officials are working with the MLA to discuss the transfer of a number of existing programmes, including Renaissance in the Regions. MLA's allocation for 2010-11 is &#163;62.6 million, however, until discussions on the transfer of programmes have been completed, it is not possible to estimate the total scale of savings per year.

	<p pid="a.620W.3/1">On current plans, the Queen Elizabeth (QE) class aircraft carriers do not have an electro-magnetic catapult system in their design, as their initial configuration is for the operation of Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft. The US has developed the Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for their CVN-78 programme. The adaptable nature of the QE class design would enable the fitting of an electro-magnetic catapult in the future, should that become a UK requirement; this would be capable of launching a number of aircraft types, including the Rafale M.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.9/2">For over a year the Ministry of Defence (MOD), together with the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN), has been exploring with partners in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard how best to develop a new governance construct for the Historic Dockyard that builds on the strengths of the current arrangements, reflects current realities and provides a strong base for handling future challenges. As part of this process of change, the NMRN and the MOD have announced their intention to withdraw from the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.9/3">The assessment of any change within the governance structure of the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard is a matter for the boards of trustees of the individual attractions. I would certainly hope that the individual museums will be able to reach agreement with the National Museum on a new construct, and I understand a process of dialogue is continuing. Each trust is free to make its own decision on the nature of future arrangements in the Dockyard.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.9/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced a major overhaul of capital expenditure on schools spearheaded by the capital review led by Sebastian James. To ensure that buildings are built on budget and on time, and to ensure that a higher proportion of capital investment gets rapidly to the front line, the announcement included the ending of a major part of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. BSF developments are being maintained for three groups of schools:</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/3" class="indent">those in a local authority area's initial BSF scheme where Financial Close has been reached;</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/4" class="indent">the first projects due to be taken forward in a local authority area where Financial Close has not been reached but where very significant work has been undertaken, to the point of appointing a preferred bidder at &quot;close of dialogue&quot;; and</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/5" class="indent">some schools with planned projects subsequent to their authority's initial scheme-projects with Outline Business Cases approved before <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/6">This means that the projects at Chesterfield High School and Crosby High Special School have stopped. Aintree Davenhill School is a primary school, and BSF did not fund projects at primary schools. The Primary Capital Programme funds primary school projects, and its operation is different from BSF's-local authorities prioritise funds that the Department for Education allocates.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/7">Sefton was allocated &#163;9.6 million for 2008-11. According to information provided by the local authority, the first phase of Aintree Davenport is a &#163;2 million refurbishment funded from its Primary Capital Programme allocation and which is due to be finished this year. The Department for Education does not hold information relating to subsequent phases of this project; it is for the local authority to make decisions about its priorities for primary investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.9/8">Plans for future Government funding for primary schools will be included in the capital review announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July 2010</phrase> by the Secretary of State.</p>

We have had a number of representations about such a curriculum. As our document &quot;The Coalition: our programme for government&quot; makes clear, we intend to allow schools more freedom over the curriculum: we believe that the approach which the previous Government proposed was too prescriptive in terms of how teachers should teach. We were also deeply concerned about the proposed move away from teaching distinct subject disciplines at primary level.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.8/2">We want to ensure that our national curriculum is a properly international curriculum that reflects the best collective wisdom we have about how children learn, what they should know and how quickly they can grow in knowledge. We want to arrive at a simple core, informed by the best international practice, which will provide a minimum entitlement for pupils and which can act as a benchmark against which parents can ask meaningful and informed questions about progress. We will announce our detailed plans for reviewing the curriculum in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.633W.0/1">It has never been the case that convictions have been based solely on the DNA evidence, including that obtained through the low copy number technique.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.0/2">In November 2006 the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) set up a multi-agency group to consider and oversee reanalysis of all low copy number samples analysed by the FSS prior to September 2005, this was referred to as Operation Cube. Under this operation the police service and Forensic Science Service (FSS) Ltd identified 4,841 samples that required re-analysis. The FSS undertook this work, free of charge, and 885 new DNA profiles were obtained. These profiles related to 342 criminal investigations across a range of crime. The results of the re-analysis have been reported to police forces and they have taken action based on these results. There were 15 cases with the potential for new and significant lines of inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.633W.0/3">Only two of the 15 cases have resulted in prosecution and conviction. In both cases the re-analysed DNA evidence was made available to the defence. But in neither case did DNA play a significant part. One conviction was quashed under appeal, through evidence unconnected to DNA. An appeal in the other case was unsuccessful and I am advised that, although the DNA analysis reinforced earlier findings, the DNA evidence as a whole had a very limited impact upon the judgment. In one other case, the re-analysis led to the elimination of persons previously suspected of, but not charged with, the crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/1">Information relating to an arrest for a recordable offence, together with the subsequent outcome, is recorded on the police national computer (PNC). This includes both 'not guilty' verdicts and decisions taken by the police or Crown Prosecution Service to take no further action against an individual. It is currently the policy of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to retain this information for 100 years from the subject's date of birth.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/4">Operational guidance supporting the code states that records should be reviewed and disposed of when there is no longer a policing purpose for retaining them. This decision is the responsibility of the chief police officer, as the data owner. Part 5 of the Police Act 1997 requires that all information held in police records must be considered for disclosure. If, in the opinion of the chief police officer concerned, the information is considered relevant to the post applied for and ought to be included on the certificate, then it must be disclosed. Information on persons cleared of criminal charges may be disclosed on this basis, but is not routinely disclosed on a CRB enhanced disclosure.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.0/1">The specific management of fisheries in Scotland is a devolved matter. However the UK shares the Commission's ambition for radical reform of the common fisheries policy to achieve healthy fish stocks, a prosperous fishing industry and a healthy marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.0/2">The priorities for reform are for simplified and de-centralised decision making, moving away from the micro-management of fishermen's activities; a properly designed system of rights-based management that will give fishermen the freedom to engage in rational economic activity and applied to all, with safeguards for certain parts of the fleet where necessary; greater integration of fisheries with other marine policies, with fisheries no longer isolated from other marine users; and an end to the wasteful practice of discarding fish, with reform providing the incentives and regulatory framework to enable us to catch less but land more of it, for example replacing landing based quota with catch quotas.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.9/1">The continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 15 of the last 21 years as a prisoner, is a deliberate policy by the military regime to isolate her from her supporters and to prevent a legitimate expression of the will of the people of Burma. Her sham trial in 2009, which extended her house arrest by a further 18 months, highlights the regime's fear of her influence as a credible political leader. My hon. Friend Jeremy Browne raised Burma at the EU-ASEAN meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-26">26 May 2010</phrase>, at which the Burmese Foreign Minister was present. He made clear that the continued detention of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi is unacceptable. Our ambassador in Rangoon repeatedly raises the need for the release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, with ministers in the Burmese military government and will continue to do so.</p>

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a number of reports on Iran, all making clear that Iran had shown no sign of suspending its enrichment-related activities and continued to stockpile uranium, as required by six UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) and numerous IAEA resolutions. The estimates in his May 2010 report showed Iran had produced 2,427 kg of low enriched uranium since the start of operations in February 2007, and that Iran had also produced a total of 5.7 kg of uranium enriched to nearly 20%, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment.</p>

	<p pid="a.646W.9/2">The Budget announced a package of reforms to tackle unaffordable spending and support the most vulnerable as set out on page 34 of the Red Book. Measures announced at Budget will have no measurable impact on child poverty over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.9/3">Estimates of the impact of Budget tax and benefit measures on the number of children in relative poverty are only available at the UK level, as lower geographical disaggregations do not provide sufficiently robust results. Estimates post 2012-13 are not available due to greater uncertainty surrounding longer term economic forecasts underpinning the modelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.9/4">The Budget announced reforms to the uprating rules for the basic state pension. The earnings link for basic state pension will be restored from April 2011, with a triple guarantee that it will increase by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5%, benefiting 11 million pensioners in the UK. CPI will be used as the measure of prices, but the Government will increase the basic state pension in April 2011 by at least the equivalent of RPI. In 2011, in the event that the basic state pension is increased by more than earnings, under the terms of the triple guarantee, the Government's intention is that, as a minimum, single pension credit recipients will benefit from the full cash value of this increase. These changes will have a positive impact on pensioners' incomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.0/1">The Government's main policy objective in relation to the coal industry is to ensure that the United Kingdom and the European Union are enabled to make best use of a valuable natural resource which continues to make an important contribution to security of energy supplies, where it is economically viable and environmentally acceptable to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.0/2">Coal production was subject to an industry-specific state aid regime under the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. This expired in July 2002 and was replaced by Regulation 1407/2002, which expires on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>. The Regulation has continued to permit closure, operating and mining legacy aid. It also introduced investment aid to support qualifying projects to maintain access to reserves at potentially viable mines; such projects remain ineligible for support under the general state aid regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.0/3">UK coal producers received around &#163;162 million of operating aid during 2000-02 and &#163;53 million of investment aid during 2003-08, but the Government are not currently paying any subsidy for coal production.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.0/4">In 2009 the European Commission consulted on the post-2010 regime, stating its preference for bringing the coal mining industry within the general state aid regime. This would mean an end to operating, closure and legacy aid, while mining and other coal-related projects would become eligible in principle to receive other state aid products.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.0/5">The UK Government broadly support this objective, but also recognises the need to provide limited transitional arrangements from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>, subject to strict closure timetables and progressive reductions in payments, for member states which have already given commitments to provide closure aid after that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.650W.0/6">Closure aid is an economic and social policy measure designed to help former miners and their communities through orderly management of mine closures with support for retraining, local economic diversification, etc. It has no effect on-total coal use or related emissions levels in either the relevant member state or the EU as a whole. This is because, in broad terms, coal produced by mines receiving closure aid merely displaces coal which would otherwise be imported to meet overall demand; and because emissions from coal used for energy production, industrial processes, etc., whatever its origin, are subject to existing EU legislation (e.g. LCPD) and the EU Emissions-Trading System.</p>

	<p pid="a.651W.2/1">Being an already established legally binding framework, the EU, and therefore the UK, has already adopted all the requirements in EU law for the next commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Continuing with the KP approach for a second commitment period would therefore not have any implications for the UK. However, certain elements of the KP are likely to change as the current round of UNFCCC negotiations progresses. Particularly, the mitigation target to which the UK is subject is likely to be higher than in the first commitment period, though ultimately the level will depend on the outcome of the negotiations.</p>

This involves the Department working with technical experts both from industry and academia and in this respect I am making arrangements to host a meeting with Professor Ian Fells to explore topics of this nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.652W.9/3">Ultimately it is for the industry to propose what type of fuel to use in any future nuclear reactors, the designs of which would be subject to independent regulatory assessment and acceptance. At present the UK safety and environment regulators are undertaking a generic design assessment process on two new nuclear reactor designs that use uranium oxide fuel. No proposals have been made for reactor designs using thorium based nuclear fuel, but we would of course consider a proposal if one was to come forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.653W.12/1">Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are currently responsible for commissioning some highly specialised services. However, the majority of national health service health care is commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs). The role of SHAs has primarily been one of system and performance management, supporting PCTs in their commissioning capacity, promoting choice and competition as well as monitoring NHS provider trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.12/2">As set out in the White Paper &quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot; the Government intend to create a more autonomous and accountable NHS-with greater clarity about the roles and responsibilities of different organisations for provision and commissioning. The proposed NHS Commissioning Board will therefore be responsible for ensuring an effective and transparent system of NHS commissioning which drives improvements in quality of patient care and health outcomes, maximises opportunities for patients to exercise choice and is underpinned by effective patient and public engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.12/3">The majority of NHS health care will in future be commissioned by consortia of general practitioner (GP) practices. The Commissioning Board would hold GP commissioners to account for outcomes and financial management rather than for delivering top-down, process-driven targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.653W.12/4">The Commissioning Board will also have direct responsibility for commissioning those services which it would be less appropriate for GP consortia to commission. We propose that this will include all specialised services, including those currently commissioned by PCTs, as well as primary care, prison health and maternity services. It would have no responsibilities in relation to NHS providers (such as hospital trusts), other than in relation to those services it is directly responsible for commissioning.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.5/1">Avandia (rosiglitazone) is licensed on a Europe-wide basis by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), not directly by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In response to emerging evidence, it has been necessary to review the balance of risks and benefits of this medicine throughout Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.5/2">To inform its input into the European debate the MHRA has conducted its own assessment of the safety of rosiglitazone and sought the advice of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM). The CHM advised in July 2010 that the risks of rosiglitazone outweigh its benefits and that it no longer has a place on the United Kingdom market. In addition, the CHM considered action should be taken promptly and ideally within the appropriate European Union framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.5/3">Emerging data on rosiglitazone have been evaluated, and updated advice, including new restrictions on use and warnings, has been issued to prescribers, via the Drug Safety Update bulletin. Following the CHM advice in July, the MHRA contacted health care professionals to provide clear advice on the need to closely follow the current prescribing advice regarding the use of rosiglitazone and to consider alternative treatments where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.659W.0/1">This Government are committed to supporting people with learning disabilities and in particular to improving health outcomes of people with learning disabilities. As our White Paper for the national health service makes clear, this Government's ambition is for health outcomes-and quality health services-as good as any in the world. And that means we are committed to providing a high quality service for everyone-especially those who are more disadvantaged and have experienced real inequity in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/2">Like all other patients, people with learning disabilities will be at the heart of everything. They will have more choice and control to shape health services around them, enabled by easy access to the information they need and want. They (or their families and advocates) will be involved in decisions about their care and we expect NHS professionals to ensure that they fully involve people with learning disabilities and their family carers and enable them to be part of that decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/3">We are pressing ahead with action to address the health inequalities which people with learning disabilities experience, especially a new confidential inquiry and Public Health Observatory. Representatives from Mencap, the National Forum for people with learning difficulties and the National Valuing Families forum are on the group scrutinising progress on these.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/4">Annual health check figures are now on the Improving Health and Lives: Learning Disabilities Observatory website at</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.improvinghealthandlives.org.uk">www.improvinghealthandlives.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/6">In 2008-09 27,011 people with learning disabilities were reported to have received a health check (23% of those people with learning disabilities known to services). In 2009-10 the number more than doubled to 58,919, (43% of those known to services). There is, though, wide variation between primary care trusts and there is still more to do. The functions of the new NHS Commissioning Board have still to be finalised pending the outcome of the consultation which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-11">11 October</phrase>. But we expect that the NHS Commissioning Board will commission the family health services that general practitioners (GPs) provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/7">&quot;Liberating the NHS: Commissioning for patients&quot; sets out further details on the intended arrangements for GP commissioning, providing the basis for fuller consultation and engagement with primary care professionals, patients and the public. We intend that GP consortia will be responsible for commissioning the majority of NHS services, including elective hospital care and rehabilitative care, urgent and emergency care (including out-of hours services), most community health services and mental health and specialist learning disability services. Consortia will be responsible for meeting prescribing and associated costs. It will be for consortia to decide on a case-by- case basis whether to commission services themselves, or to make appropriate arrangements with another commissioning organisation (for instance a lead consortium). The NHS Commissioning Board will develop a commissioning outcomes framework which measures health outcomes. The Government are considering how the outcomes framework will measure improved health outcomes, including for people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/8">The Department is working through strategic health authorities (SHAs) to review and improve training for healthcare staff to ensure that they give appropriate support to people with learning disabilities. SHA Education Commissioners are taking action to review the training provision for healthcare staff and people with learning disabilities. Staff in all GP practices delivering annual health checks have had training in meeting the needs of people with learning disabilities. The Royal College of General Practitioners is due to publish additional training materials for GPs later this autumn on getting health checks right for people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/9">The Department is looking very carefully at the detailed recommendations set out in this report and how these support our objectives to improve outcomes for people with learning disabilities who have complex needs and their families. The elements of good service and good practice examples included in this report sit very clearly within the programme of work which government is leading to support independent living for people with learning disabilities and to support local service planning and commissioning to meet identified needs in their locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/10">The Department has encouraged NHS bodies and local authorities (LAs) to set up these posts and promoted examples of good practice in involving learning disability acute hospital liaison nurses such as the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton. We have also encouraged NHS bodies to use patient passports for people with learning disabilities as an important way of ensuring that their health needs are all in one place. The Learning Disability Partnership Boards have reported some good progress on improving health outcomes for people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.0/11">The national director for learning disabilities has written to all NHS and LA chief executives in July to remind them of the recommendations in the ombudsmen's report &quot;Six lives: the provision of public services to people with learning disabilities&quot; and to ask them to report on progress in meeting those recommendations. We will shortly publish a response on progress against those recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.661W.2/1">The Centre for Disability Research (2008) predicted a sustained increase in the number of people with learning disabilities known to services, from 2009 to 2026. The research detailed a number of scenarios, based on expected levels of need and anticipated levels of eligibility criteria in local authorities. All scenarios suggest sustained growth in the need for social care services for adults with learning disabilities over the full time period. However, average estimated annual increases vary from 1.04% (lower estimate, services are only provided to new entrants with critical or substantial needs) to 7.94% (upper estimate, services are provided to new entrants with critical, substantial or moderate needs).</p>
	<p pid="a.661W.2/2">The impact of these increases upon future funding requirements will depend on the ability of the social care system to deliver efficiency savings through a range of measures-including a renewed focus on preventing needs from escalating, greater personalisation, and improved community-based services to keep people independent. Future funding requirements will also depend upon decisions taken at a local level around charging policies and eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.661W.2/3">Plans to improve care and support services for people with a learning disability within Blaydon and in the North East region are a matter for local decision. We have made clear our commitment to drive forward action to improve support and outcomes for people with learning disabilities across England and to support independent living. For this year, our priorities are to improve health outcomes and support people into jobs and homes of their own.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.5/3">The End of Life Care Strategy made a commitment to pilot, and then roll out, a survey of bereaved informal carers, which can be used as a proxy measure for the quality of care provided to the deceased, as well as measuring the care provided to the carers themselves. This commitment is being met through the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services (VOICES) questionnaire. This has been revised to reflect the recommendations in the Strategy and a pilot is currently under way to test out how the VOICES questionnaire could be most effectively utilised in a national survey. The pilot will run to January 2011. The results from such surveys will inform local policy development.</p>

The Government's decision to redeploy &#163;150 million of our savings in 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality employer owned Apprenticeships.

	<p pid="a.670W.5/1">Information on the total number of young people and adults seeking an Apprenticeship is not collected centrally. People may start an Apprenticeship through a variety of routes, including using Apprenticeships vacancies, the national on-line system for advertising and applying for Apprenticeship vacancies. Alternatively people may apply directly to a training provider or to an employer offering an Apprenticeship programme, or may already be employed and undertake an Apprenticeship. However from this academic year (2010/11) training providers are required to submit all Apprenticeship vacancies through the national Apprenticeships vacancies system. This does not apply where it is proposed that the Apprenticeship opportunity will be offered to a learner already employed. In the last academic year (August 2009 to July 2010) 354,000 candidates had registered to use Apprenticeship vacancies and 75,000 candidates made at least one application. A regional breakdown is not available.</p>

Enhanced support includes additional funding available for training providers to support learners with a learning difficulty and/or disability. A priority for NAS is to address stereotyping and under-representation across apprenticeships including gender, race and disability. NAS and the Skills Funding Agency fund apprenticeships through a wide range of training providers including specialist providers that support disadvantaged learners. NAS also work with employers to help them understand and be more responsive to the needs of under-represented groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.672W.2/1">In 2009-10, the total expenditure on participation in apprenticeship training was &#163;1,072 million, including the Department for Education's expenditure on apprenticeships for 16 to 18-year-olds. Additionally, a total of &#163;33 million was spent on activities supporting the expansion of the Apprenticeships Programme, such as maintaining the Apprenticeship vacancies IT system, marketing and communications and piloting new delivery models.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.2/2">It is not possible to provide a meaningful average cost to the public purse of an apprenticeship. The public cost of delivering an apprenticeship varies significantly depending on the industry in which the apprenticeship framework is being delivered; length of stay on the programme; whether the framework is at Level 2 or 3; and whether the participant is in the 16 to 18, 19 to 25 or 25+ age group. For example, the Skills Funding Agency estimates that the cost of delivering a Level 2 adult apprenticeship in business and administration is around &#163;2,700 and is &#163;16,300 for an advanced apprenticeship (Level 3) in engineering for a 16 to 18-year-old.</p>
	<p pid="a.672W.2/3">The Apprenticeship programme is administered by the National Apprenticeship Service, which was housed within the LSC during 2009-10. The total administrative cost of the LSC in 2009-10 was &#163;247 million. Information on the proportion of this expenditure that relates to the administration of apprenticeships is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.0/11">While local authority level estimates can be calculated from the Annual Population Survey, the sample is not large enough to provide estimates for smaller geographies such as parliamentary constituencies. Furthermore, estimates for local authorities are subject to large sampling variability and should therefore be treated with caution and viewed in conjunction with their Confidence Intervals<sup>(1)</sup> (CIs), which indicate how accurate an estimate is. For example, a 95% CI of +1-2.6 percentage points (pp) means that the true value for the Liverpool estimate shown above is between 24.5% and 29.7% for 95% of cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.0/13">It is important to note that the estimates provided here will not be comparable with estimates from the Labour Force Survey, which BIS uses to report headline measures of qualifications held within the population at national level in England. As well as being based on different time periods, the estimates from the two data sets are compiled using different methodologies. The method used to calculate the headline Labour Force Survey measure allows for known issues arising in capturing data on attainment through social surveys, but this method cannot be applied to the Annual Population Survey data. As a result, the estimates provided above potentially underestimate attainment within the population.</p>

	<p pid="a.679W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.679W.8/2">Effective enforcement of the national minimum wage (NMW) plays a crucial role in driving up compliance levels. Officials are working with HMRC to deliver a compliance strategy that ensures that enforcement is targeted on the areas where there is the greatest risk of non-compliance. To achieve this, HMRC will be testing new ways of working to focus on the most 'at risk' employers and the most 'at risk' workers. This will include piloting a triage approach to investigating complaints and making greater use of the contribution that community bodies, unions, trade associations in the low pay sectors and other interested parties can make to promoting the NMW and raising the profile of enforcement. We will also be encouraging more NMW inspection activity co-ordinated with the work of other bodies, including the Employment Agency Standards inspectorate. This will build on the joint working agreements put in place following the launch of the single Pay and Work Rights helpline last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.679W.8/3">Central to our compliance strategy is the proposition that a 'one size fits all approach' is not the most effective. We will therefore continue to use a variety of tools and techniques to reach different audiences, ranging from ensuring that up-to-date, practical and accessible guidance is available, through to prosecution of the worst employers. This tailored approach to NMW compliance ensures that employers who want to comply have access to information and tools to enable them to do so and those employers who would otherwise be tempted to operate outside of the law are deterred from doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.680W.8/1">This Government are committed to tackling avoidance and intends to build in sustainable defences against avoidance opportunities when undertaking policy reform and to review areas of the tax system in which repeated changes have been necessary to close loopholes.</p>
	<p pid="a.680W.8/2">HMRC's anti-avoidance strategy is based on stopping avoidance at source as far as possible, through robust legislation, early detection of avoidance schemes and engaging with taxpayers to deter them from engaging in tax avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.680W.8/3">The disclosure of tax avoidance schemes regime forms a key part of this. It provides early information about schemes and informs efforts to prevent avoidance through legislation and operational intervention. Where avoidance is identified, HMRC responds quickly by advising the Government on legislative changes to close loopholes and by challenging avoidance schemes vigorously, including, where necessary, through litigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.680W.8/4">As the emphasis of HMRC's strategy is on prevention, it is difficult to provide estimates of the total amount of tax that is protected. However, HMRC estimate that the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes regime has already helped to prevent over &#163;12 billion in avoidance opportunities since 2004. Changes announced in the Budget will further strengthen the regime to provide HMRC with better information and make it harder for those who do not to comply.</p>

	<p pid="a.684W.2/1">It is not currently possible to separate the cost of supervising offenders on community sentences as probation case loads also include significant numbers of offenders that have been released from a custodial sentence or released temporarily into the community. Work is in hand in the National Offender Management Service to ensure that all offender services delivered in custody and in the community are properly specified and costed so that commissioners can ensure resources are targeted effectively to protect the public and reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.2/2">Our future plans for, and the balance of expenditure between, custodial and community provision will need to be considered in the light of the assessment of sentencing and work on new approaches to rehabilitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.2/2">The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) collates data annually on consultancy expenditure as part of its Consultancy Value Programme which assists Departments in getting best value from Government's use of consultants.

The total was &#163;50 million in 2008-09 and &#163;56 million in 2007-08. A data collection exercise is currently under way for the expenditure on consultants in 2009-10.

	<p pid="a.690W.2/1">The national payment rate for financial penalties at the end of the 2008-09 financial year was 85% and 71% excluding the value of administrative cancellations. The payment rate covers fines, compensation, victims surcharge, and unpaid fixed penalty notices. Her Majesty's Courts Service has in place a strategy to increase the success of compliance with court orders particularly with regard to financial penalties-the Criminal Compliance and Enforcement Services Blueprint. This was launched in July 2008 and is being implemented across HMCS. The blueprint sets out HMCS's strategic objective for enforcement which is for a cheaper, faster and more proportionate system that primarily focuses on 'first time' compliance while continuing to apply the principles of rigorous enforcement to the hard core of defaulters. The blueprint implementation ensures greater use of the sanctions available under the Courts Act 2003 and extended methods of payment. In the 2009-10 financial year HMCS collected &#163;259,241,082 which was &#163;12.5 million (5%) more cash against financial penalties than in the 2008-09 year.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.2/2">The use of fines is currently under consideration by the Ministry of Justice as part of a full assessment of sentencing. We will publish sentencing proposals for consultation in a Green Paper in the autumn. Any proposals made in relation to fines will take into account the issue of enforcement.</p>
