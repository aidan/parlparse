	<p pid=".1015W.3/2">The latest best estimates for the amounts spent by the Services' Training Agencies on individual training for the Royal Navy, Army and RAF in the last 12 months are respectively: #403.6 million; #894 million and #404.5 million. These figures are approximate and are in accordance with Resources Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) procedures which incorporate consumption figures not included in a cash budget.</p>
	<p pid=".1015W.3/3">For the Royal Navy, a small proportion of trainee days are spent in Scotland, but separate costs are not recorded for these activities by the Naval Training and Recruiting Agency. The Army Training and Recruiting Agency estimates that its total expenditure in Scotland in the current Financial Year will be #22 million. The majority of the RAF Training Group Defence Agency's training establishments are based either in England or Wales, but the in-year cost of their Outdoor Activity Centre in Scotland for the current financial year is #675,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1015W.3/4">The cash costs of Royal Marines individual training for financial year 2001&ndash;02 are projected to be #39.9 million. It is not possible to identify separately Royal Marines training expenditure in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".1015W.3/5">Training costs falling to the Service Commands are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1017W.5/2">The criteria used by the Regulator to assess the safety of future operations at West Freugh airfield were the adequacy of safety infrastructure and the number of aircraft movements. Regulatory minima are set for both the overall number of movements and the number of fast jet movements in order to maintain the currency of air traffic controllers. The numbers of aircraft movements at West Freugh had fallen below these regulatory minima, leading to the decision to cease full-time airfield operations.</p>

We have no record of any individual who made a statement expressing a wish to give his evidence through being interviewed by the Board. The statements taken from the surviving crew members were available to the Board of Inquiry. The Board interviewed witnesses where it was believed that doing so could assist in its inquiries. The decision as to which witnesses were interviewed was the responsibility of the Board. To publish a list of those who provided statements to the Sheffield Board of Inquiry would be a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 and a breach of confidentiality, unless the permission of all the individuals involved was first obtained. This could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1020W.0/1">Data on the number of New Deal appointments under the programme for Young People was recorded from the beginning of the scheme until April 2001. From then, data also included the over 50s and lone parents programmes. Since October 2001 data has not been held centrally on the New Deal programmes. Available data are detailed in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1020W.0/4"> <th>Financial year</th> <th>Lone parents</th> <th>Over 50s</th> <th>Young people aged 18&ndash;24</th> <th>Total numbers recruited under New Deal (includes those aged 25 and over)</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".1020W.0/7"> <td>1998&ndash;99</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>11</td> <td>17</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1020W.0/8"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>35</td> <td>58</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1020W.0/9"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>n/a</td> <td>20</td> <td>43</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1020W.0/10"> <td>2001&ndash;02 (until October 2001)</td> <td>0</td> <td>2</td> <td>6</td> <td>10</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1020W.0/13">Forty-two New Deal recruits subsequently became permanent members of staff. Others who have left the scheme will have had the opportunity to acquire new skills and enhance their marketability for employment elsewhere, but information is not held on whether they returned to jobseekers allowance or other benefits. New Deal recruits take up existing vacancies so extra costs to public funds are limited to the subsidy, where appropriate, and any training and development that may be needed. Details of costs are not available and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".1022W.2/1">DEFRA, working closely with other departments, is leading on the UK's domestic and international preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). The Department is represented on MISC18, the Cabinet Committee set up to co-ordinate, develop and deliver the Government's strategy for WSSD. DEFRA also chairs two official level groups which co-ordinate preparations across Government. My officials are fully involved in the international preparations for the Summit and are attending the third preparatory meeting in New York which started on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-25">25 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.2/2">DEFRA also leads on the development of a cross Whitehall communications strategy to raise awareness of the Summit. We are working closely with local authorities, NGOs, business and other organisations to ensure that we engage a wide range of stakeholders in the Summit. DEFRA has also developed the government sustainable development website (<a href="http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk">www.sustainable-development.gov.uk</a>) to include information on WSSD.</p>

	<p pid=".1022W.5/2">The recovery and recycling targets in article 6(1) of the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste&mdash;94/62EC&mdash;were implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/3">In order to comply with the requirements in the Directive, recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging regulations were 56 per cent. for recovery and 18 per cent. for material-specific recycling of packaging waste. Final figures for 2001 are not yet available, but data received to date suggest that, if all obligated parties met their obligations, these targets should be met. This would mean that the UK had recovered 4.6 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2001 ie 50 per cent. We would expect to recycle some 45 per cent. We also anticipate that all materials will meet the 15 per cent. material-specific recycling target in the Directive, with the possible exception of plastic.</p>

	<p pid=".1023W.2/2">The United Kingdom's fishing industry has a negligible interest in fisheries agreements south of the EU so no assessment has been carried out. Fisheries agreements with countries north of the EU are of considerable importance to UK fishermen. However, the economic benefit cannot be assessed precisely since it depends on availability of fishing opportunities which can vary year on year and actual catches taken.</p>

It is the United Kingdom's view that, certainly in relation to many of the southern agreements, the Commission's performance of these tasks needs to be improved.

This will be a response to the report but will go further than that. We will work with a wide range of stakeholders to determine how best to take forward the Commission's ideas and deliver positive changes on the ground. As responsibility for addressing the Commission's recommendations rests with industry and other organisations as well as Government, we will be looking for their active involvement.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.11/1">The criteria applied to determine the applications for the appointments to the Countryside Agency were that applicants should have a general interest and experience of countryside issues, and preferably have specific expertise in the areas of rural business/rural enterprise, rural development or the voluntary sector. In addition we made clear that we were particularly seeking applications from candidates based in the West Midlands or South West England.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.11/2">Advertisements were placed in the national press on 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-16">16 September 2001</phrase>, with a closing date of <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-11">11 October 2001</phrase>. Our intention was to appoint up to two candidates. In line with our normal timetable, a shortlist of candidates for possible interview was drawn up in November, four shortlisted candidates from South West England were interviewed in January and one has now been appointed. The deadline for applications from candidates based in the West Midlands was extended to <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-11">11 February 2002</phrase> and this was advertised on the DEFRA and Countryside Agency websites. We are now considering the applications from candidates based in the West Midlands, received both before and after the original deadline, and hope to interview a shortlist in May. However, there is no fixed number for the number of people on the Board, and only one member is leaving the Board in April; so we will not necessarily appoint a second person this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.11/3">In addition to the national advertising campaign, which included information being posted on the DEFRA and Countryside Agency websites, we approached 160 organisations with an interest in countryside issues in September 2001 asking them to suggest candidates. We also made a limited number of further approaches in the West Midlands for additional suggestions in January.</p>

ACRE advises on the basis of the best scientific evidence available and experience gained from previous releases and, for example, by the seeds industry in the use of separation distances to secure specific levels of seed purity amongst conventionally bred plant varieties.</p>
	<p pid=".1029W.2/5">The legislation governing GM crop trials derives from European Union directives, so similar principles are followed in other EU countries.</p>

	<p pid=".1036W.3/2">The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has specific responsibility on behalf of the Secretary of State to safeguard public health where medical devices are involved. Within this overall remit, MDA has a specific unit responsible for wheeled mobility devices where adverse incidents concerning the safety or quality of wheelchairs are considered.</p>
	<p pid=".1036W.3/3">The MDA unit works with users, manufacturers, trade associations, professional groups, service providers, and other Government departments where appropriate to reduce safety problems for users both in the short and in the longer term. If the unit finds that there is a need for improvement in a wheelchair design, usage instructions or manufacturing process then appropriate action is taken with the manufacturer/supplier. When necessary Safety Warning notices are widely distributed which incorporate the actions required to reduce specific problems with wheelchairs that are already in use. Advice or written guidance on wider issues relating to the safety of wheelchair users is also given where root cause, or trend, analysis highlights a particular area of concern which requires improvement for the future. Also, if a shortcoming is revealed in an issued British Standard concerning wheelchairs or a need for a new standard the unit works with the British Standards Institute (BSI) to make any necessary revisions or assist with the drafting of any new standard.</p>

	<p pid=".1039W.5/2">The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) in conjunction with its independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines to ensure that medicines meet acceptable standards of safety and efficacy. The nature of the clinical setting is not within the scope of CSM advice. However, if the balance of risks and benefits for a medicine when used in a particular indication or population is considered to be unfavourable MCA/CSM will not hesitate to take action to modify its use and to inform prescribers of this action.</p>
	<p pid=".1039W.5/3">For example the balance of risks and benefits for thioridazine in the following indications was considered unfavourable: anxiety, agitation and restlessness in the elderly, moderate to severe psychomotor agitation, violent and dangerously impulsive behaviour, mania/hypomania, and behavioural disorders and epilepsy in children. Upon advice from the CSM, in December 2000 the use of thioridazine was restricted to the second line treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Health professionals were notified of this via a Dear Doctor letter and an article in the drug safety bulletin <i>Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance</i>. A copy of this article has been sent to the Library.</p>

While there are other clinics in South West London where cancer patients and lymphoedema are treated, the St. George's service also meets the needs of patients with non-cancer lymphoedema. The St. George's service is a specialist service and receives referrals nationally. The Trust is also one of the few places where academic and epidemiological work is progressing related to lymphoedema.

Expert advice on this analysis was sought from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. No new drug safety signals were identified, although the results highlighted that patients considered that insufficient information was available to them about their medicines. There was an ongoing programme at that time to ensure that Patient Information Leaflets were authorised for all products and this programme was completed by January 1999.</p>

A new risk assessment model is unnecessary since there is no significantly new scientific evidence to warrant revising the structure or assumptions of the current model.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.5/2">Because of the multiple uncertainties surrounding this issue, it was not considered feasible to make a straightforward prediction of potential secondary infections from surgery. The Risk Assessment therefore did not predict the scale of any secondary epidemic of vCJD, instead, it developed different scenarios to address the various uncertainties&mdash;including the standard of decontamination&mdash;and gaps in our knowledge about vCJD.</p>
	<p pid=".1046W.5/3">The advice we had from Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee was that good decontamination is key in reducing the risk of person to person transmission of vCJD via surgical instruments. This was confirmed by the Risk Assessment. As a result of the work we did last year on improving decontamination, all NHS hospitals in England have access to decontamination services of an acceptable standard.</p>

	<p pid=".1048W.2/1">The number of orthodontists and the amount of orthodontic work in the General Dental Service has increased significantly since 1996&ndash;97 in both Lincolnshire and England as a whole. Additional clinics have been set up in Lincolnshire and by the end of March 2002, it is envisaged that there will be no over 26-week waits for orthodontic appointments in Lincolnshire. An additional consultant orthodontist post has been funded and concerted efforts are being made to recruit to this post.</p>

	<p pid=".1049W.2/2">During the implementation of NHS Direct, the Department had regular meetings with general practitioners bodies, including the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association and the National Association of GP Co-operatives, to discuss ways in which NHS Direct and GPs could work collaboratively to improve patient care. Bodies representing GPs are also represented on the NHS Clinical Assessment System Clinical Reference Group, a national group that ensures the system used by NHS Direct is safe and reflects evidence-based best practice.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.2/3">Independent evaluation by the National Audit Office and Sheffield University found evidence that NHS Direct has a good safety record, is as safe as other entry points into the NHS, and that serious adverse clinical outcomes associated with the service are likely to be rare.</p>

It is estimated that up to two staff-days will be needed in each health authority and trust to extract the information from their existing systems in order to complete the two returns KO41A and B. In addition, it is expected that each Primary Care Trust will require up to two staff-days in total to complete the new KO41C central return.</p>
	<p pid=".1050W.0/3">The collection of ethnic category data on written complaints will be valuable in gauging fair and equal access to health care across ethnic groups. Where monitoring shows unequal outcomes between different minority ethnic groups, public authorities will be required to take action to promote greater equality and to prevent discrimination whether direct or indirect. In the longer term, data collected on written complaints will be used to inform service improvements as well as give practice managers and the service as a whole more qualitative information around access to health care services.</p>

	<p pid=".1056W.8/2">However, we do recognise that GPs have a crucial role to play in our overall strategy of increasing the availability of treatment to drug users. The Department made available #1.8 million to the Royal College of General Practitioners for the development and implementation of an accredited training programme to give GPs the skills they need when working with drug misusers. Since its launch in October 2001 more than 400 GPs have taken part in the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".1059W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-23">23 October</phrase> last year, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to review the scientific literature on cannabis, including the so-called Xgateway theory&quot;. Their analysis of this theory can be found in section 4.6 of their Report, XThe classification of cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&quot;, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-14">14 March 2002</phrase>. The Report says that it is not possible to state, with certainty, whether or not cannabis use predisposes users to dependence on Class A drugs. Nevertheless, the risks (if any) are small and less than those associated with the use of tobacco or alcohol.</p>
	<p pid=".1059W.3/3">There is a link between Class A drugs and crime. Preliminary findings from the drug testing programme, currently being piloted in Staffordshire, Nottingham and Hackney, show that 55 per cent. of offenders arrested for trigger offences (property crime, robbery and Class A drugs offences) tested positive for heroin and/or cocaine (including crack cocaine). The number who previously used cannabis is not known.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.12/1">The Home Department is not aware of any other fairly traded products purchased in the past five years. The department fully supports ethical trading in mainstream business and Fair Trade products will be purchased where they meet the criteria of value for money principles, which includes quality, fitness for purpose and delivery against price.</p>
	<p pid=".1060W.12/2">The Home Office will be publishing an article on fair trade in the next edition of XPurchasing Matters&quot;, an internal periodical for all procurement staff which will help raise awareness of fair trade products. In addition the Home Office will be holding a purchasing symposium on the issue of Fair Trade in April 2002. I hope these measures will enable greater purchasing of fair trade products.</p>

Caseworkers have access to various sources of information, including country assessments prepared by the Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) of the Home Office which often provide information on the prison conditions in a particular country. CIPU have access to a wide variety of further information and have links with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as well as other organisations who are able to assist with specific requests.</p>

Where the applicant has raised torture and the caseworker feels it would be useful, the applicant may be invited to submit a medical report.</p>
	<p pid=".1061W.2/3">However, it is for the applicant to decide whether they wish to undertake a medical examination to establish that torture has taken place. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate does not insist that a medical report is submitted when torture has been alleged. Not all forms of torture result in physical scars or injuries which could be identified during a medical examination.</p>
