	<p pid="b.823W.3/1">DFID is working to increase life expectancy through a variety of activities including support for the provision of clean water and sanitation, large-scale immunisation and insecticide-treated bednets programmes and addressing related maternal mortality. Safe hygiene practice and improved access to clean water and sanitation are also vital for reducing child mortality. DFID produced the Water Action Plan in March 2004, and we will double our spending on water and sanitation to &pound;95 million by 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.823W.3/2">In Nigeria we are providing &pound;20 million to rebuild routine immunisation services and a further &pound;80 million for malaria control. In Tanzania we continue to provide support for the social marketing of bednets as part of the national Insecticide Treated Net Programme, and in Sierra Leone we are designing a new long term Child Survival and Maternal Health Programme with the World Bank and national partners. In Malawi we are contributing &pound;100 million over six years to the government's essential health and human resource programme, and significant progress has been made on child survival through immunisation and malaria programmes. Similarly in Zambia we are major donors to the National Strategic Health Plan, which includes a focus on improving child health through expanded vaccination, curative care and improving access to services. In Kenya we are supporting a sector wide approach for the long term strengthening of the health system and improved service delivery. We have funded the development of a number of plans in human resources, procurement and financial management. We are also concentrating much support on the prevention of malaria, the major cause of mortality in children in Kenya. By the end of 2007 we will have spent more than &pound;45 million on insecticide treated bednets and distributed 11 million nets, saving approximately 167,000 lives. DFID is indirectly supporting South Africa's efforts to reverse under-five mortality rates through the &pound;30 million, five-year HIV/AIDS Multi-Sectoral Support Programme (MSP). Our support to the Maternal Child and Women Health Unit in the Department of Health supports research in the area of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), the development of fertility options policy, and research on barriers to antiretroviral uptake among children and pregnant women.</p>
	<p pid="b.823W.3/3">DFID continues to provide strong support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM), and also played a central role in the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) which issued its first bonds in November 2006. This will disburse $4 billion over the next 10 years and is estimated will save 10 million lives, including five million children before 2015. DFID also recently pledged long term support to UNITAID, the International Drug Purchase Facility, starting with a &pound;15 million contribution in 2007, to ensure poor countries benefit from lower prices for drugs to treat AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>

	<p pid="b.824W.2/1">There has been progress in driving down the prices of HIV/AIDS drugs in a number of ways. Competition between multiple producers is leading to significant falls in the prices of some first-line Antiretrovirals (ARVs). The work of UNITAID, trade measures, research and improved transparency around pricing in developing countries, are also combining to bring down prices and improve access.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.2/2">DFID is supporting UNITAID, the international drug purchasing facility established in late 2006. UNITAID has already approved several significant expenditures, including $61.7 million for paediatric anti-retroviral therapy (ART), $70 million for second line ART and $52.5m for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. We hope that UNITAID will contribute to the necessary reductions in the prices of second-line drugs such as Viread and Kaletra.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.2/3">UNITAID and the Clinton Foundation recently announced a major cut in the price of 16 ARV formulations which will be available to 66 developing countries. UNITAID has committed over $120 million in 2007 and 2008 to this programme, and the Clinton Foundation has negotiated price reductions on average between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.2/4">DFID and other Whitehall Departments have worked with the EU and World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states, to ensure that developing countries have the necessary flexibilities in the WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement to safeguard their pressing public health needs. TRIPS now allows countries without manufacturing capacity to issue compulsory licences to import generic copies of patented medicines. The EU is taking steps to implement legislation transposing this agreement into European law. We have funded several programmes including pilot projects in Kenya and Botswana to help them implement legislation allowing them to use TRIPS flexibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.824W.2/5">The UK is also involved with others in research, largely through public private partnerships including the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), and recently launched an international Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA) to focus on price, quality and availability of medicines across the supply chain in-country. MeTA builds on the existing efforts of developing country, donor, World Health Organisation, other multilateral and civil society partners to strengthen national procurement and supply systems, and to tackle corruption.</p>

	<p pid="b.825W.2/1">DFID is helping to improve the economic conditions in the Middle East in a number of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/2">We are supporting the Iraqi Government in their economic reform efforts through a &pound;13 million programme, providing technical advice on fiscal (including budget management and public financial management) and macroeconomic policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/3">We are providing &pound;15 million to the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The TIM and other international assistance has helped to slow economic decline. The World Bank has highlighted the restrictions on movement and access of Palestinians as the biggest economic constraint, and the UK Government have made our concerns clear to the Israeli Government on this.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/4">As part of our Yemen programme of &pound;12 million this year, we are investigating various ways in which we can support growth and jobs for poor people. We also focus on improving the efficiency of Government. We are supporting the Ministry of Finance to implement National Public Financial Management Reform. This includes support to budget development and management, procurement reform and auditing. Currently we have &pound;1.1 million committed (2006-08) to this multi-donor Government programme, and are looking to expand over 2008-11 if opportunities to build on progress exist. At community level, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) is supporting small and micro enterprise development throughout the country to which DFID is providing approximately &pound;800,000. DFID has over the past couple of years worked with the Government and other donors to harmonize donor assistance in Yemen in order to make it as effective as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/5">At regional level, DFID supports economic reform across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through contributions to the EC European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) which will provide &euro;5.6 billion (approximately &pound;3.8 billion) for 17 MENA and eastern European countries from 2007-10. Approximately &euro;1 billion (approximately &pound;0.6 billion) of this will come from DFID's budget. The ENPI is designed to promote good governance and equitable social and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/6">DFID also directly supports the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and partnership (FEMIP) which has loaned &euro;2 billion (approximately &pound;1.4 billion) to MENA countries to help them meet the challenges of economic and social modernisation and improve regional integration. DFID has provided &euro;3 million (approximately &pound;2 million) in grants to a technical trust fund which helps to ensure the FEMIP lending is effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.826W.8/1">Accurate data on the number of Acholi people who have been murdered are not available, although UN reports do suggest that incidents of violence in the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) affecting parts of northern Uganda have fallen dramatically since peace talks between the LRA and the Government of Uganda began in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.8/2">Accurate data on the number of Acholi people who have been raped are also not available. Many women and girls do not come forward and say that they have been raped because of the stigma involved, and the practical problems associated with reporting such incidents. However the risk of sexual and gender based violence is high. As part of our humanitarian assistance, DFID has provided approximately &pound;2 million to UNICEF and Save the Children over the last two financial years for their programmes to protect women and children in the North. Communities have also stressed the importance of a police presence in tackling issues of sexual and gender based violence. In response we are providing &pound;700,000 from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool funds in support of a plan to strengthen civilian policing in the North.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.8/3">DFID is working closely with the Government of Uganda and others to support the collection of accurate information in conflict-affected areas of northern Uganda, to fully understand the impact of the conflict, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance is targeted towards the greatest needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.8/4">In July 2005 DFID supported a Uganda Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation led survey that measured crude mortality rates in northern Uganda. This found that the crude mortality rate in northern Uganda was 1.54 deaths per 10,000 people per day. A crude mortality rate of over 1.0 per 10,000 a day is considered an emergency. As a direct response we have provided over &pound;37 million in humanitarian assistance over the last two years, including &pound;9.6 million in support of a UN programme aimed at tackling some of the main causes of death, including malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection. There is strong anecdotal evidence that mortality has fallen but a repeat survey will be carried out before the end of the year to check that this is the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.834W.8/2">Gift Aid is one of a number of charitable reliefs and activities administered by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). HMRC does not distinguish the costs of processing Gift Aid from its other activities in relation to charities and charitable giving and does not have information available to identify the cost of processing Gift Aid by charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.834W.8/3">However, the HMRC Charities business stream brings together most policy, technical and operational work in relation to charities for both direct and indirect taxes. The total operational cost of this business stream was &pound;3,342,594 (2005-06) and &pound;3,690,339 (2006-07). These figures include the paybill costs of staff, but exclude departmental overheads such as accommodation.</p>

Where significant risks are identified they are pursued through a variety of interventions one of which involves opening an inquiry into the company tax return or claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.836W.2/3">In response to consultation HMRC opened seven specialist R and D units in November 2006. The units will improve the consistency of dealing with claims and their role is to encourage and help companies to make claims to R and D relief while ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are effectively and efficiently handled.</p>

	<p pid="b.840W.3/1">The UK recognises driving licences issued by all other European Union (EU) member states, including HGV entitlement. As European Council Directive 91/439/EEC prescribes a minimum standard for health and driver testing (including HGV tests), it is presumed that HGV drivers from other EU states will have the same conditions applied to their driving standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.840W.3/2">Non-EU licence holders who are resident here may only drive vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes (motorcycles, cars and light vans). Visitors may drive larger vehicles only if the vehicles were registered outside Great Britain and have been driven into the country temporarily. While driving on British roads they are subject to the same road traffic laws as British HGV drivers.</p>

	<p pid="b.845W.2/1">The Hercules C-130K explosion suppressant foam (ESF) modification takes approximately 44 days per aircraft to complete. The less complex Hercules C-130J modification takes approximately 16 days. The difference in time scale between the two marks of aircraft is due to the need to replace the fuel tank sealant on the older C-130K. In order to improve overall aircraft availability to the front line command, the ESF modification has been combined with scheduled maintenance wherever possible.</p>

These three projects are judged to be highly successful: the first involves 98 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and de-mining personnel for the Kosovo Protection Corps. The second is the Bosnian project, which on completion will have destroyed over 10,000 tons of ammunition. And the third is the International Mine Action and Training Centre in Kenya has trained some 3,800 African and International personnel in de-mining and associated skills. Wider initiatives by the UK, funded by DFID at &pound;10 million per year, are targeted at the world's poorest nations, and have reduced casualties significantly.</p>

An Additional Duties Commitment is formal part-time employment, completing the spectrum of employment between Territorial Army Service that is entirely voluntary at the lowest level (attendance on weekday evenings and weekends) through to full time working on either a Full Time Reserve Service engagement or mobilised service. In recognition of the differing levels of commitment and guarantee of work at any given time, the terms and conditions of service are also graduated.</p>
	<p pid="b.847W.11/3">The LAND Information and Communications Services Group was given formal approval in March 2007. It is a National 'Specialist' Territorial Army unit, recruited from all over the UK. Once fully recruited, it will consist of a mix of suitably qualified Territorial Army personnel, and recently retired regular officers and senior non commissioned officers, and professionally qualified officers (PQOs) with specialist skills obtained from industry which will enhance the Defence Information and Communications Systems capability.</p>

	<p pid="b.849W.3/1">The Department has not received any formal representations. Child protection is a matter for local authorities and their partners. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children requires effective co-ordination in every local area. For this reason, the Children Act 2004 requires each local authority to establish a Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB). LSCBs came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Their core membership includes local authorities, health bodies, the police and other key agencies providing services to children and adults. The objectives of LSCBs are to co-ordinate local work and to ensure the effectiveness of the work of member agencies to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The Government's statutory guidance &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; (2006) sets out their roles and responsibilities including their relationship to the wider children's trust arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.849W.3/2">This guidance also sets out the processes to be followed if there are concerns about a child's welfare. Firstly, a referral should be made to local authority children's social care and it should decide whether to undertake an initial assessment to establish whether the child is a child in need. If the child is a child in need under s17 of the Children Act 1989, then the LA should decide what services are required to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child and which agency is best placed to provide them.</p>
	<p pid="b.849W.3/3">If there are concerns that a child may be suffering, or is likely to suffer significant harm, then a multi agency strategy meeting&mdash;led by local authority children's social care&mdash;should be held to determine whether to undertake inquiries under s47 of the Children Act 1989 and what action is required to safeguard the child's welfare. If a child is at continuing risk of harm, then a child protection plan would be put in place. Children's social care and the police, together with the other services are required to work closely together during these assessment and decision making processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.849W.3/4">These processes are used to protect children from different sorts of harm and are flexible enough to be used in a range of circumstances. The Government will of course continue to keep this framework under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.851W.5/15">In 2005-06 school funding was part of the local government finance system. School funding was split into four blocks: primary; secondary; under fives; and high-cost pupils.

The primary, secondary and under five blocks also included an element for pupils with additional educational needs, defined as pupils with: English as an additional language/ethnicity; working families tax credit; and income support. The primary block also had an element to reflect sparsity.</p>
	<p pid="b.851W.5/16">Each local authority's total Dedicated Schools Grant for 2006-07 was calculated by multiplying their full-time equivalent pupil numbers (aged 3-15) from the January 2006 pupil count by their Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding (the Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding is unchanged from that set in</p>

These modifications assume that Mandarin may be spoken at a slower speed, the range of topics may be more limited and pupils may work with a limited number of characters. There are no similar modifications for other languages.</p>

	<p pid="b.856W.8/1">The Secretary of State has not had any discussions with education providers on the teaching of Mandarin in schools. The Languages Review, published in March 2007, proposed widening the range of languages taught in schools. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has recently finished consulting on the revised Key Stage 3 languages curriculum. The consultation proposed removing the requirement that schools must first teach a European language to allow them to teach any major spoken world language, including Mandarin, depending on local need and circumstances. We are considering the potential implications of these changes for the school workforce.</p>

	<p pid="b.859W.2/1">In the last 10 years the Department has received a total of 248 applications (109 of which in respect of closed schools) that involve the disposal of an area of land capable of forming a sports pitch of at least 0.2 hectares. Of the total received, 54 must be subsequently withdrawn, 16 are still under consideration, 176 have been approved and two were rejected. Of the approved applications, the sale proceeds were used to provide new or improved sports or educational facilities in every case.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.2/2">Since the School Playing Field Advisory Panel was set up, in July 2001, the Department has approved 1,076 general consent applications. The effect of a general consent is that, in certain circumstances, the specific prior consent of the Secretary of State is not required to dispose of school playing field land. Such circumstances include the disposal of an area of land to provide a facility as part of an extended school, such as childcare, lifelong learning etc.; the disposal of the ancillary social and recreational areas that surround the buildings of a closed school; certain disposals where playing fields remain as playing fields (for example a transfer to the district council); the exchange of one school playing field for a replacement newly-created school playing field of at least equal size, resulting is no net loss of facility; the disposal of areas of playing field under 50 square metres; and a temporary loss of school playing field.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.2/3">Data on school playing fields were supplied to the Department by local authorities in 2001 and 2003. However, because the data were incomplete, it is not possible to assess accurately the number and area of school playing fields.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.2/4">Education Ministers only have power to regulate the disposal of school playing fields. They do not have any statutory powers to govern the future use or development of school playing fields. These are matters for local planning authorities to consider.</p>

This enables teachers to take places on the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy's professional development programme. This has seen over 143,000 teacher training places being undertaken by primary school teachers from April 2005 to March 2007. These places develop teacher' skills in delivering high quality physical education for their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.0/1">The ability to reflect on learning and how to improve performance is an essential skill for life and work. This is why it continues to be an important element of the National Curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.0/2">Schools provide opportunities for young people to develop these skills through their approach to pedagogy and assessment, and particularly through their approach to assessment for learning. These opportunities can take place within subject contexts and beyond them.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.3/3">The research included a survey of a representative sample of 40 per cent. of secondary schools in England. Projections were made of the total number of teachers in secondary schools in England delivering the mathematics and science curriculums. The findings also included distributions of the teachers by age and by highest qualification in the subject being taught.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.3/5">The research found that there were an estimated 27,400 teachers teaching mathematics in secondary schools in England, of whom an estimated 21,100 were mathematics specialists<sup>(1)</sup> including 11,700 with a degree in mathematics. The following table shows the distribution of mathematics teachers in terms of their mathematics qualifications. The teachers are counted once against their highest qualification in mathematics. For example, if an individual holds a degree and a PGCE in maths, they are counted in the figures for &quot;degree in maths&quot;; if an individual holds a PGCE in maths but a degree in another subject, they are counted against &quot;PGCE incorporating maths&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.866W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.2/4" class="indent">You asked how many teachers were judged by Ofsted (a) not to be adhering to the school behaviour policy and (b) not to be complying with management requests at the Ridings School in Calderdale.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.2/5" class="indent">Ofsted does not collect this detailed information. Inspectors observed a number of inadequate lessons at The Ridings School, and in some, the school's behaviour policy was not being followed. Other evidence, such as that emerging from discussions with support staff, indicated that children were being sent to the internal exclusion unit without earlier procedures being followed, supported the view that the problem was more widespread than those specific teachers. The school does not disagree with this judgement. However, the school inspection framework does not require&mdash;and indeed, there is insufficient time&mdash;for inspectors to observe all teachers in lessons.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.2/6" class="indent">Similarly, the number of staff not complying with management requests was not pursued in detail. The school's management team, governors and the Local Authority gave this as one reason for the difficulty the school was experiencing in moving forward and the evidence seen by inspectors triangulated this view. For example, an inspector observed a lesson taught by a teacher who was not a specialist in that particular subject area. It was a very poor lesson in which there was no planning, school behaviour policies were not followed by the teacher and the work was not appropriate for the students. As a result, students made no progress in their learning. The teacher explained that he was following union guidance to not adhere to any school policy regarding planning of lessons, preparing work and following behaviour policies when teaching lessons which were not in their specialist subject area.</p>

	<p pid="b.866W.5/2"><i> </i>As part of their general funding, local authorities have substantial resources to fulfil their responsibilities towards children and families. They also receive the Carers Special Grant which supports local authorities in providing breaks and services for carers in England. Department of Health guidance indicates that councils should consider spending around 20 per cent. of their allocation on young carers and those caring for disabled children. The Carers Grant was &pound;125 million in 2004-05, &pound;185 million in 2005-06 and &pound;185 million in 2006-07. It is worth &pound;185 million in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.5/3">The Vulnerable Children Grant, which identified young carers as a vulnerable group, was allocated to local authorities on a formula basis. It was worth (including matched funding) a total of &pound;84 million in 2004-05 and 2005-06. From 2006-07 onwards, the grant is no longer separately identified within DfES funding to local authority children's services. Within their overall provision, local authorities with children's services responsibilities are free to make spending decisions in accordance with their own assessment of local needs and priorities. Out-turn expenditure information on individual vulnerable groups is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.5/4">The Government have also funded the Children's Society to provide the &quot;Young Carers Initiative&quot; at a rate of &pound;80,000 over each of the three years up to 2006-07. The successor grant for 2007-08 to 2009-10 has been substantially increased. The grant for 2007-08 will be &pound;205,651.</p>

	<p pid="b.867W.5/11">These figures are drawn from the operational client management systems maintained the Connexions Service. They include 16-18 year olds known to the Connexions; young people who attended independent schools or were at school outside England may be excluded. The age relates to those of calendar year age 16-18 on the date of measurement. The figures are for the average percentage NEET between November and January each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.867W.5/12">This NEET measure is that used for setting and monitoring local authority NEET targets. The definition differs from that used to measure the national departmental PSA NEET target. Along with not covering the entire population, the Connexions NEET measure excludes those on gap years, or in custody. The PSA measure is for academic rather than calendar age 16-18.</p>

Non-operational governor grades are required to notionally work 41 hours in the London area and 42 elsewhere, including meal breaks. Operational governors work on the basis of being available to respond to emergency situations and therefore are unable to work a set shift cycle.

Governors do not work regularly in excess of guidelines set by the Working Time Directive.</p>

An investigation of the premises found it to be maintained to a very high standard. The whole storage and manufacturing process is inaccessible to wild birds. The feedstuffs produced at the mill comprise only ingredients from UK sources. The main component of the feedstuff produced is pelleted feed in a computer controlled operation which includes a heating process to at least 80&deg;C. Whole wheat grains are added to the pellets making up to 30 per cent. of the final ration. Before inclusion the wheat goes through a spraying process with a proprietary solution (Anitox Monoprene F Liquid) containing ammonium salts of propionic and butyric acids, propionic acid and formaldehyde.</p>

	<p pid="b.882W.6/2">European Council Directive 64/432/EEC requires cattle more than six weeks old to have reacted negatively to an intradermal tuberculin test carried out during the 30 days prior to export. Although technical staff employed by Animal Health have been recognised as 'approved tuberculosis testers', lay testers are not used for pre-export testing of cattle for tuberculosis (TB). This is in accordance with the Veterinary Surgery (Testing for TB in Bovines) Order 2005, and there are no plans to change this policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.11/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.886W.11/2">My Department has received representations in support of this matter from several hon. Members on behalf of constituents, (including Mr. Rodney Hale, chairman of the British Brown Hare Preservation Society), a petition signed by 505 members of the public, and letters from four further individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.11/3">Brown hares are not protected by a close season in the UK. In part, this is because it is recognised that hares can cause serious agricultural damage, and farmers need the flexibility to address problems when they occur. But mainly it is because there is currently no evidence that the introduction of a close season would significantly enhance hare numbers. Hare numbers have declined throughout Europe despite protection with close seasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.11/4">The Hare Preservation Act 1892 forbids the sale of hares during the notional main breeding season of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase> inclusive. This discourages farmers from shooting hares for commercial gain at this time, and aims to limit control during the breeding season to that necessary for crop protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.11/5">The current view of the Brown Hare Species Action Plan Steering Group is that habitat changes due to modern farming practices, rather than hunting or shooting, are the main cause of population decline in the brown hare. The steering group, which advises DEFRA on this species, has therefore not recommended the establishment of a close season. If there is any change to this advice then a case for new legislation to protect the brown hare would be considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.889W.2/2">Council Directive 99/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the welfare of laying hens. The directive bans the practice of keeping laying hens in conventional cages throughout the EU from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2012</phrase>. This has been implemented in England through the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No. 1646).</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.2/3">The directive specifically requires the EU Commission to prepare a report on the various systems that exist for keeping laying hens, including their health and environmental impact. The report will also take into account the socio-economic implications of the various systems and their effects on the Community's economic partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.2/4">We will consider the report and the evidence it contains once it is published. In the meantime, our policy remains that there should be no conventional cages from 2012. Reviewing the future of conventional cages on an EU basis will ensure that any legislative changes apply to all EU producers, thus avoiding the risk of simply displacing egg production to other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.891W.9/6" class="indent">The initial phase of the Operational Improvement Plan has focused on the organisational and operational restructuring of the Agency, and the training of our people to increase our capacity and capability. No commitments were made for the first year but the performance of the Agency has been steadily improving with early results showing improvements in several key areas and more money is already getting to more children. At the end of December 2006 compared with a year ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.891W.9/7" class="indent">58,000 more children were in receipt of maintenance or had a maintenance-direct arrangement in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.891W.9/8" class="indent">Applications are being cleared more quickly: 55 per cent. within twelve weeks, up from 49 per cent. and meeting target level for March 2007, and 74 per cent. within six months, up from 64 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.891W.9/9" class="indent">Client Service has improved: The Agency answered 97 per cent. of queued calls over 12 months, up from 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.891W.9/10" class="indent">I am confident the performance figures for the last quarter, due to be published later this week, will continue to demonstrate the ongoing developments in the Agency's performance.</p>

	<p pid="b.892W.11/5" class="indent">The procedure for the collection of debt is the same for old scheme and new scheme cases. If a change of circumstances, which results in an alteration to the debt balance of a case, is processed the Agency will recalculate the debt balance and contact the non-resident parent to negotiate a new payment arrangement. Under the Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency aim where possible to recoup any outstanding arrears within two yeas, once a payment schedule has been established. However, the Collections and Enforcement Regulations, 1992 prevent the Agency from taking more than 40% of a non-resident parent's net income in child maintenance payments, and all arrears agreements reflect this requirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.899W.2/2">Analysis from a recent independent poll indicates that the CRB is making a real difference to the protection of children and vulnerable adults; in the last three years, 60,000 unsuitable people have had offers of employment which involved working with children and vulnerable adults withdrawn on the basis of information contained on their Disclosure. This analysis also demonstrates that users of the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB) service feel that the information provided on Disclosures useful when making recruitment decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/3">The research, conducted by IPSOS MORI, shows that customer satisfaction levels are at an all-time high, reflecting the year-on-year improvements made by the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/4">The National Audit Office (NAO) produced a report in 2004 (Criminal Records Bureau, Delivering Safer Recruitment?) in which it noted that CRB did not measure the impact that it had on society, whether it reduced crimes against the vulnerable or reduced the fear of crime. Following a CRB Internal Audit report in 2006, a proposal was put forward to adopt a system of outcome measures, which the CRB are currently exploring, that will be used to determine further the effectiveness of the CRB's service in terms of child and vulnerable adult protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.899W.5/1">The Government believe that cross-border information exchange is fundamental to the fight against organised crime and terrorism and have therefore supported various EU initiatives to improve the exchange of information between member states. This includes a proposal currently under negotiation to facilitate the electronic exchange of data on fingerprints, DNA and vehicle registration between member states, known as the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.5/2">The Government have doubts however about the need for a centralised EU fingerprint database as suggested by the European Commission in its Annual Policy Strategy Communication for 2008. In particular, the Government will be looking to the Commission for a clear assessment of what added value this would bring to the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.5/3">The European Commission has yet to present the detail of its proposal, without which the Government cannot undertake a cost assessment. However, the Government have estimated that the start up costs for implementation of the Pr&uuml;m Council Decision would be around &pound;31 million. This includes running costs for the first year, which would be around &pound;2.5 million. The Government believe that this is justified by the practical benefits to be gained from the enhanced information sharing arrangements.</p>

Wiltshire police authority has recently provided the Home Office with its unaudited accounts for 2006-07 which show a &pound;3,066,000 deficit in their pensions account. In November 2006, Wiltshire police authority estimated a deficit of &pound;3,296,000 in their pensions account for the 2007-08 financial year. Under the new system of funding for police pensions, any deficit in an authority's pensions account is reimbursed with a grant from central Government each year; any surplus is recouped.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.12/1">Following a public consultation, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase> the Government announced the introduction of a new Impact Assessment (IA) to replace the previous Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) process.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.12/5" class="indent">A revised template aimed at improving clarity and transparency of IAs. This includes new requirements to more clearly summarise the rationale for government intervention and the evidence supporting the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.12/6" class="indent">A strengthened ministerial declaration that will bolster the quality of the analysis in IAs and help embed this earlier in the policy making process.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.12/7" class="indent">An increased emphasis on post-implementation review&mdash;the need for this existing requirement is featured on the front page of the new IA template.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.12/8" class="indent">Improved analysis of the impact on businesses and the third sector, with an indication of the estimated annual cost per organisation of the policy option for micro, small, medium and large organizations, and requiring policy makers to consider whether micro and small businesses should be exempted from the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.12/9">The new process is being phased in&mdash;IAs in the new format will appear in public consultations from mid-May and, from November 2007, we expect that all IAs will use the new format.</p>

	<p pid="b.911W.6/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, an independent body, was set up to make decisions on the clinical and cost effectiveness of technologies based on the latest evidence.

A report published by the National Cancer Director last year, &quot;Uptake of NICE approved cancer drugs&quot;, confirmed that the uptake of new cancer drugs by the national health service increases and variation in use around the country reduces following a positive NICE appraisal.</p>
	<p pid="b.911W.6/4">The Department has reiterated in recent good practice guidance that the NHS should not withhold funding for treatments just because NICE guidance is not available. In this instance, primary care trusts should make their decisions based on the available evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.912W.5/2">In June 2004, Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director published 'Variations in usage of cancer drugs approved by NICE'. This report showed that a positive appraisal of a cancer drug by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) was usually followed by increased overall usage of that drug but that there was variation in usage of NICE approved drugs between cancer networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.912W.5/3">In July 2006, Professor Richards published a follow-up report, 'Usage of cancer drugs approved by NICE', to confirm if the variations identified had been reduced. This report showed improvements with a continued increase in uptake of cancer drugs following a positive NICE appraisal (a 47 per cent. increase in cancer drug use since the last review) and a reduction in variation between cancer networks in usage of all NICE approved cancer drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January 2007</phrase>, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance to the national health service on the use of Cetuximab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.0/2">NICE'S guidance did not recommend Cetuximab as a treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the guidance states that patients who were receiving Cetuximab should have the option to continue to do so until they and their consultants decide that it is the right time to stop treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.0/3">It will be for individual primary care trusts to decide whether to fund Cetuximab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in the light of NICE'S recommendations. It would be inappropriate for ministers to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.6/1">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 placed a duty on all public authorities to address issues of racial inequality. The Department is a public authority under the meaning of this Act and is required by law to undertake race equality impact assessments. One such assessment was carried out by an external contractor to ensure independence and impartiality in 2004-05 at a cost of &pound;10,125 to the Department following its major change programme of 2003-04. This assessed the impact of a significant restructuring programme across the whole Department. The conclusions are summarised in an executive summary, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The Department continues to take action to ensure an ongoing commitment to equality is embedded within the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.3/2">In April 2003 the National Health Service Security Management Service (NHS SMS) was created and assumed responsibility for tackling violence against NHS staff, together with all other security related issues in the NHS in England. A comprehensive strategy has been implemented detailing both preventative and re-active action to be taken to tackle this problem both nationally and locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.3/3">Guidance has been issued to every health body in England setting out the support that should be offered at a local level to all NHS staff, including nurses that have experienced violence and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.3/4">The guidance directs the executive director responsible for security locally to ensure full co-operation with investigations into incidents of violence and abuse and it details the requirements to ensure that the person assaulted is kept informed of the progress and outcome of an investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.3/5">In addition the guidance includes the requirement for staff to be made aware of the support services available to them such as counselling and referral to an occupational health practitioner.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.6/1">This information is not held centrally. However, we do know that electronic record systems, such as those being delivered by the national programme for information technology, capable of sharing patient information wherever and whenever it is needed, provide more complete data and lead to the delivery of better care. No significant body of medical opinion disputes their enormous potential to support better clinical decision taking and reduce the incidence of medical error.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.6/2">Evidence from environments where electronic patient record systems are already routinely available and used shows, for example, that the number of failed appointments falls because hospitals have accurate and up-to-date addresses for patients. The number of duplicate diagnostic procedures and tests also reduces so that patients do not have to undergo repeat X-rays, reducing their risk of excess radiation and, importantly, patients benefit from knowing their records are up-to-date.</p>
	<p pid="b.926W.6/3">Systems like these deployed under the national programme, including the choose and book electronic bookings system which puts patients in charge of their care, and the patient demographic system, that enables letters to be posted to the correct address and patient information to be handled more efficiently, are already in place in every national health service trust, supporting access to care. These include an acute patient administration system (PAS) and a community hospital PAS deployed to Milton Keynes General Hospital NHS Trust and Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust respectively on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-24">24 February</phrase>, consisting of core PAS functionality along with accident and emergency, scheduling, and clinical functionality. These systems will serve 267,000 inhabitants in the Milton Keynes area.</p>
