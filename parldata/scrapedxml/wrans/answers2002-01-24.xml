The child tax credit will be complemented by the working tax credit, which aims to improve work incentives and make work pay.</p>

	<p pid=".986W.8/2">Before Budget 1998, an estimated 760,000 households faced marginal deduction rates (MDRs) of 50 per cent. or more, while 800,000 faced MDRs of 40 per cent. or more. After Budget 2001, an estimated 1.1 million households faced MDRs of 50 per cent. or more while 1.12 million faced MDRs of 40 per cent. or more. These figures, which cover the number of households in receipt of either income related benefits or WFTC where at least one person works 16 hours or more, include the effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit. The effect of tax and benefit changes introduced since Budget 1998, including the working families tax credit (WFTC), has reduced the number of households facing MDRs in excess of 70 per cent. by around half a million. As the WFTC is more generous than the family credit that it replaced, more families benefit from it, hence the larger numbers of households now facing MDRs at 40 and 50 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence is seeking to modernise arrangements for warship support and achieve savings to the defence budget. We have received proposals from the dockyard companies for potential partnering arrangements at the naval bases at Portsmouth, Devonport and the Clyde. We have also received alternative proposals from our trade unions for the pursuit of efficiencies at the naval bases. All options are currently being compared for value for money, together with their technical, commercial and human resource implications, for a decision in the near future.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence plans to introduce a facility to enable all serving personnel to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) through deductions from pay, to enable them to &quot;top up&quot; their pension benefits where they have scope to do so under Inland Revenue rules. This would also be available for those on specialist pay. As we made clear in our consultation document on the current review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, published in March of last year, we are also considering the option that MOD, as employer, might fund part of the costs of AVCs in respect of specialist pay. The decision will depend on whether or not this is judged to be a reasonable and cost-effective way of improving recruitment and retention. A decision on the review is expected later this year.</p>

Following detailed examination during the Defence Training Review, it has been decided to expand the college to include students from the RAF, Royal Navy and the civil service. A public-private partnership (PPP) project is currently under way to deliver the requirements of the Defence sixth form college, and this will be judged against a benchmark site at a former Army Barracks at Garats Hay near Loughborough. I must stress that the private sector is not constrained by this benchmark, and tenderers will be given the opportunity of selecting an alternative site to provide the facilities and services. It is too early to say where the college will ultimately be sited.</p>

	<p pid=".997W.3/2">The services rarely interfere or become directly involved in matrimonial or relationship disputes, unless requested to do so by the parties concerned, as these are essentially a private matter. Nevertheless, each service places great importance on the welfare of service families, recognising the significant contribution they make as well as the deleterious effects of mobility and separation aspects of service life. Consequently, there is a range of welfare facilities able to provide help and support on a wide range of issues, including relationship breakdown if requested. The service welfare organisations liaise with Relate at local level and provide those service personnel seeking professional marriage guidance counselling with an early referral.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.3/3">With the naval service personnel are able to meet with a professional from one of the Navy's caring organisations: the Naval Personal and Family Service (NPFS) or the Naval Chaplaincy Service (NCS). The NPFS employs qualified social workers able to offer direct advice, counselling, support (practical and emotional) and advocacy on behalf of clients.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.3/4">Within the Army, the main source of help is through the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association&mdash;Forces Help (SSAFA-FH), a charity contracted to provide a range of professional welfare services, particularly overseas. Army personnel also have access to other welfare organisations, available at most garrisons, as follows: the Army Welfare Service (AWS), the Army Families Federation (AFF) and the Army Families Advice Bureau (AFAB). In Germany, the Army also provides funding for dependants to return to the UK to be trained in marriage guidance counselling by Relate; this then provides an additional resource in theatre.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.3/5">As with the other two services, the RAF has no programmes in place specifically to provide assistance to those experiencing relationship problems. However, there are a number of networks and organisations available to individuals or couples able to provide support and guidance if requested. These include the SSAFA-FH RAF(UK) Social Work Service which has staff based on 32 Stations in the UK. The RAF has recently launched a community support website that gives practical information and links to organisations which may be able to provide the necessary help and guidance. The website, <a href="http://www.rafcom.co.uk">www.rafcom.co.uk</a>, is designed to tackle issues that may contribute to relationship problems.</p>

We understand that the Irish Government are considering how to address the concerns of the Irish people regarding the treaty. In the meantime, as agreed by all EU Governments, including the Irish Government, other member states are proceeding with their ratification processes. The Laeken European Council in December 2001 confirmed the EU's determination to complete negotiations with those candidates that are ready by the end of 2002 so that they can join the EU in time to participate in the 2004 European Parliament elections. The UK is fully committed to this goal.</p>

However we recognise that debt management is a key part of maintaining longer-term debt sustainability. DFID is working closely with the World bank, International Monetary Fund, other development partners and the Government of Tanzania to ensure that such investments, and the resulting impact on annual debt repayments, are fully scrutinised as part of the public expenditure review and debt management processes.</p>

	<p pid=".1004W.3/1">The normal retirement age for members of the senior civil service is 60. The main objective of the review currently being undertaken is to produce a model which will provide Departments with a range of options for managing their senior civil servants. These could include opportunities for moving to flexible working patterns as part of a phased retirement process, and mechanisms for retaining staff with strong potential beyond age 60, particularly those with key skills in such areas as project management. The time scale for implementation has not been finalised but will take account of the differing circumstances and staffing structures of Departments.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.4/2">The inquiry has been unable to establish the source or nature of the leak of the 2001 Key Stage 2 test results. The main reasons for this are:</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.4/3">(a) There appears to have been no leak of a paper or document; the <i>Evening Standard</i> article on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September</phrase> seems to have been based on one or more casual conversations from which the story was constructed; and</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.4/4">(b) Given the significant number of people in the Department for Education and Skills, Ofsted, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the associated contractors and those elsewhere who had access to the information, there is no prospect of identifying the person who provided the relevant information, unless the journalist concerned is prepared to reveal his source or sources.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.4/5">The inquiry concludes that there is no evidence of a deliberate disclosure from Ministers, officials or advisers in the Department. Indeed, on the limited evidence available, the disclosure seems unlikely to have come from any departmental source.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.4/6">The inquiry makes a number of recommendations for strengthening the control and management of sensitive information in advance of the advertised day of its disclosure. These are being taken forward.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.2/2">Local education authorities (LEAs) are responsible for the local strategic management of the school estate. This responsibility includes the need to ensure best value when making investment decisions. When considering major investment in school buildings, one of the options that authorities should consider is the private finance initiative. Where an LEA decides, following an options appraisal, that it wishes to pursue the use of PFI, it will submit an outline proposal to my Department. If, following evaluation against published criteria, provisional support is received to develop an outline business case, the authority must demonstrate that PFI represents a better value for money solution than a conventionally procured alternative.</p>

	<p pid=".1015W.0/2">The use of PFI contracts to upgrade school buildings is one of a number of funding options available to local education authorities. If an authority wishes to develop a PFI project, it must first make preliminary proposals to the Department, which are assessed against published criteria. Although the Department currently allocates each year around &pound;850 million PFI credits, we are not able to support all of the proposals put forward. The proposals which best match the published criteria receive provisional support at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".1015W.0/3">Projects are not formally approved until a full Outline Business Case (OBC) has been submitted to the Treasury-chaired Project Review Group. This OBC must include a public sector comparator (PSC). It is a condition of approval that the proposed PFI solution must demonstrate better value for money than the PSC, as well as satisfy various other criteria necessary to demonstrate the viability of the project.</p>

The 1998 School Standards and Framework Act provides for schools with a specialism to select up to 10 per cent. of their intake on the basis of aptitude for a specialist subject prescribed in regulations. Prior to the 1998 Act schools had greater discretion over aptitude selection and this accounts for the percentages above 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".1016W.5/2">The Technology Colleges Trust is an independent charitable trust grant-aided by the Department to advise schools in drawing up applications, and through its work in promoting the Specialist Schools Programme attracts sponsorship to support individual school's applications. Detailed information on grants facilitated by the Technology Colleges Trust is not readily available and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, we do have an analysis of applications for Arts, Technology and Language status in June and October 1999, and March 2000, which shows that of the 238 applications submitted 88 applicants included sponsorship facilitated through the Technology Colleges Trust.</p>

Research on the impact of specialist schools was commissioned by the then DfEE from Leeds university and the London school of economics and was published in 2000. Last October Ofsted published a report on the progress of specialist schools. Professor David Jesson will shortly be preparing an analysis of educational outcomes of specialist schools in 2001 on behalf of the Technology Colleges Trust and I expect this to be published in the spring.</p>

	<p pid=".1023W.2/1">Disability living allowance and attendance allowance provide a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people. Entitlement to these benefits is not based on specific mental or physical disabilities, but depends upon the need for help with personal care, supervision and (in the case of disability living allowance) mobility difficulties which arise from such disabilities. This means that the benefits are already accessible to people with mental or physical disabilities, or a combination of both.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.2/2">We are exploring, with the help of representatives from disability organisations, whether extra-costs disability benefits could be based on a range of activities of daily living rather than just the care and mobility tests.

The total paid in statutory compensation for slaughtered animals is &pound;1,079,500,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1027W.9/2">The Department has not published an assessment of the total market value of animals killed because of FMD. The statistics which the Department will publish in &quot;Agriculture in the UK&quot; in March 2002 will show the impact of FMD on the value of the industry's assets.</p>

The report &quot;Water-based Sport and Recreation&quot; identified the powers available to local authorities to give people greater access to inland water for open-air recreation. We are looking at what action we may need to take in the light of the research report. Copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>

The evaluations are being conducted under an agreement between the farming and biotechnology industry body (SCIMAC) and the Government. The progress of the evaluations is being overseen by the independent Scientific Steering Committee (SSC), which includes experts from academia and conservation organisations. SCIMAC finds locations for the evaluations programme. These are then checked, assessed and selected against scientific criteria, which includes crop history, agronomy and measures of biodiversity, by the independent researchers undertaking the field study. The distribution of locations is finally approved, on scientific grounds alone, by the SSC. They have recommended that a geographical spread of sites be obtained that is representative of regional differences in crop distribution and the range of current farming methods, biodiversity and production intensities throughout Britain. The Government are not involved in the process of selecting FSE sites.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.5/1">The Countryside Agency published interim results from its own interpretation of community vibrancy based on three 'classes' in its State of the Countryside Report 2001. The indicator was based on interim findings of the 2000 Rural Services Survey and the State of the Countryside report recognised some limitations with the indicator, stating that these findings largely reflect the 'critical' mass of population needed to enable the community activity opportunity to become viable or functional. The indicator does not reveal the extent to which smaller settlements and parishes are able to take up community activities in neighbouring parishes. Further, communities in all size of parish may exhibit community vibrancy in other ways than those assessed here.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.5/2">Consultation was not done directly with individual communities. However the scoring system used for the sub-set of parishes analysed was contained in the State of the Countryside Report 2001. Following this publication, the Countryside Agency received no comments on the components of the scoring system. The indicator is still in development and the scoring was adapted to meet the four classes used in the RWP headline indicator.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.5/3">Individual parish scores were not intended to be published, but used within an overall indicator based on returns submitted through the Rural Services Survey parish questionnaire to all rural parish clerks during autumn 2000. Some forms were interpreted differently or inadequately completed and, to date, the indicator has used these returns as the sole basis. The indicator is thus based on a standard national measure for 2000. For future work, the Countryside Agency is looking at ways of improving the collection and robustness of data to inform our indicator. This will include working with DEFRA, National Association of Local Councils and bodies such as rural community councils.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.5/4">The Countryside Agency recognises some shortcomings in the data and it is not intended for any listing of parishes to be used for targeting funding or similar policy initiatives. The Countryside Agency intends to look at the whole issue again through consultation on the methodology, rather than amending individual classifications. Differing views over individual classifications are inevitable but the Countryside Agency would prefer to address these in a review of the indicator rather than on a case-by-case basis. In particular, the naming convention of the groups may be reconsidered to more accurately reflect the underlying information.</p>

Taking into account the policy that Registered Social Landlord rents increases should be limited to RPI plus 0.5 per cent. a year, it is likely that average council rents will have to rise by about an average of about 1.5 per cent. a year in real terms over the next 10 years to achieve Ministers' intention that similar rents should be charged for similar council and housing association properties by 2012.

	<p pid=".1039W.2/1">There are estimated to be around 50,000 LPG cars in the UK. Motorists are converting to LPG at an increasing rate, with the number expected to increase by about 25,000 over the next year, prompted by the Government grants available, and the fact that low-cost LPG fuel is now available in all areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1039W.2/2">DVLA data provide more disaggregated information on alternative fuel use as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1039W.2/5"> <th><i>Vehicle class</i></th> <th><i>Dedicated gas</i></th> <th><i>Percentage of total fleet</i></th> <th><i>Bi-fuel</i></th> <th><i>Percentage of total fleet</i></th> </tr>

			<tr pid=".1039W.2/10"> <td>Trucks</td> <td>202</td> <td>0.05</td> <td>25</td> <td>0.006</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1039W.2/13">But this understates the number of vehicles because not all conversions to alternative fuelling are notified to DVLA.</p>
	<p pid=".1039W.2/14">DVLA statistics do not distinguish between liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas vehicles. However, cars and light commercial vehicles tend to use LPG, while heavier vehicles use natural gas.</p>
	<p pid=".1039W.2/15">Although DVLA does not keep statistics on the number of battery electric cars, my Department estimates that there are approximately 400 of these in the UK. In addition, DVLA statistics show that there are 484 hybrid petrol/electric cars.</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.2/1">The Government do not fund speed cameras. The cost of purchasing and operating cameras falls to the local authorities and police. Eight police force areas have been trailing a new funding system that allows some fixed penalty fine revenue to be netted-off and re-invested in speed camera operation. It is estimated that 109 fewer people were killed or seriously injured as a result of the increased enforcement in the trial areas. The new funding system is now available nationally and I fully expect, as more areas join, the numbers of those killed or seriously injured to decrease still further.</p>

It entailed the replacement of 420 directional signs across the town and its approaches with new versions. None of the work was carried out in car parks.</p>

I have no reason to question the rigour with which the work was conducted. Descriptions of the project written by some of the individuals who took part were published in the technical press (<i>Highways and Transportation Journal</i> July 1989 and February 1990).</p>

	<p pid=".1047W.0/1">The Widford Bridge is situated on the old A12 (now A1114) through Chelmsford. Chelmsford borough council manage the road on behalf of the Highway Authority, Essex county council, although pending its replacement, the bridge remains the responsibility of the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".1047W.0/2">Because the bridge's condition has deteriorated, the agency has had to restrict to three tonnes the weight of vehicles using it. To achieve this, vehicle widths are restricted to 6 ft 6 in. The signing arrangements were designed for the borough council by the agency's design agents. The programming of the work to implement the width restriction and the installation of advance and permanent signing on the local road network are being organised by the borough council. All work is being carried out by the borough council's contractors although the Highways Agency is paying for it.</p>
	<p pid=".1047W.0/3">A scheme to replace the bridge is currently expected to start in autumn 2003. The cost, which will be borne by the agency, is expected to be about &pound;4.5 million. Given the large amount of detailed design and preparation work that needs to take place, and also taking into account the long lead in time necessary to carry out work over a busy railway line, this is the earliest date work can start.</p>

Links are made to the substantial body of guidance to regional and local planning authorities where there is a read across with air navigation procedures and the design of controlled airspace around larger airports. I have placed copies of the guidance in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1052W.8/1">We are today publishing a consultation document entitled &quot;Consultation on possible changes to the Use Classes Order and temporary uses provisions&quot;. This completes the series of consultation papers that together are designed to deliver a radical reform of the planning system.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.8/2">Planning permission is required for a material change of use. However, certain uses are so similar, for example in terms of noise, traffic, appearance and parking, that there is no obvious reason why planning permission for change of use from one to the other should be required. The Use Classes Order (UCO) excludes from planning control any change of use where both the existing and proposed use fall within the same class. The General Permitted Development Order (GPDO) provides further flexibility by classifying certain moves between the Use Classes as permitted development, so that a developer does not need to apply for planning permission.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.8/3">It is important that the Use Classes Order should be up to date and relevant and reflect current policy priorities. In our view, the order and related GPDO provisions should be constructed in a way which allows the maximum possible freedom from planning control consistent with delivering planning policy and wider objectives, including protecting amenity.</p>
	<p pid=".1052W.8/4">The consultation document sets out a range of options for changes to the use class provisions and temporary use provisions. We will consider responses carefully before deciding on the most appropriate way forward.</p>

	<p pid=".1053W.2/1">The Regional Planning Guidance for the east midlands (RPG8) is being published today.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/2">The RPG sets out the spatial development strategy that encompasses proposals for the development of the region's economy, infrastructure, housing and other land uses. The guiding principle is that the main urban areas and previously developed land should be the preferred locations for most development. RPG also sets out proposals for the conservation, management and enhancement of the region's natural and cultural environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/3">I am pleased that much of the format and content of RPG8, including the vision, objectives and core strategy, carries forward much of what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the East Midlands Regional Local Government Association (EMRLGA). RPG8 reflects very effective working between EMRLGA, local authorities and other stakeholders, all of whom have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft strategy. It builds on the new inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. The RPG was prepared before our planning Green Paper proposals were announced in December. I look to the Regional Planning Body to take strategy forward and to monitor and review it in line with the regional planning principles set out in the Green Paper.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.0/1">Paragraph 9.12 of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy states that around 1.3 million people without a gas supply in Great Britain are thought to be in fuel poverty. This figure is a broad estimate derived from estimates for England (0.9 million), Scotland (0.3 million) and Wales (0.05 million) based on official data sources. The production of these figures, and the overall estimate, have been overseen by members of the Government Statistical Service.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/2" class="italic">England</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/3">It is estimated that in 1998 there were approximately 0.9 million households in England which were fuel poor and did not have mains gas in the home (the householder stated that there was no gas supply in the home). The source of this information was the 1998 Energy Follow Up Survey which was carried out by the Building Research Establishment on behalf of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. This figure has been derived under both main definitions of fuel poverty used in the Government's UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, set out as follows. There is a small difference (0.08 million) between the figures under these two definitions; however, both figures round to 0.9 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.0/7" class="italic">Scotland</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/8">It is estimated that in 1996 there were approximately 320,000 households in Scotland which were fuel poor and did not have a mains gas supply in the home (i.e. there was neither a gas meter, nor a mains gas pipe in the home). This is the latest information available for Scotland. The source of this information is the 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey which is carried out on behalf of the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.0/9">The definition of fuel poverty which was used is that a household needs to spend 10 per cent. or more of income (including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest) on all fuel use.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.0/11">It is estimated that in 1997&ndash;98 there were approximately 50,000 households in Wales which were fuel poor and did not have a mains gas supply in the home. This is derived from information from the 1998 Welsh House Condition Survey which was carried out on behalf of the National Assembly for Wales. The estimate of fuel poverty in Wales is based on the number of households eligible for assistance through the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (222,000 in 1997&ndash;98). Figures are not currently available under definitions of fuel poverty, and this &quot;eligibility measure&quot; is used as a proxy.</p>

The results of the pilot will be fully evaluated and decisions on national roll-out will be based on the findings of the evaluation and on further work on funding and service design.

Work on evaluating the pilot has already begun and a full evaluation should be completed by the end of June. Work on funding and the design of a national service will be progressed as far as possible in parallel with evaluation of the pilot so that firm decisions on a national scheme can be taken next autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.0/2">At the June 2001 meeting of the OECD Export Credit Group the USA rejected latest proposals of the common approaches recommendation as they did not &quot;require&quot; Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) to make public environmental impact information relating to projects being reviewed by ECAs before the ECA reaches its decision on supporting a project.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/3">ECGD would have been content to discuss this issue further and was successful with its proposal that the following wording should be included:</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Members are expected to encourage project sponsors to make environmental impact information publicly available&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/5">Several of the country representatives stated that their domestic legislation prevented their ECA from making publicly available any information concerning applications for support. Several more made it clear that, at this stage, they could not consider publishing any information &quot;prior&quot; to making their decision on support. It was therefore apparent that a consensus could not have been achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/6">Given the significance of the issues that could be agreed and the commitment to review the agreement by the end of 2003</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/7" class="indent">&quot;to enhance it in the light of experience&quot;, ECGD concluded that this agreement was a good first step in order to cement the progress made.</p>
	<p pid=".1068W.0/8">ECGD will be consulting about the timing of the publication of EIAs in early 2002 as part of its review of its &quot;Impact Questionnaire&quot; and associated case impact analysis process.</p>

	<p pid=".1073W.2/2">Decisions relating to ATMs are a commercial matter for Post Office Ltd. who tell me that maintenance arrangements vary according to the type of ATM machine and the provider of the machine. However, all technical servicing is undertaken by the machine's provider. In the more remote locations some maintenance and stocking of cash is carried out by the sub-postmaster. Payment for sub-postmasters is based on transaction volumes and in some cases a fixed sum up to a transaction volume threshold. No assessment has been made of additional income generated for sub-postmasters by ATM machines; Post Office Ltd. is not party to the retail trading performance of individual sub-postmasters.</p>

	<p pid=".1073W.5/1">The Department and claimants' solicitors have agreed a priority points system which is set out in the Handling Agreement. Claimants with higher points will have greater priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/2">There are predominantly two stages of prioritisation in respect of living former miners claiming compensation for respiratory disease:</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/3" class="indent">A. Claimants undergoing screening spirometry;</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/4" class="indent">B. Claimants proceeding through the medical assessment process, MAP, after lung function testing. <i>A. Screening Spirometry</i></p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/5">Three factors are taken into account as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/6" class="indent">(1) age of claimant;</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/7" class="indent">(2) date of receipt of claim;</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/8" class="indent">(3) short life expectancy (as recorded by the GP).</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/9">Points are allocated for short life expectancy if IRISC, the Department's claims handlers, receive written confirmation from the claimant's GP that the claimant has a life expectancy of less than two years. The age of the claimant and any short life expectancy are considered to be more important factors than the date of claim and, accordingly, are weighted more heavily in the points system. <i>B. Claimants proceeding through the medical assessment process, MAP, after lung function testing</i></p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/10">Further points are awarded on the basis of a claimant's spirometry test result to a maximum of 150. Claimants who are unable, for medical reasons, to produce a spirometry result, will receive points in lieu of those that would otherwise have been awarded after spirometry testing.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/11" class="italic">Deceased mineworkers</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/12">With regard to deceased mineworkers, these claims will be processed by a paper-based assessment with priority being given to widows. Points are awarded according to the age of claim and any short life expectancy of the widow.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/13">Presently, the Department is processing claims as set out in the Handling Agreement with the most elderly and ill being dealt with first. Widows are also being dealt with as a priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1073W.5/14">It should be noted that prioritisation does not override geographical variations in the availability of resources for live claims. All available resources will be used to the maximum even though claimants based in one area may be tested or examined ahead of someone with a higher priority score in another.</p>

	<p pid=".1074W.5/1">The latest labour force survey data shows that there were 2,505,000 people resident in the west midlands who were in employment in the period September to November 2001. This represented an increase of 30,000 or 1.2 per cent. on the previous three-month period and an increase of 42,000 or 1.6 per cent. on the equivalent period a year earlier.</p>

With regard to the current situation between Land Rover and KPMG (administrative receivers to UPF Group) both parties are in urgent negotiations to resolve their differences. We hope that a satisfactory solution is found that safeguards security of supply to Land Rover and also enables the UPF business to be sold as a going concern. DTI continues to remain in contact with all the key players but essentially this is a commercial matter for Land Rover and KPMG.</p>

	<p pid=".1078W.5/1">The detailed arrangements for operation of the BUPA Redwood facility as a diagnostic and treatment centre for national health service patients are currently in development between BUPA and the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. It is not possible to say at this stage what the ratio of public to private staff will be or how the facilities will be used for NHS patients. This information will be made available prior to commencement of the new arrangements. Human Resource issues are of paramount importance in the development of this concept, and the trust will be working closely with the Department to ensure that the most appropriate arrangements are agreed.</p>

	<p pid=".1083W.6/2">Morecambe Bay Hospitals National Health Service Trust and Morecambe Bay Primary Care Trust intend to review the delivery of emergency and out-of-hours services for residents of South Lakeland. This work will take place with full public involvement and in the context of existing and developing national guidelines, the local modernisation review process and relevant staffing considerations. It is anticipated that detailed information of the nature requested will emerge as part of that exercise. A report, with recommendations, will be produced by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>, to be considered by the boards of the trust, primary care trust and Cumbria ambulance service. Any proposals for significant variations in existing service provision would, of course, be subject to full public consultation at a later stage.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.5/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issues equal opportunities goals and objectives on an annual basis for all public appointments to national health service boards, special health authorities and non-departmental public bodies. The goals and objectives set in July 2001 for achievement by December 2004 are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.5/3">We have made huge strides over recent years in increasing the proportion of women and black and ethnic minority candidates appointed NHS boards. 49 per cent. of all NHS board members and 41 per cent. of chairs are now women, and 12 per cent. of members are black or from ethnic minorities. This compares with figures of only 39 per cent. and 5 per cent. at the time of the 1997 general election. The proportion of disabled candidates appointed over the last five years has also more than doubled. As a result, the boards of these bodies are now much more representative of the communities they serve.</p>

Dr. Miller would also provide advice to the Department's independent advisory committee, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, and, as required to the Committee on Safety of Medicines.</p>

	<p pid=".1091W.2/1">Considerable progress is being made in the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; pay modernisation talks. In particular the job evaluation scheme has been developed further so that it is now generating credible and consistent results over the range of jobs covered by the United Kingdom-wide national health service. It has now been used to carry out evaluations on around 400 examples of the most common NHS jobs, which provides the basic data needed for negotiating the new pay structure. The central negotiating group has prepared negotiating documents covering all areas of the new pay system, with remaining differences between the Health Department's proposals and the views of staff representative organisations highlighted.</p>
	<p pid=".1091W.2/2">We have decided to leave final decisions on the new system until after the 2002 Spending Review is announced. Until then all parties have agreed that the job evaluation scheme and models of a new pay structure should continue to be developed. The aim will be to complete this work as early as possible this year to enable swift agreement with a view to starting implementation at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

But Scotland should benefit from work undertaken in England and Wales in researching the problem of mobile phone theft, and in working with the industry. Although other measures are important, more needs to be done by the industry to enhance the security of their product, and we are pressing them to do more to prevent their customers from becoming the victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1099W.5/2">We have succeeded in gaining the commitment of United Kingdom phone operators to some early measures to test ways of putting stolen phones out of action. In particular, we are exploring with the police and the operators a Dutch initiative which disables stolen phones by &quot;bombing&quot; them with teletext messages every few minutes. The operators have also agreed to improve security as investment takes place in new systems, and we are seeking similar commitments from manufacturers.</p>

	<p pid=".1100W.0/1">Some 40 per cent. of regulated scientific procedures using live animals in Great Britain are conducted in universities and medical schools. They form part of a wide range of programmes of fundamental and applied medical research.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.0/2">All such procedures in the United Kingdom are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Act provides for a three-tier licensing system covering the establishments concerned, the research programmes undertaken, and the individuals carrying out the work.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.0/3">Under the Act the procedures can be licensed for only a limited number of permitted purposes, and then only if there is no alternative to the use of animals. Moreover, use of animals will not be permitted unless the benefits of the proposed research are deemed to outweigh the welfare costs to the animals. The number of animals then used, and the suffering they are caused, must be minimised. This reflects the application of the &quot;three Rs&quot; in relation to animal experimentation; replacing the use of animals with alternative methods, reducing the number of animals needed for a particular purpose and refining the procedures to minimise suffering.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.0/4">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate assesses all licence applications and monitors compliance with licence authorities to ensure appropriate standards of animal welfare. Required minimum standards for the housing and care of the animals are set out in detail in published codes of practice.</p>

	<p pid=".1102W.2/1">'Child Abuse' is not a specific offence but actions of this nature can be prosecuted under a number of offences. Recorded crime statistics show the categories of offence with the largest numbers of offences specifically against children are: cruelty or neglect to a child (2,558 offences in 2000&ndash;01) and gross indecency with a child (1,336 offences in 2000&ndash;01).</p>
	<p pid=".1102W.2/2">In the year 2000, 616 prisoners were received for the offence of gross indecency with a child. They had been given, on average, a sentence of 27.5 months. In the same year, 124 prisoners were received for the offence of cruelty to a child. They had been given, on average, a sentence of 16.4 months.</p>
	<p pid=".1102W.2/3">Other offenders imprisoned for actions against children would have been included in offence categories that do not separately identify children, eg rape, incest, homicide, etc. It is not possible to identify the sentence lengths given for these cases from central records, although all those convicted of murder would have received a mandatory life sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".1102W.2/4">Under the broad review of sentencing that began in July, the Government are looking at tougher determinate sentences for sex offenders that will ensure they stay in prison, up to the full term if necessary, so long as they continue to present a risk of harm to our communities and that they are subject to strict and extended supervision on release. The Government are also looking at a requirement that where a life sentence is an option judges should not shy away from using it if the professional evidence shows that there is a clear risk that the offender will commit further sex offences.</p>
