	<p pid="b.642W.3/1">In April 1998, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) published guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields in the frequency range up to 300 GHz. This report is available at www.icnirp.de.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.3/2">Restrictions on the effects of exposure to time-varying EMFs are based on biological considerations of their interactions with the body and are termed basic restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.3/3">Depending on frequency, the physical quantities used to specify the basic restrictions include: induced current density, measured in Amps per square metre (A m<sup>(2)</sup>); specific energy absorption rate (SAR), measured in watts per kilogram (W / kg); or, for higher frequencies, power density, measured in watts per square metre (W / m<sup>(2)</sup>).</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.3/4">For example, the basic restriction on exposure to EMFs in the frequency range between 10 Hz and 1 kHz, which includes the frequency of UK mains electricity, for occupational exposure, ICNIRP recommends 10 mA m<sup>(-2)</sup> (10 milliAmps per square cm). For public exposure, ICNIRP recommends a reduction in the limit to 2 milliamps per cm (2 mA m<sup>(-2)</sup>) &mdash;5 times less.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.3/5">For the frequencies used by mobile phone companies, the ICNIRP guidelines for occupational exposure specify 22.5 watts per square metre (for 900 MHz) and 45 watts per square metre (for 1.8 GHz frequency). For public exposure, these guidelines are 4.5 watts per square metre and 9 watts per square metre respectively&mdash; 5 times less.</p>

	<p pid="b.660W.0/1">Since April 2004 all three and four year olds have been entitled to a free, good quality, part-time early education place. The free entitlement consists of 12.5 hours early education per week for 38 weeks of the year and will be extended to 15 hours a week by 2010. By that time, parents who wish to do so will also be able to access the free entitlement flexibly across a minimum of three days.</p>
	<p pid="b.660W.0/2">Figures for January 2006 show that virtually all 4-year-old children receive some form of free entitlement. The figure for 3-years-olds is 96 per cent. This covers all maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers and represents 541,700 3-year-olds and 559,400 4-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.660W.0/3">In January 2006 there were 970 part time funded places for three year olds and 1,100 part time funded places for four year olds in the Gravesham parliamentary constituency. There were 12,400 part time funded places for three year olds and 14,900 part time funded places for four year olds in the Kent local authority. The latest figures on early education places for three and four year olds in England were published in Statistical First Release 32/2006 'Provision for children under five years of age in England&mdash;January 2006 (final)' in September, which is available on my Department's website: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/">www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/</a></p>

	<p pid="b.660W.3/1">Local authorities receive funding for all pre-16 provision, through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). This is a ring-fenced DfES grant provided to local authorities to fund educational provision in all types of setting, including private, voluntary and independent settings offering free early education. Funding for under 5s is not identified separately within DSG. The DSG guaranteed unit of funding (for each full-time equivalent pupil aged 3-15) should not be seen as the level of funding for each pupil but as a mechanism for distributing the total quantum of DSG to local authorities. The total DSG funding provided to Kent county council in 2006-07 is &pound;718 million (a 6.9 per cent. increase per pupil).</p>
	<p pid="b.660W.3/2">Local authorities are responsible for deciding how best to apply the total funding across different age groups and between different types of provider taking account of local needs and circumstances. The &quot;Code of Practice on the Provision of Free Nursery Education places for Three and Four Year Olds&quot; makes clear that local authorities should fund all providers delivering the free early education entitlement equitably, fairly and transparently.</p>

	<p pid="b.663W.6/1">There is no general exemption given to the policy of full cost recovery for the environmental regulation enforced by the Environment Agency (EA) that applies to agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.6/2">In general, the legislation across all industries that involves permits, licences, consents or authorisations provides for charges to be made. Other, 'rule-based' regulation, which makes general provisions for all (rather than requiring a site-specific approach) does not. A significant part of farm regulation is based on 'rule-based' legislation. The EA's work on rule-based regulation is generally funded by Grant in Aid (GiA).</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.6/3">There are three areas where special arrangements have been made for the agriculture sector relating to charges. All these originate from the Action Plan for Farming 2000 . They are:</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.6/4" class="indent">The waiving of charges for groundwater authorisations from their initial implementation until they were reinstated after four years in 2005. In this case the shortfall in charges replaced by GiA was of the order of &pound;1 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.6/5" class="indent">The Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 ('Agricultural Waste Regulations') which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>. The Action Plan for Farming (2000) included a Government commitment that registration of exemptions for the agriculture sector would not be chargeable. No estimate on the cost to the EA is available. The Environment Agency and DEFRA are exploring low cost approaches to achieve the desired environmental outcomes in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.6/6" class="indent">The Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 which require that intensive livestock installations of relevant size thresholds hold a permit. The Action Plan for Farming included a commitment that application and subsistence charges for permits for the intensive livestock sector should be as low as possible. The Environment Agency, in consultation with DEFRA and industry organisations, has developed a low cost approach to PPC for the intensive livestock sector consistent with the lower charges.</p>

These two orders prohibit, amongst other things, making funds, financial assets or economic resources available to the extensive list of individuals listed under Council Common Position 2004/423/CFSP. The orders also ban, with certain exemptions, new investment in listed Burmese state-owned enterprises. These orders do not however apply in Bermuda and Gibraltar. In the case of Gibraltar, the EU Common Position is applied through Gibraltar's Export Control (Sanctions, etc) Orders 2005 and 2006, and the Burma, Freezing of Funds and Economic Resources, (no.2) Regulations 2005. The Government of Bermuda has not yet implemented the necessary legislation, but we are discussing this with them.

	<p pid="b.667W.8/1">Child rights are one of the top three human rights priorities for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An important focus is the issue of children affected by armed conflict, including the recruitment of children into armed forces and armed groups. The UK supported the establishment of a UN monitoring and reporting mechanism on this issue and is actively involved in the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, established by UN Security Council Resolution 1612, to follow up reports from this mechanism. The UK welcomes the efforts of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict to advocate the rights of children affected by armed conflict. The UK encourages all states who have not yet signed or ratified the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts to do so as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.8/2">Ministers and officials have made representations on this issue. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Mr. McCartney), raised our concerns on a number of issues in Burma including the recruitment of child soldiers with the Burmese ambassador in London in June, and in writing to the Burmese Foreign Minister in July. During 2005, officials were active in a series of EU d&eacute;marches in countries where the use of child soldiers is a particular problem, such as Burundi, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Nepal, Sudan and Uganda. The UK has also sought to ensure that disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes are sustainable and make appropriate provision for the particular needs of children. This has included specific assistance in a number of the countries listed, for example the Ministry of Defence's assistance in reforming recruiting practices in the Sierra Leone army.</p>

	<p pid="b.669W.2/1">In July 2004, the International Criminal Court (ICC) launched an investigation into the situation in Northern Uganda, following referral of the situation by the Government of Uganda. The ICC issued warrants for the arrest of five Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) commanders, including Joseph Kony, in October 2005. Raska Lukwiya, one of the indictees, is believed to have been killed in August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.2/2">The UK is a strong supporter&mdash;in principle and in practice&mdash;of the ICC. We believe it is imperative to tackle impunity, to deter others taking up arms and terrorising civilians.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.2/3">Responsibility to effect the arrest warrants lies in the first instance with the states on whose territory the LRA commanders are believed to be, in this case, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.2/4">We continue to urge all parties, in particular the Governments of Uganda, the DRC and Sudan to fulfil their commitments to the ICC and we welcome the fact that these Governments are co-operating with the Court.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.2/1">Iran's nuclear activities are of great concern. The nature of the Iranian programme, Iran's history of concealment and its continuing failure to co-operate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have intensified international concerns that the aims may not be, as Iran claims, entirely peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.2/2">Despite intense and prolonged efforts to encourage Iran to take the steps required by the IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council, Iran has not done so. The most recent report by the IAEA Director-General, Dr. Mohammed El-Baradei, makes clear that Iran has not suspended its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. In Resolution 1696, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July</phrase>, the Security Council made a full suspension mandatory on Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase>, EU High Representative Javier Solana presented to Iran a set of far reaching proposals on behalf of the 'E3+3' (UK, France, Germany + China, Russia, US). These would give Iran everything it needs to develop a modern nuclear power industry, and other benefits, while addressing international concerns. We are disappointed that Iran has not taken the steps required to enable negotiations to begin.</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.2/4">In Resolution 1696, the Security Council expressed its intention to take appropriate measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter&mdash;which might include sanctions&mdash;if Iran failed to comply. Together with our partners, we are presently considering next steps. The E3+3 proposals remain on the table, and if Iran meets the requirements of the IAEA Board and Security Council, we are prepared to suspend further activity in the Security Council. But if it does not, Iran should be in no doubt that the Security Council will respond.</p>

	<p pid="b.677W.2/1">The UK has used it Presidencies of the UN Security Council to support the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325. Specific examples of UK activity include:</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/2" class="indent">UK officials actively seeking opportunities for appropriate references to gender concerns in all UN peacekeeping mandates&mdash;recent examples can be found in UN resolutions on peacekeeping operations in Liberia and Sudan;</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/3" class="indent">awareness raising events on various issues including mainstreaming gender throughout the Security Council's protection-based work, strengthening the UN's response to gender based violence in conflict and post conflict situations and the development of National Action Plans;</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/4" class="indent">providing financial support to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO's) &quot;Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multi-dimensional Peace Operations&quot; which involved the development of a 'virtual resource centre' for those involved in peace operations to draw on; and</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/5" class="indent">UK participation in a Joint Donor Review Mission to four UN Peacekeeping Missions to assess the effectiveness and impact of DPKO's gender work and to identify lessons learned and best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/6">As part of our commitment to UNSCR 1325 the UK has developed a national action plan to support implementation of this important resolution. The action plan links humanitarian, conflict, defence and diplomacy work, all-important to conflict resolution and peace building. Recent examples of activity under the action plan include:</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/7" class="indent">Providing training to all desk officers in the UK Mission in New York to familiarise them with the provisions of UNSCR 1325 and to demonstrate concrete ways in which UNSCR 1325 can be incorporated into resolutions, reporting and peacekeeping mandates;</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/8" class="indent">a seminar at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for UK based staff aimed at raising their awareness of UNSCR 1325 and explain what the UK is doing to support its implementation and what can be done further;</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/9" class="indent">the Ministry of Defence is currently carrying out an audit of its Peace Support Operations training to ensure that it deals adequately with the areas covered by UNSCR 1325; and</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/10" class="indent">the Department for International Development has recently participated in a workshop organised by the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery in support of UNDP's efforts to mainstream gender throughout their activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/11">The UK is also working closely with the non-governmental organisation Working Group on Women, Peace and Security in New York to support their &quot;October Advocacy Programme&quot; which will coincide with the sixth anniversary celebrations of UNSCR 1325. We are co-hosting a side event with the group and the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women on the development of National Action Plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.2/12">The Global and Africa Conflict Prevention Pools and Global Opportunities Fund continue to provide the key UK funding mechanism for supporting women and conflict projects around the globe through its many strategies. For example, the Government have co-funded, through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, a conference on peace and security: Implementing UNSCR 1325. The conference was held at Wilton Park between <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-30">30 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June 2006</phrase> and provided a forum for discussion on implementation of UNSCR 1325, drawing together policy makers and practitioners in order to find constructive ways forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.3/1">The market was informed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-05">5 September 2006</phrase> that Ministers had decided to implement a staged reduction of up to 15 per cent. to the April 2006 drug tariff reimbursement prices for some blood glucose detection strips.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, reimbursement prices for all affected products were reduced by 12 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/3">The decision in regard to the staged approach is a direct consequence of the consultation process and demonstrates clearly that the Department had regard to the responses received and was willing to adjust its proposals accordingly. The final decision aims to recognise the existing services that are provided by suppliers to the benefit of patient care, while at the same time moving to secure better value for money for the national health service overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/4">In arriving at the 15 per cent., three sources of information were used: secondary care purchase data, additional secondary care tender data, and information concerning the industry's cost and revenue structures.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/5">In addition, it was in fact clear from both consultation papers on the arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents to primary care in October 2005 and May 2006:</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/6" class="indent">that the 15 per cent. figure was an average derived from a comparison between prices in the primary and secondary care markets;</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/7" class="indent">that the rationale underlying the comparison was that prices in primary care should more closely reflect the market-tested prices available in secondary care; and</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/8" class="indent">that the price differential between the markets went as high as 35 per cent. and that the reduction proposed was therefore reasonable in the context of the overall range of pricing that the data suggested was reflective of the more competitive environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.3/9">The data underlying these calculations was given to the Department in confidence, and related to commercially confidential transactions within the NHS. In a market for items manufactured by only seven companies, four of whom collectively account for 97 per cent. of sales, it would not be feasible to publish data in any meaningful form without&mdash;whether on its face value or by obvious implication that would be evident to companies in that market&mdash;revealing to each manufacturer something about its competitors' pricing.</p>

	<p pid="b.682W.5/1">We have no plans to undertake research to evaluate the proportion of net disposable income taken by hospital parking fees for patients on income support. However, those patients who are on income support are eligible for the hospital travel costs scheme which allows them to claim reasonable travel expenses when travelling to hospital. This can include the full reimbursement for car parking fees and petrol expenses where this is the cheapest form of travel which is available to them. The Department does not collect any data centrally on the hospital travel costs scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.5/2">The income from car parking from patients and staff for each national health service trust in 2005-06 has been placed in the Library. These data are as provided by NHS organisations, without amendment, on a voluntary basis and therefore will not be complete. The figures provided represent the income received and not the profit from the provision of car parking as maintenance and running costs such as lighting and security will need to be paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.682W.5/3">It is for NHS trusts to decide what level of car parking to provide and what charges to apply at their sites. In doing so they should take account of guidance from the Department which advises them to consider a range of factors, including offering concessions to certain groups, when implementing car parking charges.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.5/1">Data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally. The national health service cancer plan set out maximum waiting time targets for cancer treatment which may include radiotherapy where this is given as a first definitive treatment. Since December 2005 there has been a maximum two month (62 day) wait from urgent referral by a GP to start of treatment, and a maximum one-month (31 day) wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers. Over 99 per cent., of patients currently receive their first treatment within 31 days of diagnosis, and 94.5 per cent., of patients receive their first treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.5/2">To tackle radiotherapy waiting times we are increasing the numbers of therapy radiographers in post and in training, making better use of existing staff, making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy equipment, and streamlining the patient journey. Prof. Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, is also currently working with Royal Colleges, professional bodies, cancer networks and trusts through the national radiotherapy advisory group (NRAG) who are looking into radiotherapy provision and will be reporting in the autumn on recommendations for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.12/1">The Government have a comprehensive strategy to reduce the demand for illegal drugs and their supply, from whatever source. The National Drug Strategy is a cross-Government programme of policies and interventions that concentrate on the most dangerous drugs, particularly heroin and cocaine, the most damaged communities and problematic drug users. The strategy comprises four strands of work:</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.12/2" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming drug misusers;</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.12/3" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.12/4" class="indent">increasing the number of individuals accessing effective drug treatment; and</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.12/5" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.12/6">The Drug Strategy is delivering tangible improvements in communities across the country. Increasing quantities of drugs are being seized and organised crime groups and dealers disrupted. Record numbers are entering and staying in treatment: the numbers in contact with treatment services. Drug-related crime is falling. Class A drug use remains stable among young people aged 16-24, while the use of any illicit drug has fallen by 21 per cent. compared to 1998.</p>

Milton Keynes' Basic Command Unit has taken part in Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns since the summer of 2004. These campaigns target irresponsible retailers who sell alcohol to drunks and children, as well as individuals who drink irresponsibly and cause alcohol-related crime and disorder. The tactics used in these campaigns include intelligence-led targeting of premises in joint police and Trading Standards 'test-purchasing operations,' as well as early intervention to deal with low level crime and disorder, by robust use of penalty notice for disorder fines. The Government continues to encourage all Basic Command Units to incorporate the tactics used in these campaigns as part of their core business.</p>

It refers to their dilapidation, frailty and severe structural problems prior to the reconstruction completed in 1991. They are statutorily listed at grade II* and grade II. Use as offices would require planning permission for change of use and listed building consent for alterations which, I understand, is unlikely to be granted.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.0/1">Parliamentary Works Services (PWSD) have investigated these claims. The initial investigation centred on the specification used during the tendering process for the Press Gallery refurbishment project and in particular the plywood used on protection and temporary works.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.0/2">Is a clear and established policy on the parliamentary estate that all wood used during refurbishment or construction work must come from a sustainable source. This rule applies equally to permanent use such as panelling, furniture and temporary usage as protective sheeting and temporary buildings. It was confirmed that the standard specification regarding sustainability was used in this contract. The key wording from this specification is &quot;it is the employer's policy to purchase only timber and timber products from sustainable managed sources&quot;. Further investigation also confirmed that the more detailed architects specification was also very specific in specifying that</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.0/3" class="indent">&quot;timber based products are sourced from sustainable managed forests controlled by a National Forest Certification Scheme assessed and recognised by the Pan European Forest Certification Council&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.0/5">Following further investigation it was established that the contractors original order for timber for the project included the words &quot;in accordance with the specification&quot;. However, further call off requests based on the original order contained no such wording. It is from these orders that the supplier delivered un-certified plywood to the Press Gallery project. The delivery of the un-certified plywood was the result of human error rather than a lack of a suitable specification.</p>

	<p pid="b.700W.2/1">The Government of Afghanistan's National Drugs Control Strategy makes clear that in dealing with the drugs issue in Afghanistan, effective sequencing between the various strands of activity is paramount. Alternative livelihoods work alone will not affect opium yields. On the other strands, for example, law enforcement is also needed. As we know from experience elsewhere, sustainable drug elimination takes a considerable time. This is particularly the case in Afghanistan where the challenges are very significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.2/2">The approach set out in the Government of Afghanistan's Strategy represents the best means of tackling the problem.

To affect opium yields progress needs to be made on all. There is no simple answer to how long the Afghan counter-narcotics battle will take, although President Karzai said at the London Conference in January 2006 that it would need at least 10 years of consistent effort.</p>

	<p pid="b.700W.5/1">The Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control Strategy makes clear that in dealing with the drugs issue in Afghanistan, effective sequencing between the various strands of activity within the strategy is paramount. It recognises that eradication is an important component of the counter narcotics effort, as it raises risk in the eyes of those involved. However, the strategy says that eradication should only be applied where there is access to legal economic alternatives. Without this sequencing, eradication runs the risk of further impoverishing those involved, and to leave them with little choice but to replant poppy again the next planting season.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.5/2">So in an effectively counter narcotics plan, the uptake of alternative livelihoods is more likely, as the risk of eradication is seen to be greater. To what extent this has been a factor to date in Afghanistan is very hard to tell, given our limited understanding of the choices which farmers make. But we do know from Afghanistan and elsewhere, that eradication does increase perceived risk, and thus is a significant factor in a farmer's decision whether to plant poppy or not.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/2"><i> (a)</i> The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which gathers data from a wide range of agencies working as part of the humanitarian response as well as through their own field offices, estimate the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to be 1.44 million. It is extremely difficult to provide accurate figures as the country is so large, many IDPs are not living in camps and the situation is very unstable. People are returning home in increasing numbers but significant new displacements are occurring every month.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/3">Since 2001, DFID has provided the following humanitarian assistance to DRC through the bilateral programme: &pound;5 million (2001-02); &pound;12 million (2002-03); &pound;13 million (2003-04); &pound;22 million (2004-05); &pound;29.5 million (2005-06). In 2006-07 we have already disbursed &pound;17.6 million, making a total of &pound;99.1 million so far over the period in question and expect to spend at least another &pound;20 million this financial year. A large part of this funding has been provided to assist IDPs in areas such as health, water and sanitation, emergency shelter, food aid and nutrition, working through United Nations Agencies, international NGOs and the International Committee of the Red Cross. From this year, the bulk of our humanitarian resources are being channelled through the joint donor DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/4">In 2004, DFID supported the establishment of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), managed jointly by OCHA and UNICEF. This is designed to undertake needs assessments and provide assistance to newly displaced people before other resources become available. In the first six months of 2006, 500,000 people were helped through the RRM. This is a particularly effective mechanism in the unstable DRC context.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/5"><i> (b)</i> The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that the number of people internally displaced in Uganda is 1.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/6">DFID has provided humanitarian assistance to displaced people in Uganda for programmes in health, water and sanitation, protection, food aid, and to purchase and supply non-food relief items. Our assistance has been channelled through a number of United Nations agencies, the Red Cross, Save the Children Fund and Oxfam. Since 2001 our support has totalled &pound;49.9 million broken down by financial year as follows: &pound;127,000 (2001-02); &pound;2.5 million (2002-03); &pound;6.8 million (2003-04); &pound;10.9 million (2004-05); &pound;19.9 million (2005-06). In 2006-07 we have disbursed &pound;9 million so far and expect to spend at least a further &pound;7.5 million before the end of March 2007 through the agencies mentioned above.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/7"><i> (c)</i> According to Colombian government figures, the total number of IDPs in Colombia is 2.5-3.0 million. Non government organisations put the figure at around 3.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/8">DFID provides assistance to displaced people in Colombia through its 18 per cent. contribution to the European Commission's development assistance programme. The EC's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) committed &euro;10 million in 2001, &euro;9.2 million in 2002, &euro;8.6 million in 2003, &euro;8 million in 2004 and &euro;12 million in 2005 to support internally displaced people and people affected by internal conflict in Colombia. A further &euro;12 million has been allocated for 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.704W.2/1">To a large extent DFID relies on the UN organisations, including the World Food Programme (WFP), working in Chechnya to provide information on the humanitarian situation in Chechnya. This information indicates a continuing need to provide food to the most vulnerable people in Chechnya, and we will continue to push WFP and other UN Agencies and NGOs involved for better targeting of that food for particularly vulnerable groups. We will also continue efforts to shift towards more sustainable assistance that will focus on recovery and reduce dependency on food distributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.704W.2/2">Following a WFP announcement in July 2006 about their funding situation, the European Commission's Humanitarian Office provided an additional &euro;3 million to WFP for 2006-07. This, together with a US cash contribution, will allow WFP to continue operations in Chechnya in 2006 through to the end of May 2007. DFID provided &pound;200,000 through the WFP to support continued food distribution during 2006.</p>

Furthermore, between 1996 and 2003, the number of UK households in fuel poverty fell from 5 million to around 1.5 million but rising fuel prices mean that fuel poverty remains a challenge. This is why the recently concluded review of UK Energy Policy recognised that delivering secure, clean energy at affordable prices is one of the major challenges we face and set out a number of actions to meet this challenge.</p>

This amount includes academic research supported by the Research Councils, supported industry-led R and D, the Carbon Trust's R and D programme and others but it is not possible to identify exactly how much of this was spent in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and its agencies have committed further direct funding of almost &pound;100 million to energy efficiency and renewable projects in the last three years. This assistance does not take into account the impact of &quot;market pull&quot; instruments such as the Emissions Trading Scheme and the Renewables Obligation that provide further incentives to bring renewable generation into production.</p>

A certain number of batch processes have to be run to update the data on the register and the time between midnight and 7 am is required to enable this to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.5/3">Later this year the mainframe will be replaced with a modern distributed processing system. This will remove the requirement for batch processing which should, in principle, allow the opening hours to be extended during the week. Decisions on extending the opening hours have however not yet been taken. Like any investment decision, the costs (including the costs of providing customer support for a 24-hour service) have to be weighed up against the benefits. Specifically, the level of customer demand would need to be considered. Companies House use a variety of methods to track the views of their customers, including surveys, focus groups and market research. These have suggested so far that there is relatively little demand from their customers to use their services in the early hours of the morning during the week. In contrast, they have received feedback from customers who have asked for their services to be available for at least some of the time on Sunday. At present this is not possible because of the significant amounts of time used on Sundays to install and test improvements to products and services.

	<p pid="b.715W.6/5">The framework identifies five key drivers of productivity&mdash;enterprise, competition, innovation, investment and skills&mdash;and there is a wide spectrum of policies that work through and across these.

	<p pid="b.719W.7/1">The Government have no plans to introduce legislation specifically aimed at changing the regulatory regime for the Alternative Investment Market. However, there are two main plans for legislation which will change the overall regulatory regime affecting recognised investment exchanges which will have an impact on the regulatory regime for the Alternative Investment Market.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.7/2">First, as I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-13">13 September</phrase>, the Government plan to legislate to give the FSA a power of veto over regulatory requirements imposed by recognised investment exchanges where these are disproportionate. This will include regulatory requirements imposed in relation to the Alternative Investment Market.</p>
	<p pid="b.719W.7/3">Second, the Government are required to make legislative changes to implement the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID&mdash;Directive 2004/39/2004) by <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2007</phrase>. MiFID implementation will change the obligations on recognised investment exchanges in respect of the markets they run. Under the directive, it is likely that the Alternative Investment Market will be classified as a multilateral trading facility (MTF). The main obligations that an investment exchange running an MTF will have to comply with under MiFID are to be found in articles 14, 26, 29 and 30 of the directive. These are similar to existing UK regulatory obligations and will not fundamentally change the regulatory regime for the Alternative Investment Market.</p>

	<p pid="b.722W.3/1">A comprehensive strategy to halve child poverty by 2010-11, on the way to eradication by 2020, was set out in the Child Poverty Review, published in July 2004. This strategy has helped lift 700,000 children out of poverty between 1998-99 and 2004-05. Research by the Institute of Fiscal Studies<sup>(1)</sup> estimates that nearly 400,000 were in families in which at least one parent was in work.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.3/2">The Government will continue to pursue the strategy set out in the Child Poverty Review, including continuing to ensure that work pays for families on low incomes. This month, following the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, the adult rate of the National Minimum Wage has increased from &pound;5.05 to &pound;5.35. The working tax credit (WTC) provides financial support in additional to earnings for households with low incomes. By April 2006, over 2.2 million working families were benefiting from WTC.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.3/3">Child tax credit (CTC) and child benefit also support families both in and out of work, smoothing the transition to employment. In Budget 2006 the Chancellor announced that the child element of CTC would continue to be uprated at least in line with earnings until the end of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.0/1">There are different penalties for the late filing of different types of returns; for example&mdash; income tax, company tax and VAT returns. Of these major heads of tax, the late filing penalties for company tax returns were the most recently introduced in Finance Act 1998. Those penalties are &pound;100 if the return is delivered up to three months late and &pound;200 in other cases. These amounts are increased to &pound;500 and &pound;1,000 respectively for a third successive failure to file on time. These penalties have not been updated in line with the retail price index since their introduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.0/1">I and my Department have made no direct estimates on the decommissioning of Wylfa. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the decommissioning and clean-up of the UK's historic civil nuclear legacy on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The legacy includes the Magnox nuclear power station at Wylfa, Anglesey.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/2">The lifetime costs for Wylfa are estimated to be in the region of &pound;1.7 billion, with about 1.2 billion spent subsequent to the end of operations. The NDA's current plan for decommissioning Wylfa (as set out in its approved Strategy) is that it will operate until 2010; between 2010 and 2012 the fuel will be removed. That will be followed by a period of preparation for care and maintenance, which will include all of the facilities outside the reactor core being decommissioned; this is planned to be completed by 2025. The core and its contents will be finally cleared by 2125. Further details of all NDA activities, such as the Strategy and plans for Wylfa and decommissioning costs, can be found on the NDA website at: <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk">www.nda.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/3">The detail of Wylfa's plans for decommissioning and clean-up are still in preparation, and job requirements have not yet been finalised. The NDA is therefore only able to provide indicative numbers. The current plan estimates that job numbers (staff and subcontract) will be about 700 in 2010, reducing progressively to 160 in 2024 through the defuelling and decommissioning phase for care and maintenance preparations.</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.5/1">Any shortfall between the local housing allowance and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels and the accommodation choices made by tenants. The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out cannot be predicted precisely and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets and different sizes of property. However, we estimate that the majority of new claimants at rollout will gain under the proposed national local housing allowance compared to what they would have been entitled to under the current housing benefit rules. Additionally, as the rates will be set at the median market rent and published, claimants will have access to 50 per cent. of the rental market and will know their maximum entitlement in advance reducing the risk of unexpected shortfalls.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking whether specialist counselling support is available at job centres to assist incapacity benefit claimants back into work. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/4" class="indent">Specialist Personal Advisers, who have received specific training in supporting and advising customers with health conditions and disabilities are available in all Jobcentres to help incapacity benefits' customers back to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/5" class="indent">Within the Pathways to Work pilots, incapacity benefits' customers have access to specialist Condition Management Programmes. Customers referred to these programmes are assessed by clinicians who will draw up a health action plan outlining the most appropriate programme for that particular customer.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.2/6" class="indent">In those areas where Pathways to Work does not operate, Jobcentre Plus advisers are also able to access a wide range of support available from partner organisations; for instance, in the voluntary and community sectors that specialise in supporting individuals with health issues and multiple barriers to work. Some of these organisations will be able to offer counselling to customers who wish to take advantage of such services.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.8/2">Ensuring that opportunities are available for disabled people in the workplace is fundamental to our welfare reforms. Since 1997, we have set about implementing the most profound extension of disability rights this country has ever seen. In 2004, we extended the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to provide protection against discrimination for an additional 600,000 disabled workers, including those with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.8/3">Engaging and supporting employers in retaining employees is also a key element to the Government's Health, Work and Well-Being Strategy. We are putting together a cohesive and wide-ranging strategic action plan, developed in consultation with employers and led by employer organisations that are committed to increasing job opportunities for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.8/4">We are currently evaluating the Institute for Fiscal Studies' early findings on the impact Pathways is having on claimants with mental health conditions. However, we continue to work closely with health professionals to improve our provision, such as the current review of the personal capability assessment, and to monitor the effect of Pathways to Work on specific groups, including people with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.8/5">As part of our Pathways to Work approach we have introduced new condition management programmes, delivered in partnership with the NHS. They offer a range of programmes to help people manage their condition and focus on their work options. Enhanced in-work support is also available in Pathways to Work areas to help people establish themselves in the crucial early period of a return to work. They allow former incapacity benefits claimants, and their employers, voluntary access to advice or specialist services including mentoring, job coaching or occupational health support.</p>
