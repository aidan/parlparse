	<p pid="b.1517W.3/1">I took account of a number of factors in agreeing to an increase in the approved cost estimate for this scheme. In particular, I noted that important causes of the cost increase were, firstly, the decision, arising from the North West's advice on priorities for major transport schemes, to slip the proposed start date of this scheme to 2012-13; secondly, the use of more realistic forecasts of construction inflation up to the scheme's new start date; and thirdly, the inclusion of additional works to restrain the amount of traffic passing through the Peak District National Park following the construction of the scheme. I also took account of all the impacts, including the benefits that the scheme will provide. These include relieving the communities of Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwistle of high volumes of through traffic and providing improved journey times for travellers. In the light of the overall balance of costs and benefits I decided that it was appropriate to agree the increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517W.3/2">I took this decision on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January 2007</phrase>. However, I recognise that at the higher cost estimate this scheme represents an additional pressure on the funding allocation for major schemes in the North West region. Officials will be discussing this with the North West region shortly and I will take account of any views that they may wish to offer on the provision of funding and timing of delivery of this scheme in the light of the higher cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1517W.6/1">Brims and Company Ltd. were contractors working on the A69 Greenhead diversion scheme. The company went into receivership in 1990. Receivers were appointed and an arbitration was brought against the Secretary of State. A settlement figure was agreed and ratified by the arbitrator in November 2002. This was a full and final settlement and explicitly included the payment of interest and costs. The agreed settlement figure was paid to Brims and Company Ltd. shortly thereafter. The settlement was enshrined in a consent award which attracts the confidentiality which is implicit in the arbitration process. The confidence is owed to the administrative receiver of Brims and Company Ltd.</p>

	<p pid="b.1518W.8/4" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the number of bus stations in England. We do not define bus stations in our data as there is no clear definition as to what a bus station is i.e. at what point are bus stops clustered close enough in order to call it a bus station. Therefore, we only recognise individual bus stops. The number of bus stops available relates to Great Britain only, as it is extremely hard to count bus stops for individual countries. There are currently 361,745 active bus/coach stops in Great Britain as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.1528W.2/1">DFID supports the World Health Organisation (WHO), through its core funding, in its efforts to help African countries strengthen their pharmaceutical legislation, good manufacturing practices, national drug regulatory capacity and performance. The WHO also promotes information exchange among drug regulatory authorities to help combat drug counterfeiters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.2/2">The UK Government are working closely with developed and developing country governments, international institutions such as the World Health Organisation, non government organisations and the private sector to develop the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA) to build support for transparency in medicines procurement and supply to help to drive out counterfeiting as well as corruption, excessive mark-ups and inefficiencies. We expect to launch MeTA in a number of pilot countries in mid 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1528W.5/1">DFID fully supports the aims of the African Union Maputo plan of action on maternal health which is consistent with the DFID strategy 'Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action'. DFID will continue to work with and encourage partner governments to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services and commodities through DFID funded country programmes, and through regional and global advocacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1528W.5/2">At regional level, DFID works closely with the African Union Commission and other regional partners responsible for the Maputo plan and will continue to do so.</p>

In Nigeria, DFID has a &pound;55 million programme of support for health system strengthening with a focus on maternal health. The programme works closely with state and federal health ministries and in Ekiti state this support has resulted in a 100 per cent. increase in the number of women who are cared for by a health professional during childbirth. In Burundi, DFID is supporting the Ministry of Health to implement a free health care policy for pregnant women and children under five. In Sierra Leone DFID is developing a 10-year &pound;50 million programme with the Ministries of Health and Finance specifically to improve sexual, reproductive and child health. In Zimbabwe DFID will invest &pound;25 million pounds over five years to improve maternal and newborn health. The project will reduce the number of maternal deaths and reduce the number of children becoming infected or dying from HIV infection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1529W.2/1">As set out in DFID's strategy 'Reducing maternal deaths: evidence and action', DFID continues to work with partner governments to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services and commodities through DFID funded country programmes, and through regional and global advocacy. Increasingly DFID supports nationally led programmes for essential health services through budget support, as well as specific programmes for improving maternal and child health. For example, in Malawi and Uganda DFID works with national partners to strengthen health services, particularly human resources for health, and is pressing for the expansion of evidence-based sexual and reproductive services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1529W.2/2">While reducing maternal mortality remains a major challenge, progress is being made. In Nigeria, DFID has a &pound;55 million programme of support for health system strengthening with a focus on maternal health. The programme works closely with state and federal health ministries. In Ekiti state this support has resulted in a 100 per cent. increase in the number of women who are cared for by a health professional during childbirth. In Kenya a regional safe motherhood programme supported overall health system strengthening and was used to argue for more support to maternal and child health within essential health services programme. In Burundi, DFID is supporting the Ministry of Health to implement a free health care policy for pregnant women and children under five. In Sierra Leone, DFID is developing a 10 year, &pound;50 million programme with the Ministries of Health and Finance specifically to improve sexual, reproductive and child health. The programme will strengthen the health system as a whole and address human resources for health, supplies of commodities, policy planning and financing. It will also contribute towards reducing key social, cultural and economic barriers to accessing basic health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1532W.3/1">The UK has been concerned by the unrest and political instability in Guinea arising from the general strike earlier this year, and has supported the efforts of ECOWAS and regional leaders in helping mediate during the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.3/2">The situation has calmed with the lifting of martial law on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23 February</phrase>, the ending of the strike, and the appointment of Lansana Kouyate as Prime Minister. We hope that he will soon appoint a new, broadly-based and consensus government which will work to move Guinea forward. But the recent crisis has brought the already devastated economy to a near standstill. It has severely affected the provision of health and other public services and the population's access to them. Food supplies have been disrupted, with the price of staples such as rice, flour, sugar and vegetables, as well as fuel, increasing sharply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.3/3">DFID is monitoring the humanitarian situation, and is in contact with international partners and agencies based in Guinea. In response to the crisis and the increased humanitarian risks, we have agreed to provide &pound;350,000 through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to be focused on meeting urgent medical and nutritional needs, and to maintain preparedness in case of further civil unrest with humanitarian consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1532W.3/4">DFID has also recently agreed to provide &pound;270,000 to the World Food programme humanitarian air service for West Africa, which facilitates the movement of humanitarian personnel and urgently needed non-food items between Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The air service recently demonstrated its importance during the civil unrest in Guinea, allowing agencies to respond and facilitate security evacuations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1533W.5/1">The new fixed-dose combination drug artesunate and amodiaquine (ASAQ) was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March 2007</phrase> and it is too early to assess the rollout. Although countries can buy the drug now, most will wait until it passes through the World Health Organisation (WHO) pre-qualification process. After this the drug can be procured through international drug purchasing facilities, such as the global fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533W.5/2">The drugs for neglected diseases initiative (DNDi) will monitor all aspects of the rollout to ensure that the drug is taken up by countries and delivered to patients. ASAQ has been produced in partnership with the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis who have extensive distribution networks in Africa. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO for the treatment of malaria, and ASAQ is an ACT recommended first line treatment in 20 African countries. Because of this and the fact that ASAQ is easier to use and less expensive than existing ACT drugs, DNDi expects quick take up by countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533W.5/3">ASAQ can only be used where there is no pre-existing resistance to amodiaquine, so it is most relevant for use in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the 20 countries where it is already recommended for first line treatment. It is less likely to be used in Asia (although it may be used in parts of India and Indonesia) and Latin America.</p>

	<p pid="b.1534W.5/12">Not all of these projects were suspended as a result of the Hamas-led Government's failure to meet the quartet principles. For example, the Gaza airport project was very unlikely to move forward during 2006, regardless of Palestinian political developments. The EC re-designed some projects in order to achieve the same results without channelling funds through the PA. Funds for other projects remain available for when the EC restarts business with the PA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1534W.5/13">The EC re-designed its 2006 programme in order to deliver support to the Palestinian people without channelling funding through the Hamas-led Government. This did not result in significant amounts of funding being blocked or suspended. In fact, the EC spent &euro;348 million in 2006, compared to &euro;277 million in 2005. This included support to: the temporary international mechanism; the Office of the Palestinian president; local and international non-governmental organisations; projects implemented by international organisations (such as the World Bank, and UNESCO); and humanitarian assistance delivered by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).</p>

	<p pid="b.1535W.2/1">Following the election of the Hamas-led Government, the European Union (EU) has suspended a number of technical assistance projects. A breakdown of specific projects from all member states is not available. Ten European Commission (EC) projects have been suspended, though some of these might have been suspended regardless of Palestinian political developments. The EC re-designed some projects in order to achieve the same results without channelling funds through the Palestinian authority (PA). No new budget support agreement was put into place (though budget support was not technically suspended). EU (EC and member states) humanitarian assistance commitments were &euro;165 million in 2006, more than double the 2005 figure. Overall, EU assistance increased by 27 per cent. in 2006 to &pound;442 million, including &pound;123 million for Palestinian basic needs through the temporary international mechanism. This compares to &pound;42 million which the EU gave in budget support to the PA in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1535W.2/2">DFID has re-oriented its technical assistance to comply with the quartet statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>. The only UK-led project that has been suspended is a planned project covering hydrometric monitoring to the Palestinian water authority (PWA) worth &pound;431,000. No new budget support agreement was put into place. In 2005-06 (prior to the election of Hamas) DFID provided &pound;10 million in budget support to the PA. DFID humanitarian assistance has remained unaffected. The UK maintained the same level of support (&pound;30 million) in 2006-07 as in 2005-06, and will increase this slightly to &pound;30.6 million for 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1536W.5/3">Trainee teachers receive training in tackling bullying and there is a wide range of courses available for qualified teachers. We supplement this training with guidance and advice designed to address the specific needs which school staff have in this area, for example, with regards to tackling prejudice-driven bullying. We are also currently revising our over-arching guidance to schools 'Don't Suffer in Silence' to ensure that schools have practical advice on how successfully to address and prevent bullying when it occurs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1536W.8/2"><i> </i>While there is not a specific legal requirement for school anti-bullying policies to cover<i> </i>activities that take place outside of regular school hours, there is a duty on schools to<i> </i>tackle all forms of bullying and so we would expect school policies to be couched in<i> </i>sufficiently broad terms that bullying on school premises outside school hours would be<i> </i>covered. The guidance to accompany the school discipline provisions in the Education<i> </i>and Inspections Act 2006, 'School Discipline and Pupil Behaviour Policies', will make<i> </i>clear that the Government believe extended school activities, sports events and<i> </i>breakfast/after-school clubs should be covered by the school behaviour policy and that<i> </i>schools should apply disciplinary penalties for poor behaviour (including bullying) that<i> </i>occurs at such activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1536W.8/3">Work has also been undertaken at local level to deal specifically with bullying in extended schools. In some schools, work funded by Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) has helped to identify children and young people at risk of being bullied, or of bullying others, and provides positive diversionary activities out of school hours and during school holidays. There is also evidence to suggest that the provision of extended services by schools may, in itself, help to counter bullying. In particular, we know that on-site provision of family and community services can have a positive impact on pupil behaviour and attendance generally. Part of the Behaviour Improvement Programme included the development of 'full service' extended schools, and the 'core offer' of extended services which we want all schools to provide by 2010 includes services of direct relevance to issues around bullying such as parenting support and easy access to a wide range of specialist support services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1552W.2/2">I wrote to the Lord Filkin, Chairman of the Merits Committee, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase> to clarify, among other matters, the remit of the Casino Advisory Panel with regard to social impact. In my letter I said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;One of the most fundamental arguments made by the Committee, and one which runs throughout the report, is that the Casino Advisory Panel should have placed greater emphasis on the minimisation of harm from gambling. I should explain that this was not the primary consideration we set for the Panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/4" class="indent">The criteria against which the Panel would assess submissions were set out in the Government's national policy statement on casinos, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>, which makes reference to the protection of children and vulnerable people. In paragraph 10 of its report, the Panel noted that the Department had asked it to have due regard to the national policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/5" class="indent">The Panel's primary consideration was to ensure that the locations provide the best possible test of social impact. Subject to this, the criteria were also:</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/6" class="indent">to include areas in need of regeneration (as measured by employment and other social deprivation data)</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/7" class="indent">to ensure that those areas selected are willing to licence a new casino.</p>
	<p pid="b.1552W.2/8" class="indent">I did not ask the Panel to make final recommendations based exclusively on the minimisation of harm from gambling. This is because it is the role of the Gambling Commission to monitor and minimise any harm that might arise from new casino gambling. It was the job of the Casino Advisory Panel to select locations that are best able to be monitored rigorously. I am satisfied that is exactly what they have done.&quot;</p>

PRIME is a 20 year PFI partnership deal, competitively let to Trillium (now Land Securities Trillium) on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>. The deal involved the transfer of ownership and management of the majority of the then Department of Social Security premises to the private sector. Following the creation of the Department for Work and Pensions, PRIME was expanded in 2003 to cover ex-Employment Service estate.

	<p pid="b.1559W.5/1">The 16 hour rule, defined in regulations, affects entitlement to housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance (JSA). People may study for up to 16 hours a week and still be entitled to those benefits, but their benefit entitlement ends if they exceed 16 hours. Financial support for full-time students (with some exceptions) is the responsibility of the education and not the benefits system. The 16 hour rule exists to support that principle and, in the case of JSA, to ensure that people concentrate on looking for a job.</p>
	<p pid="b.1559W.5/2">Members of the Foyer Federation continue to lobby for changes to the housing benefit rules to allow young people at risk of homelessness to receive housing benefit while in full-time study. We accept that some young people in these circumstances may need a second chance at learning and are considering how we might be able to help. We also continue to receive approaches to waive the JSA 16 hour rule in specific circumstances. Our response is to clarify the rule's purpose and effect and that the Employment and Training Act 1973 allows us to target unemployed people who face particular labour market disadvantage, by removing them from JSA and the requirement to actively seek work, instead paying them training allowances to undertake full-time training. We are using these arrangements in the 'Adult Learning Option' pilots which are supporting our customers towards achieving a Level 2 qualification. The budget that supports training allowances is finite and this route to full-time learning has to be carefully targeted on those most in need.</p>

This means that with the available limited blood test having to be repeated three times at intervals on individual animals, it is impractical and verging on the impossible to confidently separate healthy badgers from bTB-infected badgers. Even if a more accurate and rapid test were available, tackling bTB in this chronically infected wildlife reservoir by removing test-positive individuals is not considered a scientifically sound or practical policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1574W.3/3">We have also considered what use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of Mycobacterium bovis in the environment could be in this instance. While this is yet to be validated for use in the field, it is clear from the researchers that, at the most, it may be possible to use this to identify areas, such as setts, where Mycobacterium bovis is present. However, this would still mean we could not identify individuals that were infected or, at this stage, whether the bacteria detected were viable and infectious.</p>

	<p pid="b.1577W.0/1">Gyrodactylus salaris (Gs) is a parasite that has the potential to cause widespread losses in both wild and farmed Atlantic salmon. The disease Gyrodactylosis, caused by the parasite, is subject to the notification requirements and control arrangements of the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 (as amended).</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/2">The UK is free of Gs and we are doing all we can to ensure that remains the case. In March 2004, following intensive discussion in the EU, we succeeded in re-negotiating robust additional fish health guarantees to safeguard against the introduction of Gs through trade in live fish (Commission Decision 2004/453). The guarantees, in effect, allow movement of live fish of susceptible species only from areas that are considered free of the parasite.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/3">The revised additional guarantees were agreed only after they had been scrutinised by leading UK fish health scientists and assessed by them as posing a negligible risk of introducing Gs into the UK. Subsequently, the EU Permanent Advisory Network for Disease in Aquaculture, made up of international fish health scientists, also considered the measures and came to the same conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/4">DEFRA has contingency plans in place which have been drafted in close consultation with the Environment Agency, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and other interested parties. In the event of identification of Gs in either farmed or wild freshwater fish stocks, the objective would be to contain and, if possible, eradicate the parasite. Officials are also in regular contact with their counterparts in other Departments and the devolved Administrations about contingency planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1577W.0/5">My Department has also carried out publicity campaigns to raise awareness among the general public (especially those involved in angling) about the dangers of introducing Gs and other diseases through travel to and from high-risk areas. A further campaign is being considered for the near future. Advice on how to keep Gs out of the country is contained in our &quot;Keep Fish Diseases Out&quot; series of guidance leaflets.</p>

I also sent copies of our recent publication 'Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility' to 57 countries, including Poland, encouraging them to join the effort to protect these species.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.0/3">DEFRA officials also ensure that Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts in the relevant capitals are briefed, and engage in discussion with their counterparts on whaling at every appropriate opportunity. This ensures that these countries are in no doubt of the importance that the UK attaches to whale conservation. This is particularly important as we approach the next IWC meeting, to be held in Anchorage, Alaska in May.</p>

	<p pid="b.1578W.6/1">I have regular discussions with European Union environment ministers on a range of issues, but none have been held specifically on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.6/2">However, the Government are taking action to both support the reduction of plastic packaging in the waste stream and encourage the recycling of plastics more generally. The Waste and Resources Action programme (WRAP) is also working to create stable markets for a range of recycled materials, including plastics. In 2003, WRAP commissioned Enviros Consulting Ltd to undertake a study of the markets, applications and growth opportunities for recycled plastics in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.6/3">For example, expanded polystyrene can readily be used for insulation in housing and other types of plastics can be recycled into lower grade plastics and used in construction or packaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.6/4">WRAP's targets for 2004-06 are to work with the plastics industry to increase the acceptance of recycled plastic throughout the supply chain, to deliver an additional 20,000 tonnes of domestic plastic bottle recycling capacity, and to ensure that an additional 11,000 tonnes of non-bottle plastics are recycled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.6/5">A common use of low density polyethylene is in the production of carrier bags. DEFRA is working closely with the devolved administrations, WRAP, the Scottish Waste Awareness Group and businesses to both promote reusable bags and reduce the number of plastic bags entering the waste stream.</p>
	<p pid="b.1578W.6/6">In addition, the packaging regulations set targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste to be met by obligated businesses each year to enable the UK to meet the targets in the EU Packaging Directive. This requires the UK to recycle 22.5 per cent. of the plastic packaging waste entering the UK waste stream by 2008. Currently, around 20 per cent. of plastic packaging waste is recycled in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1579W.5/1">DEFRA is one of five departments which fund regional development agencies (RDAs) through a single programme budget (the &quot;single pot&quot;).

	<p pid="b.1579W.5/15">The significant increase in the DEFRA contribution to the single pot from 2005-06 is the result of the transfer of additional funding from the Countryside Agency for rural socio-economic activities (&pound;21 million per annum), a commitment made in rural strategy 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1579W.5/16">How each RDA utilises its single pot allocation will vary according to regional need. Details of RDA priorities and planned spending can be found in individual RDA corporate plans, (approved by Government), with six-monthly reports on performance, setting out what has been achieved. These documents can be found on each RDA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1579W.5/17">Responsibility for the delivery of the socio-economic measures of the Rural Development Programme for England (and legacy of the earlier England Rural Development Programme) was passed to the RDAs on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. This implemented another of the commitments from the rural strategy 2004. The level of funding for the new programme has yet to be finalised but RDAs will have access to a minimum of &pound;40 million per annum over the period 2007-13.</p>
	<p pid="b.1579W.5/18">The move to devolve funding to the regions through RDAs is part of the Government's devolving decision-making agenda. RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to spend their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. However, DEFRA is confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the RDAs and having increased the resources it makes available to them, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people who need it most.</p>

	<p pid="b.1582W.3/4" class="indent">In your earlier question, Official Report Volume 458, column 406, to which you refer, you requested a time series of data from 1997. I pointed out that while the data was available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), it could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. I have therefore only provided data for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1582W.3/5" class="indent">The attached table gives a breakdown of the average hourly earnings of employees of working age, and the percentage pay gap between all male employees and employees who are either women with dependent children, people from ethnic minorities, workers with disabilities, and employees for each of the main qualification groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1582W.3/6" class="indent">Average hourly earnings shown are based on the statistical mean. The ONS also publishes information for both the mean and median hourly earnings in table 38 of the LFS Historical Quarterly Supplement, which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1582W.3/8" class="indent">The results shown are not comparable to those provided in the earlier reply as that information was provided from the Annual Survey of Hourly Earnings (ASHE). The estimates relate to the three months ending June 2006. These estimates have not been seasonally adjusted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1585W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.11/2">In January 2002, &quot;Estimating the Social Cost of Carbon Emission&quot; a Government Economic Service (GES) working paper, was published jointly by DEFRA and the Treasury. It suggested &pound;70 per tonne of Carbon (tC) (within a range of &pound;35 to &pound;140 per tC) as an illustrative estimate for the global damage cost of carbon emissions. This would rise by &pound;1 per tC per year in real terms to reflect the increasing marginal cost of emissions over time. The GES paper also recommended periodic reviews of the illustrative figures as new evidence became available. The UK was almost unique in issuing official guidance on the social cost of carbon (SCC). The scientific and socio-economic uncertainties behind these calculations are very significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.11/3">The Stern Review estimates the SCC for a scenario of unmitigated climate change averaging over time and over different possible outcomes, is $85 per tCO2 in year 2000, rising over time. The equivalent value in 2007 might be around &pound;264-269 per tC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.11/4">However, the Stern Review also notes that, if the world converges on a trajectory towards stabilisation at a level that reduces the risks and damages of climate change, the SCC will be lower, perhaps $25-30 per tCO2 in year 2000. Again, this would rise over time. The equivalent value in 2007 might be around &pound;90-95 per tC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.11/5">Economists from relevant government departments are currently developing revised guidance on the calculation and use of shadow prices of carbon in informing UK policy decisions in the light of the Stern Review work on the social cost of carbon as well as previous work by DEFRA in this area. The aim is to publish revised guidance by the summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1595W.3/1">The gross remuneration paid to providers of national health service dental services covers both the practice expenses incurred in providing services and the dentists' net income. For the financial year 2005-06, the average NHS income for general dental services dentists in England and Wales with a reasonable commitment to the NHS was estimated at &pound;76,500 in net terms, plus &pound;88,500 to cover practice expenses.

	<p pid="b.1595W.3/2">Average net earnings in the current year, 2006-07, will also be affected by any change in the relative level of practice expenses.

The local EU representatives have requested the Government of Cambodia ensure that a full enquiry into the circumstances of the death is conducted without delay and that appropriate action is taken to bring to justice those responsible.

This initiative is making information available to schools across the UK about the exciting opportunities available.

	<p pid="b.1605W.3/1">We remain deeply concerned about the continued use of the death penalty in Iran. After China, Iran executes more people than any other country in the world. Despite announcing a moratorium on juvenile executions in 2005, Iran still imposes the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18. Reports suggest that between five and eight juvenile executions took place in 2005, and at least two in 2006. This is a clear contravention of Iran's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are also concerned that basic standards surrounding the application of capital punishment are absent in Iran and that death sentences are often carried out in public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1605W.3/2">We make frequent representations to the Iranian authorities about the use of the death penalty, both bilaterally and through the EU. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December 2006</phrase> our ambassador in Tehran raised our concerns about death sentences handed down to 10 men, with the head of Iran's International Department of the Judiciary. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-21">21 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-04">4 March</phrase>, the EU presidency in Tehran raised our concerns about specific juvenile death penalty cases and reiterated the EU's longstanding objection to the death penalty in all circumstances. In the last two years, through the EU, we have raised the death penalty with the Iranian authorities at least 15 times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1605W.3/3">We also take action through the UN, and were pleased that all EU countries supported a resolution on human rights in Iran at the UN General Assembly in December 2006, which expressed serious concern at &quot;the continuing of public executions, including multiple public executions, and, on a large scale, other executions in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards&quot; and &quot;in particular, deplores the execution of persons who were under the age of 18 at the time their offence was committed&quot;.</p>

We do not accept that the mission report is not valid as the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members went. The report is based on the assessments of UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We will continue to press all members of the HRC, including those from the OIC, to take forward the recommendations in the report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1609W.11/3">We remain a strong supporter of promoting EU-US economic co-operation and integration in this sense and are keen to see further progress under the German presidency. Deepening economic co-operation between the EU and the US will not only bring the benefits of helping to remove remaining barriers to trade and investment but also serve as a positive step towards a more flexible and efficient global economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1610W.9/2">Current evidence suggests that while there has been some outsourcing of business functions abroad, this has had little significant impact on UK employment or growth. From 2001 to 2005 UK employment grew fastest in exactly the services, IT and call centres, that were regarded as most likely to be outsourced overseas, although a survey of the UK IT industry last year suggested there may be a small fall in its employment in the UK over the next few years. Therefore, while outsourcing of business functions abroad is generally expected to increase in the future, it is not clear that this will have a significant impact on UK employment or growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.1628W.0/1">Data concerning the average waiting time taken to complete a disclosure are not a performance target and are not collated by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). The CRB operates to a set of published service standards (PSS) which include to issue 93 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days. For January 2007, the CRB issued 99.2 per cent. of standard disclosures and 90.8 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within PSS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/2">Within these overarching performance standards, there are a number of targets that are the responsibility of the CRB that the Bureau has been meeting consistently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/3">There are a number of other factors that can affect the timely completion of checks by the CRB, including but not restricted to the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with the initial application, the accurate completion of the application form, the clarity of the information provided, the existence of conviction or non-conviction information and the operational effectiveness of the disclosure units of the police forces involved in the enhanced disclosure process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/4">In order to address these, the CRB has provided more support to all counter-signatories and customers in the form of detailed guidance notes which accompany the application forms to ensure that applications are completed accurately and are accompanied by all relevant supporting documentation. The CRB has also established a rigorous compliance and assurance function to ensure that registered bodies make the best use of the disclosure service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/5">There have been fluctuations in the performance of some of the police disclosure units, caused by a combination of factors including a significant increase in disclosure applications and a combination of local staffing and IT problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/6">However, the police and the CRB have been working closely together to identify ways of tackling these problems in forces, which have included additional resources for disclosure unit managers and a greater degree of monitoring performance and support. These initiatives have been strengthened by a new service level agreement in April 2006 between the CRB and all the 43 forces in England and Wales, which focuses on service delivery. These measures have led to a substantial improvement in the overall disclosure process in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.0/7">The CRB has issued approximately 285,000 applications each month in the last six months and as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-23">23 March 2007</phrase> 162,826 applications are in progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1632W.0/1">Estimates of the prevalence of drug use among the household population in England and Wales are provided by the British Crime Survey (BCS), which has included a comparable self-completion module on drug use since 1996.</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.0/2">The prevalence of self-reported drug use in the past year amongst those aged 16-59 in England and Wales from the BCS is shown in the following table. This shows that use of amphetamines and cannabis has declined significantly since 1998. Cocaine powder use has increased over the same period but most of this increase took place prior to 2000, since when use has remained generally stable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1632W.0/3">It should be noted that general population surveys such as the British Crime Survey provide poor coverage of more problematic users, who are more likely to use heroin and crack. These figures are therefore likely to be an underestimate of use of these drugs. A three year research programme is currently underway which will provide us with a better assessment of trends in the prevalence of problematic opiate and crack use in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1633W.0/1">The Lantern pilot is still in its early stages and the initial results and feedback received to date indicate that Lantern is delivering the expected business benefits and that officers are finding it easy to operate and a useful tool that they would not want to be withdrawn. Currently results are being returned to the device in less than two minutes with an accuracy rate of approximately 97 per cent. and a hit rate of 40 per cent. (i.e. 40 per cent. of people checked are recorded on IDENT1). This high hit rate reflects the environment in which the devices are being used&mdash;proactive, intelligence led policing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.0/2">A number of arrests have been made, particularly of disqualified drivers presenting false ID. Lantern has also been used to identify a vehicle occupant who presented a false identity but was wanted by three forces for fraud and ATM card skimming. In another case Lantern played a large part in apprehending a man described by police as 'the most wanted nominal' in the area. In many of these cases the individuals would not have been arrested without the identifications provided by Lantern.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.0/3">Results indicate that Lantern is showing time savings beyond expectations and hence allowing officers to spend more time on the streets and providing a visible deterrent. Establishing a person's identity at the roadside avoids the need to arrest a person and take them to a custody suite to do this&mdash;a process which typically takes about three hours. Early results show that in encounters where officers have reported a time saving using Lantern, the average time saved has been about 90 minutes. There have also been a number of cases where Lantern has provided early identification of deceased persons carrying no ID and hence saved a considerable amount of police and coroners time and also enabled next of kin to be informed sooner. Cases have included fatal road traffic collisions, sudden deaths and suicide victims on railway lines.</p>

The Respect taskforce also has a small research function to evaluate action taken.</p>
