	<p pid="a.5W.2/1">The rural land register (RLR) is our spatial database maintained by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and used to validate farm subsidy payments, primarily the single payment scheme (SPS) but also schemes under the Rural Development Programme for England.

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.5W.2/11">The costs were unusually high in 2009-10 owing to RPA undertaking a major exercise with the RLR where some 2.4 million land parcels were updated.

	<p pid="a.10W.8/1">The Animal By-products (ABP) Regulation which was recently reviewed and revised by the EU will maintain the ban on burial of fallen stock on farm in most circumstances. There is therefore no realistic possibility in the short term of the ban being lifted. However, there are a number of things we can do both in the short and longer term to ease the regulatory burden for farmers when disposing of their fallen stock. Firstly, the revised ABP legislation continues to recognise that fallen stock can be buried in remote areas and extends that principle to derogate from the rules requiring disposal by incineration or rendering in circumstances where accessing fallen stock for disposal is practically impossible or dangerous or when natural disasters make it disproportionate to require collection. When the revised rules come into effect next year, we will make guidance available to farmers on when such circumstances apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.8/2">Secondly, the revised legislation makes it more straightforward for on-farm containment systems such as bioreducers to be approved for use under EU rules and we will be pressing the Commission to bring forward the necessary proposals to make that happen as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.10W.8/3">In the longer term, as the BSE risks have declined markedly since the on farm burial ban was first introduced in 2003 and as scrapie is not known to pose a risk to human health, we will be pressing the Commission for a review by the European Food Safety Authority of the current scientific rationale for the ban, so that it can inform future changes to ABP legislation.</p>

The biggest factor in the size of an outbreak is the length of time between the disease entering the country and its detection (the so called silent spread period-typically three weeks). Properly observed standstills limit the number of movements livestock can make during this period and hence reduce the number of potentially infected premises. I have asked the Task Force on Food and Farming headed by Richard Macdonald to review the six-day rule and make recommendations as to whether it should be retained in its current form, modified or abolished.</p>

From April 2011 all funding for the scheme will be provided through Formula Grant which gives local authorities the freedom and flexibility they want in their use of funding. Formula Grant is allocated on the basis that the level provided overall is sufficient to enable local authorities to deliver effective local services, while ensuring that authorities do not set excessive council tax increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.8/2">The overall amount of Formula Grant funding available for local government was set out in the spending review. The funding available within Formula Grant for concessionary travel takes account of savings that local authorities will be able to make following the recent change to the age of eligibility for the scheme and through reforms to the administrative and reimbursement arrangements of the scheme. These reforms are not designed to impact on the provision of concessionary travel for eligible people.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.2/1">Cycling England was established in 2005 with a remit to &quot;Get More People Cycling, More Safely, More Often&quot;. Over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11, the Department for Transport (DfT) invested around &#163;140 million in programmes to deliver this objective. Cycling England's role was to advise on how best to spend these funds and to oversee the delivery of the projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.20W.2/2">Analysis of results of the first three years of funding, of which DfT contributed &#163;7.5 million, for the initial six Cycling Demonstration Towns has provided a Benefit Cost Ratio in the range 2.6 to 3.5, and a 27% increase, in cycle trips as shown by automatic cycle counters.</p>

	<p pid="a.39W.0/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID's) programmes support a combination of prevention activities-encouraging behaviour change, counselling and testing and addressing the societal and structural drivers of the epidemic-including issues of gender and gender based violence. There has been a 60% overall reduction in new infections in sub-Saharan Africa since 2002, and the latest national survey in Zambia shows falling incidence rates in young women. Data on other countries may be published around World Aids day. Despite these positive trends, there are still many new infections in women. We recognise the need for ongoing investment and to look for more effective prevention approaches.</p>

The review will include an assessment of the relevance of each organisation or fund to the UK's development objectives and their ability to deliver results on the ground. It will not look at staffing or secondments specifically, but it will make recommendations for how DFID should engage with the multilaterals in future to increase value for money.

	<p pid="a.46W.6/1">All heat pumps that are designed to provide domestic hot water should have the ability to raise the temperature of the water to 60 degrees centigrade. Some refrigerant cycles enable hot water to be produced by the heat pump only. Other refrigerant cycles provide lower temperature hot water. These systems periodically raise the temperature of the hot water tank for a pre-determined time to kill legionella bacteria; using a combination of the refrigerant cycle and direct electric heating or just direct electric heating. The efficiency of a heat pump decreases as the required water temperature increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.9/1">The Government are committed to maximising the economic opportunities that renewable and nuclear energy can bring to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/2" class="italic"> Offshore wind</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/3">The UK is the largest deployer of offshore wind and currently the largest market. The Carbon Trust estimates that up to 70,000 jobs could be created in offshore wind by 2020, made up of 50,000 direct jobs, and 20,000 secondary jobs (e.g. legal services, finance). They also estimate 220,000 jobs in offshore wind by 2050 - 135,000 direct and 85,000 secondary jobs. Following the Government's announcement that it will make up to &#163;60 million available to support the establishment of manufacturing infrastructure at port sites a number of major turbine manufacturers have indicated their intention to set up UK manufacturing facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/4" class="italic"> Wave and Tidal</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/5">The wave and tidal sector is currently at a pre commercial stage but we are committed to harnessing the benefits which a successful marine renewables sector can bring to the UK opportunities for the development of the supply chain was one of the topics covered in the 'Marine Energy Action Plan' published by DECC in March 2010 and will form one element of the Government's new UK Marine Energy Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/6">In addition, a number of studies have been carried out, for example the Carbon Trust's 'Focus For Success' report estimates that the wave sector alone could create around 16,000 direct jobs by 2040, with 25% supporting UK exports. We have also been working with industry representatives on modelling and mapping the marine energy supply chain. A good example of this is the Regen SW 'Marine Energy and Offshore Wind Company Directory' which maps the supply chain in the region and can be seen at.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.9/8" class="italic"> Biomass energy</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/9">A number of studies have been conducted to consider the economic potential in the bioenergy sector. For example, a 2007 study to quantify employment from biomass power plants showed that power only bioenergy systems typically create 1.27 man years of employment per GWh electricity produced. A recent study for the Forestry Commission in June 2010 found that the woodfuel sector alone could contribute &#163;1 billion to the UK economy by 2020 and support 15,300 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/10" class="italic"> Nuclear</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/11">The various private sector consortia that are gearing up for new build have stated intent to deliver up to 16 GWe by 2025 and UK companies have the potential to benefit from the majority of the work generated by this investment. Research by the Nuclear Industry Association reports that UK companies have the capability to supply 70% of the total requirements of new nuclear plant in the UK and that with some investment this could rise to 80%.</p>
	<p pid="a.46W.9/12">A report by the Cogent Sector Skills Council found that thousands of training opportunities, new apprenticeships and new jobs will be needed in the construction, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of anticipated stations for a programme of this scale and that up to 30,000 new jobs could be created. More jobs could be created as the result of larger programmes and the opportunity for companies involved in new nuclear build is not limited to the UK market with many more countries looking closely at introducing or expanding nuclear power programmes as a way of meeting rapidly increasing demands for energy while addressing the challenge of climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.49W.0/1">Citizens Advice Bureaux (CAB) are independent organisations and registered charities. Each Citizens Advice Bureau is a separate registered charity, operating independently, which may be funded by the local authority in which it is located.</p>
	<p pid="a.49W.0/2">Local authorities are democratically elected and independent from central Government. They are responsible for their own finances and for developing local solutions that meet the needs of the community.

Information on the amount of funding provided by authorities to CABs is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.49W.0/3">Citizens Advice (CitA) is the national umbrella organisation for the Citizens Advice Service in England and Wales.

It is for individual authorities to decide whether applicants have a local connection with their district. Authorities may have regard to non-statutory guidelines agreed by the local authority associations which suggest that, among other things, a working definition of &quot;normal residence&quot; should be residence for at least six months in the area during the previous 12 months or for not less than three years during the previous five-year period.

	<p pid="a.52W.8/1">The Department has not directly commissioned research on the potential cost savings which may arise from local authorities, police authorities and NHS organisations working together more closely, but has sought to encourage local public sector organisations and representative bodies to develop projects which could identify savings that could be achieved across agencies. These initiatives include:</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/2">The Department, along with HM Treasury and other departments, worked with a number of local authorities and their partners on 'Total Place' during 2009-10. These areas looked at new ways of working locally; redesigning services to meet local people's needs. A report was made of their findings and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.52W.8/6">The local government sector is evaluating the opportunities offered by such approaches. The Improvement and Development Agency has published reports on this subject in 2008 and 2009 at:</p>

Government are currently reviewing the data requirements placed on local authorities with the aim of reducing them and making them transparent. This will result in a single comprehensive list of all the data that local government is expected to provide to central Government, including that required by DCLG, from April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.5/2">However, as an example, research for the Total Place pilots found that across Leicestershire's councils, PCT, fire, police and probation services, there were 90 full-time staff, at an annual cost of &#163;3.7 million, having to collect and process data for central Government, reporting on more than 3,000 individual data items. They were also subjected to 83 different inspections every year, costing &#163;2.2 million in dedicated staff costs and a further &#163;1.4 million in other staff time (Deloitte/Leicestershire county council, &quot;Measuring the Workload: Public Sector Performance Reporting and Inspection Regimes in Leicestershire, October 2009&quot;).</p>

	<p pid="a.55W.5/2">The energy justification for why a proposed wind farm should be sited in a particular location involves considerations of technical and commercial feasibility (including meteorological and economic viability) which are for the developer concerned. In reaching their decision on a planning application for a wind farm, local planning authorities will consider whether the proposed development is acceptable in terms of their development plan and other considerations which can include national planning policy and relevant planning issues raised by local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.61W.2/1">The standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest was fixed at 6.08% by the last Administration. That rate was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/2">The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to the formula of Bank of England base rate plus 1.58% from January 2011, which at present would produce a rate of 2.08%.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/3">The Chancellor announced in the June 2010 Budget that the standard interest rate would be based on the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage interest rate. Legislation to introduce this change came into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October 2010</phrase> and the standard interest rate is currently 3.63%.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/4">The Department conducted thorough analysis on the likely impacts of this change, and we have included as much information as possible in the equality impact assessment published on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/support-for-mortgage-interest.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/6">The Department is in the process of developing a model to estimate the impact of changes to support for mortgage interest on the number of repossessions. However any estimates will always be limited since detailed case-by-case information, such as arrears at the start of a claim, is not collected by the Department. The Department will consider whether the results can be used publicly once this is work is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/7">The Council of Mortgage Lenders has told the Department that it expects lenders to continue to exercise forbearance where it is fair to do so for the borrower, and the borrower has a chance of paying off any arrears in the future. The Council of Mortgage Lenders thinks that where arrears levels increase for some borrowers as a result of the change in the standard interest rate this does not translate into an immediate possession risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.61W.2/8">At the comprehensive spending review 2010, the Chancellor announced funding for a one year extension to the temporary package of support for mortgage interest changes that had been due to expire in January 2011. This extension maintains the waiting period for new working age claimants at 13 weeks and the limit on eligible mortgage capital at &#163;200,000, and provides additional support to homeowners facing difficulties.</p>

The lower number is based on the number of employers expecting to reduce or restructure their work force. The higher number is based on the responses of a very small proportion of employers who reported that their most likely response would be to close their firms. This is consistent with departmental estimates of the impact on employment levels, based on the elasticity of labour demand to changes in non-labour costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.63W.6/1">This change is very difficult to model in 2011-12 due to the previous Administration's policy to claw back 1.5% for benefits uprated by RPI in April 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.3/2">The number of ASBOs issued at all courts in the Northumbria Criminal Justice System (CJS) area between <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase> is 463. The corresponding figures for the north-east Government office region (GOR) and England are 957 and 16,091 respectively. These figures include ASBOs made on application which became available from <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> and ASBOs made following conviction for a relevant criminal offence, which became available for offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-02">2 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.3/3">ASBOs can be of a fixed duration (for a minimum of two years) or made until further order. Furthermore, courts have the power to vary ASBOs, including their durations and the details of any such variations are not centrally collected by the Ministry of Justice. It is therefore not possible to determine from centrally collected data how many ASBOs are in force at a particular point in time.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.2/2"><i> </i>Detection and enforcement of offences are operational matters for the police. Apart from driving without a licence being an offence in itself, those who commit the offence may also be guilty of other motoring offences and more likely to be involved in road traffic collisions. The police fully recognise the seriousness of such behaviour and its consequences and enforce the relevant offences vigorously. To help in this enforcement they are able at any time to access at the roadside accurate and up to date driver licensing information (including a photograph where appropriate). There are also good IT links between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the courts to assist in effective prosecution of offenders. Where an offence carries licence penalty points, there are provisions for endorsement to be made on the driver record, rather than the licence itself, for future reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.2/3">Where the person without a licence is a foreign national or otherwise does not have a satisfactory UK address there are provisions to require an immediate roadside deposit against payment of any fixed penalty or court-imposed fine for specified offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.11/2">Final detailed budgets have not yet been agreed. The priority of the Agency remains to secure the border and to control migration while we play our part in reducing the public deficit. We are committed to programmes such as e-Borders and the Immigration Case Working system that will help to reduce the threat of terrorism, crime and immigration abuse and replace costly and outmoded paper work, respectively. These programmes will help improve our productivity and efficiency and will mean that we can target our resources on those people likely to cause most harm to the UK. As a result the UK Border Agency will be able to deliver its objectives while reducing the budget by up to 20% in real terms over the next four years.</p>

	<p pid="a.82W.2/1">The 2010 Equality Act was an important streamlining of equality legislation. The Impact Assessment, published in April 2010 shows a total benefit figure (private and public sector) for the Equality Act 2010 of &#163;75 million over 10 years, which includes a &#163;66.5 million benefit for the private sector. In order that these benefits are realised, both Government Equalities Office and Equality and Human Rights Commission have provided a range of support and guidance on their websites as well as speaking at externally organised events. We intend to continue this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.82W.2/2">The Government Equalities Office sponsored Citizens Advice to develop a training programme for its national advice session supervisors and to cascade training to its network of advisors. The cost of the development of this package was &#163;15,000. 11 training sessions have been held so far across England and Wales, taking place between <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-22">22 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-22">22 October 2010</phrase>. A total of 146 Citizen's Advice Bureau supervisors attended these sessions. A further 10 sessions are planned.</p>

	<p pid="a.82W.2/4">The Equality and Human Rights Commission held 14 training events for a number of organisations on the Equality Act 2010, at a total cost of &#163;1,480.

	<p pid="a.85W.2/2"><i> </i>In the same way that our economy is subject to scrutiny from organisations such as the IMF and OECD, the Government report annually on our economic policies to ECOFIN and benefits from reports on the policies of other member states, as set out in article 126 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union (the stability and growth pact). We believe that it is right that we should co-operate with this process because of its contribution to macro-economic stability in the EU, but that co-operation should in no way undermine the fiscal sovereignty of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/3">Although We do submit information to the EU under the stability and growth pact as required in section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, this is presented to Parliament first. This was reinforced when discussions on the EU semester took place earlier this year and the Chancellor secured a clear provision in the stability and growth pact code of conduct to ensure that the UK will continue to send its Budget to the EU only once it has been presented to Parliament. All other member states are now required to send draft budgetary plans to the EU under the EU semester.</p>
	<p pid="a.85W.2/4">Furthermore, while the EU can make recommendations on our fiscal position, by virtue of protocol 15 of the treaty, we are under no obligation to act on such recommendations.

	<p pid="a.91W.6/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.Ofqual.gov.uk">www.Ofqual.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.91W.6/3">Ofqual reports on a number of different aspects of standards in qualifications and assessments and its work is based on five common criteria against which it judges qualifications and assessment: validity, reliability, comparability, manageability and minimisation of bias.</p>
	<p pid="a.91W.6/4">In terms of giving accurate information on how attainment is improving overall, my Department will reform the league tables so that schools are able to focus on, and demonstrate, the progress of children of all abilities. We will also make more data available to the public. In addition to the headline indicators in the tables, parents will be able to access a wealth of information about their schools. Our plans will be announced in a forthcoming White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.2/1">We have made clear that we intend to review the National Curriculum. Our intention in doing this is to restore it to its original purpose-a core national entitlement organised around subject disciplines. One of the tasks of the review will be to identify the aspects of geographical knowledge that all children should acquire at certain ages.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.2/2">We will be announcing details of the review later in the year and are committed to ensuring that it will be conducted in an open and transparent manner. We intend to consult a wide range of interested parties, including subject associations, teachers and academics, before coming to any conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.2/3">Ahead of the review we have received a number of representations about the teaching of geography in primary and secondary schools. In particular, the Geographical Association has encouraged its members to write to MPs to reinforce the message that geography matters; MPs have written to departmental Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.98W.2/4">A child's education is diminished without a sound knowledge of geography. The Government want to encourage children to study geography beyond the age of 14. One of the options we are presently exploring is to give special recognition to pupils studying a broad range of academic subjects, including English, maths, science, a modern or ancient language and a humanity, such as history or geography. Our proposals for an &quot;English Baccalaureate&quot; along these lines could provide schools and students with the incentive to follow the courses which best equip them to succeed, and help ensure that all young people have the chance to do a balanced range of GCSE subjects.</p>

	<p pid="a.104W.2/1">The Government's priorities for primary education are to: (1) improve the quality of teaching in primary schools, a first step has been to expand the Teach First programme into primary schools; (2) give teachers all the powers they need to tackle poor behaviour and restore discipline; (3) increase the autonomy of the primary school system, for example, by opening up the Academies programme to primary schools and supporting the establishment of new Free Primary Schools; (4) create a fairer funding system by introducing the Pupil Premium from 2011, which will provide additional funding for disadvantaged pupils, including those in primary schools, to ensure they benefit from the same opportunities as pupils from more advantaged families; (5) introduce a reformed National Curriculum, which will focus on the core knowledge which children need to acquire in traditional subject disciplines, while giving teachers greater freedom to decide how to teach, including by reducing bureaucracy and data burdens; and (6) ensure that teachers have a secure understanding of how to teach phonics given the importance of learning to read in the early years of primary school.</p>

	<p pid="a.104W.5/1">Governing bodies currently have a statutory responsibility to ensure that schools have a sex education policy in place which as a minimum should provide information on how sex education will be provided, any sensitive issues that will be covered, and who will provide it. This must be made available to parents on request. Where primary schools have chosen not to provide sex education, they must still have a written policy statement to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.5/2">We believe that it is far better to encourage and reinforce the importance of regular and open communication between schools and parents through clear guidance, rather than through additional legislation. Many schools have good channels of communication with parents which help them understand what exactly is being taught in school-including in sex and relationships education (SRE)-and gives them an opportunity to comment on content and the manner in which that content will be presented. Schools may decide to amend their SRE programmes if a majority of parents are unhappy about their content.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.5/3">Ultimately, parents have the right to withdraw their children from SRE teaching, outside the national curriculum, if they are not happy with the school's approach.</p>

Those afforded the next highest category (B) are eligible for ROTL for a special purpose, such as a funeral, but not for resettlement day release (RDR). Eligible prisoners may be considered for RDR either two years before their conditional release or parole eligibility date, or once they have served half the custodial period less half the relevant remand time, whichever gives the later date.</p>
	<p pid="a.117W.11/4">ROTL will not be granted unless the purpose of the leave is one that contributes directly to the prisoner's resettlement into the community or, exceptionally, it is required to enable them to deal responsibly with unexpected family and personal events. The prisoner must additionally pass a rigorous risk assessment taking into account the risks of harm, re-offending and absconding, and the impact of the particular release upon both the victim and public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.2/1">As part of the ongoing work of the Digital Radio Action Plan the Government will be looking closely at which listeners, if any, would be disproportionately disadvantaged by a digital radio switchover. These considerations, along with the cost benefit analysis and impact assessment will determine whether provisions need to be made to support some listeners in switching to digital radio.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.2/2">To ensure future policy takes account of the wide range of listeners' needs, the Consumer Expert Group (which originally formed to inform the digital TV switchover process) has agreed to extend its scope to cover radio.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.8/1">The Government and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) established the Nations and Regions Group to ensure UK-wide engagement and to maximise the legacy from London 2012. This group works directly with representatives from each of the nations and English regions to realise the sporting, economic, and cultural benefits of the 2012 Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.8/2">The north-east stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the 2012 Games, through businesses winning Games-related work, increased tourism and cultural celebrations. Some examples of how the north-east will benefit from the Games are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.8/3">Across the UK over 124,000 companies have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised) and over 1,200 contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers. Information on businesses in the north-east that have directly supplied the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is available on the London 2012 website at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.8/5">St James Park is a 2012 venue for the preliminary rounds of the football competition and will be one of the key non-London venues. Along with Pre-Games Training Camps it will provide an opportunity to create further economic benefits, including inward investment, through the international attention that will follow. In the north-east there are 20 facilities, that met the criteria to be world-class training venues for Olympic and Paralympic sport, which are included in the official London 2012 Pre- Games Training Camp Guide. The guide is accessible at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.8/7">Agreements have been signed with the Olympic Committee of Colombia and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka to hold training camps in the region before the start of the Games.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.8/8">Over 890 cultural and sporting programmes across the UK have been awarded Inspire Marks, including 50 in the north-east. Over 15,000 schools and colleges across the UK have registered for LOCOG's education programme 'Get Set'; 693 of those are in the north-east-53.6% of the total number in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.8/9">The north-east has secured &#163;1.53 million from the Legacy Trust for the region's 'Generation 2012' project. This initiative provides opportunities for regional cultural organisations and young people to work together to develop up to 10 high quality, aspirational 2012 projects in the region, bringing people together for community activities of all kinds.</p>
	<p pid="a.135W.8/10">In addition, I recently announced the 'Places People Play' programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy.

	<p pid="a.146W.8/2">To support the Browne Review and the Government's response to it, we commissioned research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) to explore how changes in fees, grants and loans impact on young participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.146W.8/3">This research exploited variation in grants, fees and loans over the period 1992-2007, and the results indicate that a &#163;1,000 increase in fees, without any compensating increase in loans or grants, results in a 4.4ppt decrease in university participation, while a &#163;1,000 increase in loans results in a 3.2ppt increase in participation, and a &#163;1,000 increase in grants results in a 2.1 ppt increase in participation. So students do respond to changes in the price of HE.</p>
	<p pid="a.146W.8/4">However, this research also concludes that the package of reforms introduced in 2006 had no impact on participation, largely because tuition fees were accompanied by large increases in loans and grants.</p>

This guidance states that all women considering abortion, after discussion with a clinician, should be given written information on procedures, including risks and complications, to ensure that they are able to give informed consent. Counselling should be offered to women who request or who need additional support in the decision-making process, as well as to young women under 16 years of age.</p>

	<p pid="a.153W.9/1">Diabetes is in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), part of the general practitioner (GP) contract, which provides additional reward to GP practices for how well they care for patients based on performance against a number of agreed indicators. There are a range of indicators for diabetes which are key in the risk management for complications of the condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.153W.9/2">In order to qualify for these incentives, GPs are required to record all patients aged 17 years and over with diabetes on a practice register and to undertake a series of tests on an annual basis to help assess and manage the risk of complications of diabetes including stroke and heart disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.153W.9/3">The QOF indicators for diabetes are in line with recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) which lists a series of nine key tests and measures that are helpful in monitoring and managing the condition of a person with diabetes. The tests include measuring blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol and making feet checks, and are important in helping to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke and heart disease. We would expect GPs to use the NICE guidance on diabetes to assist them in safely managing individualised blood glucose level in people with diabetes.</p>

This includes both the adult pooled treatment budget (&#163;381.3 million) and the young peoples pooled treatment budget for substance misuse treatment (&#163;25.4 million). &#163;45.4 million is also allocated by the Department for prison drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.155W.2/2">In 2010-11 the pooled treatment budget was &#163;406.7 million. This is in addition to an estimated &#163;200 million spent by local partners, including the primary care trusts.

	<p pid="a.157W.8/1">Lifestyle behaviours such as smoking, the harmful use of alcohol, drug misuse, poor diet and nutrition, being overweight and physical inactivity are acknowledged risk factors for a number of diseases in men, including cancer. Later this year, we will publish a Public Health White Paper setting out details of our strategy for improving public health and reducing the risk factors associated with developing conditions such as cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.8/2">We know that the earlier a cancer is detected, the sooner treatment can begin and the better the outcomes is likely to be. Screening programmes and cancer awareness initiatives are key to achieving this. The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NHSBCSP) is currently being extended to men and women aged 70 to 75, and those over the age of 75 will be able to self-refer every two years. Last month, we announced the introduction of a new screening technology for the NHSBCSP: flexible sigmoidoscopy. This can detect abnormalities before they become cancer, as well has helping to detect cancer early. Experts estimate this technology will save around 3,000 lives a year. &#163;60 million has been provided for a four-year roll out and, subject to the approval of the UK National Screening Committee, pilots will begin next spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.8/3">In September, we announced that &#163;9 million would be provided through the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative to support 59 local campaigns that will work to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of bowel, lung and breast cancers and to encourage early presentation at a general practitioner (GP) surgery. A further &#163;1.75 million will be provided to pilot activity in two regions to test the viability of a possible national signs and symptoms campaign on bowel cancer. In preparing these campaigns, we are considering how to impact: on different groups in society, including how to influence men to present earlier at a GP surgery.</p>
	<p pid="a.157W.8/4">We are also undertaking a review of the Cancer Reform Strategy to ensure that we have the right strategy to deliver improved cancer outcomes, including reducing incidence and mortality. This review is examining how to achieve equality of access, experience and outcomes in different groups of society. We plan to publish the review in winter.</p>
