	<p pid="b.1439W.6/2">I regret that in my previous answer the figure of &pound;228 million given for the cost to the BBC to support Digital UK for the period of digital switchover was incorrect. The correct figure is &pound;216 million. The full correct response to your questions is as follows&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1439W.6/3">In addition to meeting its costs for the upgrade of the transmission network for digital switchover, the BBC will meet Digital UK's communication costs and a share of Digital UK's operational costs. The cost to the BBC to Support Digital UK amounts to &pound;216 million for the period of digital switchover. In addition, the BBC will also fund the digital switchover help scheme for people 75 or over or who have a significant disability. Our best estimate at this stage is that the cost of the scheme will be at or around &pound;600 million over the period of switchover.</p>
	<p pid="b.1439W.6/4">There are no central estimates of the overall cost to Government of digital switchover. However, other than the costs of updating television equipment within the Government sector, the only costs will be those incurred for research, communications and other programme support costs for the Digital Switchover Programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1440W.3/1">The Concessionary Bus Travel Bill, which is currently before Parliament, provides for a national bus travel concession for older and disabled people in England. This would be introduced in April 2008, in line with the Chancellor's announcements in the 2006 Budget. For those eligible, it will guarantee free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England, rather than within the local authority area of residence as at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.1440W.3/2">The Government are making available additional money of up to &pound;250 million to fund this improvement. We are confident that this will be sufficient to cover the total additional cost to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1440W.3/3">Local authorities and Passenger Transport Executives will be responsible for administering the new concession when the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill comes into force. The Bill does, however, contain a power allowing the Secretary of State to change the tier of local government which has travel concession authority responsibilities. There is also a power allowing the Secretary of State to administer the scheme centrally. No decision on any use of these powers has yet been taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.1446W.6/1">DFID spent &pound;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan between April 2001 and March 2006. We plan to spend a further &pound;102 million in 2006-07. DFID has a performance management and reporting system in place to assess the outcomes of our work, although there are well-recognised issues with attribution of development spending. Specific outputs are identified for every DFID project at design stage. These are monitored and reported against on an annual basis, as well as at project completion. Project reporting feeds into annual country level reporting and divisional level reporting, and finally into the departmental report. This is presented to Parliament every year. The relevant sections of the departmental reports for 2001 to 2006 illustrate the achievements of our Afghanistan programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.6/2">DFID now puts over 50 per cent. of its funding through the Government of Afghanistan's national budget via the World Bank managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). This supports the Afghan Government in delivering its own priority outputs and outcomes. Since 2002 DFID has channelled &pound;235 million through the ARTF. This has helped the government to deliver essential public services: for example through the timely payment of over 100,000 teachers' salaries each month. DFID has led the development of a performance assessment matrix for the ARTF. This will further improve the monitoring of outputs and outcomes of spending through the national budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.1446W.6/3">Other achievements since 2001 which are attributable to combined donor-government efforts include: the number of functioning health clinics has increased by 60 per cent.; 72 new hospitals and clinics have been built; &pound;16 million vaccinations have been administered against childhood diseases, saving an estimated 35,000 lives; over 13,000 primary and secondary schools have been reconstructed; school enrolment has quadrupled; and nearly six million Afghan children are now in school, a third of them girls. Since 2003 economic growth has averaged over 10 per cent. per annum (8 per cent. in 2006-07) and private investment has risen from $22 million to over $400 million. GDP per capita has increased from $182 per capita in 2002 to $335 per capita in 2006, and government fiscal revenue has risen almost five-fold in the same time period: from around $115 million per annum to around $520 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="b.1448W.8/1">There is no agreed global list of conflict affected fragile states, nor fragile states. We do have a list of 'fragile states' which we are reviewing, as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. DFID defines fragile states as those where the government cannot or will not deliver its core functions&mdash;the delivery of basic services, provision of safety and security, capable management of public resources, and control over its own territory. DFID's list of fragile states is based on the countries in the bottom quintiles of the World Bank's country policy and institutional assessments from 1999-2003. Detail on DFID's current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and annexe 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.8/2">DFID's commitment to work more in fragile states is clearly stated in the 2006 White Paper. The UK has also announced its intention to provide &pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years to support education and this will include support for fragile states. This long term commitment will support the development and implementation of education sector plans aimed at meeting the education goals including in fragile states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1448W.8/3">DFID's bilateral programmes are already supporting education in fragile states. For example, in Afghanistan some 40 per cent. or &pound;15 million of our support to reconstruction went to education last year. In addition, through the Education for All Fast Track Initiative's (FTI) Education Programme Development Fund (EPDF) there is the capability to support fragile states to get them on-track with education sector plans. The FTI is now piloting capacity building support for Haiti, Liberia, Somalia and Burundi through the EPDF. The UK-led FTI fragile states task team has been created to examine how the FTI can increase its support for fragile states.</p>

	<p pid="b.1450W.8/1">DFID's main support to the education sector in Afghanistan is through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). This plays a big part in meeting in meeting the recurrent costs such as wages and salaries of teachers and school materials. ARTF resources cover 90 per cent. of the Ministry of Education's wage bill and teachers' salaries represent almost 40 per cent. of ARTF recurrent expenditures. DFID funds a third of these expenditures. The total UK contribution to ARTF to date is &pound;223.7 million ($425.2 million). In addition, we gave limited support (&pound;47,000) for primary education of refugees in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="b.1450W.8/2">In Iraq, our support to education has been channelled through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). In 2004, we contributed &pound;70 million to the multi-donor trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, which provide assistance in key areas including education. IRFFI projects have rehabilitated schools, provided essential text books, and trained Iraqi teachers.

	<p pid="b.1452W.2/1">DFID uses a range of approaches and aid instruments to fight specific diseases in developing countries according to the country situation. The preference within the bilateral programme is to provide budget support or pooled funds to support the implementation of countries' own health plans. Such approaches provide flexible and long term support to fund trained staff, essential medicines and the costs of delivering broad based health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.2/2">In more difficult settings where DFID supports large disease specific programmes it encourages the delivery of integrated packages of care, for example adding distribution of bednets, micronutrients, and other vital treatments to immunisation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452W.2/3">The challenges are greater in multilateral investments where DFID channels funds through others, for example the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria or the GAVI Alliance. DFID encourages these groups and others to buy into national plans and use national delivery systems where possible. The aim is to minimise the negative effect of projects that may divert funds, staff and effort to specific health issues at the expense of broader services. In response to such concerns GAVI has established a health systems funding window to support the infrastructure needed to deliver sustainable health systems and the Global Fund model is evolving with the recent contribution to the pooled health sector fund in Mozambique.</p>

DFID has committed &pound;68.5 million, including technical assistance, between 2002 and 2006 for the National Health Facility, of which approximately &pound;41 million is for reproductive health services. This national programme includes family planning; female health workers whose role includes providing community based family planning, and some population welfare which includes reproductive health.

	<p pid="b.1458W.6/1">The initial figure of &pound;72.80 for the flat rate accrual amount is the equivalent of &pound;1.40 a week in earnings terms. This figure will be re-valued in line with average earnings during a working life and with prices in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1458W.6/2">In coming to this figure we have 'smoothed' the accrual amounts; this radically simplifies the current system where for around the next twenty years, state second pension accruals would have been set at different levels for younger and older workers. Over the next forty years our reforms are broadly cost neutral and people's pensions will build up in a straightforward way that they will find easier to understand.</p>

However, schemes who seek accredited status will be free to apply for funding, in the same way as any other voluntary or community organisation, from existing funding sources where they meet the appropriate grant criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.1462W.0/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has written to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what plans he has to (a) pilot and (b) introduce a road pricing scheme in Northern Ireland; and what research his Department has undertaken in relation to the feasibility of such a scheme in Northern Ireland. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has made it clear that he wants Northern Ireland to be fully engaged in the road pricing agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/5" class="indent">In Great Britain, officials in the Department for Transport are considering legislative proposals to be taken forward in a draft Road Transport Bill. The Bill would reform the existing powers of local authorities in England and Wales to introduce pilot road pricing schemes. It would give greater freedom to local authorities to implement schemes whilst ensuring that schemes in different places are consistent and interoperable. Pilot schemes could tackle congestion where it is already a problem, or predicted to be, and could support the Government's work to explore the potential for a national system of road pricing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/6" class="indent">Northern Ireland roads legislation does not at present contain any powers enabling the introduction of road pricing or road pricing pilot schemes. However, Roads Service officials are currently liaising with their counterparts in the Department for Transport to determine whether it would be appropriate to introduce similar legislative provision to Northern Ireland either through the proposed Road Transport Bill or by a separate Order in Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1462W.0/7" class="indent">Turning to the matter of research, Roads Service officials have been actively involved in the development of the Department for Transport's Road Pricing Feasibility Study and in the outworkings of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' Lorry User Charging proposals. We continue to monitor developments in road user charging in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.1465W.2/2">It is a statutory responsibility for every local authority children's services to safeguard children in their area, including runaways, and local authorities have a duty to promote co-operation between all those who work with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1465W.2/3">Government issued 'Children Missing from Care and Home&mdash;a guide to good practice' in tandem with the Social Exclusion Unit's report 'Young Runaways', in 2002. This includes information for local authorities and their partner agencies on responding both to children in care who go missing from their placements and also to children who go missing from their homes. This guidance states that where runaways from one area present themselves in another local authority area, it will be important that the &quot;receiving&quot; authority negotiates with their &quot;home&quot; authority so that, if necessary, these children can be linked back into appropriate services that are local to their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.1466W.0/1">It is for schools to decide the way in which they will evaluate the effectiveness of any innovative curriculum plan they undertake. All school activities are subject to inspection by Ofsted, and one of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's specific responsibilities is to monitor the curriculum and to report on developments in the national curriculum subjects.</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/2">There are a number of key elements of the curriculum that have stood the test of time and which will remain at the forefront of what the next generation learn. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/3" class="indent">in English, children will continue to read classical literature and will study Shakespeare and pre-20th century writers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/4" class="indent">in history, they will continue to learn about the importance and impact of events in the last century, such as the world wars and the holocaust;</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/5" class="indent">children will continue to learn to read music and will be taught about classical traditions;</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/6" class="indent">in science, children will continue to learn about energy, electricity, reproduction, astronomy and space; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/7" class="indent">in maths, we have retained statistics, algebra, geometry and equations, while putting more emphasis on the use of maths to solve real problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/8">The recent changes to the science curriculum at Key Stage 4 give teachers more flexibility to communicate the excitement of science. The new Key Stage 3 science curriculum has been reviewed to complement the key Stage 4 programme of study so that science teaching for all age groups is integrated and engaging for pupils. There are no plans to change the format of the Key Stage science programme of study.</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/9">Cross-curricular themes will not be a statutory requirement of the revised secondary curriculum. It will be for schools to decide how best to deliver the new curriculum to meet the needs of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.1466W.0/10">The guidance for teachers which will help them track the progress of their pupils, including how well they have grasped the key concepts and skills in each curriculum subject, will be developed by the QCA with input from other experts. There are no plans for a consultation on the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1466W.3/2">Reducing the amount of overly detailed factual content in the curriculum will free up time in the school timetable. Schools and teachers can use that time to give more lessons in English and mathematics to pupils struggling with the basics, and to give opportunities for other pupils to extend their learning in areas in which they have particular interests and aptitudes. This moves us away from a one-size-fits-all curriculum to one that offers more flexibility to tailor teaching to pupils' needs and aspirations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1468W.9/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) makes extensive use of databases. Some (for example for recording visa applications and financial transactions) are managed centrally. Many others, where there is no operational need to share data, are locally owned, by either diplomatic posts overseas or departments in the UK. A survey in 2005 identified more than 1,000 databases, of varying size and complexity, holding over one million records supporting the full range of activities undertaken by the FCO worldwide. The owning post or department is best placed to ensure the accuracy of the data held, in accordance with local need and any relevant UK statutory provisions. We do not duplicate this responsibility by central monitoring, and consequently to collect and collate the information required to answer the hon. Member's question fully could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

It will have responsibility for a budget of &euro;7.51 billion (&pound;5 billion) in the seven year period 2007-13. The ERC is part of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development in the overall EU budget; the UK contribution to the ERC will therefore be in proportion to our contribution to the EU budget. The ERC will be based in Brussels and staff will be recruited under Commission staff regulations as they apply to Commission Executive Agencies, so it is not possible at this stage to determine how many of the staff will be UK nationals.</p>

The positive outcome to the latest round of six-party talks, with agreement reached on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-13">13 February</phrase>, is a step in the right direction towards denuclearisation. On human rights, we and our European partners regularly raise our concerns with the DPRK Government and in international fora.

	<p pid="b.1487W.0/1">The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) has housed the United Kingdom National Central Bureau (NCB) for Interpol since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. Previously the NCB was housed within the pre-cursor agency the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). The process undertaken in SOCA is the same as it was in NCIS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487W.0/2">While the NCB is not responsible for the collection and recording of information on UK nationals who commit crime abroad, the unit will receive such information during the course of international law enforcement co-operation, which is its remit. The sources of information will vary, but may include information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An initial assessment of the quality of the information is made. If there is insufficient identification material, more details are requested. Research is carried out against available databases in order to identify if the individual is already known or of interest to UK law enforcement. Where sufficient details of identity and offence are received, the case officer will forward this to the National Identification Service. Any existing record will be updated, or a new criminal record will be created.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487W.0/3">Since many notifications will be contained within investigative casework, neither SOCA, nor NCIS before it, has statistics which would accurately reflect the number of conviction notifications received, or what percentage of these have been added to the Police National Computer.</p>

Revocation of an order does not mean the subject may re-enter the UK. It only makes them eligible to apply for entry under the Immigration Rules. Consideration of these applications is not measured using average times but rather is included in the total for all non-asylum, non-charged postal applications. These are measured against the published service standards set for IND's Managed Migration which are that 25 per cent. of all applications should be completed within 20 working days, and 30 per cent. completed within 70 working days. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase>, 43 per cent. of these applications are completed within 20 working days and 87 per cent. are completed within 70 working days.

	<p pid="b.1501W.5/1">Strengthening identity authentication is a stated business objective for IPS in its corporate and business plans. The main IPS objectives of the Personal Identity Process (PIP) are:</p>

	<p pid="b.1501W.5/3" class="indent">To deter and help detect fraudulent applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1501W.5/4">The most difficult thing for an identity fraudster to do is to create a history for a false identity. Therefore, the concept of PIP is to check information supplied by passport applicants against information held on private and public sector databases in order to help confirm that the identity claimed is a real person who is alive and, importantly, who has been active in society at the address given. This is known as a social or biographical 'footprint'.</p>

None of the applicant's financial details are included within the PIP checks. The checks establish only that the applicant's details are present on the databases..</p>

	<p pid="b.1512W.0/2">Under the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, Probation Boards may contract out probation work but do not have a legal duty to do so. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out the legal obligations on local Boards to co-operate with the police, prisons and other bodies to manage the risk posed by certain offenders. This is in addition to the general aim of Boards to reduce re-offending under Section two of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1512W.3/1">The Government believe that dangerous, violent and seriously persistent offenders should go to prison, and for a long time if necessary, but most offenders can better and more effectively be punished in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512W.3/2">The National Probation Service (NPS) has received a real terms increase of 39 per cent. in Resource funding since 2001-02 to meet the cost of increased workload and intensity of supervision. The funding for 2007-08 is not yet finalised, but at present it is planned for the NPS to receive an increase of 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1520W.7/2">A 2004 Home Office study profiled 228 women involved in street-based prostitution and found that 87 per cent. used heroin and 64 per cent., crack cocaine. Anecdotal evidence from Government consultation on prostitution suggested that a high proportion of those involved in street-prostitution use class A drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520W.7/3">Drug services are now expected to focus on the client's needs, not just on the misuse of the drug. Treatment services are therefore adopting flexible treatment packages that reflect both the range of drugs used and the complex needs of the drug users, working in partnership with other local agencies to deliver a range of support. The Home Office published commissioning guidance for partnerships and providers tackling drug problems associated with prostitution in 2004. This guidance looks at how to reduce the impact problematic drug misuse has on those involved in street prostitution through primary prevention, harm reduction and drug treatment. The Government's coordinated strategy on prostitution builds on this, and also includes proposals for a new rehabilitative penalty for loitering or soliciting, to encourage those involved to tackle the issues that tie them to the streets, including drug addiction.</p>

	<p pid="b.1524W.6/2">To date, there have been no firm expressions of interest to join the Army as a result of the Look at Life (LAL) event run at Gamecock Barracks for youngsters from the Ahmadiyyan Muslim community. The primary purpose of the event sought to raise awareness of the Army and its place in society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1524W.6/3">The LAL course was well received. The course was developed as part of the Army's ongoing 'Diversity Thread' programme, which seeks to engage with key influencers and the target audience (16 to 33 years old for the Regular Army and 18 to 34 for the Territorial Army). This entails raising awareness of the Army and its place in society, building interest in the Army, its careers, and its values and standards, all with the intention of potentially securing commitment to join or simply to support the ideals of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1524W.6/4">In this financial year over 1,000 young people from ethnic backgrounds have applied to join the Army as regular soldiers; with over 300 enlisting since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. This is very encouraging and represents an increase of 6 per cent. compared to the same period last year. Over 70 young people from ethnic backgrounds have applied to join the Army as officers&mdash;an increase of 70 per cent. over the same period last year&mdash;with 23 passing the Army Officer Selection Board&mdash;an increase of 109 per cent. over the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1524W.6/5">While the growth in young people from ethnic backgrounds seeking to join the Army is modest, the annual increase is steady. For the current recruiting year, the Army is looking to recruit 4.1 per cent. of its intake from ethnic minority communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.2/1">Service personnel are only used to provide cover during fire strikes as a last resort. There are accordingly no armed forces personnel on permanent standby or permanently trained to provide emergency fire cover. In the event of a strike, fire services are expected to explore all other available options drawing on professional firefighters. This has been borne out recently, as military assistance was not required during Fire Brigade Union industrial action in Hertfordshire and Merseyside last year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.5/1">Military patients can be treated in any NHS hospital, which is the most effective way of enabling them to benefit from the latest advances in medical treatment and the recent major investments in NHS facilities. On average, on any one day, the number of military in-patients in NHS hospitals throughout the UK will be barely enough to fill two wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/2">The total number of military in-patients across all UK hospitals are not collated on a regular basis. When a snapshot exercise was carried out on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, there were 33 service in-patients in the five NHS hospitals hosting Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) and 16 in-patients at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) in Birmingham. A small number of individuals were also being treated at NHS hospitals who do not host one of our MDHUs. However, the number of personnel falling into this category are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. It was estimated that there were around a further 15 to 25 service personnel as in-patients in NHS hospitals on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, in addition to those in the MDHU and RCDM hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1525W.5/3">Service personnel who require in-patient mental health care are treated at the Priory Group. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February 2007</phrase>, 31 military personnel were receiving in-patient treatment. This is part of our ongoing commitment to providing community-based mental health care access to high quality care without delay, providing regional care within easy reach of unit, base or home.</p>

	<p pid="b.1525W.8/1">Service personnel have always been entitled to secondary care and community services in the NHS since it was formed in 1948. Following the decisions in 1990s to close the remaining military hospitals, the NHS now provides secondary care services to the military in the UK, with in-patient mental healthcare being provided by the Priory Group. The geographical distribution of military bases within the UK means that this use of local secondary care facilities is the most effective way of providing excellent healthcare to the armed forces. In addition to this, we work closely with the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust to provide both the Royal College of Defence medicine and a military managed ward which primarily supports those wounded on operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1532W.2/1">It is important to be clear about the differences between avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and pandemic influenza. Avian influenza is a disease of birds which occasionally affects people. Seasonal influenza refers to the illness which occurs each winter due to human influenza viruses which are circulating in the population. Pandemic influenza occurs infrequently, when a new influenza virus emerges which is markedly different from those recently circulating in the human population, causes disease in people and spreads easily between people because they have little or no immunity to it. This could happen through an avian influenza virus, such as the H5N1 virus, mutating into a different strain with greater affinity for people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1538W.3/1">It is important to be clear about the differences between seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza. Seasonal influenza refers to the illness which occurs each winter due to human influenza viruses which are circulating in the population. Pandemic influenza occurs infrequently, when a new influenza virus emerges which is markedly different from those recently circulating in the human population; causes disease in people; and spreads easily between people because they have little or no immunity to it. This could happen through an avian influenza virus, such as the H5N1 virus, mutating into a different strain with greater affinity for people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538W.3/2">It is also important to remember that it is very difficult to prevent a pandemic and it could emerge anywhere in the world including the United Kingdom. The UK is working closely with World Health Organisation and other international partners to prepare for, and respond to, a potential pandemic, including by containment of an emerging pandemic virus. The WHO has a stockpile of antiviral drugs, to which the UK has contributed, which will be sent to where a pandemic develops. If deployed rapidly, these drugs may help to contain an emerging pandemic virus or slow its national and international spread.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538W.3/3">Should a pandemic develop, the UK would follow the procedures outlined in the UK Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan, which was published in October 2005 and is available on our website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu">www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu</a>. The plan is currently being revised and the revised plan will be published shortly.</p>

The WHO, in conjunction with the International Organisation of Animal Health, is working to ensure there is strong epidemiological surveillance in South East Asia to detect outbreaks early and on a strengthened rapid response capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1539W.2/2">The United Kingdom works closely with the WHO and international partners to ensure that our planning is informed by expert advice and international consensus. The UK has tested its preparedness in several exercises. The WHO considers the UK to be at the forefront of preparedness internationally and we are continuing to consider what other measures could be taken to further improve our preparedness for a pandemic of influenza. Preparedness planning in other European countries was reported to be broadly good in an assessment published in the Lancet in 2006, although substantial variation between countries was noted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1540W.0/3">Under Modernising Medical Careers, doctors in training will not be required to look for new jobs every six months. Instead, they will train in managed programmes lasting a number of years according to specialty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1540W.0/4">Modernising Medical Careers will, therefore, help to ease rather than increase the pressure created by the August start date. We are aware, however, that there will still be a higher level of recruitment in August than in any other month. We have asked the Modernising Medical Careers United Kingdom Strategy Group to consider whether other arrangements might be more appropriate. The BMA and indeed NHS employers will be consulted as part of that study.</p>

	<p pid="b.1542W.6/1">Low vision aids are already available free on loan to any person assessed as requiring them. The hospital eye service assesses the needs of the individual and provides any necessary low vision aids. There are no plans to bring low vision aids within the scope of the optical voucher scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1542W.6/2">Social services departments also have responsibility for assessing the needs of individuals who request help due to problems with their vision. This help is usually in the form of modifications to a person's home.</p>
