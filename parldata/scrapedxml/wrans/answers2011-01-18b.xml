	<p pid="b.669W.4/1">Following the review by Sir David Normington of data burdens placed by the Government on the police service, police cost estimates by crime type based on activity based costing (ABC) data are no longer collected centrally by the Home Office. 2007-08 is therefore the latest year for which these data are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.4/2">Some incidences of acquisitive and violent crime are likely to be related to alcohol or drugs. However, ABC did not record whether violent and acquisitive offences were drug or alcohol-related. Spend on violent and acquisitive crimes is therefore presented here with no further break down.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.4/3">Based on ABC, estimates of the cost to the police of dealing with acquisitive crime, violent crime and drug offences in 2007-08 are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/6"> <td></td> <td><i> &#163; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/7"> <td>Drug offences</td> <td>338</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/8"> <td>Violent crimes</td> <td>913</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/9"> <td>Acquisitive crimes</td> <td>1,268</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.669W.4/12">These estimates include business support costs such as personnel and finance activities. Excluding business support costs results in the following estimates:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/15"> <td></td> <td><i> &#163; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/16"> <td>Drug offences</td> <td>266</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/17"> <td>Violent crimes</td> <td>727</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.669W.4/18"> <td>Acquisitive crimes</td> <td>1,007</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.669W.4/21">Crime prevention activity is excluded from these figures. Drug offences are only those directly related to the sale and possession of drugs. Violent crime includes more serious and less serious violence. Acquisitive crime includes burglary from a dwelling, burglary from commercial or other premises, robbery, theft of or from a motor vehicle, and other theft. Figures exclude data from Essex, Suffolk, Staffordshire and Thames Valley police forces, which are not available.</p>

Diplomatic service appointments of ambassadorial rank are agreed by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Prime Minister and made by Her Majesty the Queen. An announcement will be made once this process is complete. The Government do not propose to bring forward proposals to enable either the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the European Scrutiny Committee to have the right to confirm the appointment of a new UK Permanent Representative to the European Union, or any other diplomatic service appointment. We do propose to continue the practice that political appointees to diplomatic service positions should appear before the Select Committee after their appointments have been made. It would not be appropriate to appoint the UK Permanent Representative to the Cabinet: Ministers are accountable to Parliament for all aspects of the Government's European policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.677W.4/1">Approved premises accept prisoners released on licence, offenders on community sentences and bailees. These are not differentiated in funding terms, so it is not possible to give specific figures for residents serving community sentences.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.4/2">The funding allocated to each Probation Trust in 2010-11 for the running of approved premises is set out in the following table. In addition to those run by Probation Trusts, 11 approved premises are operated by independent third-sector organisations, and these are shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.4/3">The grant for approved premises in 2009-10 equated to an average &#163;26,600 per bed space. More than one resident will occupy a single bed space in approved premises over the course of a year, with an average stay per resident of 74.7 days in March 2010 and 70.8 days in November 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.677W.4/4">Approved premises provide for enhanced supervision, particularly of high risk of harm offenders on release from custody. It would be much more difficult to provide that level of supervision, were such offenders to be dispersed into less suitable accommodation in the community on release from custody.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.9/1">The Ministry does not have oversight of the provision of legal advice to the Government as a whole and as such the Ministry does not hold information on the cost of legal advice to other departments. The estimated cost of the provision of legal advice and representation of the Government at inquests following the deaths of military personnel on active service and hospital deaths are matters for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Department for Health (DoH) respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.9/2">The Ministry does, however, have responsibility for the welfare of prisoners, and, as such, it has obtained legal advice and representation from the Treasury Solicitor's Department and Counsel at inquests following the deaths of prisoners in custody. These costs came to &#163;1.8 million in 2007-08; &#163;2.2 million in 2008-09 and &#163;2.7 million in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.9/3">Legal aid funding for inquests is not within scope of the legal aid scheme. Nevertheless, under the Access to Justice Act 1999, the Lord Chancellor has the power to authorise the Legal Services Commission to grant exceptional legal aid funding in cases which are not within the scope of the civil legal aid scheme. The total amount spent on exceptional funding was &#163;1.1 million in 2007-08; &#163;1.5 million in 2008-09 and &#163;1.6 million in 2009-10. While most of the applications for exceptional funding are for inquests, it is not possible to disaggregate the expenditure on inquests from the total amount spent on exceptional funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.685W.0/21">The overall average cost for 2008-09 comprises the expenditure on public and private prisons (as recorded in the NOMS agency annual report and accounts), increased by an apportionment of relevant costs borne centrally and in the regions by NOMS. This involves some estimation. The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (eg Health and Education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Expenditure recharged to the Youth Justice Board in respect of young people is included.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.0/22">Cost per prison place is expressed in terms of the certified normal accommodation number of places; this gives a higher unit cost than the cost per prisoner.</p>

	<p pid="b.687W.8/1">The specific budget for public sector prisons allocated to prison psychology services in the 2010-11 financial year was &#163;85.5 million. However, additional funding would have been included in the budgets for individual programmes and cannot be identified separately.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/2">The budget for public sector prisons allocated to prison probation for the reimbursement of costs for seconded probation officers in the 2010-11 financial year was &#163;11.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/3">Budgets for prison psychology and prison probation for the next four years have yet to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/4">Responsibility for the funding of prisoner education in England rests with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). BIS are still working through the detail of the comprehensive spending review and information will be announced as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/5">In 2010-11, BIS plans to spend &#163;171 million on offender learning in English public sector prisons. This includes spend associated with the employment of heads of learning and skills in prisons, libraries and higher education in public sector prisons in England and a small amount in private sector prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/6">In addition &#163;2.4 million is allocated for education in public sector prisons in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/7">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) provides both physical resources and staff to support educational activities for prisoners. It is not possible to separately identify these costs which are not held centrally. Education in private prisons is largely run in house and the full costs are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/8">Training for prisoners is undertaken, mainly by Prison Service staff, while prisoners work or are engaged in various areas such as prison industries, catering, physical education, land based activities, industrial cleaning and laundries. The central costs of the training elements of these, mainly production functions, are not kept centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.8/9">NOMS gained co-financing organisation status in January 2009 and successfully bid for a total of &#163;50 million of European social funding to enhance the skills and employment services to offenders in prison and the community. NOMS has been granted the funding over 27 months to increase offenders' employability and improve their access to mainstream support provision. Funding has been extended into a second phase up to 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.691W.6/1">Controls on pesticides work at a number of levels, initially by identifying the hazard potential, then by assessing and managing risk. Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are first evaluated at community level. A key part of this process is an assessment of the risks to bees. If an active substance meets the EU safety requirements then products containing that active substance can be authorised at member state level, taking into account that country's individual agronomic, climatic and dietary requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.6/2">In the UK, pesticide products can only be sold or used after they have been authorised. As part of this process, the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) undertakes an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment (in particular honey bees) may be exposed. The purpose being to ensure that the use of the product poses no unacceptable risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.6/3">The controls extend to the use of products and CRD routinely restricts the way products can be used (e.g. specifying dose rates, timing and place of application) to ensure protection of human health and the environment. Users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. Advice on how this can be done is set out in a statutory &quot;Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products&quot; which, amongst other things, contains guidance on minimising the exposure of bees to pesticides.</p>

Future expenditure must be well targeted, delivering measurable outputs that offer real value for money and societal benefits that the market place cannot provide. It should tackle the key objectives of encouraging a competitive, sustainable EU agriculture sector, reducing reliance on subsidies and focusing resources on the provision of environmental public goods.

	<p pid="b.694W.11/1">The total discard estimate in 2009 (the latest period for which figures are available for those fisheries sampled in UK) is 51,179 tonnes. There are many reasons explaining these discards; however, the current system for recording catch and discard data does not allow us to differentiate (year on year) why each fish is discarded. Despite this, CEFAS analysis, conducted in 2010 on the 2008 English and Welsh discard data, estimated that;</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/2" class="indent">54% (13,230 tonnes) of total discards were discarded for reasons relating to weak/absent markets (i.e. non-quota species).</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/3" class="indent">Quota constraints were estimated to account for 22% (5,390 tonnes) of discards (i.e. quota species above the legal minimum landing size)</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/4" class="indent">24% (5,880 tonnes) of total discards were quota species below the legal minimum landing size (MLS) and were too small to land.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/5">High grading is another type of discarding where fishermen try to optimise the value of their catches by keeping the good value fish and discarding the poorer value ones. This creates a financial profit for fishermen but is still a waste of legally landable fish. A European high grading ban is in place in waters around the UK to prevent this behaviour. The extent of high grading has not been successfully separated from estimates for other types of discarding. Other types of discarding, such as unmarketable species, over quota and under MLS may represent a loss of value to the fishermen and from the fishery.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/6">Because discard estimates 1997-2010 have not undergone the same analysis as 2008 data, estimates of the financial impacts of discards for the British fleet as a whole are unreliable. To simply use the average market value of all fish species as a multiplier would give an inaccurate estimate of the financial impact of discards.</p>
	<p pid="b.694W.11/7">We do, however, have a more robust study underway looking at the economic impact of discarding fish.</p>

	<p pid="b.695W.2/1">The food industry has always shown itself to be adaptable and flexible to its customers' demands and much progress has already been made in providing more and better information on food labels. However, we recognise that more could be done to ensure origin information is provided on products of interest to consumers, such as fresh meat.</p>
	<p pid="b.695W.2/2">Discussions in the EU on a new Food Information Regulation are ongoing. The UK supported the extension of compulsory origin labelling to all fresh meat, a review of extending origin labelling for other foods, and a requirement for origin information to be given for main ingredients when origin claims are made. Member states have reached political agreement on the text, which will now be sent to the European Parliament for further consideration. We do not expect the regulation to be adopted and published until early 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.695W.2/3">In the meantime, we continue to work with the food industry, retailers and others to encourage better labelling. Voluntary principles on country of origin labelling, developed by industry and facilitated by DEFRA, were launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-24">24 November</phrase> and have been agreed by trade associations representing manufacturers, retailers and the food service sector. All of the major supermarkets have signed up to this approach and many individual businesses already provide excellent origin information. These principles formalise and strengthen the current labelling practices of many businesses. As part of the Structural Form Plan, DEFRA will be carrying out an assessment of current origin labelling practices in the UK during the first half of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.11/1">One of the Government's priorities is to support and develop British farming and encourage sustainable food production. To achieve this it needs to be seen to lead by example and encourage sustainable food procurement by the Government and the wider public sector. In support of this the Government have made a commitment to source food, subject to no overall increase in costs, meeting British or equivalent standards of production.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.11/2">This commitment will be included as part of a set of Government Buying Standards for food, covering sustainability of food and catering operations as well as nutrition, which will be mandatory for central Government Departments and will be promoted to the wider public sector. These Government Buying Standards, currently the subject of an external review ending on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-24">24 January</phrase>, will be published in March this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.11/3">We know that some Departments are already buying a high proportion of food that meets British or equivalent standards of production and therefore it should be possible for others to do the same. DEFRA will be working to help all Departments achieve this goal through guidance and learning from best practice. Departments will be asked to report on the extent to which they meet the Government Buying Standards in June 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.11/4">Government, procurement has to comply with EU and UK legislation which is intended to prevent 'buy national' policies and encourage free trade and equal access to markets.

	<p pid="b.698W.8/3">The focus of the programme has been reconsidered since finding &quot;P. ramorum&quot; seriously affecting Japanese larch trees in the south-west of England in August 2009. The programme has been subject to review, in consultation with a range of interested parties, and the outcome of this review should be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.8/4">The Forestry Commission has been working closely with the Food and Environment Research Agency to deliver the programme against the diseases and has been carrying out annual surveys of woodland since 2004. Wherever the pathogen's presence is confirmed it requires the removal of all infected plants and trees, and the Forestry Commission takes the same action on the land it manages. Activity has increased significantly since &quot;P. ramorum&quot; was confirmed on Japanese larch, an important component of commercial forestry, and currently some 3,000 hectares of Japanese larch are being cleared mainly in south west England and south Wales in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. Funding totalling &#163;600,000 has been made available from the programme funds to help owners arrange for the felling and marketing of their timber and the clearance of younger non-commercial crops.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.2/3">DEFRA has contributed approximately &#163;2.5 million a year to the SDC's budget. We are determining the scale of any costs arising from the abolition of the SDC as part of the SDC transition project. This will include the cost of redundancy compensation payments as well as salary costs for any staff that transfer into DEFRA. We anticipate that any costs will be outweighed by the long term savings to DEFRA and to Government.</p>

When the current Ambassador's term ends in 2011, we will retain the post of UK permanent representative to the conference on disarmament in Geneva. However leadership of the UK delegations to the non-proliferation treaty and the arms trade treaty will revert to the relevant heads of department at the FCO in London. This will ensure even greater Whitehall and ministerial co-ordination across the multilateral arms control and disarmament community, including on the arms trade treaty as we approach the critical UN negotiating conference in 2012. I can confirm that multilateral arms control and disarmament continue to be a high priority for the FCO.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.8/1">The bilateral relationship with India sits on solid foundations, but my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear that the UK is committed to making this partnership stronger, wider and deeper, to mutual benefit. This reflects India's increasingly important role in the world and our shared interest in democracy, sustained economic growth, and global security through effective international institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.8/2">Since my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's visit to India and the summit with Indian Prime Minister Singh in July 2010 we have set in train an ambitious agenda of practical co-operation. A number of further visits, including by Cabinet Ministers, have taken place in both directions. A significant UK trade delegation is accompanying my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills (Vince Cable) on a visit to India this week. In February a forum of chief executive officers from both countries will meet to advise on improving bilateral trade. A new phase in the UK/India Education and Research initiative will further enhance co-operation between educational institutions and provide a platform for the increased ties in science and technology that will help drive economic growth on both sides. Co-operation also continues on defence, counter terrorism and climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.8/3">Both sides are committed to deepening the relationship at the non-governmental level and hon. Members may be aware of recent parliamentary exchanges. India's new membership of the UN Security Council also provides an opportunity to engage even more closely on key international issues and it is the Government's intention to do so.</p>

I am also deeply concerned by reports that Reza Khandan, Ms Sotoudeh's husband, has now been detained by the authorities. Arrests and harassment of family members as a means to exert pressure are entirely unacceptable. I urge Iran to cease its harassment of human rights defenders and lawyers for doing their jobs and defending those without a voice.</p>

The costs cover the direct staff administration costs of Budgeting and Crisis Loans including face to face interviews, Community Care Grants, Funeral Payments and Sure Start Maternity Grants, reviews and appeals and exclude Winter Fuel payments. Debt Management activity is carried out by a Shared Service function on behalf of Jobcentre Plus. Activity specific to Social Fund Debt is not separately identified from the wider debt recovery costs.<br/> 3. The increase in cost mainly reflects increased volumes of Crisis Loans.<br/> 4. In 2009-10 face to face interviews were introduced where an individual made a third or subsequent request for a Crisis Loan within a rolling 12 month period. The aim of these interviews is to:<br/> Help ensure that the Fund is not being mis-used. Evidence suggests that on being invited to interview, significant numbers of applicants either terminate the telephone call or fail to attend the appointment.<br/> Help sign-post genuine needy customers for independent money advice so that they can receive help with matters such as budgeting.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Jobcentre Plus Activity Based Management System</td> </tr>

The Average Actual Clearance Time (AACT) target measures the average number of days we take to process changes of circumstances. The purpose of the target is to make sure that our customers' changes of circumstances are processed in a reasonable length of time.  5. The AACT is calculated by dividing the total number of days taken to clear cases by the total number of cases cleared. <i> Example:</i> Total number of working days taken to clear cases is 150; total number of cases cleared is 50.

Since appeals take around six months to be completed on average, there is a significant delay between an appeal being lodged and the result being given. Data are presented for claims starting by August 2009 since we expect that the large majority of appeals for these cases will have been cleared to date. If we were to provide data on more recent cases it would be unreliable and probably underestimate the true number of appeals.</p>

	<p pid="b.712W.3/1">The Church of England has a long history of delivering youth work and currently provides activities outside church for over 439,900 children and young people. At a local level, the church has seen extensive growth in the number of churches employing youth workers in recent years and the establishment of some key projects, often with the financial support of local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.3/2">At both national and local levels the Church has had a long history of delivering youth work collaborative working partnerships with national and local government. Currently there are approximately 440,000 children and young people up to the age of 25 attending church-based activities and youth groups which are staffed by 116,000 volunteers and an additional 4,900 employed adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.3/3">There is still a desire to work in partnership but most recent conversations have inevitably focused on how reductions in their budgets will impact on projects undertaken by the Church and other voluntary sector organizations. In Lincolnshire the county council is proposing a 60% cut to the youth budget of children's services and there are similar stories from across the country. The Church's concern is not only for young people within it but also those in the wider community.</p>

	<p pid="b.712W.6/1">Figures held centrally by the Ministry Division of the Archbishop's Council show that in the period 2005-10 the division's candidate's panel dealt with 14 former Roman Catholic priests seeking ordination in the Church of England, of whom 11 were accepted for ministry. As there is discretion at diocesan level over the requirements for acceptance into ministry, not all cases are centrally recorded, meaning the national figure is likely to be higher. There are, however, no pensions implications for the Church Commissioners who are responsible only for clergy pensions earned for service in the Church of England before 1998.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.2/1">The Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) are not World Bank funds, but rather are managed by an equal number of developing and developed countries. The World Bank acts as trustee and, alongside other multilateral development banks, is one of the agencies recipient countries may choose to implement their national programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/2">The UK's &#163;735 million contribution to the CIFs is helping 45 developing countries to pilot transformational investments in clean technology, sustainable management of forests, increased access to renewable energy, and climate resilient development. For example, the CIFs are expected to install over 12.5GW of renewable energy-enough for the equivalent of nearly 16 million households-and increase crop yields for 440,000 people in Bangladesh through improved water management.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/3">The money provided to the Environmental Transformation Fund under the 2007 comprehensive spending review was a capital grant contribution. The UK's contribution to the CIFs is then used to make loans on highly concessional terms, with a small proportion available as grants. Once loans are repaid to the CIFs, they can be reinvested in further programmes to help other developing countries tackle climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/4">As a first mover in the development of the CIFs, the UK's contribution of &#163;735 million has leveraged over five times this amount ($6.4 billion) from other donors, much of this in the form of grants. These donor pledges are, in turn, leveraging further funds from the multilateral development banks and the private sector. For example, for every &#163;1 of finance for clean technology we have agreed to spend, another &#163;8 is being mobilised from other sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/5">In accordance with the International Development Act 2002, no conditions were placed on the UK's contribution, although we are working hard to ensure that the CIFs deliver results and value for money.</p>

However, the coalition Government wanted a more complete measure of rough sleeping and when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.

	<p pid="b.720W.2/1">There are no plans at this time to extend cervical screening in England to women who are aged under the age of 25, or who are under 25 and have given birth. In England, cervical screening currently starts at age 25 years in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and the independent Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening (ACCS).</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.2/2">The Department is committed to ensuring that the age at which women are invited for cervical screening is based on the latest available clinical evidence and in the best interests of young women. In May 2009, the ACCS conducted a formal review of the evidence relating to the risks and benefits of cervical screening in women under the age of 25.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.2/3">The committee were unanimous in deciding there was no reason to lower the age at which screening commences. The reasons for not lowering the screening age were that cervical cancer is very rare in women aged under 25; there is no clear evidence of an increase in the incidence of cervical cancer following the change to the screening age limit in England; no new scientific evidence was available to support the reintroduction of screening in women aged under 25; there is evidence that treatment following screening in this age group can lead to an increased risk of subsequent premature births, increasing the risk of babies dying or having disabilities; and one in three young women screened aged under 25 would have an abnormal result, as opposed to one in 14 for all women screened, and there is evidence that this causes distress and anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="b.720W.2/4">The cervical screening age range is a standing item on the agenda of ACCS meetings. The ACCS reviews all new research to assess its significance to the screening programme and makes recommendations to Ministers accordingly.</p>

The group included public health experts, scientists and engineers with specialist knowledge of instrument decontamination, including protein removal. The HTM proposes a progressive approach to improving quality and ensuring effective risk reduction for patients and staff. We are confident that the validation processes used were exhaustive and fit for purpose. Drafts of the guidance were shared with an expert steering group and the British Dental Association. Comments from the peer review were considered and changes made where appropriate.

	<p pid="b.722W.0/1">The Department has issued guidance to the profession in Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 01-05: &quot;Decontamination in primary care dental practices&quot;, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. This describes both essential quality requirements that all practices need to have in place as well as best practice requirements that all practices should aspire to reach. The Department, with the Infection Prevention Society has issued a self-assessment audit tool to help practices assess their own level of compliance against the guidelines. A CD ROM version of the audit tool will also be distributed to practices very shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.722W.0/2">All primary care dental practices will need to be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) by April 2011. The standard of local decontamination procedures within the practice is an integral part of the Health Care Acquired Infections (HCAI) Code of Practice, and compliance with the Code is included in the essential registration requirements of practices with the CQC.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.5/1">The 2010 spending review recognised the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society, including disabled people. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. Our assessment of the settlement is that, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, there is enough funding available to enable local authorities both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/2">We have achieved this in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/3" class="indent">The national health service will transfer some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will rise to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15, and will promote improved joint working between the health and social care systems. The new NHS operating framework set out specific primary care trust (PCT) allocations that they will transfer to local authorities for spending on social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. PCTs and local authorities will need to work together to agree jointly appropriate areas for social care investment, with a shared analysis of need and a common agreement on the outcomes to be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/4" class="indent">Additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.5/5">Decisions about access to social care services are taken by local authorities. We would expect authorities to assess the impact of their decisions on those with disabilities.</p>

Core features are the establishment of a new body, Public Health England, as part of the Department, and the return to local government of public health leadership and responsibility. There will be ring-fenced public health funding from within the national health service budget. A copy of the White Paper has already been placed in the Library.</p>

The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase>. For sexual health, we propose that local authorities will be responsible for commissioning comprehensive open-access sexual health services using funds from the ring-fenced public health budget. These arrangements will also cover sexual health services for young people.</p>

	<p pid="b.732W.6/1">HM Treasury consider ex-gratia payments to be a form of special payment. HM Treasury's definition includes personal injury claims that are settled out of court. Information about local ex-gratia payments made by the national health service to patients to avoid litigation is not held centrally. Local NHS bodies record 'losses and special payments' in their consolidated accounts and these will include all ex-gratia payments, not just those paid to patients or to avoid litigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.6/2">The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) records data held centrally specifically on ex-gratia payments made for clinical, employer and public liability claims settled out of court. As the NHSLA settles the vast majority of its claims this way, they fall under HM Treasury's definition of ex-gratia. Data provided by the NHSLA will cover payments to patients, although some will be made to families/dependants, employees and visitors.</p>
	<p pid="b.732W.6/3">Data on actual payments made each year can be provided only at disproportionate cost. The NHSLA has therefore supplied data in the following table which shows the total amount of damages paid on claims settled out of court where the claim was closed between 2007-10. It should be noted that some actual payments for these claims may have been made in earlier years to when the claim was closed.</p>

	<p pid="b.740W.6/1">Shale gas exploitation in other countries suggests that the impact on global warming from the extraction and use of this resource can sometimes be higher than that of conventional gas, because of increased drilling density and well site operations. This impact is expected to vary more between individual shale gas exploitation operations than it does between individual conventional gas fields, making it relatively location dependent.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.6/2">In the UK the first exploration well designed to evaluate shale gas potential is currently drilling west of Blackpool.

As time was the key driver for locating staff nearer to the QAH, accommodation in Fort Blockhouse was not considered: the time taken and distance travelled to get staff to and from work from Fort Blockhouse was well outside Ministry of Defence policy on Tri-Service accommodation.

	<p pid="b.746W.5/1">British Forces Post Office (BFPO) mail to Belize is transported through the USA and was therefore temporarily affected by the security restrictions resulting from the toner cartridge bomb alert in early November 2010. The backlog was cleared and deliveries made to Belize in time for Christmas. As a result of this incident the USA has imposed additional restrictions of the carriage of mail weighing more than 500 grams.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.5/2">Delivery times for BFPO mail/parcels to all destinations are regularly monitored and the average time for delivery from anywhere in the UK to Belize through the BFPO system is currently between four and 11 days, largely dependent on whether the package weighs more than 500 grams.</p>

	<p pid="b.756W.11/5" class="indent">We have not assessed the impact of the change in VAT on businesses or levels of employment. However, the OBR applied a range of fiscal multipliers to help inform its judgement on the impact of VAT on aggregate demand in the economy. These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document. A figure of 0.6, for example, means that a measure which has a direct effect of raising revenue by 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to reduce aggregate demand in the economy by 0.6 per cent in the short run.</p>
	<p pid="b.756W.11/6" class="indent">The interim OBR's June 2010 Budget forecast and the OBR's November forecast assumed that the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent would reduce the level of real GDP in 2011/12 by around 0.3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.763W.11/2"><i> </i>Under our proposals from academic year 2012/13-and for the first time-all part-time undergraduate students in England will be eligible for loans for their tuition costs provided: they are personally eligible in terms of residency; they do not already hold a qualification which is at an equivalent or higher level to the qualification for which they now intend to study; they are studying on a course which is designated for support. These criteria match those for full time studies. The further criterion for part-time students is that they should be studying at an intensity rate which is at least one-quarter of an equivalent full-time course. Currently 60,000 part-time students receive tuition grants. Under our proposals we estimate 175,000 part-timers may be eligible for loans. No eligible part-time students will have to pay for their tuition costs up front and they will not have to begin repaying until they are earning at least &#163;21,000, the same repayment threshold as we propose for full-time students.</p>

	<p pid="b.764W.2/5">Learners will be able to select training and qualifications designed and valued by business, and which are offered by a broad range of autonomous providers competing with one another.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.2/6">Greatest support from the state will be given to those who need it most. But we will expect learners and employers to share responsibility by contributing towards the costs of intermediate and higher level training.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.2/7">There will be a new role for employers in shaping the skills system. We need employers to get involved, to shape the system and utilise the skills of their work force, so that they get the most from their investment. We will support them in implementing proposals they make for raising their game on skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.764W.2/8">We will increase competition between providers to drive up standards, and encourage greater diversity of provision. And we will free providers from bureaucratic control and centrally determined targets and radically simplify funding so they can respond to the needs of business and learners.</p>

It will be replaced, from September 2011, with an enhanced discretionary learner support fund which will be managed by schools, colleges and training providers.
