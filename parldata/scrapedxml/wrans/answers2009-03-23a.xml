Consequences will be most severe in Darfur, but will also affect humanitarian and recovery and development assistance throughout north Sudan particularly in conflict-affected regions of the transitional areas and the east. As well as increased risk of disease, malnutrition and deaths, lack of water, food and shelter could increase insecurity, particularly in large, volatile camps like Kalma (90,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and Gereida (130,000) in south Darfur. Civil disturbances and mass movement of IDPs seeking help could quickly take the situation out of control.</p>

	<p pid="a.3W.3/1">The Tebbit Review recommended that the scope of the activities of the Office of the Clerk of the House should be expanded to embrace planning and performance management functions, and an increased communication co-ordination role; that its staffing numbers should be increased; and that it be renamed the Office of the Chief Executive to reflect its larger role.</p>
	<p pid="a.3W.3/2">In December 2007, immediately before the departmental restructuring which followed the Tebbit Review, there were 12 staff (11.6 full-time equivalent) in the Office of the Clerk of the House. There are currently 21 staff (20.2 full-time equivalent) in the Office of the Chief Executive. A breakdown by band is given in the following tables. Most of the increase in staff is accounted for by the transfer to the OCE of functions from other Departments (principally internal audit, risk management and internal communications), so there has not been a corresponding increase in the total number of staff in the House Service.</p>

Although there is no statutory requirement for local residents to be contacted ahead of schemes taking place within the highway boundary, and it would be impractical and costly for the Highway's Agency to undertake to contact individual households for each one of these schemes, the Highways Agency seeks to ensure that public involvement takes place in a proportionate manner.</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.6/1">From 2001 to 2007, HMG funded its conflict related programme activity through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) and Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP), owned and managed tri-departmentally by DFID, FCO and MOD. By bringing together the UK Government's development, diplomatic, and defence interests and expertise this ensured a coherent response to conflict prevention. In 2001, all three Departments contributed funds to form these pools (&pound;2.1 million disbursed by the FCO; &pound;14.4 million by DFID and &pound;3.2 million by MOD), but in subsequent years funds have been allocated directly from HMT. The Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) was set up in April 2008 as a successor to the former Global and Africa Conflict Prevention Pools, focusing activity through regional programmes where the UK can have its biggest impact, and through thematic programmes to deal with cross-cutting conflict prevention issues. The CPP commands a total of &pound;112 million in 2008-09 of which the Africa Conflict Prevention Programme is forecast to spend &pound;68 million. From FY 2001-02 to 2007-08, HMG has spent approximately &pound;341 million through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool. This is broken down by year as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.14W.5/1">The Government place the highest priority on the safety and security of our servicemen and women while on operations. If the arrival of a new piece of equipment to theatre is delayed, then commanders on the ground will either continue using existing equipment coupled with the appropriate tactics, techniques and procedures until the new capability is available; or, adapt operations to achieve the same aim while avoiding exposing troops to disproportionate risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.14W.5/2">It should be noted that, even once new equipment has been delivered, technology alone cannot guarantee the safety of deployed troops.

	<p pid="a.18W.5/1">All training delivered by the MOD in Sudan is to members of the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs), which are made up of equally sized elements of the armies of North and South Sudan. JIUs were established as a peace-building measure under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that ended the war between North and South. The CPA mandates members of the international community who supported the peace process, including the UK, to provide training and other support to the JIUs.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.5/2">The MOD does not, however, directly fund any training in Sudan; instead the UK training programme is financed by the tri-departmental Conflict Prevention Pool. It has included the training of the JIUs' first de-mining Company, delivered by the International Mine Action Training Centre in Kenya, a wide range of individual courses conducted at military establishments in the UK as well as conflict resolution workshops and English language training conducted in Sudan. Specific information for 2003-04 and 2004-05 is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost, but is assessed to have been very low as we then had no Defence Section in Sudan.

(103,590 hectares) of the land in Helmand with the potential for agriculture was devoted to poppy cultivation in 2008. In their winter survey, UNODC has indicated that there may be a slight decrease in the cultivation of poppy in Helmand in 2009.

	<p pid="a.27W.5/1">To date the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has secured several contracts with the Bank of England which provide the full cover allowed for our forecast US dollar and euro net exposure up to February 2010, and partial cover over the intervening months to January 2011. HM Treasury have limited the amount of cover we can purchase to a maximum of 80 per cent. of our net foreign exchange exposure at overseas posts, but up to 100 per cent. for known commitments to international organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said many times that the UK would like to have a positive and constructive relationship with Iran&mdash;a relationship which is based on mutual respect and is not a prisoner of history. We believe that we have important shared interests in Iran's neighbourhood, including stability, security and economic development in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, we and the rest of the international community have significant and legitimate concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, its activity in the region, and its repression of its own people. Iran must address these if our relationship is to move forward. The Iranian authorities are also responsible for unacceptable harassment of our staff in Tehran, both UK based and Iranian&mdash;pressure which has forced the British Council to suspend its operation in Iran, and which obstructs the legitimate activities of our embassy. We have raised this with the Iranian authorities on numerous occasions, and we regret that they have done nothing to address this.</p>

The resolutions expressed the conviction of the majority of UN members that the use of the death penalty undermines human dignity; recalled that there is no conclusive evidence of its deterrent value; and noted that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable.</p>

	<p pid="a.33W.0/1">While there have been improvements in the human rights situation in Nepal since the end of the conflict in 2006, significant challenges remain to the promotion and protection of human rights caused by the absence of rule of law. Despite the government of Nepal making repeated commitments to promoting respect for human rights, they have made limited progress. It has taken steps towards the proportional inclusion of minorities in all organs and at all levels of the state. It has also increased the budget for the national human rights commission, and has discussed the introduction of a bill to establish a truth and reconciliation commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.0/2">The continuing impunity for past and current human rights abuses remains a key concern. It has encouraged a lack of respect for the law which encourages people to turn to violence to resolving disputes. Poor public security, particularly in the Terai (plains), where there is a proliferation of armed groups, is a major obstacle to improving human rights in Nepal. We are also concerned at the increase in intimidation and violence against journalists which is leading to self-censorship by journalists. Political interference in police investigations is commonplace and we continue to receive reports of torture in police custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.33W.0/3">Our embassy in Kathmandu closely monitors the human rights situation. During the past year we have raised our concerns, including at ministerial level, about attacks on the media, freedom of expression and movement, excessive use of force by the security forces, and the need to discharge minors from the Maoist People's Liberation Army. We will continue to engage with the government of Nepal both bilaterally and in conjunction with the EU, other international partners, and the Office of the High Commissioner on human rights to urge it to meet the commitments they have made to uphold and promote human rights. Our Embassy is also supporting the efforts of civil society to combat impunity, through advocacy, training and work on legislative reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.33W.6/1">While there is no doubt that North Korea imprisons large numbers of people for their political and religious beliefs, there are no reliable figures available for the number of political prisoners in North Korea. Different non-governmental organisations produce various figures based on the observations of defectors, but these are difficult to verify, and often out of date. That is why we have consistently pressed North Korea to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea access to their country.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.5/1">There are no restrictions specific to mail or gifts originating in the UK. Incoming mail destined for the Occupied Palestinian Territories must be routed via Israel. It will be subject to security checks. Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff, living in Gaza and the West Bank report that it will take small envelopes several weeks to arrive from an international address. Some of this period of time may also be accounted for by the inefficiency of the Palestinian Authority's own mail service.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.5/2">For parcels sent to the West Bank, the security checking process can last up to two months and many West Bankers now arrange for larger mail items to be sent to addresses in east Jerusalem and then delivered on by friends or relatives. Parcels destined for Gaza can be held up for several months and few individuals or organisations inside Gaza would now use this as a means to send items into the Gaza strip.</p>

	<p pid="a.44W.2/1">While we have yet to enter into formal discussions with the European Commission on the review of EC Regulation 1/2005 on the welfare of animals during transport, as it has yet to publish formal proposals, we have responded to early opportunities presented by the Commission to comment on a draft options paper. The UK provided a set of generic principles which was drawn up in close consultation with the Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer in Wales, the Scottish Government Rural Directorate and the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland. We fully support the Commission's initiative to review key elements of the Regulation and welcomed the opportunity in the early stages of the review process to express our opinion on the Commission's policy options.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.2/1">The DEFRA-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) works to develop new markets for waste in the UK. WRAP has supported several companies, through a range of financial and technical assistance mechanisms, in developing new and existing plastic recycling businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/2">Since its creation, WRAP has provided over &pound;3.1 million in capital grants to plastics recycling businesses. In the next five years, these will divert a total of over 270,000 tonnes of plastic waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/3">Plastic bottle recycling has significantly expanded in recent years, with around 132,000 tonnes of plastic bottles collected and recycled from UK households in 2006. WRAP'S focus has therefore moved on to mixed plastics (plastic packaging other than plastic bottles).</p>
	<p pid="a.53W.2/4">WRAP has undertaken trials with a number of technologies, with the aim of understanding the best ways to handle mixed plastics from an environmental, economical and technological perspective. The programme has investigated three main areas: collection, reprocessing, and end markets. The trials showed clearly that it is economically viable to recycle the vast majority of the mixed plastics we currently send to landfill, and there are clear environmental gains in doing so. WRAP is now working with councils and industry partners to deliver mixed plastics reprocessing in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.3/2">This detailed work showed that there was scope to reduce the delivery risk and improve the value for money offered by the &quot;Up2U/First Steps&quot; scheme. I have now approved a revised deal between the HCA and London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q). This deal will involve the properties that were to be covered by the &quot;Up2U/First Steps&quot; scheme being delivered through the Government's existing intermediate market products (including Rent to HomeBuy, Intermediate Rent and New Build HomeBuy).</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.3/3">As a result of this deal, all of the properties that were to be covered by the &quot;Up2U/First Steps&quot; scheme will now be made available at completion as affordable housing and will not instead be sold outright.

	<p pid="a.72W.8/1">There are no planning powers conferred on local authorities specifically in relation to the development of houses in multiple occupation in areas identified as tourist destinations. But local authorities may make use of their general planning powers in such areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.8/2">The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) is intended to be a deregulatory mechanism which removes the need for planning permission between certain specified uses by grouping into classes land uses which have similar implications for local amenity. The Use Classes Order defines dwelling houses under the C3 use class as houses used by a single person, any number of persons living together as a family, or by no more than six people living together as a single household.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.8/3">HMOs do not fall within any of the specified use classes, and therefore are &quot;sui generis&quot; (in a class of its own) in terms of use. Planning permission is needed for a change of use to or from a sui generis use. Therefore, planning permission would be needed for a proposed change of use from a private dwelling to a HMO, or if such is deemed to have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.8/4">The current definition of a dwelling house implies that up to six people living together as a single household should not, prima facie, be considered as a HMO. However local planning authorities may determine individual cases on the basis of &quot;fact and degree&quot; and may decide that a dwelling with fewer than six people living together other than as a single household constitutes a HMO.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.8/5">In addition, local authorities have powers under the Housing Act 2004 to licence certain HMOs. These measures concern the condition and management of these properties and, again, are not specifically related to areas identified as tourist destinations.</p>

	<p pid="a.73W.2/2">The Government remain committed to tackling the problems arising from rogue landlords providing private rented accommodation to illegal migrants. Having consulted the Local Government Association and the professional local government regulatory services body LACORS, we concluded that there are more effective alternative ways of promoting joint working between United Kingdom Border Agency officials and their local government counterparts across a broader spectrum of common interests than proceeding with the proposed National indicator 12. That includes the development of partnership working between local authorities and the new network of UK Border Agency local immigration teams, the majority of which will be in place by the end of next year. We will consider whether it would be appropriate to devise and consult on alternative indicators relating to immigration as part of the refresh of the National Indicator Set which is due to conclude in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to how many occasions on which the Child Support Agency was not able to make deductions directly from non-resident parents' benefit due to technical difficulties in the last three years it was (a) possible and (b) not possible to establish why the technical fault occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/5" class="indent">In child maintenance cases where the non-resident parent is in receipt of state benefit, the Child Support Agency may issue a request to Jobcentre Plus to make a flat rate maintenance deduction from their benefits. This automated request may initially be rejected when the information the Child Support Agency holds differs from that held by Jobcentre Plus; for example, the benefits are now being administered by a different office from where the original request was sent, or the benefits are suspended pending a decision. These reasons are in fact administrative in nature and unfortunately are sometimes perceived to be and explained as technical issues. I understand that such a misunderstanding may have occurred in relation to a constituent's case, for which I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.0/6" class="indent">In such cases, the revised request will often be accepted before affecting maintenance deductions, which are carried out bi-weekly in accordance with benefit payments. Therefore, even if a request to deduct maintenance is initially rejected for an administrative reason, this does not necessarily mean that the maintenance payment was not received by the parent-with-care on time. The Agency does not hold information on the number of rejections which resulted in a deduction being missed or the different reasons why a request may be rejected.0</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.2/2">In cases where a child's adoptive arrangement may be at risk or the child may be at risk of significant harm if their whereabouts was identified there is a facility to shield the ContactPoint record, i.e. to hide from view information relating to the whereabouts of the child. Shielding decisions should be made on a case by case basis and it would not be appropriate automatically to shield a ContactPoint record simply because a child was in the process of being adopted or had been adopted.</p>

	<p pid="a.98W.6/1">Although schools are generally safe places for pupils and staff, the Department has given head teachers a power to search, without consent, any pupil they suspect to be carrying a weapon. This increases the options available to schools, and we issued guidance in May 2007 which includes what to do when an illegal weapon is discovered: confiscating and storing the weapon, informing the police, and delivering the weapon to the police. (The guidance also advised on the existing power, announced in October 2006, to screen pupils at random.) Determining the appropriate sanction to apply is a matter for the head teacher, who has the power to permanently exclude pupils for carrying an offensive weapon, including if this is a first or 'one off' offence.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many women under 16 years became pregnant in (a) England, (b) the North East, (c) Tees Valley district and (d) Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency in each of the last 10 years. (264415)</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/5" class="indent">Available figures are estimates of the number of conceptions that resulted in a live birth and/or stillbirth (a maternity) or a legal termination.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/6" class="indent">Numbers of conceptions to women aged under 16 in England, the North East Government Office Region (GOR) and the Tees Valley district, for the years 1998- 2007 (the most recent year for which figures are available), are shown in the attached table. Figures for 2007 are provisional.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/7" class="indent">Information on conceptions is not routinely published for parliamentary constituencies. Hence figures cannot be provided for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency because of the risk of disclosing individual's information, due to small differences between the parliamentary constituency and local authority boundaries. Figures are instead provided for Middlesbrough UA and Redcar and Cleveland UA for 1998-2007, in the attached table.</p>

	<p pid="a.114W.8/6">The Government's stated policy on detention of families with children is set out in the 1998 White Paper &quot;Fairer, Faster and Firmer&mdash;A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum&quot;.

	<p pid="a.119W.0/1">The procedures the UK Border Agency has in place for the removal and deportation of all categories of immigration offenders are set out in the Enforcement Instructions and Guidance (EIG) manual available to view on the UK Border Agency website via the link below. Procedures for deportation can be found in chapters 11-15; illegal entrants at chapter 47 and those subject to administrative removal at chapters 50 and 51. This is a 'live' document which is subject to constant change.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/enforcement/">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/policyandlaw/guidance/enforcement/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/3">Appendix A of the UK Border Agency business plan for April 2008-March 2011 contains a table which shows the overall budget allocation and staffing plans for the agency for the current financial year. This document is available to view in the Library of the House and at the following website:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/businessplan/">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/businessplan/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/5">There are many staff involved, including seconded police officers, in the enforcement process across the UK Border Agency and the funding and other resources in place to support the removals process can not be disaggregated from the overall budget and resources. However, UK Border Agency plans for enforcing the immigrations laws including removing the most harmful first and the additional resources put in place to support enforcement and compliance activities are set out in the enforcement business plan, 'Enforcing the Deal', copies of which are available to view in the Library of the House and at the following web-link:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/managingourborders/enforcementbusinessplan08_09/enforcementbusinessplan08_09.pdf">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/managingourborders/enforcementbusinessplan08_09/enforcementbusinessplan08_09.pdf</a>?view=Binary</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/7">The UK Border Agency is not able to provide the average cost of a removal because there are many different factors which may or may not be involved in the cost of a case (such as detention costs, travel costs, and the cost of escorting the individual in question). We are therefore unable to disaggregate the specific costs and any attempt to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/8">However, the National Audit Office (NAO) gave a breakdown of what it costs to enforce the removal of a failed asylum seeker in appendix 2 of their report &quot;Returning Failed Asylum applicants&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>. In this they estimated the average cost of an enforced removal as being &pound;11,000. This report has since been superseded by their report &quot;Management of Asylum Applications by the UK Border Agency&quot; which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-23">23 January 2009</phrase>. This does not give a single average figure for the cost of removal but instead (on page 36 of the report) breaks it down into upper- and lower-end estimates for a range of people in different circumstances (for example, a single undetained adult who is removed after exhausting his/her appeal rights, the cost range given is between &pound;7,900 and &pound;17,000 excluding accommodation and support costs, and between &pound;12,000 and &pound;25,600 including accommodation and support costs). This report is available to view at the following website:</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/management_of_asylum_appl.asp">http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/management_of _asylum_appl.asp</a>x</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/10">There is no central pool of information on the numbers awaiting a removal/deportation decision on their case and this information could be obtained by the detailed examination of individual case records only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/11">The destination country to which the most number of people were removed or departed voluntarily from the UK in 2008 was France; this includes non-asylum cases refused entry at port (including cases dealt with at juxtaposed controls) and subsequently removed. Excluding such cases, the destination country to which the most number of people were removed or departed voluntarily from the UK in 2008 was India. This is the latest 12 month period for which published statistics are available; the information is provisional.</p>
	<p pid="a.119W.0/12">The Home Office publishes statistics on the number of persons removed and departed voluntarily from the UK, broken down by destination, on a quarterly and annual basis. National Statistics on immigration and asylum are placed in the Library of the House and are available from the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.0/1">The Government have not made any such assessment. The decision on whether to accept certain payment methods, and whether or not to charge a fee for accepting certain payment methods, is a commercial one for banks and retailers. However, in doing so, they must take account of legal obligations which are relevant to the giving of information about prices. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices which harm consumers' economic interests. In broad terms, commercial practices are acts or omissions by a trader directly connected to the supply of products to consumers. The giving of information about prices is one form of commercial practice.</p>

We have agreed new flexibilities to allow apprentices who cannot find immediate alternative employment to move into full-time further education for up to six months while maintaining their existing apprenticeship framework and maintaining their status as an apprentice. The Learning and Skills Council have advised providers of this new flexibility which allows redundant apprentices to maintain their framework for an extended period while they and their provider seek a new employer.</p>

This independence is a great strength of our world class sector. But it also means that judgments have to be made by universities themselves in developing their own priorities and sense of mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.2/1">The Government recognise that information communication and technology (ICT) training has a major role to play in helping to deliver our ambition to become a world leader in skills. With regard to ICT user skills, the recent publication &quot;Skills for Life: Changing Lives&quot; outlines how DIUS is considering with partners the development of a national strategy for ICT as a skill for life. More details will be provided shortly when the Informal Adult Learning White Paper is published. Plans for the development of digital skills more widely are being prepared with advice from sector skills councils following publication of &quot;Digital Britain: The Interim Report&quot; in January 2009 and will be presented in the final report to be published by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.2/2">With regard to Kent Thameside more specifically, it is recognised that a mismatch between skills and opportunities could be a significant potential barrier to local regeneration. The Kent Thameside Regeneration Framework has a specific objective to raise the standards of learning and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.144W.2/3">IT training will play a critical part in up-skilling local residents to take advantage of the opportunities that will become available through regeneration. There is a range of projects located in local communities across Kent Thameside aimed at raising the skills of local people. The Gateway Knowledge Alliance is part of a partnership delivering targeted IT provision with Learn IT to unemployed learners in deprived communities. It is also working as part of Employ North Kent on a SEEDA funded initiative. Starting from April 2009, the project will involve jobs-matching and the delivery of suitable courses that have been identified, which could include IT. In Dartford, a new state-of-the-art adult education centre was officially opened in February. The centre includes a new IT suite and aims to allow adults to gain the skills that employers are looking for, particularly during this economic downturn. There has been a big uptake in the number of people taking part in courses for the key employability skills of maths, IT and basic English. In Dartford alone, there has been a 20 per cent. increase in the number of people enrolling on these courses since September.</p>

	<p pid="a.145W.2/2"><i> </i>Data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) suggest that the employment rates for 18 to 24-year-olds not in full-time education have fallen slightly faster than for other age groups. However, it is too early to say that young people are or will be disproportionately affected by the current downturn, and the data may be affected by sample size fluctuations.</p>
	<p pid="a.145W.2/3">Over the last year increases in ILO unemployment have been spread quite evenly across different age groups. The claimant count, which tends to be more reliable than the LFS for looking at short-term economic trends, shows that the rise in inflows to job seeker's allowance (JSA) has also been spread evenly by age.</p>
	<p pid="a.145W.2/4">There has been an increase in the percentage of 18 to 24-year-olds not in education, employment or training from 2007 to 2008, from 14.6 per cent. to 15.6 per cent., however due to the small samples involved, this is likely to include some degree of sampling error.</p>

	<p pid="a.159W.0/1">Information has been provided on the age groupings 19 to 25 rather than 18 to 25 (in order to avoid double counting). The data have been broken down by strategic health authority (SHA) of residence and then a further breakdown of individual primary care trusts (PCTs) in London has been provided. As well as this, extra tables showing emergency admissions to hospitals have been provided, as this is the closest thing we can provide to emergency care. Hospital episode statistics datasets are not able to determine whether admissions required intensive care or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.0/2">In 2006-07 SHAs were reconfigured, with 28 SHAs merging into 10. Due to this, data for 2006-07 and 2007-08 are based on the new configuration.</p>
	<p pid="a.159W.0/3">Tables showing a &quot;Count of admissions and emergency admissions by SHA and London PCT of residences broken down by age where there is an external cause of assault by sharp object (X99) and assault by blunt object (Y00) in 2003-04 to 2007-08&quot;, have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.162W.11/2">There were 17 NHS trusts designated financially challenged in 2006-07 (financially challenged trusts (FCTs)). Long-term financial recovery plans were drawn up for these NHS trusts with the aim of returning them to financial balance while maintaining and improving services to patients. 10 of these trusts have agreed a realistic profile for surpluses going forward and repayment of their historic debt within five years and were no longer therefore designated as FCTs at the beginning of the 2008-09 financial year. One of these trusts was Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.11/3">Capital investment schemes can form part of the recovery plan at FCTs as they can deliver cost efficiency savings at the same time as improvements in patient care. In exceptional circumstances, where a trust urgently requires a level of investment that it cannot afford from its depreciation or from affordable borrowing from the Department, it can receive an exceptional allocation of capital from the Department (referred to as exceptional Public Dividend Capital (PDC)).</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.11/4">At Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS the Department has recently agreed to fund two capital schemes from exceptional Public Dividend Capital: new operating theatres at St. Michael's hospital (total &pound;5.8 million); and &pound;3.8 million to create a 'central hub' for sexual health services on the Royal Cornwall hospital site.</p>

	<p pid="a.162W.14/2">Both public capital and private finance through the private finance initiative (PFI) and NHS Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) (for acute trusts and the primary care estate respectively) is available for both small and large scale capital investment projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.14/3">Information on the amounts of public capital resources so far allocated to strategic health authorities (SHAs), NHS trusts and primary care trusts in 2008-09 has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.14/4">The allocations data provided shows the total capital resources allocated up to the end of Quarter 3 (December 2008). Allocations include capital funding for locally prioritised capital expenditure and programme capital for centrally announced initiatives and reflect adjustments for capital grants to third parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.14/5">Some organisations are showing a negative capital allocation. Negative allocations can arise where there are planned asset disposals and the selling organisation does not plan to reinvest the total value of the disposal in capital assets in the selling organisation's books in the year of disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.14/6">From resources of &pound;5.6 billion and &pound;4.8 billion of public capital for the NHS announced in the pre-Budget report (November 2008) for 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively, allocations for these years are currently being set as part of NHS trusts' and PCTs' financial plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.14/7">Private Finance in the form of senior debt and shareholder capital (equity) under the PFI and NHS LIFT initiatives is raised by private sector project companies which win contracts for schemes put out to tender by the procuring authority (i.e. an NHS Trust or PCT).</p>

	<p pid="a.163W.2/1">Comprehensive information is not available centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.163W.2/2">Local information technology (IT) expenditure reported by the national health service in the 2007-08 financial year&mdash;the latest period for which information is available&mdash;amounted to &pound;1,852 millions. This figure comprises revenue expenditure (&pound;1,517 million, including capital charges of &pound;258 million) reported through an annual national survey of IT investment, and capital expenditure (&pound;335 million), identified in NHS accounts and reported by foundation trusts. It does not include expenditure by special health authorities or central expenditure funded by the Department. The information collected does not differentiate between different elements of IT expenditure, for example on hardware or software-related costs, nor include details of the local contractual arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.163W.2/3">Contracts covering the core systems and service being provided centrally under the national programme for information technology were entered into during 2003 and 2004. The contract with Fujitsu, the then local service provider for the national programme in the south of England, was terminated in May 2008 because of the company's failure to meet key contractual milestones and to provide an acceptable remediation plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.163W.2/4">Information about the local financial and resource impact due to the implementation of computer systems are held locally by the NHS organisations involved. However, while the purpose of the new systems being deployed through the national programme is to improve patient services by delivering better, safer care to patients more efficiently, they will in fact also save money by relieving doctors and other staff of unnecessary and time-consuming administrative burdens.</p>

	<p pid="a.167W.2/2">The budget for the GP patient survey during 2008-09 is &pound;8 million, a reduction of 20 per cent. on the 2007-08 costs.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-03-23a.263703.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-03-23a.176W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="176W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/text/90323w0039.htm#0903241001873">
	<p pid="a.176W.2/1">The full average cost per prisoner at Haverigg prison has not been calculated for each year requested. This information was not until recently gathered in this format and to produce it would incur disproportionate costs. However the direct cost per prisoner at Haverigg is published in the annual accounts of Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is set out in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/2">These costs represent the direct costs only; that is expenditure accounted for at prison establishment level. The year on year figures may not be strictly comparable due to accounting changes over the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/3">For 2007-08, an overall cost per prisoner has been calculated taking into account costs met centrally by the Prison Service and the National Offender Management Service. These are primarily property costs (in particular depreciation and cost of capital) but also include some headquarter overheads and other costs met centrally. On this basis the overall cost per prisoner at Haverigg, for 2007-08 was &pound;34,815, and includes some estimation.</p>

In 2008-09, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice together allocated &pound;550,000 to support the development of Integrated Offender Management in West Yorkshire. This money was received by the Drugs and Offender Management Unit in West Yorkshire police on behalf of the multi-agency Integrated Offender Management partnership in West Yorkshire. We expect the allocation for 2009-10 to be &pound;395,000. The core funding of criminal justice agencies also supports this work.</p>

	<p pid="a.178W.6/1">Tackling prejudice and discrimination is one of the aims of offender management and it is standard practice for offenders to be advised about the implications of discriminatory behaviour during the induction process: The information requested is not available, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, in the four probation areas that make up the Yorkshire and Humberside region of the National Offender Management Service, 16,715 offenders started community or suspended sentence orders during 2006 and 18,079 during 2007. Each offender will have gone through an induction process. Section 2c.7 of the National Standards for the Management of Offenders requires probation areas to induct offenders into the sentence at the start of a community order.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.6/2">Similarly induction procedures into prison establishments require prisons to emphasise the prison policy on the Race Relations Act and establish standards of behaviour. There were 125,881 first receptions into prison establishments in 2007 and 128,986 in 2006. The data are not broken down by region.</p>

	<p pid="a.179W.2/1">For the purposes of this reply, we are taking &quot;restrictive interventions&quot; to mean the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements, Approved Premises, Home Detention Curfew and certain licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.179W.2/2">It is not possible, on the basis of information held by the Yorkshire and Humberside region or by each probation area within that region, to disaggregate and isolate from general probation activity the amount of time spent on the delivery of each of those restrictive interventions to offenders. To require this information to be collected this information would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.180W.2/1">Absconds have fallen to less than half the levels they were 10 years ago while there have been no prison escapes so far this financial year compared to 10 to 20 escapes per year a decade ago. Escapes occur when prisoners unlawfully absent themselves from custody by overcoming a physical barrier or restraint. Absconds occur from open prisons when prisoners absent themselves without needing to overcome a physical barrier or restraint. Prisoners can escape from an open prison if they are being held temporarily in secure conditions within the open prison such as in segregation.</p>

	<p pid="a.183W.2/1">While operating within an overall strategic and policy framework laundries within the public Prison Service are not managed centrally, running costs having been devolved to establishment level some years ago. As a result, relatively little information about operating costs is held centrally. To collect this information from each establishment would attract disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.2/2">In 2007-08, Prison Industries Headquarters allocated funding to establishments for industrial laundry materials and maintenance to the value of &pound;783,500. A further &pound;376,000 was allocated for capital plant replacement.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.2/3">In 2007-08 there were 43 industrial laundries together with a significant number of local launderettes.</p>

Prisons provide breakfast, midday and evening meal and a supper snack together with all condiments and beverages.
