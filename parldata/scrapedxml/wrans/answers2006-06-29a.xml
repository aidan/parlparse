	<p pid="a.523W.2/1">DFID has allocated a total of&pound;15.8 million to support public sector research on improved seed varieties, including plant breeding, over the past three years. The vast majority of research supported has been carried out overseas, with some advanced research being carried out at UK institutions, including the John Innes centre and the university of Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/2">DFID is already working with the World Bank and other donors to see how we can increase the quality and quantity of aid given for agricultural research. For example, we are working in Africa to support regional agricultural research programmes. We expect this will lead to increased grants and loans for research from the World Bank and other donors. We expect some of these funds will be used to support plant breeding and development of new seed varieties that meet the needs of poor farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/3">DFID's Plant Sciences Research Programme managed by the centre for arid zone studies at the university of Wales at Bangor allocated &pound;3.6 million over the last three years for plant breeding research with overseas partners. This included work on: resistance of pearl millet to downey mildew, nematode resistance of rice, banana and potato, aluminium tolerance in wheat, new breeding methods based on farmer participation in design and selection of varieties of rice, maize and cassava, and genetic marker assisted methods for pearl millet improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/4">DFID also provides core funding to the international agricultural research centres of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Centres vary in the proportion of their budgets devoted to plant breeding. Of the core support DFID has given to centres, over the last three years, we estimate that &pound;12.2 million has been used to support research on plant breeding and improving crop varieties for the benefit of poor people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.2/5">DFID has not undertaken, or commissioned, research into the extent of, and impact on, the role of the private sector within the global seed industry. However policy research has been carried out which examined the pros and cons of revenue generation from public plant breeding and links to the private sector. (Tripp and Byerlee 2000, <a href="http://www.odi.org.uk/NRP/57.html">http://www.odi.org.uk/NRP/57.html</a>). DFID is also supporting the Seeds of Development Programme managed by the university of Cornell. The purpose of this programme is to better understand the role of private sector in achieving agricultural growth which benefits poor people by improving their access to better quality seeds.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.5/1">DFID's assessment is that there are circumstances when the private sector can play a role in meeting the needs of poor people. This is because, in spite of extensive technical assistance, public water utilities in developing countries have found it difficult to improve their performance and outreach. This has come about for a variety of reasons that we need to understand and learn from. DFID continuously assesses and learns from examples of public and private sector participation in delivering water.</p>
	<p pid="a.524W.5/2">There are good and bad examples of both public and private service provision. The best approach often involves partnerships between the public sector, the private sector and communities. An important factor for success is effective regulation, with enforceable contracts that set out clearly what is expected. One example is a four-year public-private partnership in South Africa focusing on poor rural communities, which has brought water to more than nine million people in five provinces.</p>

	<p pid="a.529W.0/36">In terms of British Energy, a loan facility was provided to the company in 2002 to support it through its restructuring. This loan was re-paid in full with interest in December 2003 and no further drawings can be made. As a result of the restructuring which completed in January 2005, the Government have taken direct financial responsibility for BE's historic spent fuel liabilities. The following payments have been made since restructuring to meet those historic spent fuel liabilities: 2004-05&mdash;&pound;185 million; 2005-06&mdash;&pound;189 million. The Government are also underwriting British Energy's decommissioning fund to the extent that its liabilities outweigh its assets. In return the company is making enhanced payments into the fund. On current valuations, the assets of the fund exceed the liabilities.</p>

The legacy is made up of experimental facilities created 30 and 40 years ago and which were built without any consideration at the time for future decommissioning and clean up. About 80 per cent. of the total legacy costs relate to Sellafield and Dounreay&mdash;neither of which ever produced much electricity. In its approved Strategy the NDA set out its proposals for nuclear clean up which is estimated to be &pound;62.7 billion. This is the life time cost of clean up&mdash;likely to take up to 100 years plus to implement.</p>
	<p pid="a.529W.0/38">Under the 2004 Spending Review the NDA received a budget of &pound;2.2 billion for 2005-06&mdash;about half of which was to be raised by the NDA's commercial activities.

Until this point BNFL held nuclear funding assets of some &pound;17.3 billion on its balance sheet to fund future decommissioning costs.

	<p pid="a.536W.3/2">As part of the continuing process of preparing to operate the Joint Strike Fighter as a sovereign capability, Ministers and senior officials have had a wide range of discussions with US counterparts on all aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter programme. As my noble Friend, the Minister for Defence Procurement, has previously explained in another place, those discussions have raised the issue of information access and explained the UK's requirements for operational sovereignty. These detailed discussions continue and we remain optimistic that they will be successful.</p>

Our Green Paper sets out proposals aimed at achieving an employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. We will do this by reducing the number of people on incapacity benefits, by helping lone parents into work and by increasing the number of older workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.4/2">We propose to significantly reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits through a three pronged approach: reducing the number of people who leave the workplace due to illness; increasing the number leaving benefits and better addressing the needs of all those on benefit with additional payments to the most severely disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.538W.4/3">Work is still under way in relation to the proposals, and an assessment of the potential impact on child poverty will form part of this. We are currently reviewing the DWP contribution to reducing child poverty across all current and planned policies and, in the autumn, we will be setting out our new strategy for how we can make faster progress towards reaching our goal of halving child poverty by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.539W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As he is currently out of the country, I am responding on his behalf.</p>

	<p pid="a.539W.5/6" class="indent">As at March 2006, the Agency had a total 333,000 uncleared potential applications. This consisted of 66,000 old scheme applications and 267,000 new scheme applications. These figures can be found in table 1 and table 2.1 of the latest issue Agency's 'Quarterly Summary Statistics' (QSS), a copy of which is available in the House library.</p>
	<p pid="a.539W.5/7" class="indent">The following table shows the number of uncleared potential applications across both schemes for each month of the last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.539W.5/8" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared potential applications fell by 8% between January 2005 and March 2006, the Agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. The Agency therefore has a 2006/07 target to ensure that, by March 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25 %.</p>

	<p pid="a.540W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the chief executive. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Hilary Reynolds:</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As he is currently out of the country, I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what his latest estimate is of the average time it takes the Child Support Agency to bring cases from first application to assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/5" class="indent">You also asked how many and what proportion of eligible parents received their first payment from the Child Support Agency within the time limit of six weeks in each month of the last year for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/6" class="indent">As at the end of March 2006, of those cases that progressed to calculation since the introduction of the new scheme, the average time from first contact to calculation was 181 days (26 weeks). Of such cases, 24 per cent received a calculation in less than 6 weeks; 48 per cent between 6 weeks and 6 months; 16 per cent between6 months and a year; and 12 per cent took more than a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/7" class="indent">It should be noted, however, that the Agency does not regard an application as being cleared once a calculation alone has been carried out, but only once collection arrangements have been agreed with the non resident parent. Additionally, since not all Child Support Agency applications result in a calculation, an application is also defined as cleared if the case is closed; the parent with care is identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case as opposed to a new application.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/8" class="indent">As of the end of March 2006, for all cases cleared since the introduction of the new scheme, the mean average time taken to process a new-scheme application from the date of first contact to clearance, as defined above, was 204 days (29 weeks). Of those cases cleared, 25 per cent did so in less that 6 weeks; 41 per cent between 6 weeks and 6 months; 17 per cent between 6 months and a year; and 17 per cent took more than a year. These figures exclude 126,000 applications that came through the Jobcentre Plus interface and which have been cleared, but for which insufficient management information exists to enable age at clearance to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/9" class="indent">The Agency does not have a time limit for the time taken for a parent with care to receive their first payment. Information regarding the number and percentage of cases receiving a first payment within six weeks or longer is attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/10" class="indent">Once a case has received a calculation, a method of collection must be agreed with the non-resident parent and set up by the Agency which, in the cases of a Direct Debit or a Standing Order, may take a few weeks. The day on which payment is due from the non- resident parent is then specified by the Agency having taken in to account the date of any other income payable to the non-resident parent, which may result in a delay of up to 4 weeks to make payment to the Agency. The Agency then has to process the payment from the non-resident parent and make payment to the parent with care.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/11" class="indent">Delays may occur if a non resident parent does not comply. For an employed non-resident parent the Agency can then impose a Deductions from Earnings Order (DEO). Where this occurs, the Agency must contact and liaise with the employer to set up the DEO, wait for the subsequent payment from the employer, which in itself can take over 20 days, before money is available to be paid to the parent with care.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/12" class="indent">The elapsed times between a payment request by the Agency and actual payment by the non resident parent mean that, it is unlikely that it would be possible for many parents with care to receive maintenance payments within 6 weeks of their first contact with the Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/13" class="indent">The Agency published its 2006 Client Charter on 28th April 2006. This sets out the minimum standards of service which we aim to meet in future for each of our main business areas. The first three service standards which relate to first contact and payments are attached.</p>

Figures for 2005/06 will be available when the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts are published. A change in accounting policy proposed by the Department for Work and Pensions, will lead to a restatement of 2004/05 expenditure reported in the Agency's annual accounts. This reflects the incorporation of costs associated with the Modernisation Programme in the accounts of individual Agencies rather than charging such costs directly to the central Departmental Resource Account. It is expected that the restated 2004-05 figure will increase expenditure to around &pound;425 million. Costs for 2005/06 will be prepared on the same basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.544W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mr. Stephen Geraghty. He will write to the hon. Member with the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Hilary Reynolds:</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive. As he is currently out of the country, I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many complaints were made to the Child Support Agency in each year for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/5" class="indent">The volumes of complaints received direct from clients, their representatives and MPs to the Child Support Agency or to our Ministers, for which information is available, are in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/6" class="indent">It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular whilst the volume of stage 1 written complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002-03 and 2003-04, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/7" class="indent">It should also be noted that the volume of complaints has stabilised. In the twelve months up to March 2006, the Agency received a total of 55,000 complaints. This compares to 55,000 for the 12 months up to May 2005 (the earliest period for which comparable data for total numbers of complaints received is available).</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/8" class="indent">Further, to put the attached figures into context, the 55,000 complaints received in the 12 months to March 2006 represent less than 4% of the 1.5 million cases dealt with by the CSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.2/9" class="indent">I hope you find this answer useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.549W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the key performance metrics are for measuring the success of the EDS contract with the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/5" class="indent">In August 2005, the Department realigned its IT contracts with Electronic Data Systems (EDS), including that covering the Child Support Reforms (CSR), into the Standard Services Business Allocation (SSBA). The realigned contract is intended to deliver industry standard services at market competitive prices to the Department as a whole including Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/6" class="indent">Under the SSBA, EDS is required to meet contractual levels for live operational services across a full range of industry standard measures. The key criteria on which EDS' performance is measured in respect of CS2 (the principal IT system used by the CSA) are:</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/7" class="indent">The level of system availability (where the current target is 99.2%, rising to 99.6% over time);</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/8" class="indent">The level of desktop infrastructure availability (where the current target is 99.2%, rising to 99.4% over time);</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/9" class="indent">Accuracy and timeliness of payments to parents with care (where the target is 100%).</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/10" class="indent">The Department is entitled to financial remedies if these targets are not met. In addition, the Department can benchmark EDS services against external industry comparators to help achieve ongoing performance and value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/11" class="indent">The general contract realignment included resolution of outstanding CSR contractual issues with EDS. As part of this agreement, EDS is required to deliver a staged programme of work to fix agreed defects on CS2. The Department is monitoring delivery of this programme to planned milestone dates and to agreed testing acceptance and implementation quality criteria. Once all the relevant services have been transformed, application reliability, which affects processing times, will also become a contractual service level.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.2/1">We have always said that we would not consider transferring the bulk of the old scheme cases onto the new scheme until the new scheme was working well.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.2/2">Child support legislation allows an old scheme case to transfer to the new scheme where an old scheme case has prescribed links to a new scheme application.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.2/3">There is no policy for converting cases back to the old scheme. But where a re-application for child support maintenance is made within 13 weeks of an old scheme application ceasing, &quot;linking rules&quot; will provide for the new application to be assessed under old scheme rules.</p>

The minimum level of income pensioners are expected to live on has increased by a third in real terms since 1997.

Pensioners are now less likely to be in low-income than younger people, on an after housing costs basis. Information on the numbers of pensioners in low income is not available at constituency level.</p>

	<p pid="a.558W.3/1">The Work Search Premium (WSP) pilots are running in eight Jobcentre Plus districts. Lone parents participating in the pilots are paid a &pound;20 a week premium for a maximum of 26 weeks to help with the costs associated with searching for work. Participation is voluntary and certain eligibility criteria must be met. Participants agree to undertake intensive work search and will also be entitled to help with the cost of formal childcare while undertaking work search activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.3/2">The evaluation of the pilots aims to assess the long and short term effect of the pilots on lone parents and movements off benefit and into work. It consists of a quantitative impact assessment which will estimate the net impact of the WSP pilots on patterns of flows off Income Support and other working age benefits like jobseeker's allowance, as well as other outcomes like entry into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.3/3">The first published report, which we expect to publish in the autumn, will use 12 months of programme data and will examine the impact of the WSP on those lone parents already claiming benefit at the time of introduction of the pilot. A report covering 30 months of data will be published in autumn 2008, and one covering 48 months of data will be published in spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.558W.3/4">In addition, qualitative evaluation will explore the impact of the pilots on the attitudes, motivations and responses of eligible lone parents, and examine the effectiveness of delivery. This will include interviews with lone parents and Jobcentre Plus lone parent advisers. We expect this report to be available in spring 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.0/1">The Energy Efficiency Innovation Review, published jointly by Her Majesty's Treasury and DEFRA last December, assessed the barriers to the increased take-up of energy efficiency measures.

Further information can be found on the DEFRA website:</p>

	<p pid="a.560W.8/2">It is not possible to define research specifically in the context of the above regulations; indeed, it is not deemed necessary to do so. My Department, in collaboration with other funding bodies, seeks to facilitate investigations that will further scientific knowledge on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) but has to take into account the likelihood of success, scope for sound interpretation of data and relevance to policy needs before funds can be committed. Investigations that are specifically addressed by the above regulations and which are statutory obligations would normally be classed as surveillance, namely investigations that determine the existence of TSEs in individual animals or targeted populations. Research and surveillance are complementary, and evidence arising in one area inevitably impacts on the other.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.2/1">The specification for the new South Western franchise has been developed to build upon the current franchise operation. The future levels of forecast demand have been based on standard rail industry modelling assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/2">A new and improved service will operate between Salisbury and Romsey via Southampton Central and Southampton Airport Parkway, replacing the Romsey-Totton service via Eastleigh. The new service will create a regular half-hourly Salisbury-Southampton service, create new travel opportunities between Salisbury and Southampton airport, and allow stops to be made at Dunbridge and Dean.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/3">In addition, services in South Hampshire and Dorset have been enhanced to provide a second train each hour through to Weymouth from London, and cross-Bournemouth services to be improved.

	<p pid="a.563W.2/4">Franchise replacements are not vehicles for significant infrastructure investment. However, they do need to consider infrastructure schemes that have committed funds to enable their delivery, and the South Western franchise process has adhered to this approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.5/1">The Government's strategy to reduce child poverty was set out in the 'Child Poverty Review', published in July 2004. It consists of:</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.5/2" class="indent">financial support for families, with more support for those who need it most, when they need it most;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.5/3" class="indent">work for those who can, helping parents participate in the labour market;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.5/4" class="indent">tackling material deprivation;</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.5/5" class="indent">delivering high quality public services that improve children's life chances.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.5/6">Across the UK, these measures have helped 700,000 children out of poverty, since 1998-99. Tax credits are benefiting more than 420,000 families in the West Midlands region, and in Coventry South claimant unemployment has fallen by over 30 per cent. since 1997.</p>

	<p pid="a.580W.5/4" class="indent">The law provides for the registration officer who has custody of the death register containing the relevant record to make a correction. The register is kept by the registrar of births and deaths until all the entries in the register have been completed (there are usually 300 entries in a register). Once the register is filled it is deposited with the Superintendent Registrar for the district, who then assumes responsibility for correcting any ofthe records it contains. A certified copy (or certificate) is a copy of the entry in the register and must be a true copy of that entry. If an entry in a death register is corrected a certified copy of the corrected entry may be issued by the person with custody of the register.</p>

	<p pid="a.582W.6/6" class="indent">Using data based on the above analysis the median household disposable income for 2004/05 was &pound;20,398.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.6/7" class="indent">Looking at table 14, appendix 1 (page 20), the mean household disposable income for 2004/05 was &pound;25,360 per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.6/8" class="indent">The article does also show the means for various other definitions of income, such as gross income. However, the analysis does not show the medians for these other definitions of income. These medians can be obtained on request.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.6/9" class="indent">The analysis is based on an &quot;equivalised&quot; household disposable income distribution. &quot;Equivalised&quot; household disposable income distribution is a process that adjusts household income to take into account the different size and composition of households.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.6/10" class="indent">Using table 14 in appendix 1 (page 20) from the above analysis, the lower limit of the top decile for household disposable income was &pound;40,385 per year (2004/05). An equivalent figure for household earnings has not been provided as this is only one part of income and would show a large variation of earnings within the top decile (and other deciles).</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.6/11" class="indent">This detailed analysis is based on the Expenditure and Food Survey, which has a sample covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>

The most recent report (Neighbourhood Renewal Unit Research Report 23) stated that neighbourhood management is capable of delivering better outcomes for deprived areas, and is a valuable tool that deserves to be developed and adopted more widely. Planned future research will address more directly the costs and benefits of the programme, though it should be noted that quantifying the impact of neighbourhood management is made harder because it works by influencing existing service providers rather than delivering and funding new services and projects directly.</p>

Where termination of a contract is necessary this should be done on the basis of the terms within that contract and any further legal advice the commissioner may need.

This is unless the contractor is of the opinion that orthodontic treatment should be provided to a person who does not have such a treatment need by virtue of the exceptional circumstances of the dental and oral condition of the person concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/2">Research has shown that IOTN grades four and five constitute about 30 per cent., of the 12 year old child population, the age most suitable for treatment. Although many orthodontic practitioners based their treatment planning on IOTN, all grades could be treated in the general dental services. It should also be noted that children do not necessarily receive orthodontic treatment within the primary care trust which they reside.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.5/2">Management information is held centrally on the number of contracts rejected or accepted by primary care trusts (PCTs). A contract may be for either a practice or an individual dentist so the information is not a guide to the number of dentists who accepted or rejected the contract. As of April, 35 contracts were agreed and three rejected in the South West Oxfordshire PCT area while 23 contracts were signed and 13 rejected in the Swindon PCT area. The signed contracts represent 98.1 per cent. and 93.1 per cent. of dental services respectively. This reflects that fact that many of those who rejected new contracts were dentists who treated relatively few NHS patients. PCTs are using the funding associated with the rejected contracts to commission additional services from other dentists.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.0/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has raised with the European Commission why its recent discussion paper on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs did not include the report from the United Kingdom expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM). The Commission has explained that the EVM work provided recommended levels for individual vitamins and minerals rather than presenting a model for establishing such levels. The annexes in the Commission document provides examples of such models.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.0/2">The FSA will consult stakeholders and independent scientific experts, and draw on the work carried out by the EVM in responding to the discussion paper on the setting of maximum and minimum amounts of vitamins and minerals in foodstuffs. The FSA will hold a meeting to discuss these points as part of this consultation.</p>

Key components of our strategy to encourage people to choose a better diet include the introduction of front of pack labelling on processed foods and restricting promotion of foods high in fat, salt and sugar to children. Work is underway to increase levels of physical activity, particularly in schools through the school sports strategy, and the setting up of sports partnerships.

They are expected to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure this is the case, including the specification of quality standards in contracts for outsourced services and the establishment of appropriate audit safeguards, but compliance remains a local responsibility. Target delivery times and other service performance standards are a matter for negotiation between parties.

This is a two year programme until April 2007. The aim of the programme is to develop national service guidelines based on research conducted by the programme. Guidelines will be published in spring 2007. The programme is intended to equip professionals and services to identify and respond to the mental and physical health effects of child sexual abuse. An expert group on child victims of domestic violence and sexual assault has been established to advise the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.649W.5/3">Juxtaposed Controls were set up as part of the strategy to reduce asylum intake and became fully operational from September 2004. The Controls are based at the Channel Tunnel, the French Seaports of Calais, Dunkerque and Boulogne and the Eurostar terminals at Brussels, Paris, Lille and Frethun. The Juxtaposed Controls counter and deter illegal migration, focusing equally on preventing clandestine illegal entrants and fraudulent use of documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.649W.5/4">Juxtaposed Controls in Calais provide a significant layer of security, increasing pressure on facilitators and racketeers who profit from attempting to smuggle people through to the UK. Facilitators are handed to the French Border Control law Enforcement Agency PAF, and appear in court soon after.</p>

	<p pid="a.650W.5/1">The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is no longer an Executive agency of the Home Office but is now a limited company, wholly owned by the Home Office. As such, it is a commercial organisation operating in a competitive environment. The information requested concerning the income generated from individual police forces could have adverse commercial consequences for the FSS if released and could serve to benefit private forensic science service providers who compete for business against the FSS, but who are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the same way. I am therefore unable to provide a detailed answer. However, it is open to the hon. Member to take up her inquiry direct with the chief executive of the FSS who, I am sure, will be prepared to provide as much information as is consistent with the principles of commercial confidentiality.</p>

	<p pid="a.657W.0/1">Details of the names, locations and funding awarded to sexual assault referral centres and rape crisis organisations are provided in the following table. This information dates back to 2001-02 for rape crisis and to 2003-04 for sexual assault referral centres. Information preceding this is not readily available. The overall purpose of sexual assault referral centres is to deliver a holistic and high quality service to victims of rape and sexual assault including medical care, counselling and support, and to provide enhanced facilities for gathering evidence. Rape crisis provides a network of co-ordination, support and advocacy for member voluntary and community organisations. Each rape crisis centre and sexual assault referral centre will have its own objectives.</p>
