	<p pid="c.494W.12/1">The number of hazards, observations, near misses and reportable incidents involving military aircraft that have been reported in each year since 2007 are shown in the following tables. They have been broken down by aircraft type. To provide further details of each of these events would, however, incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.494W.12/2">A new system for capturing all flight safety events across the Defence aviation community, known as the Aviation Safety Information Management System, was introduced in 2009. This improved system has resulted in an increase in reporting.</p>

	<p pid="c.494W.12/103">A reportable incident is described as an occurrence involving an aircraft which results in the aircraft sustaining category 1, 2 or 3 damage; or in a person receiving a minor or slight injury; or which discloses a flight safety hazard or potential hazard. As the MOD damage categorisation system does not apply to civilian registered aircraft, the occurrence is to be classed as an incident if the damage is repairable by the contractor's aircraft maintenance staff at the aircraft operating location.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.8/1">Funding for the treatment of wounded personnel at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court has been, and will continue to be, made available to match clinical requirements, including surges in casualty numbers. Our future budgetary plans assume a continuing need for additional investment in facilities and staff at Headley Court. Comprehensive financial data for the past five years are not readily available, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.8/2">Headley Court has received steadily increased investment in facilities and staff over recent years. The unit's operating costs, including estate management, are about &#163;20.4 million in the current financial year, as compared with some &#163;10.7 million (actual costs) in 2005-06. Significant new facilities brought into service over recent years, at an additional total cost of about &#163;7.5 million, include a 30-bed ward annexe (May 2007), a 58-bed staff and patient accommodation block (January 2009) and the new Centre for Mental and Cognitive Health (opened in spring 2009). For many years the Headley Court estate, which is owned by a charitable trust, has also benefited from additional funding of projects by that trust and other charities.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.8/3">In addition to funding the projects just listed, it was announced in May 2008 that an extra &#163;24 million in capital funding over the next four years for a Headley Court development programme. Over the first two years (i.e. up to June 2010) this funding has been mainly applied to the MOD contribution to the Help for Heroes rehabilitation complex, which recently came into service, and a utilities upgrade for the whole site.</p>

	<p pid="c.501W.5/1">No Minister in the Department has an allocated pool car.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.5/2">The Government's policy is that Ministers may make use of the Government Car Service (GCS) under the terms of the recently announced Ministerial Code. Ministers will be entitled to use cars from the GCS pool as needed. UK manufactured cars make up a relatively small proportion (around 16%) of the current GCS fleet, most of which comprises low carbon emission hybrid vehicles manufactured abroad. Changed rules for allocation of cars and the need to reduce the cost of operating the GCS mean that vehicle replacement is likely to be restricted in the immediate future, necessarily limiting the options for reconfiguring the fleet without incurring additional cost. For reasons of efficient and economic fleet management, it is not practical for Ministers to specify a particular vehicle or type of vehicle for a journey in a pool service car.</p>

	<p pid="c.504W.2/2">The role of War Pensions Committees (WPCs) has evolved since they were established in 1921. To ensure they remained relevant for the current ex-service community it was decided to review the structure and function of the WPCs.</p>
	<p pid="c.504W.2/3">The WPCs are now known as the Veterans Advisory and Pension Committees (VAPCs), and a pilot scheme is being established to assess an informal broadening of their role to include, most notably, support and advice in relation to the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. On completion of the pilot, in June 2011, a full evaluation will be carried out and a decision on the future role of the VAPCs will be made.</p>

	<p pid="c.509W.3/1">Since 2001, DEFRA has spent a total of &#163;2,464,622.14 on projects commissioned from the consultancy, Eunomia. Due to the wide ranging nature of work, it would involve a disproportionate cost to identify individual projects, which have included many areas of work across DEFRA. Eunomia currently has a contract with DEFRA and the Department for Communities and Local Government to draft a protocol and guidance to improve the interface between environmental permitting and planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="c.509W.3/2">Data for individual projects are however available for those commissioned by the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.509W.3/3">Table 1 lists the title, subject and cost of work commissioned from Eunomia by WRAP. These are inclusive of VAT.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.8/1">The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which was transposed in 2003, raised the bar and introduced more challenging objectives for our aquatic environment. It takes a more holistic approach to managing our waters, looking at the water within the wider ecosystem and taking into account the movement of water through the hydrological cycle.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/2">The WFD contains two key objectives: to aim to achieve good status in all water bodies by 2015 and to ensure no water body deteriorates below its current classification. Where it is not possible to achieve good status by 2015, the WFD provides two further planning cycles (2015-21 and 2021-27) to achieve that objective, although this is subject to strict criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/3">In order to achieve the objectives we are required to put in place River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) which we achieved by the deadline within the WFD.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/4">The first RBMPs were developed in consultation with interested organisations and individuals and were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-22">22 December 2009</phrase>. The plans set out how we will work towards meeting the WFD objectives and include over 8,500 investigations to be completed by the end of 2012. This will provide the evidence we require for further action within the first cycle and subsequent cycles to protect our freshwater resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/5">The actions contained within the first plans will see more than 9,000 miles of rivers in England and Wales improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.8/6">The Environment Agency protects freshwater resources by preventing deterioration from their current Water Framework Directive classifications. The Agency plans for and delivers sustainable licensed abstraction of water for economic and social needs and issues effective environmental permits to protect water bodies that receive discharges. The Agency also identifies and implements actions to improve the water environment including redressing the impacts of existing abstraction licences that damage the environment.</p>

The latest sanctions resolution makes the choice between the benefits of re-engaging on the nuclear portfolio and the cost of ignoring international opinion starker, and will strengthen the voices of those in Iran who recognise the bleakness of Iran's future if it does not change its policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.522W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated June 2010:</p>
	<p pid="c.522W.6/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning how many EU nationals working in the UK (a) entered and (b) left the country in each month since May 2004. (1888)</p>
	<p pid="c.522W.6/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes annual estimates of migrants entering and leaving the UK. The attached table provides estimates of migration by KU citizens, where the main reason is for work related reasons, for each year since 2004. These estimates are based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The IPS is a sample survey and cannot provide monthly estimates of migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.522W.6/5" class="indent">Please note that the migration estimates provided only cover those visiting or leaving the UK for periods of twelve months or more. They will therefore exclude those entering or leaving the UK for less than twelve months. Also note that not all those travelling for work related reasons will find work in the UK. Similarly, those who travel for other purposes may subsequently work.</p>
	<p pid="c.522W.6/6" class="indent">These estimates are of numbers of moves each year rather than numbers of people. For instance, an individual could enter in one year, leave just over a year later and then enter again a year after that. They would appear three times in this table.</p>

	<p pid="c.533W.5/1">As stated in the coalition's joint programme for Government, we will seek to introduce superfast broadband in remote areas at the same time as in more populated areas. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-08">8 June</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Culture, the Olympics, Media and Sport set out the Government's plans for ensuring the UK has the best superfast broadband network in Europe by the end of the Parliament. These plans include enabling access to existing infrastructure to reduce the cost of deployment. Further, the Secretary of State proposed three market testing projects schemes for superfast broadband in rural areas. The Secretary of State's full speech can be read at:</p>

	<p pid="c.533W.5/3">As a first step towards this ambition, the Government are also committed to making a service level of 2Mbps available in towns and villages still without a basic level of access. The office charged with delivering this universal service commitment, Broadband Delivery UK, will be holding an industry event in July to provide further information on the approach to meeting the 2Mbps service commitment and the market testing schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.544W.0/1">The consequentials of the &#163;6.2 billion cuts announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-24">24 May 2010</phrase> were calculated through the Barnett formula in the usual way. The consequential cut for the Welsh Assembly Government was subsequently reduced by &#163;1.4 million following confirmation of a cut to the Olympics budget, which is UK-wide and therefore not comparable for the purposes of the Barnett formula. Details of the operation of the Barnett formula were set out in the Statement of Funding Policy published by the Treasury in October 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.554W.2/2">Decisions about the number of police officers, police community support officers and other police staff engaged by each force are matters for the relevant chief constable and police authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.2/3">The Home Office has protected the front line by finding most of the savings needed from its own budgets and those of its non-departmental public bodies. As I said in my written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-27">27 May 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-05-27.12"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 12-16WS</phrase> we are confident that the savings which amount to less than 1% of expected spending in 2010-11 can be made while maintaining a front line policing service. It is for each chief constable to use their expertise and decide what makes most sense for their force, but we are clear that the savings can be achieved by driving out wasteful spending on support functions, reducing bureaucracy and increasing efficiency in key functions; leaving the front line strong and secure.</p>

	<p pid="c.554W.5/1">A senior Crown Prosecutor, expert in UK football legislation, has been deployed in South Africa, with the English police delegation, for the duration of the England football team's involvement in the tournament. Their role is to liaise with South African authorities in accordance with an agreement with the South African Ministry of Justice. This has become standard practice since Euro 2004 when uncertainty regarding fast track judicial arrangements put in place for that tournament led to criticism, both in the media and courts here, about court verdicts on England fans convicted of violent disorder. As a result the European Union Handbook on International Police Co-operation for Football Matches recommends that participating countries should consider deploying prosecutors in host countries to assist liaison and clarity. The South African authorities have put in place comparable fast track criminal justice arrangements for dealing with foreign offenders during the 2010 World Cup.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/2">A key role of the Crown Prosecutor in South Africa will be to provide authoritative witness statements regarding the judicial process and the strength of any evidence presented against any England fan convicted in a South African court. This will assist the police and courts here to determine whether or not football banning orders should be sought against the individuals convicted on their return. The Home Office is funding the prosecutor's travel, accommodation and expense costs. I will write to the hon. Member once the final costs are known.</p>

We use our financial resources, policy expertise and position as a shareholder to achieve this. For example, DFID has provided technical assistance to the MDBs to support research on the risks of climate change in developing countries, and to help governments factor these into national strategies and programmes. The Government have also been a strong voice in calling for each MDB to have a climate change strategy, agreed with their shareholders. We are working to ensure that the targets and commitments in these strategies are met, including through regular discussions with MDB staff and at the executive board of the MDBs. We are also working to ensure that projects supported by the MDBs can deliver sustainable development gains in the context of a changing climate. For example, DFID funds the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience, which aims to generate lessons to improve MDBs approach to adaptation and sustainable development in poor countries.</p>

Currently there is limited direct evidence to assess the effectiveness of IOM in reducing levels of reoffending, although it builds on offender based approaches such as local prolific and other priority offender schemes and the Drug Interventions Programme, for which there is positive indicative evidence of their impact on re-offending.

	<p pid="c.569W.14/1">Integrated offender management is a locally led strategic approach to managing offenders and as such the Ministry has not allocated any direct funding to commence new integrated offender management approaches in 2010-11 or in 2011-12. We are aware that some funding for integrated offender management approaches has been provided locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.569W.14/2">As IOM is a local strategic approach, the pace of development of IOM will be by agreement between local partners and will develop at different rates in different areas. All probation trusts without an IOM approach report that one is planned or being developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.570W.8/1">The Ministry of Justice have identified &#163;325 million in year savings to contribute to the &#163;6.2 billion across Government. Each area of the Department is contributing to the delivery of these savings (including arm's length bodies). These savings will be achieved by reducing discretionary spend, reducing capital and IT spend and stopping or deferring planned change programmes. When identifying these savings we have sought to ensure that they will not adversely affect services.</p>
	<p pid="c.570W.8/2">None of the major MoJ capital projects that are being deferred are based in Wales. Some of the reductions in discretionary spend, ICT and recruitment spend will be proportionately allocated to services in Wales.</p>
