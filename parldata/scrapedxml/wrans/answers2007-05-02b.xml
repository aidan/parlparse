	<p pid="b.1660W.25/2">The UK, France and Germany have however been instrumental in developing the EU Battlegroup concept, which achieved Full Operational Capability in January 2007. EU Battlegroups are small, mobile self-sustaining forces (approximately 1,500 troops) intended for rapid intervention in a crisis, typically in response to a UN request. There are two EU Battlegroups on standby at any time. The UK provided a national Battlegroup on standby during the first half of 2005 and will do so again in 2008. With the Netherlands we have also offered an amphibious Battlegroup in 2010. Each Battlegroup will be on standby for a period of six months.</p>

	<p pid="b.1667W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1667W.3/2">There are a range of controls in place to safeguard human health and the environment from exports of waste. All exports of waste from the UK for disposal are generally prohibited. However, certain non-hazardous wastes such as paper, glass and plastic can be exported for recovery or recycling, including to China, provided the wastes are destined for genuine and environmentally sound recovery operations. Itis in the Chinese authorities' interest to ensure that imported recyclables are tracked and properly processed in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.1667W.3/3">It is for waste producers, including local authorities and waste management contractors, to ensure that their waste is properly managed throughout the steps in the recycling chain, including at its final destination. They should assure themselves that exported waste is in compliance with the relevant environmental legislation, including that which applies to waste exports, and the duty of care. In support of this, the Environmental Services Association in the UK recently launched a compliance scheme for exports of recyclable materials, which the Government welcome. The code of practice, which is part of the scheme, includes requirements on members of the scheme to have documented control systems to demonstrate that waste recyclables are recovered under standards broadly equivalent to EU standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1667W.3/4">The Environment Agency (EA) is the competent authority in England and Wales responsible for the regulation and control of transfrontier shipments of waste. The EA has a programme of inspections ofsites exporting waste and has taken part in joint enforcement projects with other EU regulators as part of the Sea Ports Projects, which includes detailed monitoring of waste exports from the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1667W.3/5">In addition, in March 2005, DEFRA wrote to all waste collection and disposal authorities in England reminding them of their responsibilities regarding the export of waste to the EU and other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.10/2"><i> </i>International aviation is not included in the UK's climate change inventory as there is no internationally agreed method for allocating such emissions between states. In 2005 aviation represented 6.3 per cent. of UK emissions, calculated as a proportion of emissions in the UK inventory plus emissions from international aviation and shipping departing the UK. Detailed data may be viewed at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1670W.10/4">As the &quot;Future of Air Transport Progress Report&quot; (December 2006) noted, aviation emissions arising from the combustion of kerosene include carbon dioxide, water vapour, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, particulates and other compounds. These give rise to &quot;radiative forcing&quot; impacts. The total radiative impacts were estimated by the EC TRADEOFF project to be approximately twice those of carbon dioxide (excluding cirrus cloud formation).</p>
	<p pid="b.1670W.10/5">Using a radiative forcing multiplier of two, emissions from flights departing the UK contributed approximately 13 per cent. of total UK emissions in 2005. However, the figures for non-aviation sources do not include any radiative forcing attributable to them, as conclusive figures are not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1680W.2/1">The Government are aware that there are certain websites which offer to sell fake identity cards, and that there is a concern that young people may try and use them to purchase alcohol unlawfully. It is, of course, illegal to sell alcohol to under-18s. It is the responsibility of retailers to have adequate procedures in place and appropriate training for staff, if they wish to have a licence to sell alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680W.2/2">Many retailers have now adopted a 'Think 21' policy, where anyone appearing to be under 21 should be asked for identification prior to any sale of alcohol, which will prevent an offence being committed. Valid forms of identification include a passport or a driving licence with a photo. The Home Office also supports the Proof of Age Standards (PASS) scheme, which establishes a common standard for issuing the various proof of age cards that are available. PASS accredited cards carry a secure hologram which helps retailers to identify genuine proof of age cards. Following on from the success of the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns, in May 2007 we will be conducting a national Tackling Under Age Sales of Alcohol Campaign, which will test whether or not retailers ask for valid identification from potential underage purchasers of alcohol.</p>

Survey results have been supplied to main Libraries in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as those in Oxford and Cambridge. Last year, following a request from Nicola Beckford, BBC Political Programmes, Cabinet Office arranged for direct access to all main Government departments' survey results through the civil service website. DWP Survey 2004 and 2005 results can already be accessed there. Results for DWP Survey 2006 will also appear there shortly. In addition, DWP is making separate arrangements to place its staff survey results, since 2002, on the DWP website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1688W.11/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated 2<sup>(<i> nd</i>)</sup> May 2007</p>
	<p pid="b.1688W.11/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the benefits processing replacement programme (BPRP) and the customer accounting and payment strategy (CAPS). This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1688W.11/4" class="indent">BPRP was launched in November 2004 to develop a replacement for our legacy IT systems, which calculate benefit payments in Jobcentre Plus and the Disability and Carers Service. CAPS was a much earlier Departmental IT programme with the aim of developing and implementing a replacement for the order book payment system. This would have provided customers with a single payment account and a smart card to access their benefit payments through the Post Office network. There is no connection between the two programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1688W.11/5" class="indent">We expect that a substantial part of the investment in BPRP will be of future benefit to the Department. For example, software licences and a testing and development environment have already been of benefit to other IT projects in Jobcentre Plus, and will be of use as we develop IT support for the employment and support allowance. Additionally, some of the planning and design work undertaken by BPRP will be of value to Jobcentre Plus in taking forward our IT Strategy.</p>

The Department has processes in place to collect death notifications from the Office for National Statistics (for England and Wales), the General Registrar (Scotland) and the General Registrar (Northern Ireland) on a weekly basis in order to update records. However, many notifications are received from the next of kin in advance of the notification from the Registrars. As part of the Office for National Statistics Modernisation Programme, dates of death will be notified to the Department on a daily basis from March 2008which should ensure the level of notifications sentto deceased individuals by the Department is minimised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1694W.3/1">Government are dealing with the issue of affordable housing principally through the social housing development programme, the co-ownership shared equity scheme, the house sales scheme for social tenants and the housing benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.3/2">The social housing development programme last year provided an additional 1,625 new homes, funded by Government grant of some &pound;132 million supplemented by housing association private borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.3/3">The co-ownership shared equity scheme has assisted almost 19,000 households into home ownership since 1978; with more than half a billion pounds of public and private funds invested. Recent changes, such as increasing the property value limits and reducing the rental charge on the shared equity portion of the property, have made the scheme more accessible for those on low incomes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1694W.3/5">Last year, over &pound;386 million was paid to those in receipt of housing benefit. Over 70,000 of recipients were in social housing and almost 62,000 were in private housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1694W.3/6">In April 2007, I received Sir John Semple's review into affordable housing. This report made a series of practical suggestions across a range of policy areas. These proposals are now being considered.</p>

In pursuit of that duty, Ofcom have been working to raise people's awareness of how to use web browsers, electronic programme guides and other tools in order to navigate safely and effectively. They are currently developing proposals for the management of audio and visual content using content labelling and tools such as internet filtering and firewalls. DCMS and Ofcom officials have had periodic discussions about Ofcom's plans in this area.</p>

This includes the introduction of a licensing regime for all premium rate service providers operating participation TV services. In addition, Ofcom is now undertaking an inquiry into these services and will examine consumer protection issues. It will report to the Ofcom Board in early summer. In the meantime, Ofcom is investigating specific allegations.

	<p pid="b.1710W.15/1">The UK took on lead G8 responsibility for counter narcotics following the Bonn Agreement in 2001. In 2006 it was agreed that the concept of 'lead nation' was redundant, as the Afghan Government now had lead responsibility for all aspects of security sector reform. The UK therefore became Afghanistan's 'partner nation' on counter narcotics.</p>

The Enduring Relationship Action Plan 2006-07 sets out the commitments between the two Governments under the 2005 Joint Declaration. Both are available in the Library of the House. Under both the Joint Declaration and the Action Plan,the UK agreed to help Afghanistan mobilise and co-ordinate international efforts to end the drugs trade, in support of the four national priorities identified in the Afghan Government's national drug control strategy (NDCS) - targeting the trafficker, strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods, reducing demand and developing state institutions. We are spending&pound;270 million over three years in support of the NDCS.</p>

	<p pid="b.1712W.3/1">Political tension in Basra has increased following the recent withdrawal of the Fadila political party from the United Iraqi Alliance (the main Shi'a coalition). This has on occasion erupted into violence. The challenging security situation and the legacy of a distorted command economy have slowed economic development in Basra and unemployment is high. The government is working to build the capability of local institutions, including through the work of the provincial reconstruction team (PRT). Basra's elected provincial council was the first to write its own provincial development strategy&mdash;the key to unlocking central government investment. The Basra Development Forum has also been an important step towards building a closer co-operation between provincial authorities in Basra and central authorities in Baghdad to help improve the situation.</p>

Both provinces remain stable and their local authorities have shown themselves capable of managing the challenges they face. Unemployment is high in Dhi Qar, as well as in Muthanna. The Dhi Qar PRT is pursuing a range of projects, from basic infrastructure, water purification and electrical sub-stations, through to an amusement park and museum in Nasiriyah, and support for Dhi Qar artists' groups to improve the</p>
	<p pid="b.1712W.3/3">quality of life for local citizens. The Muthanna PRT is working with the provincial government to carry forward projects aimed at the province's most pressing problems: unemployment, agricultural reform, water, electricity and transport. In both al-Muthanna and Dhi Qar, the PRTs are working with the provincial authorities to build their budgetary planning capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1714W.2/1">In its preliminary conclusions on the elections published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April</phrase> (<a href="http://www.eueom-ng.org">www.eueom-ng.org</a>), the EU election observation mission reports that in the state elections, EU observers witnessed incidents of hijacking of ballot boxes. In almost one fifth of polling stations visited, attempts to influence voters were witnessed. Disorder inside polling stations was witnessed in 15 per cent. of polling stations visited during closing and counting. In almost 30 per cent. of collation centres EU observers had indications of proof that polling results were fraudulently changed. EU observers witnessed cases of fraud, such as that in five wards in Zamfara state, where no elections took place but fake results were included in the governorship elections for the wards concerned. On election day disruption, sometimes violent, of the polling and counting processes by groups of thugs was observed in several states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.2/2">In the federal elections EU observers witnessed examples of ballot box stuffing, alteration of official result forms, stealing of sensitive polling materials,vote buying and under age voting. In 14 per cent. of observed polling stations attempts were made to influence voters. Cases of vote buying were observedin Niger and Jigawa states. Disorder was observed in24 per cent. of the result transfer and collation centre processes observed. A number of fraudulent practices were observed. In many polling stations unused ballot papers were marked and stuffed into the ballot box resulting in almost 100 per cent. voter turnout, as observed in Kwara, Gombe, Edo and Niger states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.2/3">Violence was judged to have been a major concern and incidents increased as the elections drew nearer. The EU observers state that credible reports indicate a total of at least 200 people were killed in election-related incidents before and during the elections. The widespread use of thugs by a number of political parties created a significant degree of fear and intimidation. Numerous violent incidents were reported by EU observers, often involving destruction of campaign material and party offices, harassment, intimidation and violent clashes between party supporters. Political sponsorship, recruitment and use of thugs was witnessed by EU observers in Borno, Abia, Taraba, Gombe, Bauchi, Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Oyo, Osun, Kogi and Edo states. Assaults, assassination of candidates and attempted assassinations of candidates were reported in the pre-election period. A heavier security presence contributed to a reduction in violent incidents in the federal elections. But turnout of women for the federal elections on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-21">21 April</phrase> appeared to be lower than for the state elections on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-14">14 April</phrase>, which could have been due, at least in part, to violence during the state elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1714W.2/4">These observations have been confirmed in most respects by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase> who undertook an observation mission on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1716W.6/1">The UK does not have contact with the Islamist insurgents in Somalia, but we have called for an immediate end to all fighting and publicly urged all parties to commit to a truce and agree a lasting ceasefire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716W.6/2">We have repeatedly made clear that all partiesin Somalia need to reject violence and allow the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to do their job. Any differences that some groups in Mogadishu might have with the TFG should be pursued through the National Reconciliation Congress and through dialogue with the TFG rather than by resorting to violence. We condemn any attacks on the TFG, which is the only legitimate route through which governance, peace and stability can be restored to Somalia. At the same time, we have repeatedly made clear to the TFG that they must make genuine attempts to reach out to all groups in Somalia that credibly reject violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1741W.5/1">The increase in the small companies' rate of corporation tax will reduce the tax advantage for a self-employed person to incorporate and receive labour income as dividends.

	<p pid="b.1741W.5/2">The measure will increase the corporation tax paid by those who have incorporated for tax reasons and will reduce the incentive for others to engage in this behaviour. The reduction in overall tax advantage depends on income level.

Information for 2006-07 will be published as soon as possible after the end of the financial year. I can confirm that the Chancellor attended the IMFC meetings in Dubai in September 2003 and passed through Dubai in March 2007. The Chancellor visited Riyadh in November 2005 and passed through Abu Dhabi en route. The Chancellor also passed through Kuwait in November 2006. The Economic Secretary visited the United Arab Emirates in November 2006 and Paymaster General visited the United Arab Emirates in January 2007.</p>

Departmental policy is that each academy should have a local authority appointed governor and a parent governor. Academy governing bodies may also include the Academy principal (as an ex-officio member), a teacher governor (either elected or appointed); a staff governor (either elected or appointed), and may include community representatives.</p>

One strand of the project is a survey conducted in 2004 with a sample of support staff. The sample was not representative but the results were weighted to account for any bias in the sample. Amongst other things, the questionnaire asked about their pay. Support staff in special schools reported a mean hourly wage of &pound;9.06. This compared with &pound;7.90 and &pound;9.55 for support staff in primary and secondary schools respectively. Teaching assistant equivalent staff across the maintained sector reported a mean hourly wageof &pound;8.66. &quot;Teaching Assistant Equivalent&quot; includes teaching assistants, learning support assistants for SEN pupils, nursery nurses and therapists.

	<p pid="b.1760W.8/1">In 2005/06, there were 2,620 entrants (2 per cent.) with one or more A levels who had fewer than 80 tariff points from these qualifications. The figures relate to 18-year-old English domiciled entrants to full time first degree courses at English higher education institutions who have obtained one or more A levels. A grade E at A level is worth 40 tariff points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1760W.8/2">Tariff points are not to be the only factor universities consider in assessing potential to succeed in HE. In 2004, Professor Steven Schwartz conducted an independent review of admissions to HE. The report makes clear that while prior educational attainment data (e.g. 'A' levels) remains the best indicator of success at undergraduate level, equal exams results may not represent equal potential to succeed in HE and that universities can usefully consider other factors. The Schwartz Group recommended an 'holistic assessment' of applicants which included consideration of contextual factors, given the variation of learners' opportunities and circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1763W.2/2">The Department does not have these figures. Prior to 2006/07 bursaries were solely a matter for individual HE institutions and information was not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.2/3">However, we are aware that following the introduction of access agreements in 2006, Higher Education Institutions have budgeted to spend in excess of &pound;300 million on bursaries and scholarships benefiting students from low-income backgrounds and other underrepresented groups by 2010/11. The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) is responsible for the annual monitoring of access agreements from academic year 2006/07 and will report on the outcome in autumn/winter 2007.</p>

I am monitoring that situation very closely and encourage any universities forecasting a genuine underspend on bursaries to invest in other measures to improve social inclusion. However, I am also aware that the scale of the underspend has been exaggerated in some reports.</p>

	<p pid="b.1766W.9/1">In October 2006 the Government published their response to the report from the Education and Skills Committee on special educational needs (SEN). The response referred to Ofsted's report &quot;Inclusion: does it matter where pupils are taught?&quot; (July 2006) which showed significant improvements in SEN provision since publication of Ofsted's 2004 survey &quot;Special Educational Needs and Disability: towards inclusive schools?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.9/2">Ofsted's 2006 report found that there was little difference in the quality of provision and outcomes for pupils across primary, secondary and special schools. It added, however, that mainstream schools with additionally resourced provision were particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils academically, socially and personally. High quality, specialist teachers and a commitment by leaders to create opportunities to include all pupils were the keys to success but the report noted that pupils in mainstream schools where support from teaching assistants was the main type of provision were less likely to make good academic progress than those who had access to specialist teaching.</p>
	<p pid="b.1766W.9/3">The Government's response to the Select Committee noted that Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools had been asked to review progress on SEN provision in 2009/10.

Training was one of the main sub-heads under the fund. It was for local authorities to decide how to use the funding. The fund guidancein 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2002-03 specifically highlighted training in ASDs as one of the areas local authorities may have wished to support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/4">Since 2004-05 &pound;81 million for SEN has been included in the baseline for the school development grant, which all maintained schools receive, and this increased by4 per cent. per year in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The school development grant can be used for in-service training. It is a matter for individual teachers and their schools to determine their own training and development needs, including training in ASDs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain circumstances, to provide specific training in SEN.</p>

The retail price index is used as the interest rate because it reflects a range of relevant factors including mortgage interest and council tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.1769W.2/2">Student loans repayments are not transferred to the Student Loans Company. They reduce the net assets, representing outstanding loans, on the Departmentfor Education and Skills balance sheet. It is only information about repayments made by individual borrowers that is passed to the company to allow it to issue annual statements. Once that information is received by the company, repayments are attributed to each month of the tax year in which they were made by the borrower and monthly interest is calculated accordingly. This ensures that even if there is a delay in repayment details reaching the company, the borrower does not pay any additional interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.1769W.8/2">Although borrowers' accounts are only updated as an annual exercise, the total annual repayment received from each borrower is credited to their account as 12 equal monthly payments, and the interest is calculated on a daily basis on the remaining balance in that month. No borrower pays too much interest as a result of the time lag in updating their account, and nor does the Department gain any additional income.</p>

	<p pid="b.1770W.2/1">The Government's assessment, which is generally shared by other countries in the Bologna Process, is that the application in question, along with those being considered from Israel, Kosovo and the Kyrgyz Republic, does not meet the criteria for membership of the Process. This is because those criteria require member countries to have ratified the European Cultural Convention. The final decision on this issue will be taken when Ministers meet at the Bologna Process Ministerial Conference in May. The Bologna Process is not a Council of Europe initiative but an independent intergovernmental agreement.The Government have not therefore made any representations to the Council of Europe on this matter. My officials have received representations from Professor Tahir Celik, chair of the Higher Education Board in the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus', concerning his assessment of the potential economic impact of non-membership on universities in the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'.</p>

	<p pid="b.1776W.6/1">There has been growing concern about the safety of co-proxamol prompted by United Kingdom research showing that co-proxamol alone accounts for almost one-fifth of drug related suicides and is second only to tricyclic antidepressants asan agent of fatal drug overdose. Furthermore, co-proxamol is involved in 300-400 self-poisoning deaths each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/2">Many deaths involve people taking co-proxamol that had not been prescribed to them. Co-proxamol is potentially very toxic, and toxic overdose can occur with only a few tablets more than the recommended daily dose. Unlike paracetamol there is very limited opportunity for effective treatment of co-proxamol poisoning and sadly victims often die before they reach hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/3">As a result of these concerns, in 2004 the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) conducted a rigorous review of all the available evidence regarding the risks and benefits of co-proxamol. The review highlighted that there is a lack of evidence that co-proxamol is any more effective than full dose paracetamol, either for short term use or for chronic conditions. During the review a public call for evidence on the risks and benefits of co- proxamol was also conducted. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) wrote to a large number of organisations representing healthcare professionals, patient groups and other stakeholders. The information gathered provided no new objective evidence concerning the risk and benefits of co-proxamol.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/4">The CSM noted that previously strengthened warnings to doctors and patients on the hazards of co-proxamol had proved ineffective. After considering all the available evidence the CSM determined that the risks of co-proxamol outweigh the benefits of allowing the medicine to remain on the market and advised that co-proxamol should be withdrawn over a period of up to 36 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/5">The marketing authorisations for co-proxamol will be withdrawn at the end of 2007. Some manufacturers have already withdrawn co-proxamol and a few will phase the withdrawal until the end of 2007. This extended withdrawal period allows long-term co-proxamol users an opportunity to move to suitable alternatives. There are a number of such alternatives and the MHRA has issued CSM pain management guidance to help doctors find the best options for individual patients. This is available on the MHRA's website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/6">The MHRA recognises that there is a small group of patients who are likely to find it very difficult to change from co-proxamol or where there is an identified clinical need; when alternatives appear not to be effective or suitable. For these patients, continued provision of co-proxamol through normal prescribing may continue until the cancellation of the licences at the end of 2007. After this time there will be provision for the supply of unlicensed co-proxamol, on the responsibility of the prescriber.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/7">The MHRA has met with Arthritis Care, the British Society for Rheumatology, the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society and the British Pain Society to discuss the withdrawal of co- proxamol. As a result of these discussions, an article on the risk and benefit of co-proxamol was agreed for publication in the MHRA's/CSM's drug safety bulletin, 'Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance'. Arthritis Care, the British Pain Society and the British Society for Rheumatology also responded to the public call for evidence. As is usual for MHRA public consultations, the responses to consultation are available on request.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.6/8">The outcome of regulatory action to withdraw co-proxamol is being carefully monitored. It is encouraging to see that the latest figures on suicide show that the national suicide rate continued to fall in 2005 and stood at its lowest ever level. Furthermorea recent report from the national programme on substance abuse deaths based at St George's Hospital in London, shows that the number deaths involving co-proxamol had declined since the CSM took action.</p>

However, we do know that all costs associated with the wind-up of the CPPIH will be covered from within its existing funding allocation. There will be no costs associated with the wind-up of PPI forums as all associated costs for forums are contained within limited contracts between the CPPIH and forum support organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1788W.2/1">Despite the very challenging nature of the public service agreement (PSA) target we have made good progress. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.2/2" class="indent">OFCOM has announced restrictions to ensure no high fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) products are broadcast advertised to pre-school children; programmes specifically made for children; or programmes of particular appeal to children up to 16 years old.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.2/3" class="indent">The 2005-06 school sport survey found that overall 80 per cent. of pupils participate in at least two hours of high quality physical education and school sport a week, meeting our PSA target early.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.2/4" class="indent">New, tougher nutritional standards for school food have been announced and those for school lunches have been in place since September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.2/5" class="indent">We launched the Top Tips for Top Mums campaign, in March 2007, to help parents tackle the four key barriers to children eating fruit and vegetables (cost, fussy eaters, limited time/cooking skills, and a lack of structured meal occasions). This was the first in a series of campaigns using social marketing approaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1788W.2/6">Obviously tackling obesity is a complex issue, requiring action on a number of fronts and working closely with families and individuals to change behaviour. It is extremely positive that internationally our approach is regarded as good practice, informing for example, the World Health Organisation Europe Charter on Counteracting Obesity published in November last year.</p>
