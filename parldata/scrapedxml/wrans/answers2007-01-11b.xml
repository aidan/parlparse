	<p pid="b.643W.12/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has issued detailed policy guidance to Crown prosecutors dealing with both on and off street prostitution and a range of associated issues. As well as setting out the relevant law and procedure, the guidance covers public interest factors to be taken into account when considering whether to charge an individual with a prostitution-related offence. The guidance emphasises that a child prostitute should generally be treated as a victim of abuse, with the focus being on those who exploit and coerce them.</p>
	<p pid="b.643W.12/2">In addressing the advertising of prostitute services through placing cards in telephone boxes, Crown prosecutors can use the antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 in circumstances where an individual has been repeatedly convicted of the 'carding' offence. The CPS has issued comprehensive guidance on this legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.643W.12/3">The CPS recognises that prostitutes can also be victims, particularly those who are trafficked from abroad for the purposes of prostitution. Further specific guidance which focuses on trafficking for sexual exploitation has been issued to Crown prosecutors to assist in handling these cases. The guidance covers support to victims who are clearly traumatised and physically and psychologically affected by events.</p>

	<p pid="b.644W.2/1">Induced and staged road traffic accidents are perpetrated in order that substantial fraudulent claims can be made to insurance companies. In addition, offenders often make false claims to state benefit based on injuries that they claim to have suffered. This criminal activity has been found to have links with serious organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.2/2">The fact that innocent road users are effectively targeted and endangered is a matter of considerable concern, as is the significant financial impact on insurers estimated to run into hundreds of millions of pounds which is then passed on to members of the public through increased premiums.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.2/3">The Crown Prosecution Service applies the Code for Crown Prosecutors, considering each case on its merits. If, in a particular case, the evidential test is met, there is likely to be a strong public interest to prosecute as the offence will usually have been premeditated, involve a group acting together, the potential or actual pecuniary advantage will be great, and importantly, there will be a real risk or actual occurrence of physical injury to another.</p>

	<p pid="b.647W.3/1">Effective states and good governance are essential to combatting poverty, and vital to good governance is an open and transparent political system, with strong political institutions. This means that in some countries, we have provided support to political groups, including political parties, to strengthen their capacity to engage in the political process. Support is not given on the basis of whether a party is in opposition, and will generally be available to all parties who are engaging in the political process. It is not partisan and must contribute to DFID's aim of poverty reduction. It is often one part of a broader programme to strengthen political systems or as part of preparations for elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/2">DFID does not keep a central record of support to political parties but the following are some examples of support which has been provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/3" class="indent">In the Democratic Republic of Congo, UN programmes partly funded by DFID have provided capacity building support for political parties generally and women candidates in particular. This included supporting women candidates to participate in the electoral process and was available to all women candidates regardless of party.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/4" class="indent">In Zambia, DFID provided funding to train members of political parties to conduct training on electoral procedures and the role of party agents during elections. The parties then carried out the training themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/5" class="indent">In Mozambique, DFID funded training on electoral campaigning for all registered parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/6" class="indent">In Kenya, during the 2005 referendum on the Constitution, DFID, together with other donors, worked with the Electoral Commission to fund poll agents for both the yes and no groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.647W.3/7" class="indent">The Political Parties in Central America, Panama and Dominican Republic project, funded by DFID and other donors, aims to contribute to political parties responding with greater efficiency to promoting good governance and sustainable development with equity, deepening of Democracy, and the fight against poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding, what plans he has for the provision of a by-pass for Saintfield, County Down. As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/4" class="indent">The A7 Trunk Road, which links the Belfast Metropolitan Area to Downpatrick, is the main traffic route passing through Saintfield and is designated as a Link Corridor in the Regional Strategic Transport Network. Roads Service's plans for improvements to the Strategic Road Network are contained in the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan 2015 (RSTN TP), which was published in March 2005 following a period of extensive consultation. The Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland envisages a further &pound;400 million of major works schemes within the RSTN Plan period and Roads Service recently consulted on &quot;Expanding the Strategic Road improvement Programme 2015&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/5" class="indent">While consideration of the responses received in relation to the latter consultation is ongoing, I can advise that a by-pass for Saintfield was not included in the proposals. As you will be aware there are many competing demands for the resources within this funding envelope and the provision of a by-pass for Saintfield would not attract a high priority when compared with the proposals for improvements elsewhere on the Strategic Road Network.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.5/6" class="indent">However, I can advise that improvements to the A7 by way of the provision of a number of Widened Single Carriageway (2 + 1) schemes are proposed within the RSTN TP. These schemes, when completed, will provide guaranteed overtaking opportunities and improve safety on the route.</p>

	<p pid="b.651W.7/1">M42 hard shoulder running was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-12">12 September 2006</phrase> as part of the Active Traffic Management project. Operations are being closely monitored to ensure that the systems are working efficiently and that any potential issues that might compromise road safety are quickly resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.7/2">Early evaluation of the impact of hard shoulder running on traffic conditions is showing that average journey times during peak periods have been reduced. The day-to-day variability of journey times has reduced on weekdays, meaning users can plan their journeys better. There is reduced congestion on the section and average traffic speeds have been smoothed so that more drivers are travelling at around 50 mph. This has helped reduce the severity of traffic flow breakdown and improved road safety. Speed differentials between lanes have reduced, suggesting that drivers are less likely to change lanes unnecessarily, thereby improving road safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.7/3">Early indications are therefore, that the scheme is working well, but it is too early to draw final conclusions of the impact of hard shoulder running on the safety of the section. This is because motorways are generally very safe and incidents occur infrequently. Early information will be provided following collection of six months of personal injury accident data. This is expected by autumn 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.658W.12/1">I have regular discussions with Cabinet colleagues on a range of matters including the location of the Energy Technologies Institute. I understand that there are plans to establish the institute at various locations in the UK rather that at any one particular location. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Board is currently giving the matter careful consideration and will reach a decision on locations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.658W.12/2">The institute's remit is to accelerate the development of secure, reliable and cost-effective low-carbon energy technologies towards commercial deployment. The institute will play a major role in technology developments internationally in support of the UK's climate change goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.658W.12/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-14">14 September 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published a prospectus setting out the aims of the institute to attract additional private sector investors. An open information event was held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October 2006</phrase>, to attract wide participation not only by possible private sector investors, but also by those interested in collaborating in the work of the institute or hosting it.</p>
	<p pid="b.658W.12/4">The DTI has announced that it is prepared to provide .&pound;500 million, creating the potential for a &pound;1 billion institute over 10 years. The Energy Research Partnership, under the joint chairmanship of Paul Golby, chief executive of E.ON UK, and Sir David King, has committed itself to raising substantial sums of private investment. EDF Energy, Shell, BP and E.ON UK have already announced their intention to be involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.664W.2/1">Following a review of self assessment forms within HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), work has been undertaken to make the self assessment return easier for customers to complete. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/2" class="indent">The introduction of a four-page short tax return, with shorter simpler guidance, for 1.5 million people within self assessment with relatively straight forward tax affairs;</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/3" class="indent">From April 2008 a redesigned main tax return will be introduced. This new version of the tax return will be shorter for most people, and will be simpler and easier to complete because it asks for less information, has clearer explanations and makes greater use of plain English;</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/4" class="indent">Improvements to the online self assessment return to make navigation easier, improve the layout, and enhance the customer experience of completing the online return.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/5">Independent research shows that the customer reaction to the new short tax return and guide is overwhelmingly (90 per cent.+) positive in terms of how easy it is to understand, clarity and ease of use.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/6">Preliminary research from the current pilot for the redesigned main tax return shows that the majority of the unrepresented taxpayers taking part find the return easier to understand than the current return.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/7">HMRC has a public service agreement (PSA) target to provide simple processes for business and individuals to meet their responsibilities and claim their entitlements easily and at minimum cost. Results from the survey in 2005-06 indicate that the overall satisfaction of small businesses that complete their own tax returns (SA, PAYE and VAT) has already been improved to the levels required by that PSA target.</p>
	<p pid="b.664W.2/8">The latest data available (2003) on the time taken to complete a tax return are as follows:</p>

Information about the total direct liability to the Department or its sponsored bodies in circumstances of immediate termination of each private finance initiative (PFI) and public/private partnerships (PPP) contract is set out in the following table. It must be stressed, however, that information on termination liabilities can be highly speculative as such liabilities depend on the exact circumstances of a termination, and that the costs involved to the Department will depend on these individual circumstances. The termination liabilities to the Department, for example, will be different if the Department itself voluntary terminates a contract compared to termination by another party. The liabilities to the Department arising from third party termination are particularly hard to determine in advance.</p>

	<p pid="b.671W.5/2">The Government aim to discourage inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding. The Department for Communities and Local Government leads on development planning policy and, following public consultation, has just published new planning policy on development and flood risk. Planning Policy Statement 25 aims to direct development away from the areas at highest risk and ensure that, where new development is necessary in areas at risk of flooding, it is appropriate and safe, does not increase flood risk elsewhere and where possible reduces flood risk overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.5/3">Defra funds the Environment Agency to advise planning authorities on development proposals to ensure flood risk is properly taken into account but does not fund provision of measures to reduce flood risk specifically to facilitate new development. Measures needed to reduce risk for new development must be funded as part of the development, primarily through either a formal agreement under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or by way of developers incorporating effective design measures to mitigate the risks of a flood event.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.5/4">New development will often benefit from infrastructure already in place to reduce flood risk such as defences and flood warning systems; many areas at risk of flooding are already protected to a high standard.

Such measures would add to the existing EU regulations, which provide for the licensing of legally produced timber imports from countries which enter into voluntary partnership agreements with the EU. The Government has been encouraging the European Commission to publish its proposal on this subject and has supported background research into the effectiveness of possible options.

	<p pid="b.674W.2/1">The National Flood and Coastal Defence database (NFCDD) has been developed in a number of phases and was first available in 2002. Following the completion of phase 3, it is live within the Environment Agency (EA) and is available to all operating authorities with the required software and local configuration. All operating authorities will be able to use the database as they set themselves up to do so and complete their training programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/2">The data that are held in NFCDD can be categorised into two main types. Firstly, mapping data showing the areas at risk of flooding and secondly, data about the defences themselves (their type, location and condition etcetera) and the areas that benefit from those defences. The data in NFCDD will be continually updated as defences are constructed, inspected and as better information about flood risk becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/3">At present, no further phases are planned but requests for changes and improvements are kept under review and will be progressed to meet the needs of the flood and coastal erosion risk management service.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/4">The NFCDD will contain data provided by, and make information directly available to, the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the EA, local authorities and internal drainage boards (IDBs)) and the Government. Linking these organisations with one common data source gives rise to potential benefits in terms of consistent policy development and improved procurement opportunities. The data in the NFCDD can be downloaded and made available to other interested organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.674W.2/5">The NFCDD can be accessed at no charge by the Government, local authorities and IDBs who have the appropriate software. Data (other than that entered by the local authority or IDB themselves) that are downloaded for other than statutory purposes will generally incur a charge. In all instances the use of the data is subject to the issue an appropriate licence.</p>

	<p pid="b.683W.0/1">In setting the overall level of Government grant support for local authority revenue spending in 2007-08, we looked carefully with local government at the factors which increased costs in that year and the extent to which those pressures could be mitigated. The overall increase in grant of &pound;3.1 billion or 4.9 per cent. provides sufficient resources to enable authorities to deliver effective services without the need to impose excessive council tax increases. The distribution of formula and specific grants between authorities reflects the circumstances relevant to authorities. Consultation on our proposals for the funding of local authority revenue spending finished on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-05">5 January</phrase>. We are currently considering carefully all representations.</p>

	<p pid="b.688W.8/1">In accordance with the National Statistics Code of Practice (2002), the Head of Profession for Statistics in the Department for Constitutional Affairs has sole responsibility for determining, pre-announcing and, if necessary, altering the dates of publication of 'National Statistics' and other relevant statistics produced by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.8/2">Any decision to change a pre-announced publication date will be based on a range of professional considerations such as the completeness of the underlying data, their fitness for purpose, the need for consistency and coherence, the need to promote widespread access and informed debate, or any earlier accidental or wrongful release. In reaching their decision, the Head of Profession will also take into consideration the detailed procedural guidance given in the 'National Statistics Protocol on Release Practices'. The Code and its 12 supporting Protocols are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.8/3">There have been only two occasions in the last five years when the Head of Profession has changed a pre-announced publication date. In both cases, the affected release was the monthly National Statistics bulletin &quot;Average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders&quot;. The details are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.688W.8/4" class="indent">October 2002: release postponed by one week from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-04">4 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-11">11 October</phrase>, as a result of downtime to allow for the installation of new IT equipment by a key data supplier.</p>

This decision was made by the then Head of Profession in consultation with communications colleagues and the National Statistician, who fully supported the approach taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.692W.2/1">This is a local matter, which falls to national health service providers locally. However, I am advised that despite the Private Finance Initiative process stopping in June 2006, Essex Rivers remains committed to centralise core services at Colchester general hospital. The trust's intention is to achieve the same strategic ends over a longer period using other avenues for finance and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. This is the central theme of the trust's investment strategy, launched in September 2006, for which consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-22">22 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.2/2">A strategic capital solution of around &pound;40 million to &pound;50 million is being developed. Early approval by the North East Essex primary care trust and NHS East of England boards will be sought this financial year, which will deliver a new five-year programme comprising 14 projects which will achieve the outcomes required, assuming that the funding regime and activity are broadly in line with the current assumptions.</p>

There have been, and it is expected there will continue to be, discussions about the procedures for testing milk for antibiotic residues, about cheese recovery operations and about the placing on the market of foodstuffs intended for further processing before consumption. The European Commission has not recently issued any new instructions about practices in the dairy sector, but it did adopt Commission Decision 2006/694/EC, the preamble (recitals) to which set down how the Commission intends the controls on antibiotics in milk should operate within the Community. The decision required all member states to prohibit the placing on the market of curd cheese manufactured by Bowland Dairy Products Ltd. of Barrowford, Lancashire, and the question of compensation is a matter for it to pursue with the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.8/1">The Department has worked closely with the fitness industry to establish a National Quality Assurance Framework for Exercise Referral and Register of Exercise Professionals to support the important contribution that gym-based exercise can make to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.8/2">While no market research has been conducted by the Department of Health to map the cost of membership of private and local authority gyms, a recent report by Deloitte and Tarp Worldwide on behalf of the Health and Fitness Foundation considered the impact of cost on exercise, including health club and leisure centre membership.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.8/3">The health benefits of gym membership relate to the level of participation by the individual. According to the Sport England Active People Survey conducted between October 2005 and October 2006, 10.5 per cent. of the adult population went to the gym at least once in the previous four weeks. Of these, 16.8 per cent. met the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) recommendation of at least 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity on five or more days of the week, exclusively through gym-based exercise. 27.9 per cent. of those who went to the gym at least once in the previous four weeks, were also reported as meeting the CMO's recommendation through moderate/vigorous intensity sport and active recreation. According to the survey, the average duration of a visit to the gym is 76 minutes. Gym-based exercise is likely to confer a significant general health benefit for those who participate regularly.</p>

The composition of infant formula is harmonised at European Union (EU)-level, and for fluoride reflects the recommendation of the EU Scientific Committee for Food that, on safety and nutritional grounds, no minimum level, but a maximum level of 100 milligrammes of fluoride per 100 kcal, should be set. This advice recognises the potential fluoride intakes of infants from supplements and/or water used to make up the formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.700W.0/1">The polonium traces in the investigation into the death of Mr. Litvinenko were found to be Polonium-210 (Po-210). It occurs naturally and is present in the environment and in people at very low concentrations. It can also be made by irradiation of other materials. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138 days. It undergoes decay by emitting alpha particles, accompanied by very low intensity gamma rays.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.0/2">Polonium-210 can only represent a radiation hazard if it is ingested, inhaled or otherwise taken into the body&mdash;for example, through an open wound. Where patches of contamination have been discovered in public places these have equated to polonium that weighs less than one millionth of a millionth of a gram&mdash;hence they are so low to cause no concern to immediate or longer term health.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.0/3">Police officers and the NHS Ambulance Service undertaking all activities in the death of Mr. Litvinenko are working to the principle of as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and in addition are working to a maximum radiation dose constraint of 1 mSv. This is the legal limit of exposure for members of the public as defined under the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999. Though legislation and best practice allow higher dose limits for emergency activities and employees, setting this lower constraint level ensures that the risks to emergency workers are kept low.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.0/4">The Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) had no operational involvement in this case. In the case of an accidental release of polonium FRS personnel would be engaged only after a full assessment of the level of release had been made and specialist radiological advice obtained. Firefighter operations in the contaminated area would be restricted and those likely to be exposed would be equipped with appropriate personal and respiratory protective equipment. This and associated control measures adopted by the FRS would aim to protect staff from accidental release of Polonium-210.</p>

	<p pid="b.701W.3/1">The Department's 'National Framework for Mental Health', containing recommendations for dealing with people with a dual diagnosis of mental disorder and substance misuse, details best practice guidance on effective approaches to commissioning and the provision of treatment services. The framework advocates an integrated care mechanism for those diagnosed with both mental health and substance misuse problems, drawing on the expertise of all local providers, voluntary organisations and other to deliver effective service improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.3/2">For drug and alcohol misuse, there is a recognition that a significant number of those presenting for treatment have associated mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.3/3">The updated 'Models of Care for treatment of adult drug misusers', published in June 2006, reflects this link by emphasising the importance of drug treatment services developing integrated care pathways for vulnerable groups, including those with dual diagnosis to ensure optimum treatment outcomes for those in treatment. It should be noted that as the voluntary sector is a major provider in terms of drug treatment the links with mental health bodies, including those in the statutory sector are already well established and we will continue to use all available opportunities to maintain and strengthen these links.</p>
	<p pid="b.701W.3/4">Similarly, for alcohol misuse, the Department, in conjunction with the National Treatment Agency in June 2006 published 'Models of Care for Alcohol Misusers (MoCAM'). This provides guidance to local national health service organisations in developing an integrated system of interventions and treatment to meet the needs of local people whose alcohol use is harmful. It is expected that MoCAM will be used by primary care trusts working in partnership with local commissioning groups and local service providers. This will include both the voluntary and mental health services.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.3/1">Since 1963, for Northwest Europe, and 1967 for the rest of the world, the Ministry of Defence has offered to repatriate the bodies of all those who die in military service, for burial in the United Kingdom. However, if the family elect to have a funeral overseas, the Ministry of Defence will pay for the next of kin and a companion to attend at public expense and, should local conditions prevent their attendance, then a visit to the grave may be arranged up to two years after the death. While this policy of repatriation was not made retrospective, in the event of the discovery of identifiable human remains on a historic battlefield, or crash site, the Department will, assuming we can trace their relatives, provide the opportunity for two people to attend the service funeral at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.3/2">In addition, since 1985, widows and widowers whose husband or wife died overseas as a result of service in HM armed forces between 1914 and 1967 have been entitled to visit their spouse's grave/memorial through the Government funded war widow/ers pilgrimage scheme, provided they have not done so before at public expense. The scheme also funds a carer to accompany the widow/er on the UK section of the pilgrimage, from which point appropriate care is provided. We review periodically the administration of the scheme, which is administered for the Department by the Royal British Legion, but we have no plans to change our policy for eligible war widow/ers to visit their spouse's grave/memorial.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.6/1">The number of trained military chaplains in the UK Regular Forces in each of the last five years broken down by rank and service is shown in the following table. In addition to the Christian chaplains shown, chaplains from the four main non-Christian faiths were appointed in October 2005, one each from the Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Sikh faiths. These chaplains are MOD civil servants rather than service personnel. There is also an honorary officiating chaplain to minister to those of the Jewish faith.</p>

ATB will however be paid to those personnel who qualify for it until the end of March 2007.

	<p pid="b.710W.0/2">It is not possible to accurately identify the numbers of responses specifically generated by television advertising. However, Army advertising as a whole over the period <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase> generated 163,770 inquiries to join the Regular Army. This compares very favourably with 88,000 inquiries for the same period last year. Of these, the Army judges that the multi-media Infantry 'Forward as One' campaign generated 113,000 inquiries, with the balance attributable to the 'Everest West Ridge' campaign. From these campaigns, the Army has received 30,020 specific inquiries to join the Infantry. Enlistments to the Infantry are currently up 30 per cent. compared with the same period in the financial year 2005-06 and the number of newly trained infantrymen that are forecast to join their units by the end of this financial year is up 15 per cent. on last year.</p>

Of these, 35 cases have been closed, two cases have been dealt with by courts martial, one case is currently being tried by court martial, one case has been dealt with summarily by the commanding officer and two investigations are ongoing.</p>

Its analysis is clear; if we are to compete in the global economy of 2020, we must have a world-class skills base. The Government have accepted the recommendations of the Report; now there must be shared responsibility for delivering the ambition. Employers, individuals and Government must work together to transform the level of investment in skills. We will publish an implementation plan in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review settlement later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.717W.0/5" class="italic"> A Guide for Providers of Vocational Training</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/6" class="italic"> What does 'Vocational training' mean?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/7">For the purposes of the regulations, the term 'vocational training' is more than just training provided by employers for their own employees. Vocational training should be taken to include a wide range of activities, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/8" class="indent">all types of training which would help fit a person for employment, including practical work experience;</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/9" class="indent">all further, higher and other adult education (but not education of pupils in schools);</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/10" class="indent">vocational guidance;</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/11" class="italic"> To whom do the regulations apply?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/12">The regulations will apply to vocational training providers across the statutory, private and voluntary sectors, regardless of whether they receive any public funding. Some of the regulations apply specifically to bodies that award qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/13" class="italic"> Are all courses at Universities and Further Education Colleges covered by the regulations?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/14">Yes, the UK Government has decided that all courses at Institutions of Further and Higher Education should be covered by the age regulations, whether they are specifically vocational or more general in nature. This is to ensure there is a unified approach to age-related practices and policies in relation to all such provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/15" class="italic"> To whom do the regulations apply?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/16">The regulations will apply to vocational training providers across the statutory, private and voluntary sectors, regardless of whether they receive any public funding. Some of the regulations apply specifically to bodies that award qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/17" class="italic"> Are all courses at Universities and Further Education Colleges covered by the regulations?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/18">Yes, the UK Government has decided that all courses at Institutions of Further and Higher Education should be covered by the age regulations, whether they are specifically vocational or more general in nature. This is to ensure there is a unified approach to age-related practices and policies in relation to all such provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/19" class="italic"> What does this mean for vocational training providers?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/20">As a general principle the regulations mean that providers will not be able to set age limits or age-related criteria for 'vocational training' activities (as defined above).</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/21">In addition they will not generally be able to set such age limits for associated benefits or conditions, such as help with travelling costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/22">However, the regulations do recognise that certain age-related practices may be justifiable where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Such objective justification will not be an easy test, and providers of vocational training will have to produce supporting evidence if challenged: assertions that an age-based approach was necessary will not be enough. For further information on objective justification, please refer to pages 30 and 31 of the Acas guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/23">If you provide vocational training and currently set age limits or requirements, you will need to consider whether these are capable of being justified. You would have to be able to demonstrate this if challenged.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/24" class="italic"> What about funding? Isn't that access?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/25">Article 3.3 of the Directive clearly states that the Directive does not apply to payments of any kind made by state schemes. The power to make provision for support for students is set out in section 22 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. The grants and loans for tuition fees and maintenance paid to students under the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2006 (which are made under section 22) are from public funds. Student support in the UK is therefore a &quot;state scheme&quot;. As such funding falls outside scope of the Directive it is not covered by the age regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/26">Maintenance loans for students affect maintenance during study, not admission to a course of study. They are not related to access and fall outside the scope of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/27">Bursaries and scholarships are also not covered, because they are incentives, as opposed to relating directly to access.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/28" class="italic"> What about learning programmes supported by Government funding that has age limits?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/29">Age limits set in relation to Government funding are outside the scope of the Directive, as explained above. However, any decision to deny access to a training course to people outside that age group would need to be objectively justified by the training provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/30" class="italic"> What does this mean for a training provider?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/31">What this means is illustrated by the following two examples:</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/32">Training Provider X run an IT course which receives Government funding for participants under 25. The training provider only admit people within this age limit and refuses places to anybody 26 or over on grounds of their age. This would have to be objectively justified.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/33">Training Provider Y also run an IT course which receives Government funding for participants under 25, who are offered free/subsidised places. However, rather than denying access to people aged 26 or over they instead require them to pay for their own place on the course. This would not need to be objectively justified.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/34">For further information on objective justification, please refer to pages 30 and 31 of the Acas guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/35" class="italic"> What else do I need to know?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/36">There is also a provision in the regulations which allows for Positive Action to be taken in connection with access to vocational training, to compensate for disadvantages linked to age. e.g. where particular age groups may be under-represented in particular occupations.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/37">Positive action should not be confused with positive discrimination. A guarantee of work once the training is completed should never be offered or implied. For further information on positive action, please refer to page 29 of the Acas guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/38" class="italic"> Can you give me an example of a legitimate aim?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/39">As Article 6(1)(a) of the EU Employment Directive makes clear, the protection of vulnerable groups is a legitimate aim. The promotion of vocational integration is also a legitimate aim listed in the Directive. Special employment-related measures to integrate particular sections of the population into the workforce are common throughout the EU. For example, the UK Government supports apprenticeship programmes which are designed by employers to develop occupational competence and wider employability, and hence help to integrate into the workforce those who would otherwise lack the necessary skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/40" class="italic"> What does vocational integration mean?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/41">The process of vocational integration should lead to an individual benefiting from educational opportunities, in order to become employable, and to achieve employment. Although the term &quot;vocational integration&quot; cannot be precisely defined, it relates to any action intended to help the transition of individuals from education or unemployment to work and their integration into the working world, or the movement of individuals between occupations.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/42">It should be remembered, however, that education of pupils in schools does not constitute vocational training within the meaning of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/43" class="italic"> Other things to consider</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/44">The following are just some of the issues vocational training providers will need to consider:</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/45" class="indent">Do you set a minimum or maximum age for entry generally or in relation to admission or access to particular courses or other relevant activities?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/46" class="indent">Is age taken into account in any way when considering applications for admission or access, or associated benefits and conditions e.g. do you offer preferential fee discount arrangements based on age? Do you provide residential accommodation to students of all ages, or are students over or under certain ages not offered accommodation?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/47" class="indent">If so, can you objectively justify any age related criteria? What legitimate aim does any age related criterion help you achieve, e.g. have you clear evidence that demonstrates particular age groups would be excluded from your learning provision if they had to pay full fees?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/48" class="indent">Are your age related criteria a proportionate means of achieving that aim? Is there another way of achieving that aim without resorting to setting age limits?</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/49">All such matters need to be critically examined in the light of the Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.717W.0/50">Acas have also produced a booklet called 'Guidance on Age and the workplace: a guide for employers'. This booklet is also aimed at providers of vocational training and is available from their website at <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.asp">http://www.acas.org.uk/index.asp</a>x?articleid=337 or can be obtained in hard copy from any of the 13 Acas regional offices covering England, Scotland and Wales. (It can also be ordered by telephone, direct from Acas Publications, on 08702 429090.) A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.2/1">Each local authority's total dedicated schools grant (DSG) for 2006-07 was calculated by multiplying its full-time equivalent pupil numbers (aged three-15) from the January 2006 pupil count by its DSG guaranteed unit of funding (which is unchanged from that set in December 2005 and is available on Teachernet at:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9405">www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9405</a>).</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/3">The DSG guaranteed unit of funding for 2006-07 was based on actual spend per pupil in 2005-06, with a basic increase of 5 per cent. per pupil (5.1 per cent. for London authorities) and headroom allocated to reflect new priorities (including &pound;82 million early years expansion).</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/4">For those authorities below 90 per cent. participation for their three-year-olds in January 2006, the number of three-year-olds for funding purposes was brought up to 90 per cent. of the projected population.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/5">The formula used to calculate schools formula spending share for 2005-06 and previous years took account of the differences in the cost of providing childcare at in different local authorities. Of the &pound;2.886 billion Under-5 Schools FSS for 2005-06</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/6">approximately:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/7" class="indent">&pound;138 million (or 5 per cent. of the total) was distributed on the basis of the area cost adjustment for areas where it costs more to recruit and retain staff; and</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/8" class="indent">&pound;319 million (or 11 per cent. of the total) was distributed on the basis of an index of pupils with additional educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/9">Since the formula for DSG starts from local authorities' actual spending on education for 2005-06, that will reflect the different local circumstances and variations in the cost of provision. The &pound;82 million extra for the extension from 33 to 38 weeks was distributed on the basis of the number of full-time equivalent children in private, voluntary and independent settings (since pupils in maintained settings already received 38 weeks'free provision), weighted for area costs.

The Act enables the seizure of such goods and prosecution of importers. However, the Act can be enforced only if evidence is supplied proving the foreign prison-made origin of goods. No seizures or prosecutions have resulted in recent years, although the Government remain willing to act upon any evidence supplied to them.</p>
