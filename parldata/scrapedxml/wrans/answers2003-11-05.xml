	<p pid=".634W.0/2">We are developing a strategy for promoting dedication to landowners, which will highlight the benefits of dedication, including the reduced liability that owners will incur and the opportunities to realise the potential that increasing visitor numbers has on the rural economy. This will build on the work undertaken by the Forestry Commission in 2001 when it ran seminars to encourage dedication by woodland owners.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.0/3">I wrote to Ministers in all Departments in February 2002 about the scope for dedication of land held by Government Departments and sponsored non-departmental public bodies. I have also pursued this point with some commercial organisations that are significant landowners. Now that the dedication regulations have been laid, I will be following this correspondence up, not least to encourage all Government Departments to actively consider the extent to which their landholdings can be dedicated under section 16 and to ensure that the option is widely understood by private sector landowners.</p>

My noble Friend Lord Whitty, has been chairing the Dairy Supply Chain Forum to consider, among other issues, ways in which the sector can improve its efficiency through collaborative action, and we have made a grant of nearly &pound;0.5 million to the Food Chain Centre to study how the efficiency of the dairy supply chain might be improved. We have also supported the establishment of English Food and Farming Practices, a new industry-led body that has been set up specifically to support and encourage collective activity across all agricultural sectors. In addition to this, we are actively considering bringing decoupling forward to 2005 to give dairy farmers the freedom to restructure their businesses for the more competitively market orientated environment. Furthermore, the Milk Development Council has been working with Food from Britain to identify potential export markets for UK dairy products.</p>

	<p pid=".635W.3/1">Price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets, are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, as long as competition rules are respected. While the Government share producers' concerns over the low farmgate price of milk, they do not support protests.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.3/2">The Secretary of State has had no formal meetings with representatives of the dairy industry to discuss milk prices or the current protests. However, Ministers frequently meet with representatives from all parts of the dairy sector and are therefore aware of the issues. In addition, matters affecting the whole dairy supply chain are regularly discussed at the forum chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty.</p>

	<p pid=".635W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the UK at the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-27">27 October 2003</phrase>. The Council reached a political agreement on one legislative measure, and also considered a number of other important issues.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/2">The Council reached a political agreement on a Directive on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in paints. This measure aims to reduce emissions from paints of these organic solvents, which are precursors of ground-level ozone which can be harmful to human health and the environment. We retained a reservation on the proposal as parliamentary scrutiny is not yet complete. Greece asked for further time to implement limits for decorative paints and varnishes, but its request was turned down.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/3">The Council agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposed structural indicators for reporting on progress on employment, innovation, economic reform, social cohesion and environmental protection to the spring European Council. There was general support for the proposed set of 14 headline indicators of which three would be environment-related. Some delegations proposed including new indicators on biodiversity and public health. I stressed the importance of using robust and meaningful indicators. I pointed out that any biodiversity indicator should be able to measure progress towards the EU's target of halting loss of biodiversity by 2010, for example, along the lines of an index proposed by Birdlife International. The current proposal, on protected areas, was not adequate. The Council agreed that the three proposed environment-related indicators, on climate change, energy intensity and transport, should be reformulated in order to focus on the most significant environmental impacts and that good quality indicators on biodiversity and health should be included as soon as possible so as to cover all of the priority areas identified in the EU sustainable development strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/4">The Council agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposal for a European strategy on environment and health. This strategy is intended to reduce the disease burden caused by environmental factors in the EU, to identify and prevent new health threats caused by new environmental factors. We also agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposal for an integrated product policy, aimed at reducing the environmental impacts that arise in the supply chain and life-cycle of products.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/5">The Presidency noted a presentation from the Commission on the results of its public consultation on a legislative proposal for an EU chemicals strategy. The Council also noted a presentation from the Commission on proposals for implementing the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in the EC and on access to justice in environmental matters. We heard a report from Sweden on a ministerial conference they had hosted on environment and sustainable development in northern Europe, and the Commission circulated a report on progress on thematic strategies under the 6th Environment Action programme. Portugal gave a presentation about the devastating forest fires they had experienced this summer, stressing the importance of tackling this issue for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/6">Belgium and France gave short presentations calling for member states' co-operation to reduce ozone levels. The Commission indicated its readiness to help and drew attention to existing measures that might facilitate co-operation and exchange of information.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/7">Belgium presented a short paper on decommissioning of ships, expressing concern in particular about the export of vessels to developing countries for disposal. I supported Belgium's concerns, stressing the need to ensure that first class and environmentally sound dismantling facilities are available in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/8">The Commission then called upon member states to support a protocol on sustainable development to the Treaty being considered by the Inter-Governmental Conference.</p>
	<p pid=".635W.6/9">We also discussed preparations for the 9th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP9) and the Kyoto project mechanisms. After an exchange of views, we agreed to reconvene on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December 2003</phrase>, immediately preceding COP9, to discuss the outstanding issues.</p>

	<p pid=".637W.2/1">The recommended individual and maximum permitted application rates of the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium used on GM maize in the farm-scale evaluations were defined by the conditions of the simulated product licence that formed part of the experimental pesticide approval. This specified a maximum permitted rate of eight litres per hectare and a recommended individual rate of four litres per hectare, depending on the weeds present and their growth stage. Application was permitted until the nine-leaf stage of maize. For further details, and for details of other non-herbicide sprays used, see Champion et al. 2003; &quot;Crop Management and Agronomic Context of the Farm Scale Evaluations of Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant Crops&quot;; Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (B). 358 (1439): 1801&ndash;18. A copy of this journal has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/2">Before glufosinate-ammonium could be used on a commercial scale on GM-maize, it would need full pesticide approval. In seeking approval, the necessary data package would have to be supplied by the applicant and be subjected to the considerations of human and environmental safety which have been established for all pesticide uses. Any approval given would specify recommended and maximum application rates in the same way as the experimental permit. These conditions would be determined by the Pesticide Safety Directorate taking due account of advice from their expert advisory committee the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.</p>

I would not, therefore, wish to divert staff at the medal offices to undertake an exercise of the sort that has been requested, at the expense of issuing the medal to Suez veterans.</p>

The Government are therefore working hard in ICAO to engage other countries in the climate change debate and to reduce emissions from aviation.

Discussions between the Port Authority and the Department for Transport about this matter will continue until such time as a satisfactory conclusion is reached. I am aware that further information is being sought from the Port of Tyne Authority as part of their on-going discussions with DEFRA and that a final decision cannot be reached until such time as all the facts are to hand.

	<p pid=".644W.11/1">The appearance of signs and markings, and conditions for their placing, are specified in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (SI 3113), which came into effect earlier this year. Guidance on good practice in the design and use of signs is given in the Traffic Signs Manual. An updated Chapter 7, on sign design, and Chapter 5, on road markings, will be published later this month. It is the responsibility of individual traffic authorities to ensure that signs and markings are used in conformity with the statutory requirements and Government guidance.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.2/1">The Department has examined the case for a road tax on cyclists in the past. It would require a registration system like the one for motor vehicles and the costs of the system would certainly outweigh any benefits for enforcement of road traffic offences by cyclists. Moreover, increasing the costs of cycling would not support our policy of encouraging more people to consider cycling as a viable mode of transport and we have no plans to introduce such a tax.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.5/1">A study commissioned by the Department to look into the effectiveness of cycle helmets, published in November last year, found that overall, the evidence suggests that cycle helmets are effective at reducing the severity of brain and upper facial injuries for all ages, and especially children. This reinforces our view that we should encourage helmets to be worn by children.</p>
	<p pid=".645W.5/2">A survey undertaken by the Transport Research Laboratory measuring wearing rates in 2002 found that the rate for all cyclists on built-up major roads was 25 per cent. The wearing rate is continuing to increase, with the exception of boys under 16 where the rate has reduced from 16 per cent. in 1994 to 12 per cent. in 2002. At these levels making helmets compulsory would cause enforcement difficulties and without greater public acceptance could have an effect on levels of cycling. We are making special efforts to persuade adolescents, and especially boys, to wear helmets. We will continue to monitor wearing rates by all ages and review the option of compulsory wearing from time to time.</p>

	<p pid=".649W.3/1">The UK Government remain fully committed to the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to ensure that it delivers a robust exit from unsustainable debt for the world's poorest countries. At present, 27 countries have reached Decision Point and have started to receive interim relief. Of these countries, eight have reached Completion Point and are now also receiving irrevocable debt relief.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.3/2">In the September 2003 publication &quot;Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative: Status of Implementation&quot;, the staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update on progress under the Initiative and new estimates of costs. This document is available on both the World Bank and the IMF websites. Table 9 in the document sets out the status of delivery of assistance by the World Bank. Under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiatives, the World Bank has made total debt service reduction commitments of US$12.4 billion and has delivered $2.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.3/3">Table 11 sets out the status of delivery of assistance by the IMF. Under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiatives, the IMF has made total debt service reduction commitments of SDR &pound;1.8 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) and has disbursed SDR &pound;1 billion (approximately $740 million). The Special Drawing Right (SDR) serves as the unit of account of the IMF and is allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.3/4">The UK has provided commitments of around &pound;2 billion of debt relief to eligible HIPC countries and has pledged a total of $474 million through the multilateral institutions to further support the initiative. The UK is committed to providing 100 per cent. relief for eligible HIPC countries, and calls for all bilateral, multilateral and commercial creditors to participate in the Initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".649W.3/5">The HIPC Initiative has an important role to play in maximising the resources available for poverty reduction in developing countries. However, unless there is an increase in the volume of resources available from donors to poor countries, additional debt relief would simply reallocate resources from one form of financing to another, and from non-HIPC poor countries to HIPC countries, without adding to the overall financing available for poverty reduction. Furthermore all HIPC countries would still need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals even if all of their debt from the World Bank and IMF were forgiven. That is why the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important. It can provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources that debt relief alone would not achieve, which could be disbursed by way of grants and additional debt relief.</p>

	<p pid=".653W.0/1">The Governments of Central Asia established the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in the early nineties; an interstate mechanism for developing and centrally funding regional environmental and research activity aimed at improving the environmental situation in the Aral Sea region. Although the established mechanism provides for an operational framework to generate international assistance, in practice the IFAS has failed to become a functioning institution with a strong regional environmental remit. The failure is attributed to a number of factors but chiefly by the general lack of enthusiasm by the governments in the region to cooperate on practical issues.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.0/2">A $12 million Water and Environmental Management Project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by an Executing Agency of IFAS, has a component to develop longer term, sustainable regional and national water management strategies; to replace the current system of annual ad hoc water allocation and distribution arrangements which is slowly breaking down. This strategy will help to develop strategic choices at the river basin level such as water allocation between and within the five states, cost sharing for operations, maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement of the existing infrastructure. The UK contributes to the GEF and last year DFID provided an additional contribution of &pound;15 million to the third replenishment.</p>

	<p pid=".653W.3/2">Forecasts of future consumption are still in the process of being developed. We have occupied our 1 Palace Street building for less than two years and a reliable baseline is only now emerging. Similarly, our East Kilbride office is undergoing extensive refurbishment and extension that will completely alter the energy consumption picture there, and our subsidiary London office is being vacated in 2004 so is excluded from future predictions. However the Department's aim is to reduce its energy consumption in accordance with Government targets, and to this end the London and East Kilbride refurbishments include such features as energy-efficient boilers, low-energy light bulbs and tubes, and, where appropriate, movement sensors instead of light switches to ensure that lights are not left on unnecessarily in unoccupied rooms. The offices have also had their computer monitors replaced throughout with low-energy flat screens. In addition, the London office electricity supply has been 100 per cent. from renewable sources since July 2002, while from this month the new supply contract for East Kilbride is 10 per cent. renewable (the maximum available there). Also at East Kilbride, a feasibility study for an on-site wind turbine is currently under way. The staff Green Awareness programme includes an energy section and a computer switch-off campaign backed up by monthly monitoring and feedback.</p>
	<p pid=".653W.3/3">DFID is committed to the Government's Sustainable Development Framework and Targets, which include an Energy component, and is developing an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 in order to deliver these. Building management systems incorporate energy reduction elements; consumption is monitored monthly and any undue increases investigated.</p>

	<p pid=".655W.2/2">We regard reproductive health as an essential and inseparable element of good health. We believe that the best way to deliver this is for people to be given the right, freedom and support necessary to enable them to take full individual and personal control of their own fertility and reproductive health. Reproductive health continues to be a key priority for DFID and we remain firmly committed to the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) target of achieving access to reproductive health for all by 2015.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.2/3">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection.</p>
	<p pid=".655W.2/4">In financial year 2002&ndash;3 alone DFID spent over &pound;270 million on reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".659W.2/1">The World Food Programme (WFP) have agreed with all their implementing partners a protocol for reporting irregularities, and in particular political interference, in relation to the distribution of donor-funded food aid, which accounts for the large majority of food being distributed in Zimbabwe this year. This information is shared with donors and implementing partners. We believe that, so long as there is no damage to the effectiveness of international humanitarian operations in Zimbabwe, the UN should also make this information available publicly. We and other donors are discussing this with the UN as part of the present review of the UN's Relief and Recovery Unit (RRU).</p>
	<p pid=".659W.2/2">Despite continual pressure from WFP, the Government has provided very little information about its own plans and activities in relation to food and grain distribution which it funds itself, distributed by the Grain Marketing Board (GMB). The UN agencies do not have a formal role in monitoring the activities of the GMB, in which donor funding is not involved. However, some local non-Governmental Organisations do monitor food supplies, including those from GMB, and publish reports locally.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.2/2">The UK has given effect to its obligations under the EU treaties through the European Communities Act 1972. Costa v ENEL set out the clear principle that its obligations under the treaties cannot be overridden by domestic legal provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.2/3">In Thorburn <i>v.</i> Sunderland City Council, Lord Justice Laws said as part of his judgment:</p>
	<p pid=".661W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the 1972 Act incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme . . .&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.2/5">The ultimate guarantee of parliamentary sovereignty lies in the power of Parliament to repeal all or any of the Acts which give effect to the EU treaties in this country. As Lord Denning made clear in the case of Macarthys Ltd. <i>v.</i> Smith, it is within Parliament's power to legislate contrary to the UK's treaty obligations. The result of so doing, however, would be to put the UK in breach of its treaty obligations.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.6/1">New statutory rights to leave and pay for parents adopting a child came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year. Eligible employees are able to take up to 52 weeks adoption leave and receive Statutory Adoption Pay for up to 26 weeks paid at the same standard rate as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)&mdash;&pound;100 per week or 90 per cent. of average earnings if this is less than &pound;100.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.6/2">SMP is paid for the first six weeks at 90 per cent. of average earnings. This reflects the legal requirement that women take a period of compulsory maternity leave following the birth of a child. This is for their health and safety and that of their child. Offering a higher rate of SMP for the first six weeks recognises this and helps mothers to take that time off.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.6/3">The adopter's partner may be able to benefit from the new rights to paternity leave and pay. Statutory Paternity Pay is paid at the same standard rate as SMP. This rate applies for all fathers, not just adoptive parents.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.6/4">We are already gathering evidence on how the new rights for adoptive parents are working in practice, as part of a wider monitoring strategy for all the new laws relating to working parents introduced in April 2003, and will continue to do so as an ongoing process. The Government will begin a review of the right to request flexible working in 2006 and we aim to look at how effective the other laws have been at the same time.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.6/5">The new rights have only been in place for seven months so as yet we do not have any figures on how many parents have taken adoption leave. However, it is estimated that in 2003 there will be 3,850 adoptions per year and we hope that most of these adopters will be able to benefit. We will be looking at the level of take up as part of our monitoring strategy.</p>

The guidance makes it clear that lenders must not ignore the unfair practices of debt collectors acting on their behalf, whether in-house or external.

	<p pid=".669W.9/1">Negotiations are continuing. The Radiocommunications Agency is in regular discussion with its French counterpart about sharing spectrum for our respective analogue and digital TV coverage requirements. These negotiations are conditioned by internationally agreed arrangements, and spectrum planning methods, for determining equitable spectrum shares. The close proximity of the two countries and the heavy demand for frequencies on both sides of the Channel requires difficult and complicated technical discussions to maximise the use of spectrum in both countries in a way that minimises interference effects. In some cases, compromises are having to be made on both sides to deliver TV networks, such as mutual toleration of the risk of greater interference for longer periods than advised by the international planning rules.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.9/2">We are still in negotiation with the French authorities on acceptable channels and transmitter powers for digital TV from the Dover and Bluebell Hill stations in conjunction with the French requests for frequencies (and transmitter powers) for their own networks. Both sides are currently analysing the impact of each others' latest proposals and we hope to meet the French administration as soon as possible to take forward the discussions.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> There are no New Deal for Communities (NDC) Partnerships in St. Helens, South.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/3"><i>(b) and (c)</i> There are two NDC Partnerships in Merseyside&mdash;Liverpool (Kensington) and Knowsley (North Huyton). There are six partnerships in the north west region. These include the two Merseyside Partnerships and those in Manchester (Beswick and Openshaw), Oldham (Hathershaw and Fitton Hill), Rochdale (Heywood) and Salford (Central).</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/4">The NDC programme is scrutinised and reviewed using two, complementary and linked streams of work:</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/5" class="indent">a performance management system, which drives annual and mid-year reviews, lead by the Government Offices for the Regions;</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/6" class="indent">the NDC National Evaluation, providing external assessment at partnership, programme and theme level, lead by Sheffield Hallam University.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/7">The performance management system was introduced in 2003 and used for the first time for the 2002&ndash;03 annual reviews. Partnerships reviewed their own performance and the results that they are starting to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/8">The evidence provided in these reviews by the NDC Partnerships show that partnerships in the Merseyside and the north west are beginning to make an impact in reducing crime, creating jobs and raising standards in education. For example:</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/9" class="indent">In the Kensington area of Liverpool, the rate of all recorded offences has fallen from 185.3 instances per 1,000 population before the NDC, to 148.8 in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/10" class="indent">In Salford, the gap between the proportion of pupils getting five or more GCSEs at grades A to C narrowed from 12 per cent. to 8 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/11" class="indent">In east Manchester, the percentage of the working age population who are in employment has risen from 52 per cent.to 65 per cent., which exceeded the city average in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/12">Alongside this evidence from partnerships themselves, data from the national NDC evaluation about the progress NDC Partnerships are making towards achieving their outcome targets is now beginning to come through. An overview of the latest position was recently published in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Research Report 7 &quot;New Deal for Communities: The National Evaluation: Annual Report 2002&ndash;03&quot;. Copies are available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.6/1">The Government are very aware of the links between housing conditions, health and poverty. Children of low income parents (those on means tested benefit) are more likely (38 per cent. of such households, 760,000 households in all) to live in homes that do not meet the decent home standard than other children (25 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/2">That is why the Government are committed to making all social housing decent by 2010 and has made a long-term commitment to eliminate child poverty by 2020. Improving sub-standard housing conditions is an integral part of the Government's child poverty strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister target is that by 2010 all social housing will be made decent and that 210,000 more households will be supported to ensure their homes are made decent. Good progress has already been made&mdash;between 1997 and 2001, nearly half a million the numbers of non-decent social sector homes have been reduced. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also helped around 120,000 vulnerable households in the private sector to make their homes decent.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/4">In March 2003 the draft Housing Bill was published. It includes the following proposals that will benefit poor and vulnerable households by targeting housing condition problems which will in turn address child poverty issues:</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/5" class="indent">Housing Health and Safety Rating System&mdash;this new system will target health and safety hazards in the home and provide a better basis for enforcement. It will replace the current Fitness Standard.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/6" class="indent">Licensing of higher-risk Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)&mdash;These house some of the most vulnerable people. The definition includes Bread and Breakfast (B&amp;B) accommodation for homeless families. This mandatory national licensing scheme will improve controls on about 120,000 HMOs, to improve basic facilities and management standards.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.6/7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also set a target to end, by March 2004, the use of B&amp;B accommodation for families with children except in emergencies, and then for no longer than six weeks. The Government are considering making it unlawful for local authorities to exceed this six-week deadline, and hopes to make an announcement by the end of this year.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.5/1">For private finance initiative (PFI) schemes with a capital value greater than &pound;10 million, the total capital cost of PFI-based investment in the four new London strategic health authorities since 1997 is &pound;975,900,000. The capital value of PFI schemes is defined as: total capital cost to the private sector including the costs of land, construction, equipment and professional fees but excluding value added tax, rolled up interest and financing costs. As PFI procures a service, rather than the underlying asset, capital values are necessarily estimates.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/2">Unitary payments on a PFI scheme&mdash;paid for from a trust's general revenue allocations&mdash;include elements for 'hard' and 'soft' facilities management services as well as financing costs. A partial breakdown of the unitary costs for schemes with a capital value exceeding &pound;20 million is held centrally. This shows the split between 'availability' and 'services' where 'availability' includes costs attributable to 'hard' facilities management and financing, but does not distinguish further. To collect this information would mean reviewing the financial models for all these schemes which would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/3">Unitary payments on PFI schemes become payable when the scheme becomes operational. The first to do so was Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup, which took its first patient at the end of March 2000; the most recent to open was St. George's in September 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".683W.2/2">The Government has no plans to provide direct financial assistance to care homes to meet any of the standards.

	<p pid=".683W.8/1">The European Directive on the conduct of clinical trials was adopted in February 2001. The main aim of the Directive is to simplify and harmonise procedures across the Community while ensuring the protection of trial subjects and providing a safe environment for the development of new medicines. member states are required to fully implement the Directive by <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/2">The scope of the Directive is wide and the United Kingdom Regulations will apply to all clinical trials on medicinal products for human use conducted in the UK, including academic and healthy volunteer studies, with the exception of non-interventional trials.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/3">Because the Directive makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial publicly or charitably funded clinical trials, they cannot be treated differently in the UK implementing regulations. However those drafting the Directive recognised the special position of non-commercial trials conducted by researchers without the participation of the pharmaceutical industry. The Government has taken steps to attempt to influence the Commission in its consideration of a Commission Directive on good clinical practice and also in reviewing guidance that the Commission published earlier this year with a view to avoiding any unnecessary regulatory requirements and costs.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/4">In responding to concerns, and to provide an environment in which patients are protected but high quality research is not inhibited, my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health, invited the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Academy of Medical Sciences to co-ordinate a report on the impact of the Directive on academic studies. The impact assessment, prepared by the MRC with the active support of others including Cancer Research UK, the National Co-ordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment and a number of academic experts formed the basis for a response to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) consultation on the draft regulations to implement the Directive into UK law earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/5">The MHRA is giving careful consideration to legislation and guidance linked to these issues. For example, they are considering the acceptability of different approaches to monitoring the validity of trial data that are less labour intensive and expensive than those usually used in commercial trials. The aim is the use of appropriate quality systems proportionate to risk (thereby minimising increases in costs). A list of responses to frequently asked questions are published on the MHRA website at <a href="http://www.mhra.gov">www.mhra.gov</a> in the Clinical Trials Directive pages, which will be kept updated.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/6">In another initiative, the Department and the MRC have announced a joint project to work with experts to find practical solutions to the issues identified in the impact assessment. Details of the project can be found on <a href="http://www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp">www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.8/7">With our careful exploration of the impact on publicly-funded research and organisations that support it and delays in the Commission finalising the GCP Directive and other guidance, the United Kingdom's implementing regulations are not expected to be made until early in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".685W.5/7">NSFs have challenging aims (the vision) for a particular service or care group. Ways to achieve those aims are described in a number of standards, focused as far as possible on the needs of patients and good outcomes, underpinned by:</p>

	<p pid=".685W.5/11">Standard 3 of the diabetes national service framework is about patient empowerment. All people with diabetes will receive a service that encourages partnership in decision-making and supports them in managing their diabetes.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.5/12">This is reflected in the &quot;Planning and Priorities Framework for the NHS 2003&ndash;06&quot;, which includes targets for the diabetes NSF.

	<p pid=".685W.5/13">The above gives clinicians and other professionals, managers and service users the information and guidance they need to drive forward improvements locally . NSFs will be implemented and monitored in the same way as departmental policy generally, allowing maximum scope for local flexibility.

	<p pid=".694W.8/2">Patient bedside televisions and telephones are operational in 95 hospitals, including 76 major facilities. We want all major hospitals to at least have a contract agreed by the end of 2003, and to have the system installed by the end of 2004. The exception will be a small number of hospitals with public finance initiative schemes which will install the system as their new hospitals come on line. We have also worked with suppliers in order to enable them to introduce the system to smaller sites, so as many NHS patients as possible can have access to the service.</p>

	<p pid=".695W.0/2">The information requested is not held centrally. However, as at March 2002, out of a total of 9,756 national health service community pharmacies in England, 1,524, or 15.6 per cent., received payment for extended opening hours either before 0900 hours or after 1730 hours on Monday to Saturday (or after 1300 hours on an early closing day). 4,015, or 41.2 per cent., received payment for opening on Sundays or on public holidays.</p>
	<p pid=".695W.0/3">We are currently consulting on a range of measures to modernise the regulatory system which governs whether or not a community pharmacy can dispense NHS prescriptions. As well as maintaining and improving access to pharmacies in all our communities and continuing to raise standards for patients, the aim is to make the system more business friendly, to provide more certainty and reliability for the companies who depend on it and to make the process less time-consuming. The measures include a proposal to exempt from the current restrictions applications from pharmacies which intend to open more than 100 hours a week, provided they provide a full and prescribed range of services, appropriate to local needs, determined by the NHS primary care trust. Full details are given in the consultation document, &quot;Proposals to reform and modernise the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-29">29 August 2003</phrase> and available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/pharmacyregulationconsultation">www. doh.gov.uk/pharmacyregulationconsultation</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase> the government published indicative figures for the targeted grant in 2004&ndash;05, which have been placed in the Library of the House. These assumed that grant would be available to authorities whose increase in Education Formula Spending and relevant DfES grant between 2002&ndash;03 and 2004&ndash;05 would otherwise be less than 12 per cent. per pupil. The increase in Staffordshire LEA is expected to be above 12 per cent. per pupil over the relevant period, which means it would not be eligible for the targeted grant.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.5/3">However, if Staffordshire or any other LEA is able to put forward a compelling case that additional, transitional funds are needed in the short term&mdash;above and beyond those already available to the LEA&mdash;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&ndash;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that might be made available in this way would be a maximum of &pound;300,000 per authority, or 0.2 per cent. of the authority's total education resources in 2004&ndash;05, if that is higher. For Staffordshire, 0.2 per cent. of its education resources would be over &pound;800,000.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.0/2">The table figures provide a useful indicative picture of the use of setting across subjects, with setting being used in the vast majority of schools in mathematics, more than three-quarters of schools in science, and between half and three quarters of schools in English and modern foreign languages. A more detailed study, undertaken over a number of years with a consistent sample of schools, would be needed to enable secure judgments to be made about trends.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.5/2">Guidance to LEAs completing the Annual Survey of Teacher Numbers and Vacancies (618G) in January 2004 will make clear that support staff who may be providing cover supervision, or who may be carrying out specified work without a teacher present under the conditions set out in the regulations, should continue to be counted separately from teachers. We would expect most of these to be counted as teaching assistants in the Annual Schools Census, but often support staff in schools undertake more than one role. We are also considering what further categorisation we might introduce for the 2005 school census.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.8/1">Since 1998, full tuition fee remission has been available to most postgraduate trainee teachers in England. In 1999, the Government announced a further package of support which consisted of a payment of &pound;2,500 for people taking Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses in mathematics and science and a further &pound;2,500 payable on appointment to a relevant post in the same subjects.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.8/2">These payments were superseded in September 2000 when the Government introduced &pound;6,000 training bursaries for eligible postgraduate trainee teachers and &pound;4,000 Golden Hellos for those going on to teach one of five priority subjects in a maintained school in England. These incentives have been reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans pilot scheme, introduced in September 2002 for new teachers of priority subjects.</p>
	<p pid=".705W.8/3">These measures have contributed to an increase of over 5,000 in the number of recruits to courses of Initial Teacher Training between 1998/99 and 2002/03.</p>

	<p pid=".709W.2/1">The Government believe that all controlled drugs, including cannabis, are harmful and that no one should take them.

	<p pid=".709W.2/3">Reclassification of cannabis is also designed to continue to deter use of the drug, because of its continued illegality, while enabling the police to put in place a consistent regime for policing cannabis, in line with the Association of Chief Police Officers' cannabis enforcement guidance. This will allow the police to redeploy resources to tackling more serious offences, including dealing in Class A drugs, like heroin and crack cocaine, which do the most harm.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.2/4">The Government will seek to make an impact on the current level of cannabis use by launching an educational and advertising campaign in January aimed at young people, making it clear how the law will operate in practice and seeking to dissuade them from experimenting with cannabis. We are also taking a tough line with dealers.</p>

	<p pid=".709W.5/1">It is difficult to make valid comparisons of recorded crime statistics over time owing to changes in police recording, the latest being the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002. However, the adoption of the NCRS by all forces will establish a fairer and more consistent basis upon which future crime statistics can be interpreted, both nationally and between police forces.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.5/2">In order to provide a more realistic picture of crime levels, the Home Office has conducted a full evaluation of the estimated impact of the NCRS at a national and force level for 2002&ndash;03. More detailed information about the methodology can be found at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.Uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr3103.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.Uk/rds/pdfs2/rdsolr3103.pdf</a>. The study concluded that overall the crimes counted in 2002&ndash;03 were approximately 10 per cent. higher than they would have been under pre-NCRS recording practices.</p>
	<p pid=".709W.5/3">Additionally, it is important to note that findings from the British Crime Survey, which is the most authoritative source on crime trends (and which has not been affected by changes to police recording practices) enable trends in crime over the last 20 years to be identified on a reliable basis.</p>

These supported the findings of research in this country that campaigns that aim to shock have at best limited success, because potential users do not associate themselves with the messages. What is needed instead is reliable information and advice for personal contacts of potential users and for potential users themselves. The Frank campaign has been designed in that light.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.5/1">Detainees at Dungavel Removal Centre are not fined. They benefit from an incentive scheme that provides them with a weekly cash allowance provided their behaviour and conduct is satisfactory. In the case of unsatisfactory behaviour, a warning letter will be issued and, if the detainee's behaviour does not improve, consideration will be given to withdrawing the weekly allowance. Unsatisfactory behaviour may include breaches of the centre rules on hygiene or health and safety. Detainees taking food from the dining room to their rooms would constitute such a breach. In the case in question, a warning letter was issued in respect of a number of separate matters but the detainee's weekly allowance was not in fact withdrawn.</p>

The length of time spent in prison following a wrongful conviction is not a matter that affects a decision on eligibility for compensation.

	<p pid=".718W.8/1">The Government has acknowledged that provision needs to be made for the victims of trafficking, in whichever part of the country they may live. It is intended that any victim support measures should be available in due course for all victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/2">The best information we have about possible number of victims of trafficking in the United Kingdom comes from research published in the report&mdash;Stopping Traffic (2002). This estimated that anything between 140 and 1,400 were trafficked annually into the UK for purposes of sexual exploitation.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/3">At present the majority of known trafficking cases are in London and surrounding areas&mdash;this is where the service delivery partner is based and have developed their specialist services. Additionally pro-active policing by the Metropolitan Police is uncovering numbers of victims of trafficking in London also.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/4">There is growing evidence to suggest this is a national problem and it seems reasonable to suppose that wherever there is a well developed vice market, there is likely to be a demand for trafficked women to work in the sex industry.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/5">The White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot;&mdash;published in February 2002&mdash;sets out our general proposals for assisting the victims of human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March</phrase> this year, we launched a pilot scheme in the London area. Under the scheme, adult female victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation whose circumstances meet the criteria set out in the White Paper are offered protection and support provided:</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/7" class="indent">The victim has been brought to the UK;</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/8" class="indent">She is being forcibly exploited;</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/9" class="indent">She is working as a prostitute or she demonstrates that she has escaped from the trafficker, and that in the period immediately prior to her escape she had been working as a prostitute;</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/10" class="indent">She has come forward to the authorities; and;</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/11" class="indent">She is willing to co-operate with the authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/12">The objectives of the pilot scheme include: to develop mechanisms that enable and ensure formal assessment of the number of victims of trafficking, the assessment of the relevance and impact of the services provided, development of a multi-disciplinary case-work model to facilitate the effective identification and assessment of victims.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/13">Under the provisions of the Children Act 1989 minors are the responsibility of local authority social services Departments. It is not possible for minors to be admitted to the pilot scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.8/14">The pilot scheme will be evaluated to assess its impact. We will then consider what more we can do to help victims of trafficking.</p>

	<p pid=".720W.8/1">The prison population projections only include legislative and policy changes that have been implemented or have an agreed date for implementation. All those listed in the previous answer are expected to have delivered their full impact during the period covered by the projections apart from automatic life sentences for serious repeat offenders where the impact is expected to extend beyond June 2009. The impact beyond June 2009 is projected to be around 50 prison places. Estimates made of the impact of such changes are kept regularly under review.</p>

	<p pid=".722W.8/1">The Prison Service keeps the impact of population pressures under review. The main threat to offending behaviour programmes stems from prisoners being transferred to another prison before completing a programme, in order to alleviate population pressures. So far this has been largely avoided. Only 1.5 per cent. of prisoners who started a cognitive skills offending behaviour programme in 2002&ndash;03 failed to complete the programme as a result of transfer (which may have been due to overcrowding or for other reasons). This is similar to the previous three years and compares with 4.8 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97.</p>

	<p pid=".722W.14/1">The Prison Service does not routinely collect information from establishments about the number of cases of tuberculosis among prisoners in England and Wales. It has, however, contracted the Health Protection Agency to provide a communicable disease data collection and monitoring service. As part of this contract, the London prisons will shortly begin to pilot use of a new reporting form, which will provide information on newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis and also on people already being treated for tuberculosis when received into prison.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.14/2">The Health Protection Agency also issues a Quarterly Report on Infectious Diseases in Prisons. The two most recent editions have included detailed guidance about the control of tuberculosis in prisons designed to clarify and reinforce earlier guidance to establishments. This makes it clear that all prisoners should be screened for tuberculosis on first reception by direct questioning about the particular symptoms of the disease. Where any case of tuberculosis is suspected, immediate efforts should be made to confirm the diagnosis or to make an urgent referral to the local NHS chest physician. Any prisoners with symptoms of the disease should be isolated until a diagnosis is made. The recent guidance also includes advice on notification under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and associated contact tracing.</p>

	<p pid=".724W.2/1">Decisions on the balance between police officers and police (support) staff is a matter for the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police (Mr. Colin Cramphorn). At the end of August West Yorkshire Police had 5,169 police officers. This is 140 more than in March 2003 and 280 more than in March 2002. I understand that the force has forecast strength for <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> at 5,286 officers. In March 2003 the force had 2,538 police (support) staff, which is 174 more than in March 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".724W.2/2">Additionally, West Yorkshire Police had 96 Community Support Officers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase>, with plans to have 160 by March 2004.</p>
