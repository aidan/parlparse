	<p pid="c.1529W.6/1">All authorised bee medicines in the UK are available as general sale products. There are no plans to put the supply of medicines for bees under the control of veterinary surgeons and licensed pharmacists. Changes in European legislation, implemented by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005, require medicines for food producing animals to be POM. This change will take effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> before which the Commission are due to produce a list of exemption criteria for the POM requirement. The UK has proposed to the Commission that bee medicines should be in the exempt list.</p>

The UK has asked for bee medicines to be exempted from the POM requirement. If this is not agreed, a beekeeper will have to be registered as a suitably qualified person (SQP) if they wish to supply these products. My officials have discussed the SQP requirements with the British Beekeepers Association and are aware of their wish to progress the provision of training for beekeepers as SQPs who are able to prescribe and supply products to treat diseases in bees. The British Beekeepers Association will be meeting the Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority early in 2006 to discuss this. If the exemption is agreed, the current sales arrangements for bee medicines will continue.</p>

	<p pid="c.1535W.6/3">In the event that commercial licensed landfill was used for carcase disposal this risk would be mitigated by ensuring that carcases were immediately covered with other material to a depth of at least 1 m and that at the end of each working day, carcases were covered by at least 2 m of cover material. All sites used for carcase disposal will have Pollution, Prevention and Control (PPC) conditions in place as well as a bespoke bird deterrent/management plan drawn up and implemented by bird control experts from the Central Science Laboratory.</p>

	<p pid="c.1536W.9/1">Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England. The principal authority with operational responsibility is the Environment Agency. The agency has undertaken no work to assign future probabilities to surge height estimates along the Essex coast. However, detailed studies have been completed to determine peak water levels for design and planning purposes along the Thames Estuary. These water levels are projected into the future by applying the Defra precautionary allowances for the effects of sea level rise. The Environment Agency has commissioned research to better understand future probabilities of sea levels in the Southern North Sea.</p>

	<p pid="c.1540W.2/4">At the end of this process, in the light of the consultation responses and taking into account the advice of Scottish Natural Heritage, the statutory nature conservation authority, the MCA will finalise its appropriate assessment and consider whether any amendments to the plan are needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1548W.12/2">The Government has no current plans to review the national speed limits for which it is responsible, namely:</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/3" class="indent">70 mph for motorways and dual carriageways;</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/4" class="indent">60 mph for single carriageway roads;</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/5" class="indent">30 mph for urban street-lit roads ('restricted roads').</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/6">Where they feel that the national limit does not reflect local needs and considerations, traffic authorities (local highway authorities and the Highways Agency) have the powers to set local speed limits through section 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. This power applies to their entire road network, irrespective of the classification of roads (A, B, C and Unclassified roads).</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/7">To help ensure consistency in the setting of local speed limits, the Department has issued guidance, currently set out in Circular Roads 1/93. Many developments have taken place in speed management since 1993, and the Department consulted on draft updated guidance on setting local speed limits at the end of 2004. As well as further improving clarity and consistency, the draft seeks to re-emphasise that the function of a road should be one of the important factors in determining what an appropriate speed is. It will also incorporate important wider factors such as quality of life through, for example, striking a more sensible balance between road safety, accessibility and environmental objectives, especially in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1548W.12/8">The updated guidance on the setting of local speed limits will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1551W.5/2">The Company Law Reform Bill will allow companies to use electronic communications with their members. This will enable companies and their members to benefit from the immediacy of electronic dialogue. However, the Government recognise that electronic communications will not suit everyone. A change to the use of electronic communications will need to be approved by a resolution of the members of the company. In addition, a member, that is the legal titleholder to shares, will have the right to require the company to send a hard copy version of documents or information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1551W.5/3">The Bill also provides a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to require companies to send documents or information to a person or persons nominated by the member. Such persons could, for example, be those investing in shares through intermediaries. The regulations may require documents or information to be supplied to nominated persons in hard copy form, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the additional benefits to nominated persons would outweigh the likely costs resulting from such an obligation.</p>

This enables staff to vary their times of arrival and departure from work, vary the length and timing of their lunch breaks and take time off if they work extra hours. Staff are required to record the hours that they work either manually or electronically. Flexible working hours (FWH) schemes usually have four week accounting periods and within limits staff can carry over from one accounting period to the next an excess or deficit in the hours they worked compared to their conditioned hours. Credits are given for authorised absences such as visits to the doctor and to allow for the effect of exceptional transport delays.</p>

	<p pid="c.1555W.5/2">The Government have received a number of representations from different parts of industry, including the packaging sector, as well as from many other stakeholders on all aspects of the proposed REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals). These included responses to the UK's public consultation last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1555W.5/3">Within the UK, REACH was subject to a regulatory impact assessment in 2004, and a further impact assessment was carried out this year, which examined the implications of the regulation for some downstream sectors, including can coatings, taking into account information supplied by metal packaging manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1555W.5/4">Across the EU, REACH has been subject to over 50 regulatory impact assessments. This includes the European Commission's extended impact assessment of October 2003, which estimated that changes made to its draft proposals could save up to &euro;10.6 billion. The Commission also carried out a further impact assessment this year in partnership with industry, trade union, consumer and environmental organisations. That assessment considered the impact of REACH on certain downstream users of chemical substances, including flexible packaging manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1555W.5/5">The considerable amount of work carried out in assessing the impact of the REACH proposals has been invaluable in determining costs and benefits, and in informing the negotiations.</p>

The UK Government are in discussion with EU member states about the threats to these tropical rainforests caused by oil palm expansion. The UK Government are taking a number of steps to tackle these issues and these are outlined as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.0/3">The former Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment (appointed in 1999 by the, Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR)) considered palm oil in the context of the scope for retailers and others to influence the supply chain. As part of its work, in 2001, the Committee brought together a number of UK players including several leading retailers, to discuss and identify the scope for practical action to tackle the environmental issues associated with this commodity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.0/4">Building on that experience the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) commissioned, on the Committee's behalf, a feasibility study to assess how a broader sustainable commodities initiative might work as a tool to reduce the negative impact of commodity crops. The study concluded that there was no single best way forward for an initiative to suit all commodities or supply chain actors. Instead an initiative should consist of a coherent set of different activities. The study is available on line at&mdash;<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consumerprod/accpe/research/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consumerprod/accpe/research/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.0/5">Based on the study, the advisory committee made a number of recommendations in its third report, From Principles to Action&quot;, around the need for a policy framework, information, best practice guidance and sharing of experience. These recommendations are being fed into the development of the Government's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.0/6">Defra is commissioning some further research work into the impacts of commodities on the biodiversity in international communities. The outcomes of this work will identify the range of commodities and inform future policy development. palm oil will be one of the commodities studied in this project.</p>
	<p pid="c.1556W.0/7">A Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil has been established, which is running a pilot programme in sustainable palm oil production in Malaysia. This is a two year scheme running from November 2005 which is subject to review at the end of this period. The programme is monitoring whether palm oil can be grown in both a legal and sustainable manner.</p>

	<p pid="c.1557W.12/1">The Government's approach to raising UK competitiveness and closing the productivity gap with our main competitors, such as the USA, is based on maintaining macroeconomic stability to allow firms and individuals to invest for the future, and implementing microeconomic reforms to remove the barriers which prevent markets from functioning efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1557W.12/2">The Government has identified five drivers of productivity: investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competition.

	<p pid="c.1557W.12/3">Examples of DTI policies to boost productivity include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1557W.12/4" class="indent">reforming the competition framework in the UK. The Enterprise Act 2002 has made the UK competition authorities (Competition Commission and OFT) independent, and has given the OFT a more proactive role in investigating markets that may not be working well for consumers;</p>
	<p pid="c.1557W.12/5" class="indent">the Technology Strategy, which supports collaborative R and D and knowledge transfer networks through strong business input. &pound;320 million of funding is available over the period 2005 to 2008; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1557W.12/6" class="indent">the Science Budget; the 2004 Spending Review announced additional funding for the UK's successful science base&mdash;an additional &pound;1 billion for over the spending review period, equivalent to annual growth in funding of 5.8 per cent. in real terms.</p>

Other countries, including the UK, provide assistance (for example, the UK trains non-commissioned officers). The current target strength for the ANA is 70,000 by the end of 2009. Good progress towards this target is being made, with many ANA units now capable of conducting combat operations, albeit with support from international forces, in terms of both equipment and logistics. The ANA is now also well established in the regions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1559W.2/2">The Afghan Ministry of Defence, as the key institution leading the development of the ANA, has made good progress under the leadership of Defence Minister Wardak and with the help of international partners.

	<p pid="c.1563W.0/1">Most consultants used by the Ministry of Defence are engaged to support projects, not to lead them. That said, the mechanisms to assess a consultant's performance will be similar whether the consultancy is acting in a lead or support role. Primarily this will focus on an assessment by the MOD project team of the consultant's performance in relation to the contracted statement of requirements, including any deliverables. In the short term we would expect any shortfalls in the performance of a consultant to be addressed through discussion with the MOD project manager. In the longer term MOD has a contractual remedy for poor performance in DEFCON 92 'Failure of Performance'.</p>

	<p pid="c.1563W.6/2">as the responsible Minister for supervising both the Service Prosecuting Authorities and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1563W.6/3">Where an offence alleged to have been committed by servicemen is triable in England and Wales in either the court martial or the civilian courts, it is ultimately the Attorney General's decision which prosecutor will consider the allegation. The Service Prosecuting Authorities will deal with the vast majority of cases concerning servicemen. However, in exceptional cases the CPS may deal with the allegation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1563W.6/4">Trooper Williams is the only case in the last five years when a criminal case involving military personnel on active service have been transferred from military in which all proceedings are complete to civil jurisdiction for trial.</p>
	<p pid="c.1563W.6/5">The charge against Trooper Williams was murder. He had been charged and had the charge dismissed by his commanding officer without the independent prosecutor, the Army Prosecuting Authority considering the allegation. As a result of the charge being dismissed the provisions of the Army Act 1955 Section 134 (1) precluded him being tried by a court martial for either murder or manslaughter. As a result the Army Prosecuting Authority could not consider the allegation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1563W.6/6">However in accordance with the Army Act 1955 Section 33(1) as Trooper Williams had not been tried for an offence by a court martial, not had an offence committed by him taken into consideration by a court martial in sentencing him nor had the charge dealt with summarily by his commanding officer, a civil court could try him. The case was therefore transferred to the civilian jurisdiction so that the Crown Prosecution Service as an independent prosecutor could consider the allegation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1566W.6/1">The coalition-wide effort to train and equip the Iraqi security forces (ISF) to conduct self-sufficient security operations, border enforcement, and law and order, has, to date, trained more than 206,000 Iraqis nationally, including almost all the Iraqi Army based in MND(SE), and 62 per cent. of the Iraqi Police Service in the United Kingdom area of operations. Coalition funds have procured various vehicles, weapons, airport x-ray machines, communications equipment and infrastructure improvements. The most recent part of a continuing UK programme of assistance to the ISF will see a further &pound;15.5 million of vehicles, communications equipment and infrastructure improvements provided to enhance this capability in MND(SE).</p>

Nangarhar saw the greatest decrease, with opium poppy cultivation dropping by 96 per cent. to 1,093 hectares. Success can be partly attributed to an effective Government of Afghanistan communications campaign in late 2004&ndash;05, which we supported, alongside Governor-led eradication initiatives and a market adjustment to high levels of cultivation in 2004. UNODC are due to publish their final report in the next few weeks, but these figures are unlikely to change.</p>

The UK therefore issues licences for the export or brokering of military goods to destinations and end users covered by an arms embargo only where supply would be consistent with exemptions to the embargo concerned, for example, for humanitarian end-use. We do not issue licenses for destinations where there is a clear risk that exported items might be diverted to embargoed states.

Failure to do so would inevitably reduce the impact and value for money.</p>

It was right to do so. Further reprioritisation will be necessary in the future. The closure of low impact services has released resources for investment in new media services, including the launch of a 12-hour Arabic TV service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1585W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) assesses the effectiveness of consultant-led projects through defined project management processes based on the Office of Government Commerce good practice. Evaluation of success or otherwise is carried out through review processes both at the end of stages within a project, drawing out lessons learned that can be immediately incorporated into later stages of the same project, and through final evaluation in project evaluation reports and post implementation reviews.</p>
	<p pid="c.1585W.5/2">FCO contracts do not include penalty clauses as these are not enforceable in English law. The FCO seeks to reach agreement at the outset on the genuine losses that would be incurred by the FCO in the event of a failure to deliver. These then form the basis of any damages payable to the FCO and are included in the contract as liquidated damages. The FCO also makes wide use of service credit regimes where performance failures lead to pre-agreed reductions in payments to the contractor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1585W.5/3">The FCO does not hold a centralised record of projects conducted by consultants that have been assessed as unsuccessful and the sanctions imposed. This information could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1590W.8/1">The Government's assessment of the effectiveness of the arms embargo on Cote d'Ivoire is based on the reports of the UN group of experts, set up by the UN Security Council to monitor the arms embargo. In its latest report, the group of experts stated that, since the imposition of the arms embargo on Cote d'Ivoire the Government of Cote d'Ivoire has restrained procurement of weapons and munitions. The group found no evidence of recent deliveries of weapons and ammunition to the most prominent militias. However, the group of experts did highlight some cases where the embargo may have been breached. The UN Security Council is now carefully considering these cases. The UK continues, through its membership of the UN Security Council and relevant UN Sanctions Committee, to press for robust enforcement of the UN arms embargo.</p>

This will include ways in which we aim to integrate climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1597W.10/4">At Gleneagles, G8 Heads invited the World Bank to develop and implement best practice&quot; guidelines for screening investments in climate sensitive sectors. The aim would be to determine how impacts related to climate change might affect the performance of such investments. For example, investments in long-life infrastructure, such as housing, roads, bridges and industry, could be at increased risk of flooding or hurricanes. G8 Heads further encouraged all major bilateral and multilateral development organisations to follow suit. DFID is working to begin implementation of such arrangements by 2008. This is in line with the Commission for Africa recommendation.</p>

The Independent Evaluation Office provides comprehensive independent scrutiny of the IMF's work and we are currently contributing to an external evaluation of its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="c.1599W.5/3">Nearly all World Bank documents are made public. The World Bank has also established approximately 65 Public Information Centres around the world, which provide the general public with copies of its publications and access to its website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1599W.5/4">The UK has consistently pressed the World Bank to publish more information, for example, board minutes, executive directors' statements, and country policy and institutional assessment (CPIA) scores. CPIA scores play a significant role in determining how the World Bank allocates its concessional resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.1599W.5/5">Partly as a result of our efforts, a revised World Bank disclosure policy was approved in March 2005. Board minutes will now be made public. All country assistance strategies will be made public as a rule. There will also be a pilot programme of publishing some board documents at the same time as they are sent to the board. In addition, this year, it was agreed that the World Bank would disclose CPIA scores, starting with the 2005 CPIA exercise. We regard these recent moves as significant steps in the right direction. However, we will continue to press for further improvements to transparency and accountability in the World Bank and IMF.</p>

But there is a 'Wirebird' (<i>Charadrius sanctaehelenae</i>), that is endemic to the island. It is currently protected under St. Helena's Endangered Species Protection Ordinance 1996 (as revised in 2001) and is specifically listed in the schedule to the ordinance.</p>

Subsequent attempts to find it, including by the Zoological Society of London, have failed. Were it to be rediscovered, it would be eligible for protection under the same ordinance. It is not currently listed in the schedule.</p>

Some of the packs were distributed to the disaster area but the majority were impounded because they did not comply with US regulations concerning the import of processed meat products from the rest of the world. They also fell foul of a ban on the import of ruminant products from the EU. The UK was not aware that there was a danger of the packs being impounded until after a majority of the ration packs had been sent to the US. Once informed of the problem, the UK stopped the despatch of any further packs from the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1603W.3/1">The Commission informs me that it has undertaken no specific research into the number of electors in each constituency in the United Kingdom who are also on the electoral roll in another constituency. However, in the course of its policy review of the electoral registration process in the United Kingdom, the Commission received a number of submissions raising the issue of dual registration. These submissions informed the Commission's recommendations for reform of the registration process, first published in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1603W.3/2">Although it is possible to be registered at more than one address, it is an offence for an elector to vote more than once in any particular election, as set out in Section 61 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Although it may be possible to detect instances of unlawful double voting by comparison of marked registers after the election, in the absence of a national electronic register there are no mechanisms in place specifically designed to prevent such conduct, or unlawful registration in more than one place.</p>

For continuing postal voters, returning officers cannot, by law, despatch postal ballot packs until after the deadline for changes to existing absent vote arrangements, which is currently 11 days before polling day.

	<p pid="c.1610W.5/24">The freehold of Blythe House at Olympia, London W14 is owned by the Department, and it was last valued for DCMS as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> at a depreciated replacement cost of &pound;21,800,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1610W.5/25">Blythe House is not carried on the Department's balance sheet as the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to lie with the three museums occupying the building for storage, each of which disclose the value of their share in their balance sheet, and has therefore been excluded from this list.</p>
	<p pid="c.1610W.5/26">The National Asset Register also includes the freeholds of properties occupied by DCMS sponsored NDPBs. These have been excluded from this table as the freeholds are vested in the Boards of Trustees of the national museums and galleries and the British Library, each of which is an exempt charity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1616W.3/1">The Department's policy is that every adult in England should have access to a free, integrated information and advice service on learning and work delivered through the national learndirect telephone and on-line advice service and local nextstep information and advice services. Priority is given within this service to those adults who do not have a qualification at Level 2, since they are more likely to lack the skills foundation for employability and lifelong learning, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. In addition, adults participating in any LSC funded learning can also access information and advice services through their learning provider.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.3/2">The White Paper Skills: getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; sets out a long-term ambition: that everyone should be able to get help if and when they want it to take stock of where they are in their lives and their careers; to review where they would like to get to; and assess what steps they can take to get there. We are jointly conducting a review with the Department for Work and Pensions, the DTI, the LSC, Ufi learndirect, Jobcentre Plus, and the Sector Skills Development Agency to help determine how best to achieve this goal, which will be concluded by the end of 2006. We are extending the learndirect telephone service on a trial basis from January 2006 to provide more intensive personal guidance to inform the review. Adults throughout England seeking to progress in their careers; wanting to gain the skills for jobs typically requiring a Level 3 qualification; and returning to work from career breaks, will benefit from the new service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1616W.6/1">I would refer the hon. Member to the reply given on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-03">3 November 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-11-03.1309"><i>Official Report,</i> column 1309W</phrase>, in response to her earlier question on minimum training standards for people who work with autistic children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.6/2">Once qualified, all teachers are expected to identify their development needs through performance management arrangements, and to address identified needs by undertaking appropriate professional development. This includes strengthening knowledge of special educational needs. All schools receive a School Development Grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.6/3">The Department's published SEN Strategy, Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; recognised the importance of training and committed us to work closely with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to ensure that initial teacher training and programmes of continuing professional development provide a good grounding in core skills and knowledge of SEN, which of course covers a wide range of conditions, including autism.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.6/4">We have commissioned the IDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified and established teachers. These initiatives will be implemented over the period 2005&mdash;2008 at a cost of approximately &pound;1.1 million. The TDA will be reviewing its Standards, as part of its new responsibilities for the school work force, and the Department will feed in to that process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.6/5">On the wider children's services front, we have developed the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge to support and focus professional development in the children's work force, including those working for private and voluntary sector. It also covers those working with disadvantaged children as well as those with a disability. The Common Core sets out the areas of expertise that everyone working with children, young people and families (including those who work as volunteers) should be able to demonstrate. It sets out the skills and knowledge that, if accredited, could form the basis of a minimum competence for working with children, young people and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1616W.6/6">There is funding available under the National Training Strategy Grant and Human Resources Development Strategy through local authorities and other organisations, for a number of initiatives to support social work, education and training, provide financial support to students and strengthen the social work and social care work force (with children and adults). It would be appropriate for some of this to be used for training for those in children's services working with children with autism, but the Government does not specify a proportion that has to be used in this way.</p>

	<p pid="c.1617W.2/1">The Basic Skills Agency (BSA) has received a total of &pound;52 million in core grant funding since the 1996&ndash;97 financial year. The agency has also received additional funding for fixed term initiatives and contracts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1617W.2/2">The BSA as a 'near to Government body', was subject to a quinquennial review in 2001. The review reported positively that BSA was making</p>
	<p pid="c.1617W.2/3" class="indent">a valuable contribution across the breadth of its activities&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1617W.2/5" class="indent">a very strong case for retention of the Agency as an independent body at arms length to the Department, with a remit which continues to cover basic skills both for pupils and adults&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1617W.2/6">The Department for Education and Skills regularly reviews the Agency's performance and is responsible for approving the BSA's strategic plan and annual delivery plan. DfES continues to work closely with the BSA on the delivery of its current three-year strategic plan and annual delivery plan, which is supported by DfES core funding. BSA's performance is reviewed each month against their delivery plan and their core grant is paid on the basis of this assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1621W.8/1">Our 14 to 19 and Skills White Papers clearly articulate our priorities for post-14 education and training. Higher participation among young people must have the highest priority, alongside helping disadvantaged adults gain basic and Level 2 skills for employability and progression to Level 3. Starting from these strategic objectives we have reviewed the SR2004 settlement announced in April 2004 and we have agreed a funding strategy with the LSC for the next two years that is driven by policy priorities and the successes of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1621W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1621W.8/3">In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success'&mdash;a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1621W.8/4">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14 to 19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult work force. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1621W.8/5">We confirmed our overall funding to the LSC for 2006&ndash;07 in our grant letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-30">30 October 2005</phrase>. The LSC will now allocate resources to regions, and local LSCs will make initial allocations to colleges in January 2006 for 2006/07.</p>

Prescribed higher education courses represents the vast majority of publicly funded higher education courses. The LSC funds a proportion of non-prescribed&quot; vocational and professional courses at levels 4 and 5. In 2003/04 there were 72,000 learners studying non-prescribed higher education courses in FECs and a further 70,000 learners studying prescribed higher education in FECs.

	<p pid="c.1624W.5/1">The Learning and Skills Council's document Priorities for Success&quot; and the Secretary of State's grant letter to the LSC for 2006&ndash;07 both stress the importance of learning and skills for offenders as the LSC moves to take full responsibility for planning and funding this group of learners from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>. The resources transferring from the Department to the LSC to fund these new responsibilities will be ring-fenced for offender learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1624W.5/2">Engagement of offender learning with mainstream provision is a key benefit of the LSC taking up its new responsibilities. Priorities for Success&quot; will mean mainstream providers are encouraged to focus on the needs of offender learners, especially those who continue courses of study that were started while in custody, with a consequent focusing of the public funds already in the system onto this priority group.</p>

	<p pid="c.1625W.5/1">The Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November 2005</phrase> our plans for narrowing the funding gap between school sixth forms and Further Education (FE) colleges for like-for-like 16&ndash;19 provision. We recognise that the funding gap will not be easy to close but we have taken some important steps in the funding package we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>. We have confirmed that for young people in FE in 2006/07 we will match the Schools' Minimum Funding Guarantee, which will be announced later this year. We estimate that this, together with other measures to correct technical anomalies, will reduce the gap from 13 per cent. to 8 per cent. by 2006/07. From 2008 we will look to bring consistency to the treatment of student retention and achievement across school sixth forms and colleges which we expect to narrow the gap by a further 3 per cent.. Beyond that we will work to establish a common funding approach across the two sectors as part of the Learning and Skills Council's Agenda for Change.</p>

It will normally be for individual governing bodies to decide such proposals, but where the governing body has failed to take proper account of the views of a majority of parents or there are serious concerns about the impact of the acquisition of the trust on school standards, the local authority may refer the proposals to the Schools Adjudicator whose decision on them will be final.</p>

	<p pid="c.1628W.2/1">It has been drawn to my attention that while the answer I made to question 24962 was done so in good faith and was based upon information passed to me by officials, it was inaccurate in its interpretation of the evidence referred to. I very much regret this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1628W.2/2">The Department is currently undertaking a longitudinal study of literacy and numeracy learners in FE colleges&mdash;a subset of Skills for Life learners. Reports on both the first and second stages of the survey will be published at the end of November 2005. The study found that 25 per cent. of this learner group had no qualifications and 86 per cent. had neither English nor Maths at Level 2 [a good GCSE A*-C]. In addition, 32 per cent. of this learner group were continuing with their full time education while 68 per cent. of learners had left. Among those who had left, 70 per cent. had left at age 16 or under. However, this does not rule out the possibility that these learners will have undertaken any post-16 education.</p>
	<p pid="c.1628W.2/3">There is further published evidence that also suggests a large proportion of participants on Skills for Life courses may have left school at or before the minimum age and may have no formal educational qualifications. I have placed in the Library of the House copies of two published DfES research reports which contain this evidence: Evaluation of Adult Basic Skills Pathfinder Extension Activities: An Overview&quot; by Michael White of the Policy Studies Institute; and Evaluation Outcomes for Learners in Pathfinder Areas&quot;, which the company Taylor Nelson Sofres were commissioned to conduct.</p>

	<p pid="c.1629W.8/1">The White Paper Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; published in March this year made it clear that the lessons learnt from the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) will influence the development of a quality National Employer Training Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1629W.8/2">The evidence from the pilots shows that the skills brokers are a tried and tested method of engaging employers in the development of their businesses and employees and is a key element of the success of the pilots. For example, the ETP Year 2 Evaluation carried out by the Institute for Employment Studies and published alongside the White Paper, shows that brokers have been very successful in helping to engage hard to reach employers. The evaluation showed these employers found the role of brokers in carrying out a training needs analysis a major attraction. 63 per cent. of hard to reach employers cited the help of brokers linking training to business needs as an attraction of ETP (as did 55 per cent. of easy to reach employers) and thus helping to maximise the added value of the programme. Employers saw the support given to help them access flexible and responsive provision that meets their needs as a major attraction of the pilots (76 per cent. of employers cited flexibly delivered training as an attraction of ETP and 19 per cent. said it was the most attractive feature). Helping to broker the right learning for the employers and learners helps to reduce dropout and ensure high success rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.1630W.2/1">The White Paper Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; published in March this year clearly states that at the heart of the National Employer Training Programme is a brokerage service that will work on behalf of the employer.&quot; Skills brokers will provide independent and impartial advice to employers on the best type of training available and then source its delivery, to meet employer needs. Brokers will help employers find their way through the often complex world of skills training and help them develop relationships with training providers which will give them the best return on their investment. Brokers are there to make the employer's search for suitable training simpler and cost-effective. Once a training relationship to meet employer's needs is in place, it is for the employer and training provider to work directly together. So long as the employer is satisfied with the quality of training they are getting, the training provider can carry on supplying it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1630W.2/2">Brokers will particularly focus on reaching employers who may otherwise not invest in training, particularly small and medium-sized employers. The White Paper clearly states that raising the skill levels of this group is a fundamental aim.</p>

	<p pid="c.1631W.6/1">The Assets Recovery Agency has had a significant impact on organised criminals in Northern Ireland. During 2004&ndash;05 the Agency in Northern Ireland disrupted eight criminal gangs, restrained &pound;3.7 million, obtained recovery orders and tax assessments to the value of almost &pound;1.5 million and realised receipts to the value of &pound;780,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1631W.6/2">The Agency is making good progress against the targets set in this year's business plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.1631W.6/3">A new assets recovery incentive scheme, to commence in 2006&ndash;07, will enable all law enforcement agencies to receive a 50 per cent. share of the receipts from confiscations. In addition, the Organised Crime Task Force plans to develop an assets recovery strategy in consultation with Task Force partner agencies, including the NI Departments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1632W.2/1">I am aware that these terrible tragedies continue to be painful for the victims and for their relatives. The British Government welcomed the establishment of the Barron Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and co-operated with it as fully as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1632W.2/2">As Justice Barron recognised, we have a responsibility to ensure the personal safety of individuals, and this was a factor in the way in which the material he requested on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was passed to the inquiry. For that reason we did not provide Justice Barron with original documents. However, the information passed to his inquiry accurately reflects all the relevant information on the Dublin/Monaghan bombings uncovered by the Government's trawl of its files.</p>
	<p pid="c.1632W.2/3">This information has also recently been made available by the British Government to Patrick MacEntee, sole member of the new Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974. In addition to this, we have provided Mr. MacEntee with further information which he has requested in relation to his specific terms of reference.</p>

	<p pid="c.1637W.5/1">Under schedule 3 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 the Board is required to fund 75 per cent. of the expenses reasonably incurred by the council in that year in connection with the establishment of, or the exercise of functions by, a DPP. The council funds the remaining 25 per cent. The Policing Board has advised me that the figures represent the expenditure apportioned to each DPP.</p>

Enforcement activity in respect of failure to wear seatbelts is largely by way of non-endorsable fixed penalty notices and figures in relation to this have been placed in the Library. Figures relating to prosecutions for failure to wear a seatbelt are not available for 2000&ndash;03, however I can confirm that the number of prosecutions in 2004 was 1,756.</p>

The Office of Communications (Ofcom) will, therefore, in the early part of 2006, be issuing a public consultation on broadcast advertising and promotion of food to children. As broadcast advertising is not a devolved matter, the consultation will be carried out on a UK-wide basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1641W.3/25">It is a criminal offence to have a knife in public without good reason or lawful authority and it is an offence to manufacture, sell or lend an offensive weapon or, for example, a flick knife. The police have a number of stop-and-search powers do deal with persons suspected of carrying knives. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (PACE) police have powers to stop and search a person or vehicle where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will find any article in relation to an offence of having an article with a blade or sharp point&mdash;with the exception of certain folding pocket knives&mdash;in a public place. The Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 allows police to stop and search any person or vehicle for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments whether or not they have reasonable grounds for suspicion in order to prevent serious violence in a locality. It is also an offence to have a knife or offensive weapon in a school, and the police may enter a school to search for such items. My Officials have been in contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to knife crime and legislation and following consultation with the Home Office I have decided to extend to Northern Ireland those provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will raise the age at which a person may lawfully be sold a knife from 16 to 18 years of age. I have no immediate plans for further change but I will keep the law in this sensitive and difficult area under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1659W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1659W.2/2">The Government recognise that giving evidence in court can be a traumatic experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.1659W.2/3">Because of the nature of sexual offences and the sensitivity of the evidence that is given, complainants in sexual offences are automatically eligible for special measures unless they advise the court that they do not want such assistance. Witnesses aged under 17 years are also automatically eligible for special measures assistance. A victim of domestic violence who falls into one of these categories will be eligible automatically for special measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1659W.2/4">Other complainants and witnesses, including those who are victims of domestic violence but who do not fall into these automatic categories, whose quality of evidence may be diminished by reason of incapacity or because of fear or distress about testifying can apply to the court for a special measures direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1659W.2/5">The Government believe that allowing courts to apply these principles strikes the right balance enabling measures to be taken which are appropriate to the particular circumstances of a case taking account of the needs and wishes of individual complainants and witnesses. We have no plans to amend the legislation to make special measures automatic in cases of domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1659W.2/6">In addition to the practical measures available in cases of domestic violence, the specialist domestic violence courts programme we are taking forward is about situating the court and the criminal justice system as part of a community wide response to domestic violence which places the victim at the heart of the process. We have a programme in place to expand the existing network of specialist courts across the country and propose to develop courts in 25 areas by April 2006. Additional funding of &pound;1 million was announced in October 2005 to expand the programme further in 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="c.1664W.8/1">The method of calculation was taken from the 'New Perspectives Series' published by Thomson Leaning entitled 'Computer Concepts, Fourth Edition, Enhanced' (June Parsons and Dan Oja, Chapter 4, Section D), which calculates that a computer hard drive of 20.4 gigabytes would equate to 5.4 million sheets of single spaced normal text, which would in turn produce a stack of paper around 1,800 feet high. The computer hard drive in question equalled 750 gigabytes which would, therefore, have produced the equivalent of 198 million sheets of paper standing at 66,176 feet high.</p>

	<p pid="c.1665W.9/2">Between July 2001 and May 2005, a total of 144,360 people had registered with a new deal for disabled people (NDDP) job broker. The number of people gaining a job up to May 2005, following registration with an NDDP job broker, was 59,560. Of these, 29,170 (20.2 per cent.) found sustained full-time jobs and 16,420 (11.4 per cent.) found unsustained full time jobs; 8,620 people (59.7 per cent.) found sustained part-time jobs and 5,340 (3.7 per cent.) found unsustained part-time jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1665W.9/3">In the same period, 84,800 (58.7 per cent.) of those registered with an NDDP job broker had not yet found work. However, 67,230 of these were still participating in the programme and so may go on to gain a job.</p>

	<p pid="c.1665W.9/5">1. For the purposes of new deal for disabled people, a job is regarded as sustained when a person, placed into work through an NDDP job broker, remains in work for 13 out of 39 weeks. Prior to October 2003, an NDDP job was regarded as sustained when a person, placed into work through an NDDP job broker, remained in work for 26 out of 39 weeks. 2. NDDP jobs data relates only to the number of individuals gaining a job through an NDDP job broker. A measure of sustainability is not available for non-job broker jobs. 3. Although data are now available on people into jobs through NDDP up to the end of August 2005, data provided is up to the end of May 2005, to allow three months for the job to be recorded as sustained. 4. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>

	<p pid="c.1666W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is undergoing a massive change programme. We are making substantial investment to modernise our IT, which will result in an improved service to customers, irrespective of where they live. We currently have rolled out around 2/3 of the national network using the CMS system. Initially, we encountered some problems with performance and reliability, but these have been dealt with through a series of performance releases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1666W.2/5" class="indent">CMS now performs to agreed service levels. However, in recent weeks our customers have experienced difficulties in getting through to our contact centres. We have taken steps to tackle these problems, by introducing temporary adjustments, including some clerical activities, to streamline business processes whilst we go through this transition period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1666W.2/6" class="indent">The current position is that we have 9 of our 24 contact centres operating some clerical processes. The extent of clerical activity will vary between different offices. It is not possible to identify the proportion of claims not subject to the full CMS processes, but we continue to deliver full CMS supported processes in around two-thirds of our contact centres and in well over three-quarters of linked sites. This situation is changing all of the time. Early indications are encouraging, and we have seen week-on-week improvements in call handling since the beginning of September.</p>

	<p pid="c.1667W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning what percentage of benefit claims have taken longer than the 12-day target to process and the average time taken to process a benefit claim in the integrated benefit system pilot areas. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1667W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is currently in the process of rolling out its integrated offices and so the number of such outlets changes quickly and, at the same time, we are rationalising and centralising the sites where benefit processing is carried out.</p>
	<p pid="c.1667W.8/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus administers many types of benefit. There are two that have a 12-day clearance target: Job Seeker's Allowance and Income Support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1667W.8/6" class="indent">Processing Centres keep statistics about the number of claims that are cleared and how long it took. The statistics only show where the claim was processed, not where it originated. Processing Centres have no means to differentiate between claims that have been made via its new integrated offices and existing service outlets. Unfortunately, this means that we cannot answer the question in the manner in which you requested the information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1667W.8/7" class="indent">We can say, however, that in September, Jobcentre plus had processed 180,639 claims to Job Seeker's Allowance and had completed 93.3% of these within the12 day clearance target. I am pleased to say that the Actual Average Clearance time for Income Support was 10.8 days, which is well within our target.</p>

	<p pid="c.1669W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie to Mr. Tim Boswell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-21">21 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply to your enquiry concerning the operation of the second generation Customer Management System (CMS) in Contact Centres and benefit offices. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/4" class="indent">CMS is the IT system that has been implemented to support a number of changes in the way our customers claim Jobcentre Plus benefits. These changes are part of a wider programme of service delivery modernisation in Jobcentre Plus that also includes, for example, greater use of telephone based contact with our customers and the adoption of standard operating processes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/5" class="indent">CMS was first introduced in Livingston in July 2003 and rollout to other sites commenced in October 2003. A second release was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-13">13 December 2004</phrase>, which made a number of improvements. This included electronic data transfer of information gathered in CMS directly into the Income Support Computer and Jobseeker's Allowance Payment Systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/6" class="indent">With any major change, there is often a period of 'settling in' and this has been the case for the introduction of CMS and the new processes that it supports. Initially we encountered some difficulties in terms of speed, capacity and reliability of the system, although, not entirely to do with CMS itself but related to complementary systems that CMS relies upon. A series of technical releases have largely addressed these issues and the computer system itself is now performing as expected.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/7" class="indent">As with all IT systems CMS has meant a significant change in the way staff in Jobcentre Plus do their job. They require a good understanding of how the whole process links together, including the importance of gathering information on behalf of Local Authorities (LA) and of getting it right at each stage. To support this we have developed in consultation with practitioners, a toolkit&quot; of advice and guidance aimed at all relevant staff and managers designed to explain and reinforce correct practice and allow managers to monitor consistently. Key messages have also been enhanced in the learning and development material being delivered to our staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/8" class="indent">Despite this programme of improvement work, we know from feedback from LAs that there is further work to be done to ensure that the operation of CMS is successful. The process works best in those LAs where there are effective liaison arrangements between Jobcentre Plus and the LA. Ongoing improvement work is overseen by a joint DWP/Local Authority Association (LAA) steering group. The introduction of CMS Release 3 on 31st October 2005 addressed many of the issues around the amount of clerical documentation associated with the initial releases. The removal of these clerical workarounds through this release will lead to further improvements and will be evaluated by the LAA in early 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/9" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is undergoing a massive change programme and is making considerable investment in improved information technology. However change on this scale does create challenges in maintaining levels of customer service for some parts of the business during this period of transition and transformation. As a result, some customers claiming working age benefits have, of late, experienced difficulties getting through to some of our contact centres. We have put measures in place to address this, including temporary adjustments to streamline business processes in order to maintain customer service whilst we go through this transition period. We have also strengthened recruitment plans supported by robust training programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/10" class="indent">Early indications following the process adjustments are encouraging. We have seen week on week improvements in customer service since beginning of September. Whilst we have sought to minimise the impact of these changes for our staff and customers, some disruption has been unavoidable and this may regrettably contribute to delays in processing benefit claims for some customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1669W.0/11" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1671W.6/23" class="indent">I am unable to comment on the 11 weeks that it takes on average for an income support appeal to reach the Appeals Service, as this is a matter for the first tier agency preparing the appeal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1671W.6/24" class="indent">The 14 week figure quoted takes into account the duration from receipt of the appeal until its conclusion and includes those appeals that are adjourned at first hearing upon judicial direction. This, therefore, increases the overall duration and is an issue outside of my remit of responsibility for the Administration of this Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1671W.6/25" class="indent">I can also let you know that the Secretary of State set a target for 2004&ndash;05 that the average waiting time for an appeal to be heard from receipt in the Appeals Service should be no more than 11 weeks and we met this target during 2004&ndash;05 for all appeals. specifically for income support appeals, we achieved a 10.3 weeks average waiting time. During this period, the average clearance time for an appeal from receipt in the Appeals Service, including those cases cleared before a tribunal hearing, was 8.89 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1671W.6/26" class="indent">We are constantly looking at ways in which to improve the level of service that we offer our customers. We are working with the first tier agencies to agree national service agreements in order to establish, amongst other things, a reduced end-to-end clearance target. We are also currently looking at how to improve our customers' overall experience of our Service, including reducing the time they must wait for their appeal to be heard, and we will be capturing customer feedback on this.</p>

	<p pid="c.1673W.0/15" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain the background to these figures. Although data indicates there has been a rise in the number of incidents reported in the last 3 years it is not possible to identify any causal relationships. Not only are there significant variables such as staffing levels, types and numbers of offices and methods of service delivery over this period which render year on year comparisons, this period also coincides with a number of initiatives within the Department encouraging staff to report all incidents so that lessons can be learned and appropriate remedial action taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.1674W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the efficiency of the computer system dealing with the processing of claims for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1674W.2/4" class="indent">Claims to JSA are processed using two computer systems. The JSA Payments Systems (JSAPS) which was implemented in 1996 is used to process completed claims and make payments of JSA to customers. This system has a very good record of reliability. Since 2003 Jobcentre Plus has been introducing a new process for taking claims for benefit, supported by the Customer Management computer system (CMS).</p>
	<p pid="c.1674W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is undergoing a massive change programme and is making considerable investment in improved IT. CMS is the first stage of our IT modernisation programme and is being implemented as part of the roll out programme to support the Jobcentre Plus new and repeat claim standard operating model. We started to introduce CMS in October 2003 and we brought in additional enhancements in December 2004 with CMS release 2. CMS Release 2 introduced new functionality to enable electronic data transfer from CMS to legacy benefit systems including JSAPS. Electronic data transfer replaces the need for manual re-keying of information that has already been gathered in CMS as part of the new claims process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1674W.2/6" class="indent">The modifications introduced by CMS release 2 led to some transitional problems with reliability and speed. These problems have since been addressed through a series of performance releases and CMS and is now delivering as agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1674W.2/7" class="indent">CMS Release 3, which went live on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>, has been driven by user feedback and introduced a number of enhancements that make the process easier to follow and reduces the opportunity for error and the subsequent need for re-work. The enhancements to CMS Release 3 have been well received by staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.1675W.3/29">The cost of helping people into work varies across the New Deals as programmes have different client groups and components. People on the mandatory New Deal programmes have generally been claiming jobseeker's allowance for some time, and can require more intensive support to overcome employment barriers than those participating on some of the voluntary New Deals. Costs can also be higher if allowances are paid to participants and employers, and can also be influenced by payments to external providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1675W.3/30">An investment in helping people into work, including those claiming Incapacity benefit, not only makes an immediate difference to those individuals, but also results in savings to the economy in future benefit payments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1678W.2/2">The information provided in my previous answer was sourced from Information Directorate 5 per cent. sample data. There are no additional breakdowns available from 5 per cent. sample data to those provided in that answer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1678W.2/3">Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) 100 per cent. data offers the potential to follow benefit claimants who move onto employment schemes or into work. However, we do not expect to be in a position to release WPLS-based figures on benefit leavers into employment until the second half of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1678W.2/4">In the meantime, the annual Destination of Benefit Leavers Survey provides estimates on the proportion of benefit leavers who go to work, education and training, other benefits and so on. The latest published figures from the 2004 survey show that 52 per cent. of incapacity benefit leavers nationally moved into work of 16 hours or more per week.</p>

	<p pid="c.1680W.2/1">The figure for the amount spent on state pensions as a whole in the UK as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is 5.5 per cent. Studies by the European Union's Economic Policy Committee have shown the average figure for the European Union 15 is 10.5 per cent., with the UK's system deemed to be sustainable in the long-term. Such figures do not, of course, take account of non-state provision, which is significantly higher in the UK than in many other member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.1680W.2/2">It should be stressed that the UK's system of support for the elderly is aimed at addressing poverty as well as replacing in-work income. An up-to-date and more indicative comparison is the harmonised expenditure on the elderly as a percentage of GDP. The European Statistical Agency's data published in October 2005 show that the UK spent 11.7 per cent. in 2002 (before the introduction of pension credit and age-related payments), which is at the upper end of the overall range of expenditure in EU member states, of between 3.6 and 14.9 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1681W.0/4" class="indent">Since April 2005 The Pension Service has offered a full holistic benefit entitlement check on all visits to customers, as a standard service. Also a specific campaign has been run to contact customers we believe to be highly eligible for additional benefits. Between April and October 2005 The Pension Service made 106,427 approaches by letter, 16,291 by telephone, and 9,039 through visits. As a result of the campaign and routine visits 549,849 customers were offered a benefit entitlement check.</p>
	<p pid="c.1681W.0/5" class="indent">The initial home visit is arranged either by ringing the customer and agreeing a date and time or by sending out a letter. In the latter instance, a contact number is provided in case the date is not convenient or if the customer chooses not to be visited. If the customer is not in, they are either contacted by phone if a number is available and an appointment rearranged or a further letter is sent out advising the customer of the new appointment. It is standard practice for two attempted visits to be made on different days of the week at different times. Contact details are left with the customer should they choose to take up the benefit entitlement check.</p>
	<p pid="c.1681W.0/6" class="indent">It is not possible to separate the costs of the full entitlement check from other Local Service activity however, the additional cost of the entitlement campaign from April&mdash;October 2005 was &pound;1,088,000. The cumulative value of additional benefit generated over a full year is estimated at &pound;350 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1691W.0/1">Government remain strongly committed to the principle that infrastructure must be sufficient to support growth and is an essential element in achieving more sustainable communities. For example, between 1998&ndash;99 and 2002&ndash;03 public spending in the South East and Eastern Regions increased by over 17 per cent. in real terms per head of population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1691W.0/2">The Government's approach is to ensure that infrastructure, including public services, is provided in step with growth, as plans for individual growth locations are developed. The main elements of this approach are ensuring that mainstream funding reflects the needs of growth, maximising the potential for private sector contributions and making available selective additional grant funding to unlock major growth schemes and locations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1691W.0/3">Assessing the infrastructure requirements for particular localities is a complex and lengthy process. It needs to assess the detailed layout of a development as it evolves and to allow for changing approaches to service provision affecting what is needed and when. The Government are encouraging local delivery partners to focus on identifying, prioritising and sourcing investment in their locations&mdash;based on their individual circumstances and priorities, and using a mix of public and private funding. This approach is being taken forward in the Milton Keynes Prospectus and is being developed in other growth location business plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.1691W.0/4">The Government's aim is to provide as much information as it can on likely future levels of support but this needs to be made within the context of the public expenditure cycle.</p>

	<p pid="c.1697W.2/1">The Government have introduced a wide range of measures to ensure that elderly people who live in the privately rented sector can enjoy decent homes that are warm and free of hazards. The provisions in the Housing Act 2004 to enable local authorities to assess properties against a range of health and safety criteria will tackle the worst conditions&mdash;cold, damp, and the risk of falls. These will be reinforced by provisions which require many of the higher risk properties in the sector to be licensed in order to improve management standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1697W.2/2">In addition, a range of financial assistance and advice is available to improve living conditions in the sector. Local authorities have powers under the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) Order 2002 to provide assistance either to landlords or tenants for this purpose. The types of assistance on offer are a matter for local discretion.</p>
	<p pid="c.1697W.2/3">The Government policy has also taken steps to increase the number of warm homes that are energy efficient. Private tenants can seek advice from the Energy Saving Trust, and in his recent Budgets my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has provided through the landlords energy saving allowance important tax reliefs to private landlords who invest in energy saving measures such as cavity wall insulation and double glazing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1697W.2/4">The 'Warm Front' scheme tackles fuel poverty among vulnerable households in both the private rented and owner occupied sectors. The scheme provides grants for packages of insulation and heating improvements, including central heating systems, for eligible households. It is available for landlords with tenants on benefits, provided the tenant stays with the landlord for at least two years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1703W.5/1">The statutory responsibilities of the Listing Officers employed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) to compile and maintain valuation lists for council tax purposes in England continue. For the current (1993) lists this means banding new properties, amending the banding of existing properties and deleting entries from the lists where properties are demolished or converted to non-domestic use. (Amendments to bandings may occur where there are physical changes that would result in a lower band, or where an improvement has been made that would take the property into a higher band and there has been a subsequent sale.) These activities will now be undertaken with the benefit of the newly digitised database of property records, which the VOA will ensure is comprehensive and up to date. This means that the VOA can introduce improved processes for handling data internally&mdash;as it will no longer be reliant on paper records&mdash;and can also provide a better service to council tax payers and to billing authorities in relation to the 1993 lists. In particular it will be better placed to deal quickly with enquiries or appeals from tax payers about their current bandings. Additionally, to secure the investment made to date in the automated valuation model technology, the VOA will complete the necessary work to ensure that the model is available for use in all its locations. Although introduced to support the 2007 revaluation, the VOA plans to use the model's capability to support the 1993 lists and also for other valuation work on domestic property which it undertakes within its statutory remit.</p>

Since that time an estimated 85,000 frontline NHS staff have been trained to prevent and manage violence.

Other initiatives include the introduction of professional skills and expertise at local level through the role of the local security management specialist who is trained to tackle security-related problems such as violence against NHS staff; this is supported by accredited training, advice and guidance from the NHS SMS. A key project of the NHS SMS will be to build strong links locally with the police and Crown Prosecution Service to ensure all cases of assaults are professionally investigated and prosecuted where appropriate. This will be supported by a memorandum of understanding between the NHS and the Association of Chief Police Officers, as well as advice and guidance from the NHS SMS legal protection unit.</p>

The plan stated that some issues would be considered in the context of next steps on Independence, Well-being and Choice&quot;, which will be set out in the forthcoming White Paper planned to be published at the turn of the year. The Government also committed to consider through the review of the national minimum standards (NMS) and associated regulations the most effective way to address other issues. It intends to issue revised NMS and regulations for consultation in spring 2006, with the intention of implementing changes from April 2007.</p>

Many of the key recommendations from the report are either already being implemented or are being taken forward for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1710W.8/3">For example, the Department has consulted on a draft code of conduct, which aims to establish clear expectations on how organisations will conduct business under payment by results and the Department will be finalising the code of conduct for next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1711W.8/1">An application for authorisation of products derived from GA21 maize was made to the Dutch authorities in 1998 under the novel foods regulation (EC) No. 258/97. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the UK Competent Authority under the novel foods regulation and seeks expert advice on the safety of Genetically Modified foods from the independent Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP).</p>
	<p pid="c.1711W.8/2">The dossier on GA21 maize was reviewed by the ACNFP during 2000. They identified certain shortcomings in the available data and its advice formed the basis of the United Kingdom's objection to the initial assessment report from the Dutch Competent Authority. These shortcomings, and questions raised by other member states, were addressed by Monsanto in a supplementary dossier that they provided to the EC Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) for further assessment. The SCF concluded in March 2002 that GA21 maize is as safe as conventional, non-GM maize.</p>
	<p pid="c.1711W.8/3">As the supplementary data and the SCF evaluation answered the ACNFP's initial questions, the FSA has advised Ministers that GA21 maize meets the necessary criteria for authorisation. The UK therefore voted in favour when European Union member states voted on the authorisation of GA21 maize in April and October of this year.</p>

This is, however, an issue tied into the wider question of the meaning given to public authority in the Human Rights Act 1998 and elsewhere in discrimination law and it will, therefore, be considered in the context of the discrimination law review currently being undertaken by the Government.</p>

Payment to the supplier depends on system deployment. This incentivises deployment, and payments can be clawed back where subsequent milestones are not met.

The review, led by the national ambulance adviser, supported by a group of stakeholders, sets out how ambulance services can be transformed from a service focusing primarily on resuscitation, trauma and acute care towards becoming a mobile health resource for the whole NHS&mdash;taking healthcare to the patient in the community.</p>

We are therefore proposing that there should be fewer, bigger ambulance trusts and will be undertaking public consultation on these proposals this winter. These proposals will ensure resources are targeted to where they are most needed&mdash;improving patient care and supporting front-line services. A three-month statutory consultation on the reconfiguration of ambulance trusts is expected to commence early next month.</p>

	<p pid="c.1723W.5/51">5. Figures are not consistent over the period (1971&ndash;72 to 2004&ndash;05), hence no comparisons should be made across different periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.1723W.5/52">6. Table is based on 2004&ndash;05 prices using the gross domestic product deflator series as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-28">28 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1723W.5/53">7. Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) pay and price inflation is a weighted aveage of two separate inflation indices, the pay cost index (PCI) and the health service cost indes (HSCI). Up to and including 1984&ndash;85, pay inflation was calculated using the pay settlements. From 1985&ndash;86 the PCI measures pay inflation in the HCHS. The PCI is itself a weighted average of increases in unit staff costs for each of the staff groups within the HCHS sector. Pay cost inflation tends to be higher than pay settlement inflation, because of an element of pay drift within each staff group. Pay drift is the tendency for there to be a gradual shift up the incremental scales, and is additional to settlement inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1723W.5/54">8. The HSCI is calculated monthly to measure the price change for each of 41 sub-indices of goods and services purchased by the HCHS. The sub-indices are weighted together according to the proportion of total expenditure which they represent to give the overall HSCI value. The pay cost index and the health service cost index are weighted together according to the proportion of HCHS expenditure on each. This provides an HCHS combined pay and prices inflation figure.</p>

In July 2004, the Government set a public service agreement (PSA) target to halt the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 by 2010 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.1727W.3/2">The White Paper delivery plan, Delivering Choosing Health: making healthier choices easier&quot;, together with discrete plans focusing on nutrition, Choosing a Better Diet a food and health action plan&quot; and physical activity, Choosing Activity: a physical activity action plan&quot; published in March 2005 set out how the White Paper commitments will be delivered and how they will contribute to delivery of the obesity target.</p>
	<p pid="c.1727W.3/3">Specific action will include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1727W.3/4" class="indent">Campaigns&mdash;to raise awareness;</p>

However, the Government's approach to noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss assessment is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts including an Industrial Injuries Advisory Council review which confirmed the appropriateness of the threshold in November 2002. Any change to our approach would need to result from further medical and scientific evidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1736W.5/1">The general policy for the replacement of retiring police chief constables is in line with section four of the Home Office guidance on the appointment process of chief police officers (available on the Home Office Police website at <a href="http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/trainingandcareerdevelopment/index.html/chiefofficerrecruit.html/">http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/trainingandcareerdevelopment/index.html/chiefofficer recruit.html/</a>) and section 11 Police Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="c.1736W.5/2">In his capacity as chair of the Senior Appointments Panel (a tri-partite body which advises me in the exercise of my role in approving chief police officer appointments) Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, recently wrote to police authorities addressing the implications of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's 'Closing the Gap' report on the current structure of policing. The letter presented the panel's view that, except where specific approval had already been granted, the common sense approach would be to advise police authorities not to proceed with existing or future plans to recruit new chief constables and accordingly sought their support in maintaining a consistent approach in these exceptional circumstances. I am placing a copy of this letter in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.1737W.2/1">The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) are working closely together to prevent the deaths of young people held in their care. The YJB has funded a dedicated juvenile outreach team to assist juvenile establishments further develop and maintain their local suicide and self-harm prevention strategies. Nationally, there is a specific suicide prevention strategy for juvenile prisoners. This focuses on promotion of peer support through insider schemes; counselling, support groups and specialised psychological intervention for those who self-harm; vulnerability recognition; and child protection training. We continue to learn lessons from previous incidents to inform our strategies for the future. Suicide prevention work is also increasingly linked with the wider Safeguards Development Programme, as part of which safeguards managers and local authority social workers have been appointed at juvenile establishments, and there has been a programme of minor works across establishments to improve provision of safer and reduced risk accommodation and other built-environment improvements.</p>

We have made available to the courts strong community penalties, with more young offenders being intensively supervised in the community to help reduce re-offending. The Youth Justice Board is also committed to lowering the number of young people in custody and has a target to reduce the population of those remanded and sentenced to secure facilities by 10 per cent. by March 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1743W.5/1">The Government are committed to every area in England and Wales benefiting from dedicated, visible, accessible and responsive neighbourhood policing teams by 2008. A key aim of these teams will be to build more effective engagement with the public. To support this, the Home Office and the Association of Police Authorities convened the National Practitioner Panel for Community Engagement in Policing.</p>
	<p pid="c.1743W.5/2">The panel has created a Guide to Community Engagement which is a resource for all policing practitioners, and which contains both practical and strategic advice for practitioners who want to develop or improve their approach to engagement. The guide is supported by a database of case studies which showcases recent and ongoing work around the country, and encourages policing practitioners to network with, and learn from, their peers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1743W.5/3">The Government are working closely with the Police Service to develop neighbourhood policing, initially within pathfinder areas. In Hertfordshire, this is the Eastern Area Basic Command Unit.</p>

	<p pid="c.1744W.2/1">The Government are currently taking forward a very full range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1744W.2/2">In Hertfordshire, street crime, alcohol-related violence and disorder and domestic violence have been identified as priorities, with alcohol as a particular target. The 10 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships have action plans in place at a local level, and additionally there are multi-agency Town Centre Crime Reduction Groups (for example in Watford and Hemel) which focus on violent crime in town-centres where the majority of it occurs. Strategies include enforcement of town-centre no-drinking zones, education within schools, licensed premises inspections, expansion of CCTV coverage and training for CCTV operators, enforcement of underage drinking laws and regular police public order patrols in town centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.1744W.2/3">Nationally, there is a huge programme of work. We are, for example, introducing new measures which will give police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which is currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1744W.2/4">We have also introduced Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which will make incitement of hatred against persons on the basis of their faith a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1744W.2/5">Domestic violence is a key priority. Our National Delivery Plan to tackle domestic violence provides support for victims, strengthens the Criminal Justice System to be more responsive to domestic violence cases, holds perpetrators to account and provides resettlement for victims and rehabilitation packages for perpetrators through end-to-end offender management and the concept of a whole sentence plan.</p>

The Office of Criminal Justice Reform has also recently agreed additional funding to maintain and approve the Criminal Cases Review Commission's (CCRC) data mining functionality.

	<p pid="c.1747W.8/1">In April 2005, intensive elements of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) expanded to a further 33 police Basic Command Unit (BCU) areas with high levels of acquisitive crime. Intensive elements of the programme include testing for Class A drugs on charge for certain trigger offences. The 33 new BCUs build on what has already been achieved in the 64 earlier DIP-intensive BCUs and are listed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1747W.8/2">Areas were selected on the basis of number of acquisitive crimes per 1,000 households and the need to harmonise, as far as possible, with other initiatives such as Street Crime and High Crack Areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1747W.8/3">The DIP programme provides a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders, using their contact with the Criminal Justice System as an opportunity to engage them in treatment and support. The key elements of DIP are delivered in all areas of England and are presently being rolled out in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.1747W.8/4">Acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug related crime makes a substantial contribution&mdash;is going down and fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1748W.2/1">Information held centrally on the Home Office Court Proceedings database does not identify separately the types of drugs involved in convictions for drug driving. There are, however, data for England and Wales which relate to drug tests processed in drug driving cases by the Forensic Science Service between April 2000 and March 2004. These show the following drugs were indicated as present in the following frequencies: Cannabis 72 per cent; Benzodiazepines 35 per cent; Opiates 30 per cent; Cocaine 30 per cent; Amphetamines 17 per cent; and Methadone 9 per cent. The figures are for polydrug use and therefore add up to more than 100 per cent.</p>

Drug testing is one of a number of interventions aimed at identifying drug misusing offenders and persuading them to engage in drug treatment and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1749W.0/2">The Drug Interventions Programme continues to have a positive impact in communities not only by the interventions that it offers but also by delivering a more integrated approach by local agencies to the problems of offenders. Since the programme began, over 29,000 offenders from DIP intensive areas have entered treatment. Acquisitive crime&mdash;to which drug related crime (including theft) makes a substantial contribution&mdash;is going down and fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005 compared with the previous 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1755W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board does not set a target for the completion rate of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme. The completion rate is, however, one of the benchmarks by which it monitors the programme's performance. The benchmark rate for completion is 60 per cent. and the current completion rate is 56 per cent. The shortfall of 4 per cent. is being addressed through the sharing of good practice, the imaginative application of incentive schemes, the use of varied and stimulating programmes to encourage young people to participate fully, and a concentration on enforcement of national standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.1755W.5/2">These figures relate to violence recorded by the police rather than violence committed. Therefore they should not be taken as a complete illustration of the number of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.1755W.5/3">For example, in certain areas where alcohol-related violence is particularly prevalent, local police are more likely to police city centres on Friday and Saturday nights thus recording more incidents of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises. If football-related violence is a problem, the choice to send police officers to the match will undoubtedly lead to more violent crime being recorded than if they did not attend. There are other examples, such as the pro-active policing of antisocial behaviour which can increase recorded crime.</p>

	<p pid="c.1757W.5/1">We expect most of the checks on the register to be done with the consent of the individual. Under Clause 14 of the Bill, regulations may be made prescribing how the individual's authority for the provision of information is to be given. This clause limits the information that may be provided to accredited organisations as part of a verification check. This includes information within paragraphs one, three and four of Schedule one, the photograph, signature, information concerning whether the ID card is valid, voluntary information and confirmation of the answers to security questions. The organisation will only be told that the information provided by the individual coincides with that which is held on the register. The organisation themselves will not be given the answers to the security questions. This limitation on the information that may be checked means that information falling in other parts of Schedule one, for example the records of provision of information (paragraph nine of Schedule 1), may not be provided to organisations verifying identity under the powers in this clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.1757W.5/2">One of the purposes of the Identity Cards Scheme, as set out in the Bill at Clause one (3) is the provision of a secure and reliable method for registrable facts about individuals to be verified wherever it is necessary in the public interest. There will be occasions when it is in the public interest for information held on the register to be disclosed without the individual's consent. However, the provision of such information is strictly limited in the Bill. The Identity Cards Bill includes measures to regulate the provision of information without consent and to prevent unauthorised disclosure. Information may be disclosed without consent to security and intelligence agencies to ensure that the scheme benefits the work of those organisations by supporting their stated statutory purposes. The police and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may also be provided with the registrable facts held for law enforcement and related purposes, minus the audit log of card use and information about other occasions when a person's record has been checked. Provision of this information to these bodies would only apply in cases of serious crime. The Bill ensures that provision of information without consent will be properly regulated and subject to independent oversight. The Bill also includes regulation making powers that would allow specified information to be provided without consent to other Government Departments or public authorities with the consent of Parliament. The Bill which was introduced to the House of Commons in May 2005 differed from that which was debated in the previous Parliament in that under the current Bill information cannot be disclosed without an individual's consent to organisations which are not public authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1757W.5/3">Clause 29 of the Bill creates a new offence, that of unauthorised disclosure of information. This offence will apply to persons who hold an office or employment in which the duties relate to the establishment or maintenance of the register, the issue, manufacture, modification, cancellation or surrender of ID cards or the carrying out of the Commissioner's functions. A person guilty of an offence under this section may be liable to two years imprisonment, a fine or both.</p>

The Association of Chief Police Officers are currently reviewing the policy in relation to the handling of suspected suicide bombers. I will await the outcome of that review before considering further involvement. All police use of firearms is subject to the usual law on the use of force.

	<p pid="c.1764W.5/1">Savings to the Exchequer from introducing new pension allowance (NPA) 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be supplied only at disproportionate cost. It is, however, likely that delaying the introduction of NPA 65 until 2025 for those who are not police officers would absorb a substantial part of the expected &pound;13 billion savings that will arise from the implementation of scheme reform within the framework of the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1764W.5/2">In the case of police officers we are introducing a pension age of 55 for new entrants to the service from April 2006. This is in line with the Government's recognition that services like the police and the armed forces have specific needs which make a lower pension age appropriate for their members. If a calculation of the savings of introducing a pension age of 65 were carried out for the police it is arguable that the cost implications for operational effectiveness should also be taken into account</p>

In the White Paper, 'Building Communities Beating Crime', published in November 2004, the Government set out proposals for strengthening the role of the police authority to ensure communities are policed effectively and to increase the public visibility of police authorities, including through the publication of an annual local policing summary. In the light of police force restructuring, we are reviewing the White Paper proposals in relation to the role and composition of police authorities and examining ways to strengthen accountability arrangements at the basic command unit/crime and disorder reduction partnership level. In addition, the White Paper set out proposals for a mechanism to trigger action by the police or other community safety partners in response to unresolved local problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1767W.2/2">To support this, the National Practitioner Panel for Community Engagement in Policing has created a Guide to Community Engagement for policing practitioners containing practical and strategic advice, supported by case studies, for neighbourhood policing teams and practitioners.</p>

This includes working together on the neighbourhood renewal and antisocial behaviour agendas, highlighting respect for others and the community, and a key role for Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) in tackling antisocial behaviour. As part of this we will enable community groups to trigger action in their local areas so that, via their local councillor, they can secure a response from the police or relevant local authority in cases they feel have not been adequately addressed.</p>

These provide that such sirens may only be used either to indicate to other road users the urgency of the purposes for which the vehicle is being used, or to warn them of the presence of the vehicle on the road. Training and guidance on when it is appropriate to use police sirens for these purposes is a matter for individual chief officers of police.</p>

	<p pid="c.1772W.5/1">All newly recruited Prison Officers now undertake an eight-week Prison Officer Entry Level Training course (POELT), previously known as Prison Officer Initial Training (POINT). The POELT course has recently been rewritten and provides new staff with a foundation level of training in all core skill areas and covering interpersonal skills, mental health awareness, race and diversity, violence reduction and safer custody, along side the more traditional security awareness and practical skills needed to be a prison officer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1772W.5/2">There has been an increased emphasis across all prison officer training on offender management and the care of all offenders. The Prison Service is in the process of embedding race and diversity throughout all training courses, where appropriate. An improved quality assurance system is now in place for all courses, which adheres to the Adult Learning Inspectorate common inspection framework.</p>

	<p pid="c.1775W.5/1">The decision to close the Belfast Public Enquiry Office (PEO) was based on the fact that only 2,000 callers used the office annually and the operating hours and capacity were very limited. A better service could be provided from the larger PEO situated in Liverpool which offered a full range of services, unlike the restricted service offered at Belfast. There are no plans to reopen the Belfast PEO.</p>

	<p pid="c.1776W.2/1">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 extended the provisions of the Race Relations Act to most public authorities by making racial discrimination unlawful in carrying out their functions. It also placed a positive duty on many public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is responsible for enforcing and monitoring the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/2">The CRE has issued more than 200 'minded letters', indicating its willingness to take enforcement action against specific public authorities. In all cases this has resulted in the authorities concerned taking the necessary remedial action required to ensure that they are meeting their responsibilities in relation to race equality. Building on this work, the CRE is drawing up proposals on what it, in partnership with others, could do further to monitor public bodies' progress on meeting their equality targets and obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act. For example, the CRE is currently targeting a range of public authorities to determine their progress in conducting Race Equality Impact Assessments. This will focus on both the number of new policies being assessed and the rigor of individual assessments. A specific focus for the CRE over the coming 12 months will be to ensure that all new policies, including legislation, are subject to Race Equality Impact Assessments. To support this work, the Home Office is working with the Interdepartmental Group on Race Equality to drive this work at a departmental level.</p>

Research has also been commissioned (building on the three Resettlement Surveys undertaken in 2001, 2003 and 2004) to provide information on the links between resettlement factors and reconviction. A large scale sentencing survey is also being undertaken which will provide information about the relative effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of different sentences.</p>
	<p pid="c.1778W.5/3"><i>(b)</i> Research was commissioned in 2001 to provide robust evidence on the impact of restorative justice (RJ) alongside the criminal justice system (pre and post sentence) on reconviction rates. Other recently conducted research on RJ has included a study examining the impact of a restorative cautioning scheme (Wilcox et al., 2004) and an exploratory study on the effectiveness of RJ schemes (Miers et al., 2001). The evidence from both of these studies on the effect of RJ on reconviction was inconclusive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1778W.5/4">To follow up earlier research on the introduction of referral orders (which follow the principles of restorative justice), a reconviction study on those offenders subject to referral orders has been commissioned by the Youth Justice Board (YJB).

	<p pid="c.1782W.0/2">A number of forces were consulated, as well as the Art Loss Register. The two forces that responded on this issue did suggest that the database could improve rates of recovery.

	<p pid="c.1787W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/2"><i>(a)</i> The Government are currently taking forward a very full range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime. We are, for example, introducing new measures which will give police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which is currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/3">Domestic violence is also a key priority. Our National Delivery Plan to tackle domestic violence provides support for victims, strengthens the Criminal Justice System to be more responsive to domestic violence cases and holds perpetrators to account.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/4"><i>(b)</i> The Government gives high priority to tackling sexual offending because of the nature and extent of the harm caused to victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/5">We have improved the care available to victims of sexual crime by developing the network of Sexual Assault Referral Centres and supporting complementary community-based services. We are committed to bringing more sexual offenders to justice. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 redefined and increased the penalties for many sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/6">We are encouraging more victims to report sexual crime and specially trained police officers and prosecutors have been established to deal with rape cases. At court, we have introduced a range of measures to facilitate the giving of evidence by victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/7">The Government are particularly determined to ensure that child abuse is tackled rigorously and works with the police and other agencies to minimise the risk of children being sexually abused. We are establishing a centre which will target paedophiles using the Internet to distribute illegal images of and to groom children. Following the Bichard enquiry, wide-ranging action has been implemented to develop joined-up working between different agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/8">We have developed the way that agencies work together to ensure that decisions about managing known sex offenders are based on the best information available. Based on evidence about what really works to reduce offending, programmes are being run in prisons and the community to educate sex offenders about the harm they have caused and bring them to realise what they need to do to stop offending.</p>

	<p pid="c.1788W.2/1">The Government are currently taking forward a very full range of work which will continue to reduce violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1788W.2/2">In Bedfordshire, the Luton Safe and Bed Safe initiatives have made a serious impact on the reported level of violent crime in recent months and Bedfordshire police have been pro-active in tackling these issues. Community Support Officers have been pro-actively enforcing alcohol bans in designated areas. Additional officers are now on the streets on Friday and Saturday nights in town-centres where police strategy involves high-visibility patrols, pro-active use of CCTV and mobile CCTV, mobile police stations, anti-drug operations using sniffer dogs and electronic testing devices, and partnership work with licensees to ensure they take their responsibilities and obligations seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.1788W.2/3">Further priorities are robbery&mdash;Operation Falcon in South Bedfordshire has seen significant reductions in the number of robberies&mdash;and domestic violence where multi-agency approach has been adopted and best practice has been embedded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1788W.2/4">Nationally, there is a huge programme of work. We are, for example, introducing new measures which will give police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which is currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.1788W.2/5">Domestic violence is a key priority. Our National Delivery Plan to tackle domestic violence provides support for victims, strengthens the Criminal Justice System to be more responsive to domestic violence cases, holds perpetrators to account and provides resettlement for victims and rehabilitation packages for perpetrators through end-to-end offender management and the concept of a whole sentence plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.1792W.8/2">A key element of the framework is the creation of a dedicated implementation body, which will work in partnership with the voluntary and community sector, the private sector and with young people themselves, to deliver a step change in the quality and quantity of volunteering opportunities. Officials within the Home Office are working with Ian Russell to create this body as an independent charity. This work includes the recruitment of the chair, chief executive officer and board of the charity. An announcement on these key appointments will be made in December 2005 and we expect that the charity will be formally launched in spring 2006.</p>
