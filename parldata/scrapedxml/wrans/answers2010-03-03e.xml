	<p pid="e.1193W.5/1">There is stringent legislation around drink driving, with a minimum of 12 month ban for drivers found over the prescribed alcohol limit for driving. We have worked closely with the police on enforcement, such as equipping police forces with new digital breathalysers, and in making the links between police campaigns and our drink-drive advertising. This long-term strategy has helped deliver more than a 75 per cent. reduction in drink-drive related deaths and serious injuries since 1980.</p>
	<p pid="e.1193W.5/2">The Government consulted last year on a number of further measures to reduce drink-related casualties in the Road Safety Compliance document, the results of which will feed into the Government's post-2010 Road Safety Strategy to be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1193W.5/3">The Department for Transport also announced in December that it had commissioned an independent review of drink and drug driving legislation. As far as drink driving is concerned, the review, led by Sir Peter North, is examining the case for changes to the current provisions, including options for reducing the legal alcohol limit for drivers. The study is also considering the likely impact of such changes on driver behaviour. Sir Peter has been asked to report by the end of March and the Government will then consult on his findings before finalising and publishing the new road safety strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1193W.5/4">Copies of the Road Safety Compliance consultation document and the terms of reference for the North review have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.1193W.5/5">In addition to these steps, the Department for Transport is developing a new multi-media publicity campaign targeting drivers who continue to mix drinking and driving. We are aiming to launch the campaign in summer 2010.</p>

	<p pid="e.1197W.6/1">The renewable energy strategy is the Government's comprehensive action plan for achieving the UK's share of the EU 2020 renewable energy target. It was published in July 2009 alongside the low carbon transition plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.1197W.6/2">Projections of air quality, which exclude the impact of the renewable energy strategy, indicate that the UK is expected to be in full compliance with limit values for particulate matter in 2020, and that exceedences of limit values for nitrogen dioxide will be confined to a small number of roadside locations in London. These exceedences are associated with road transport emission sources.</p>
	<p pid="e.1197W.6/3">Emission projections which include policies contained within the low carbon transition plan and the renewable energy strategy indicate a small net increase in the emission of oxides of nitrogen due to increased uptake in combined heat and power units, and no change in relation to emissions of particulate matter. While a full exceedences assessment has not yet been undertaken based on these emissions projections, it is thought unlikely that there will be any impact on the extent of limit value exceedences in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="e.1197W.6/4">DEFRA and DECC have worked closely to identify policies within the renewable energy strategy that may impact on air quality. For example, the renewable heat incentive proposes a maximum emissions standard for biomass boilers below 20MW to minimise any detrimental impact on air quality in urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.1203W.3/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report indicates that, after 2100, sea levels will continue to rise for centuries to come, mainly because of continued thermal expansion of the oceans. However, the magnitude of this rise cannot be predicted precisely because it depends on a number of factors, including the effects of future greenhouse gas emissions on temperature increases and the dynamics of ice sheet melting.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.3/2">The Netherlands Delta Committee report, published in 2008, estimated that thermal expansion and the likely contribution from land-based ice melt could cause global sea level rises in a range from 1.5 to 3 metres by 2200, compared to levels at the end of the last century. Urgent mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions would reduce projected sea level rise but not prevent it beyond 2100, so adaptation to sea level rise would also be needed.</p>

	<p pid="e.1206W.0/1">Demand for heating oil increases in cold weather. Oil distributors worked hard in challenging conditions, particularly in more remote parts of the country, to supply customers during the worst cold weather experienced for 29 years. DECC officials received representations from the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers (FPS) that heating oil distributors were facing increases in demand-at higher rates than they could make deliveries in large part as a result of the difficulties of access to properties due to ice and snow. DECC officials worked closely with FPS so that the enforcement of drivers' hours rules could be temporarily relaxed to enable deliveries to be made to customers as conditions improved.</p>
	<p pid="e.1206W.0/2">With regard to the question of Ofgem, the Government do not believe that bringing these fuels under regulations having similar scope to the Gas and Electricity Acts would be an appropriate and proportionate form of regulation. These Acts deal with markets where there are natural monopolies which mean that competition cannot be expected on its own to protect consumers from the risk of exploitation. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly in the distribution of heating oil. In the UK there are around 200 different fuel distributors each with a national, regional or local presence, with competition between the companies involved. Overall, the Government support the retention of a competitive market for heating oil, believing this to be in the best interests of all customers. Both general consumer protection legislation, such as the Sale of Goods Act and Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations, and competition law apply to this sector.</p>

	<p pid="e.1210W.11/1">In 2009, a system for examining the skills and capabilities of specialised commissioners was developed, closely based on the primary care trust commissioning assurance process. This has been made available on a voluntary basis to strategic health authorities for them to assess specialised commissioning groups. The national specialised commissioning team is based within NHS London and could be assessed using the same system with some adaptations. The national specialised commissioning group is an advisory group reporting to Ministers on the commissioning of specialised services and the assurance process would not be suitable to assess its performance.</p>

These conditions are not known to increase the severity or duration of community acquired infections, such as influenza. Therefore, these conditions are not routinely regarded as causing immunosuppression, which is one of the conditions in the clinical risk categories. However, general practitioners (GPs) should take into account the risk of influenza infection exacerbating any other underlying disease that a patient may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from influenza itself. GPs should consider on an individual basis the clinical needs of their patients.</p>

	<p pid="e.1218W.0/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) is leading the UK response to the Haitian earthquake: at DfID's request the Ministry of Defence (MOD) sent a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship, RFA Largs Bay, to carry vital relief supplies to Haiti. RFA Largs Bay arrived in Haiti on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-18">18 February</phrase>, delivered its cargo of aid and is now engaged in further taskings in support of the World Food programme under the direction of DfID. This has been a high priority task and I trust it has been seen as a significant contribution by the Government to the international aid effort.</p>
	<p pid="e.1218W.0/3">The MOD deployed an Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team to Haiti via 2 C-130 Hercules flights to advise DfID on the capabilities of RFA Largs Bay and on what military assistance was required. DfID does not currently require any military assistance in the region beyond that already in Haiti. The MOD continues to take an active role in the UK response, and will provide further assistance where possible if required.</p>
	<p pid="e.1218W.0/4">Some 130 military personnel are on board the RFA Largs Bay. Five military personnel remain in Port-au-Prince in support of the ship. Eight members of a Royal Military Police close protection team for the FCO's consular Rapid Deployment Team as well as 11 military personnel and one civilian from the Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team were deployed initially to Haiti following the earthquake but have all since returned to the UK. A small number of UK service personnel on exchanges (with Canada, Bermuda and USA military forces) were also deployed, or were on standby to deploy, to Haiti.</p>
	<p pid="e.1218W.0/5">Spending by the MOD in support of Operation PANLAKE, the assistance provided by MOD to Haiti on behalf of DfID, will be recovered from DfID. At present, it is not possible to provide a final costing of the operation as the work is still being completed.</p>

This is required to inform decisions, likely to be necessary in the next Parliament, on whether and how we may need to refurbish or replace our current warhead. Expenditure amounted to some &#163;7.3 million in 2008-09 and is forecast to be some &#163;16.5 million in 2009-10. Comparable levels of future annual expenditure are anticipated until final decisions are taken.</p>

	<p pid="e.1224W.5/2">For 2010/11 academic year, the main funding streams available to colleges for post 19 learning are the Adult Learner Responsive and Employer Responsive budgets. Within these, Government funding is prioritised towards basic literacy and numeracy skills and full level 2 and full level 3 qualifications that provide the skills for adults to enter into and progress in employment and further learning.</p>
	<p pid="e.1224W.5/3">It is for the LSC to agree with colleges the broad level outcomes that they expect to deliver for this funding. The actual amount paid will depend on how colleges respond to demand from learners and employers in line with local and regional priorities. Regional skills priorities will be articulated in regional priority statements by regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.1224W.5/4">In addition to Adult Learner Responsive and Employer Responsive funding, some colleges and training organisations also receive Government funding to support a clearly defined set of outcomes. For example funding for the training element of the Young Person's Guarantee is to support 18 to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for six months or longer to undertaken specific employment focussed training. The funding will therefore respond to meeting a local need.</p>

	<p pid="e.1225W.2/1">The policies and actions of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), and its predecessors, have focused on building a competitive economy and on delivering prosperity and sustainable economic growth. The implementation of BIS policy in the Yorkshire and the Humber region has been taken forward primarily by the Regional Development Agency Yorkshire Forward and the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber, working in partnership with the local authority and other relevant bodies. The Government and their regional and local partners have responded vigorously to the global recession, providing assistance to businesses and individuals. Statistical information at constituency level is limited. Information has therefore been provided for north-east Lincolnshire local authority area, which includes the Great Grimsby constituency. Examples of how BIS policies and actions have impacted on north-east Lincolnshire include:</p>

Yorkshire Forward has made 24 SFI and GBI grant offers to businesses in north-east Lincolnshire totalling &#163;7.7 million, creating or safeguarding 1,663 jobs. Yorkshire Forward has also provided grants to support research and development by small and medium-sized businesses, through the SMART scheme and its successor, the Grants for Research and Development scheme.

	<p pid="e.1225W.2/23">Since 2008, Business Link Yorkshire has been the single contact point for all publicly funded support available to businesses in Yorkshire and the Humber. This has made it easier for businesses to access information, advice and support on issues including business regulation, best practice, marketing, innovation, financial support and help with exporting. For example in 2009/10 to date, Business Link Yorkshire has helped 1,260 businesses in the north-east Lincolnshire area and 256 individuals thinking of starting a business. As part of the Government's Real Help Now package we are providing more help for businesses to survive during the current economic conditions. Since October 2008 this has included a free Business Link health check which can be a useful starting point for identifying further business support tailored to the needs of individual companies. To date Business Link Yorkshire has arranged 373 health checks for small and medium-sized businesses in north-east Lincolnshire. In addition, the Yorkshire Forward funded Financial Health Check, which offers a grant of &#163;2,000 for accountants to carry out a full review, has benefited 35 businesses in north-east Lincolnshire.</p>

North-east Lincolnshire was awarded &#163;18.7 million for its LEGI programme (&quot;e-factor&quot;) in December 2006. Since the programme began, e-factor has, with LEGI funding:</p>

In 2006, when the mothers included in the study went on maternity leave, the statutory entitlement to Ordinary Maternity Leave (OML) was 26 weeks, while mothers who had worked for their employer for a qualifying period of 26 weeks were also entitled to Additional Maternity Leave (AML) of 26 weeks.

The campaign plays a part in contributing to the success of this broad-based activity. Its aim is to focus on putting science in places that it would not typically be associated with, such as consumer and tabloid media and thereby demonstrating to the public how important science is to their everyday lives</p>
	<p pid="e.1228W.2/11">To evaluate the effectiveness of the Science: [So what] campaign, BIS uses a range of measures, including visits to the campaign website, the extent that media coverage has reached the campaign's core audience and its return on investment for media coverage. An Ipsos-MORI survey is also being conducted with a representative sample of 2,000 people from the C2DE (lower income) core audience, in order to gauge their recognition of the campaign, its messages and the media channels used.</p>

	<p pid="e.1234W.0/1">The latest three years for which data are available are 2006 to 2008. These are from the superseded fire data report forms which were in place until March 2009. Under this system, the numbers of people rescued but uninjured were recorded, but for reasons of economy, entry sampling was used such that full details of incidents for only one in five of those incidents that did not involve injuries were input to central databases.</p>
	<p pid="e.1234W.0/2">Examination of the estimates from this data base have shown that fluctuations in the estimates at fire and rescue service level, which occur as a result due the entry sampling, mean that only the following approximate national figure can be derived: the number of people rescued uninjured from fires by the fire and rescue service in each year between 2006 and 2008 is in the region of 1,500 to 2,000.</p>
	<p pid="e.1234W.0/3">Details of incidents under the new incident recording system are entered electronically at source, thus CLG's databases of incidents from April 2009 will no longer be subject to entry sampling or the resulting limitations in estimates.

	<p pid="e.1252W.3/1">Staff working in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) are expected to meet high standards of professional and personal conduct. Behaviour constituting discrimination, harassment, victimisation or bullying-including instances which involve a racial element-will not be tolerated and, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, would fall under the category of gross misconduct and would invariably lead to dismissal.</p>
	<p pid="e.1252W.3/2">Details of disciplinary outcomes are recorded centrally according to the type of misconduct rather than the actual offence committed by the member of staff. According to central records, five prison officers have been dismissed from public sector Prison Service establishments on grounds of racist behaviour since <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. A breakdown of this information is provided in the following table.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="e.1252W.3/13">There may be additional cases on the central databases which have not been recorded as racist in nature. In order to confirm the accuracy of this data, NOMS would need to contact all public sector Prison Service establishments, ask them to check their local records for the period required and ask them to submit this information to Headquarters so that the central records can be updated. This would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="e.1252W.3/14">NOMS believes that the key to long-term success in tackling unacceptable behaviour is to embed a sustainable diversity infrastructure across the service. A major initiative in this area has been the development of Challenge It Change It, a new training course and diversity toolkit. This is being introduced across the public sector prison service and NOMS HQ and is receiving very positive feedback.</p>

	<p pid="e.1257W.5/1">The application to form an all-Wales trust met the criteria required for Trust status in terms of performance and it is considered that this would be the best means of delivering locally tailored and cost effective services for all communities in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="e.1257W.5/2">In common with all probation trusts, the Wales trust will be formed of local delivery units who are empowered to work with partners to understand and meet local needs, either through direct provision or commissioning. These units will provide a visible local presence for probation in all communities and ensure that the diverse needs in different parts of Wales are met. Compared to the retention of four separate probation areas in Wales, the single trust will save &#163;1.5 million. This additional saving equates to 46 posts in corporate support and governance arrangements. In reducing management overheads, the all-Wales trust will focus resources on the frontline, improving public protection. These savings will allow 34 full-time equivalent probation officers to be employed across Wales who would otherwise not be funded.</p>

The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. Health and Education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Expenditure recharged to the YJB in respect of young people is included. Prison costs are classified to categories according to each prison's major use at the end of the year.

	<p pid="e.1267W.2/1">There are around 87,000 violent incidents involving glassware each year. In the majority of cases where violent crime involving glassware is reported it is most commonly pint glasses which are broken and used as sharp weapons. The <i> British Medical Journal</i> has highlighted that the injury caused by drinking glasses could be substantially reduced by the use of toughened glass in premises.</p>
	<p pid="e.1267W.2/2">We anticipate the cost of the new glasses will be similar to existing standard toughened glass. Cost will clearly be a consideration as we move forward with these prototypes. Both glass solutions should have a potentially longer lifespan than existing glass, therefore we do not have any plans to financially support trade in acquiring stocks of the glasses as it would be part of their natural expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="e.1267W.5/2">The Communication Capabilities Directorate brings together work to ensure that, in a changing communications environment, communications data and interception of communications can continue to protect the public and save lives. This includes implementing the European Union data retention directive and looking at how communications data capabilities can be maintained in the future as technology continues to evolve through the Interception Modernisation Programme. The Directorate is also working with public authorities to improve training around the use of communications data to maximise efficiencies as suggested by feedback to the 2009 public consultation 'Protecting the Public in a Changing Communications Environment'. The Directorate has incurred expenditure of &#163;14 million since it was established. This includes resources, facilities and capital expenditure.</p>

The survey excludes victims and witnesses of sexual offences, domestic violence, and cases involving a fatality on ethical grounds. Drug and motoring offences are also excluded.</p>
	<p pid="e.1280W.2/4">WAVES data show that in 2008 (latest full year available), 91 per cent. of victims interviewed were notified that someone had been charged with the offence. WAVES does not fully distinguish between respondents who were informed of the case outcome, and those who found out the case outcome in another way.</p>

As a result of the above, the two datasets are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="e.1290W.5/2">In my capacity as Minister for Sport I attended the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and was accompanied by my Private Secretary. The Minister for the Olympics also attended the games with her Private Secretary, a press officer and a special adviser.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.5/3">In addition, four members of the Government Olympic Executive also attended the games and it is planned that a further four officials will attend the Paralympics. They are participating in the observer programmes which run throughout the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	<p pid="e.1290W.5/4">Attendance at the Games provided an invaluable opportunity to study at first-hand Vancouver's experience in staging an Olympic Games and to learn lessons for London 2012.</p>

	<p pid="e.1292W.0/1">UK Sport has advised that for the majority of events supported by UK Sport through its World Class Events programme, athletes are required by their international federations to have their own insurance to allow them to compete. International federations will usually incorporate medical cover requirements in the event contract agreements with which host organisers must comply.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/2">The event organisers are liable for public liability insurance cover in case of any accident/injury as a result of the event set up, as opposed to simply injury/accidents as a result of participants competing.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/3">Visitors to events are always covered in terms of emergency first aid as a matter of best practice. This would be free of charge, but organisers of events would not be liable to cover any required hospital treatment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/4">With regards to participants and visitors to the UK for the Olympic Games in 2012, it was a requirement of the bid that NHS treatment for the Games Family (including participants, IOC and IPC members, technical officials etc.) would be free. The Department of Health is working to fulfil the bid commitment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/5">For participants, the larger Olympic and Paralympic teams will bring their own specialist medical teams and will provide any medical care required. The vast majority of medical services will be delivered by LOCOG in the polyclinic in the Olympic Park and in on-site facilities in other Games' venues. LOCOG is working directly with Hospital Trusts to specify the services and facilities needed in the rare event that a participant is admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/6">For spectators, business as usual arrangements will apply in line with current legislation-treatment given in an NHS accident and emergency department is free to all persons, but treatment after admission as an in-patient will incur a charge unless the person is entitled to it for free.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/7">Finally, with regards to the TT races on the Isle of Man, the reciprocal healthcare agreement between the UK and the Isle of Man is still in effect, but terminates on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>. Therefore all competitors must be insured against the risk of personal accident in accordance with the FIM Sporting Code.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/8">The Isle of Man Health Service is not part of the UK NHS and, except for immediately necessary and emergency treatment which does not require admission to hospital, visitors to the Isle of Man (including UK residents) who require treatment will be expected to pay for it.</p>
	<p pid="e.1292W.0/9">It is therefore strongly recommended that all visitors to the Isle of Man ensure that they have appropriate insurance in place which will cover any treatment costs and repatriation to the UK by air ambulance if that should prove necessary.</p>

However, these aspects of the Department's business are not always identified as specific allocated budgets within the remit of larger programmes and policy initiatives. It would not be possible to accurately identify the annual amount of spend on preventative and early intervention measures without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="e.1296W.2/2">If a local authority has concerns that a child is not receiving a suitable, full-time education it has the power to take steps under the school attendance order framework, including serving a school attendance order on the child's parents instructing them to register their child at a named school. Failure to comply with an order is an offence. Local authorities have the responsibility for prosecuting parents if they breach a school attendance order and also have the option of seeking an education supervision order. We believe that this achieves a balance between the rights of parents to educate their children outside the school system, many of whom do a good job, and the rights of the child to a full-time education suitable to their needs and abilities.</p>

	<p pid="e.1297W.2/1">Over the last 12 months, we have continued to roll out a comprehensive programme of work to prevent and tackle bullying. This includes working through the Anti-Bullying Alliance and the National Strategies to help schools deal with bullying effectively and providing challenge and support, where necessary, to improve anti-bullying strategies.</p>
	<p pid="e.1297W.2/2">It also includes funding for peer mentoring of pupils and a helpline for parents. We have strengthened further our anti-bullying guidance. In April 2009 we published new guidance on preventing and tackling the cyberbullying of school staff. In September we produced a DVD resource pack for schools on bullying related to special educational needs or disabilities. In December 2009 we issued new guidance for schools on preventing and responding to sexist, sexual and transphobic bullying. In February this year we produced, in collaboration with Stonewall, a DVD resource pack on tackling homophobic bullying.</p>
	<p pid="e.1297W.2/3">In November 2009 the Anti-Bullying Alliance delivered our annual anti-bullying week for which the theme was cyberbullying. During that week we launched a short web-based leaflet for parents on bullying from a young persons' perspective and re-ran our cyberbullying campaign, 'laugh at it and you're part of it'. In December, 2009 we published a consultation document on the new duty on schools (due to come into force this September) to record and report all serious and persistent incidents of bullying.</p>

	<p pid="e.1300W.2/1">The 2008/09 PE and Sport survey showed that 50 per cent. of school pupils were taking part in at least three hours of high quality PE and sport per week as part of the five hour offer for children and young people. For Years 10 and 11 the figures were 42 per cent. and 37 per cent. respectively. For primary pupils the figure was 57 per cent. We are working with the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England, and through them with School Sport Partnerships and County Sport Partnerships, to ensure that plans are in place to deliver a five hour offer which is taken up by every young person who wants it. At present we judge this to be the case in 92 per cent. of SSPs. As part of this we believe every young person should have access to regular competitive sport; coaching to improve their skills and enjoyment; a choice of different sports; pathways to club and elite sport; and opportunities to lead and volunteer in sport. We are also developing new ways of communicating the offer so that more young people take it up.</p>
