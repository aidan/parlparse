	<p pid="b.1W.6/1">DFID supports partnerships between schools in the UK and Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean through a programme called DFID Global School Partnerships (DGSP). The programme is managed by the British Council, under contract to DFID. It provides advice and guidance, professional development opportunities and grants to schools that are using partnerships as a means to develop and embed a global dimension within their curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/2">There are currently four UK-Namibian partnerships through DGSP:</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/3" class="indent">Hey with Zion VC Primary School in Oldham works with John Shekudja Combined School;</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/4" class="indent">Warlingham School in Surrey works with Udjombala Junior Secondary School;</p>

	<p pid="b.1W.6/6" class="indent">St. Michael's CE Primary School in Herefordshire is partnered with Emma Hoogen Hout School.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/7">In addition, the British Council operates a programme, not funded by DFID, called 'Connecting Classrooms'. This links schools in the UK with schools in Africa&mdash;including Namibia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/8">Under this programme 'partnerships' between schools are supported. Each partnership consists of three UK schools, plus three schools from one African country and three schools from another African country. Each partnership is entitled to &pound;15,000 per year, for up to three years, to take part in study visits, to purchase materials, and meet certain other associated costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1W.6/9">In 2006-07, two sets of twinning partnerships under 'Connecting Classrooms' involved Namibia: the first was a group of three schools in Namibia, twinned with three schools in Leeds and three schools in Zimbabwe. The second was a group of three schools in Namibia, twinned with three schools in Devon and three schools in Nigeria.</p>

	<p pid="b.7W.2/1">The return of people to their homes in Sudan is a major priority for the international community in 2007, particularly in the first half of the year, before the rains make movement difficult. DFID has channelled all its funding for the returns process through the UN-administered common humanitarian fund (CHF). The multi-donor CHF is an ideal way of supporting returns as it provides fast and predictable funding. Of the $133 million allocated so far by the CHF (of which the DFID contribution makes up 60 per cent.), $12.4 million was given to support the returns process.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/2">A considerable amount of the CHF funding for other sectors (e.g. water and sanitation, health and nutrition) in the south ($50 million) and the three areas ($17.8 million) is also targeted at areas of return for refugees and the internally displaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.7W.2/3">Of the $63 million that the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) received last year for similar operations, the CHF provided $14 million.</p>

Its achievements to date include service training for newly recruited officials at different levels in central and state level Government and technical assistance for government accountants.

If the absence of information might mislead consumers, then Guidance on Country of Origin Labelling and Clear Food Labelling produced by the Food Standards Agency suggests that both the origin of the meat and the country where the processing takes place should be declared in order to facilitate informed consumer choice. More restrictive rules apply to beef and poultry meat that has not been processed.</p>

	<p pid="b.24W.6/1">The European Road Transport Working Time Directive 2002/15/EC is intended to help prevent &quot;mobile workers&quot; (mainly drivers and crew of HGVs, buses and coaches) from being forced to work excessively long hours. The directive also helps promote road safety and to ensure fair competition across Europe (by delivering a &quot;level playing field&quot; on working time).</p>

The RIA did not estimate a one-off cost for regulators but estimated recurring enforcement costs of &pound;120,000-&pound;217,000 per annum.

	<p pid="b.27W.9/1">Since 1990 the main acquisition of office accommodation has been the construction of Portcullis House over a number of financial years at a capital cost of &pound;234 million. Leasehold space was taken on at 7 Millbank during the 1990s; the annual rental is currently &pound;4.7 million. More recently, additional leasehold space has been taken on a temporary basis at 4 Millbank at an annual rental of &pound;0.7 million to provide decant space for use while core parts of the estate are refurbished.

	<p pid="b.32W.0/1">PFI credits relate solely to schools capital funding. Future PFI credits available to the Department as part of its capital baseline are largely assigned to the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. PFI contracts usually cover a 25 to 30 year period. After this, the buildings will normally transfer to the local authority which is the signatory to the contract. Partnerships for Schools, our delivery partner for BSF, is working with each local authority which has joined the programme to establish which school projects are suitable for investment through PFI. This is decided on value for money grounds and is usually for those projects where the school is to be largely rebuilt, rather than refurbished.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.0/2">Percentage budget figures for PFI credits over the last 10 years to 2006-07, and planned for the years 2007-08 to 2010-11, are set out in the following table. The Department has no plans beyond the next spending review period ending 2010-11. The PFI percentage figure is established by dividing PFI credits by the total schools capital funding baseline, including PFI credits.</p>

We risk therefore being unable to increase the number of students who reach the age of 14 at a level which enables them to take full advantage of the increased choices we are making available in the 14-19 phase. The consequence of that will be that some young people become disengaged from learning and unable to meet their aspirations.

	<p pid="b.39W.0/1">My Department is working with the health service to enhance the capacity of the symptomatic service, with the aim of introducing bowel cancer screening in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.39W.0/2">Before a full programme can be implemented in Northern Ireland, detailed planning is required in order that the introduction of bowel screening does not adversely impact on services for those patients with symptomatic disease. In addition, infrastructure development and capacity building is required so that the necessary resources, people and skills are in place to ensure a quality service. My Department is currently working with the relevant health professionals to address these issues and thereby enhance the capacity of the symptomatic service.</p>

	<p pid="b.49W.5/1">A complete medical record is maintained for every member of the armed forces. This facilitates where necessary any ongoing medical treatment and supervision wherever the individual is serving, and provides an audit trail of responsibility for those engaged in the care and treatment of patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.5/2">The custody and security of medical and dental documents of all personnel is the responsibility of the senior Medical Officer (MO) or (for the Navy) the Medical Branch Rating (MBR) of the establishment or ship in which the individual is serving. To prevent breaches of medical confidentiality, accidental or otherwise, all medical records are kept secure at all times. They are not kept in the possession of any person other than the MO or medical staff in the course of their duties. When not in use all such documents, notes, correspondence and external media used to store medical data are kept in a locked container.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.5/3">Quarterly musters of all medical records held are carried out in all primary care units against unit nominal lists, and more frequently when required (e.g. when a unit is formed or deployed). During musters, medical records are scrutinized by physically inspecting the main service medical record known as &quot;F Med 4&quot; form which are a series of documents which record an individual's medical history. These are cross-checked against other records to ensure that personnel remain in-date; records are accurate; and no treatments or appointments are outstanding. Scrutiny of medical records is carried out on receipt of a new &quot;F Med 4&quot; and on notice of drafting or deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.5/4">When an individual is receiving secondary-care treatment in an NHS hospital, any medical notes are the responsibility of the NHS Trust where the treatment is taking place. When an individual is discharged from hospital, the hospital discharge report is enclosed in the &quot;F Med 4&quot;, along with other clinical reports such as Laboratory, Physiotherapy and X-ray. The same procedures apply for documentation from MOD Regional Rehabilitation Units, Departments of Community Mental Health and other directly managed units such as the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.5/5">There is currently no centrally available source of information regarding the number of missing medical records, and the information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The information could be obtained only by requesting every military medical centre in the UK and overseas to provide details of records not held at their last quarterly medical records muster.</p>

Where possible, damaged equipment is restored, drawing on funding from the Treasury Reserve as appropriate. Equipment which has been destroyed may also be replaced through a call on the Reserve, though in some cases we may choose to restore the capability rather than seek a like-for-like replacement.</p>

	<p pid="b.55W.0/1">As paragraphs 5-7 and 5-8 of the White Paper: 'The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent' (Cm 6994) make clear, our policy is to maintain continuous at sea deterrent patrolling to ensure our deterrent remains fully credible. There would, theoretically, be a number of alternative postures to continuous patrolling but we do not regard them as providing credible deterrence. However, for a given size of fleet, the cost difference between maintaining continuous deterrent patrolling and not doing so would potentially be relatively minor since the costs directly associated with operating the submarine on patrol are a very small proportion of the overall costs of maintaining, supporting and operating the deterrent. Total expenditure on the capital and running costs of the Trident nuclear deterrent, including the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, in 2006-07 is expected to be around &pound;1,500 million.</p>

As part of this process, my ministerial colleagues and I have been discussing the future deterrent in a wide range of forums. For example, there has been a full debate in the House of Lords, and I have given a speech at King's College, London; provided the Defence Committee with wide-ranging evidence; taken part in a televised debate with CND; and discussed the future deterrent with a panel of experts at RUSI. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase>, at the conclusion of this process, there will be a full debate and vote in the House of Commons.

	<p pid="b.56W.2/1">As set out in paragraph 5 to 14 of the White Paper on the 'Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent' (Cm 6994), we estimate that the in-service costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent will be around 5 to 6 per cent. of the defence budget once the proposed fleet of replacement SSBNs comes into service. This calcution is based on initial whole life estimates of in-service and disposal costs for the deterrent capability and the estimated costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, averaged over the currently expected life of the new submarines and compared to the current defence budget. Taking similar costs for the current system, from 1998 to 2005, and comparing them to the actual defence budgets for those years, the average annual in-service cost was around 4 per cent. of the defence budget. The cost of the deterrent in 2006-07, including the cost of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, is expected to be around &pound;1,500 million, or just over five per cent of the current defence budget.</p>

Key to that is the establishment of a design and build programme which balances sustainability requirements with military need and affordability. MOD is working closely with industry to agree such a programme, together with other issues such as collaboration and rationalisation to ensure a viable enterprise well into the future.

	<p pid="b.61W.2/1">It was always understood when we bid that national lottery funding for London 2012 would involve some loss of income to the non-Olympic good causes. Non-Olympic distributors may lose an average of 5 per cent. of their income because of sales diversion to Olympic lottery games over the period 2005-06 to 2012-13. In addition, we have already announced that &pound;410 million will be taken from non-Olympic lottery proceeds between 2009 and 2012. No decision has been made about how that amount will be shared between the various non-Olympic good causes nor on the further use of lottery funding to meet any of the &pound;900 million in additional costs that have been announced.

The figure for the total spent in each year is not available, but core funding for each zone totalled &pound;350,000 over the five years of planned investment. A further &pound;1.998 million magnet funding was also awarded to the scheme.

	<p pid="b.65W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/2">My Department is promoting sport for people of all ages and backgrounds, both as something enjoyable and worthwhile in itself and, where appropriate, as something that has a vital role to play in tackling obesity.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/3">As part of my Department's ongoing work to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity for the under-11s by 2010, we have been working closely with our target-holding partners, the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills, on how best to tackle this serious public health problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/4">The National School Sport Strategy, jointly implemented by DCMS and DfES, is a key component of a multi-faceted, 'whole school' programme of addressing obesity. The 2005/06 school sport survey found that overall 80 per cent. of pupils participate in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. This exceeded the target of 75 per cent. for 2006 and demonstrates a considerable increase from the estimated 25 per cent. in 2002. This target will rise to 85 per cent. by 2008. By 2010 the ambition is to offer all children at least four hours of sport a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/5">Furthermore, we are working with school sports partnerships to increase participation in physical activity by overweight and obese children.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/6">In addition, we have a PSA target to increase by 3 per cent. between 2005 and 2008 the number of adults and young people aged 16 and above from priority groups (in this context defined as those with a physical or mental disability, black or minority ethnic groups, those from socioeconomic groups C2, D and E, and women) who participate in active sports at least 12 times a year and engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity level sport at least three times a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/7">Regional Sports Boards in partnership with Community Sports Networks are responsible for delivering the target in each of the Government regions. Sport England is also a key partner in our delivery chain for obesity with successful action dependent on good regional co-ordination and close working with primary care trusts and local authorities to increase participation.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.3/8">We have now invested over &pound;1 billion in 4,000 new or refurbished sports facilities in order to help deliver this target and we are working to ensure that the 2012 Olympic Games creates a lasting legacy of increased participation in sport and physical activity.</p>

From this, the tourist board granted &pound;3,000 towards the staging of the 2006 Royal Lancashire show, on the grounds that the show would serve to raise the profile of the LBTB and the Lancashire rural tourism initiative. The NWDA''s strategy for tourism in England's north-west identifies the show as one of a number of events of national and international significance that take place across the region.

These include the Security Council's legally binding requirement that Iran should suspend all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities. Dr. Solana explained that if Iran did so, we would be prepared to suspend further action against Iran in the Security Council. He indicated that the E3+3 might be prepared to be flexible about the timing and format of any meetings, if Iran was prepared to comply with its obligations. With our support, Dr. Solana is continuing his efforts to encourage Iran back into negotiations and details of his conversations with Dr. Larijani therefore remain confidential.</p>

The comprehensive peace agreement has done much to raise the expectations of a number of disenfranchised groups in Nepal. It is important that the coming interim Government ensure that ethnic minority rights are addressed urgently. Failure to do so risks undermining the peace process as Nepal moves towards elections to a constituent assembly in June.</p>

	<p pid="b.88W.5/1">In April 2006, Nepal had its second 'people's movement' against the autocratic rule of the King. Women played a significant part, coming onto the streets in huge numbers to demand a more inclusive democratic system of government. Their protests did much to ensure that gender equality and justice were placed on the national agenda. This new emphasis on equal rights resulted in the passage of legislation which requires 33 per cent. of women's representation at all levels of the state structure and, for the first time, allowed for the right to citizenship to be passed on through the mother not just the father.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.5/2">But the inclusion of women in society remains largely cosmetic. The current Government, due to be replaced by an interim Government in the coming weeks, have only one female Minister. Although the interim Parliament formed in January has an increased number of women, this is largely due to the Maoists who fielded women for 37 per cent. of their 83 seats. Moreover, although the interim constitution notes the inclusion of traditionally marginalised groups such as women, it remains to be seen whether the constituent assembly elections will include the 33 per cent. of women candidates required by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.5/3">Discrimination in Nepal is rooted in culture and religion and while legislation can make it unlawful, it will take a long time to change attitudes and perceptions. A huge cultural shift is required if women in Nepal are to participate in the peace process and play a significant part in the constituent assembly. In addition, structural changes in society are necessary in which poverty and the education of women need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.5/4">If Nepal is to continue to move towards a peaceful future, it is vital that the rights of women and other minority groups are addressed. We will continue to work with our international partners and women's groups in Nepal to uphold their rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.5/5">Through our embassy in Kathmandu, and the office of the Department for International Development, we have pressed high level politicians to include women as an integral part of the peace process. We will continue to encourage and enable meaningful representation and participation of women in all aspects of the peace process. The UK-drafted Security Council on Nepal (UN Security Resolution 1740) contains a specific reference to the need to pay special attention to the rights of women in the development of a democratic new Nepal.</p>

	<p pid="b.89W.2/1">The Nepalese Government and people are to be congratulated on the progress made so far in the peace process. In less than a year, Prime Minister Koirala and the alliance of seven democratic parties has signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement with Maoists, drafted and agreed an interim constitution, formed an interim Parliament including 83 nominated Maoist MPs and secured a UN Security Council Resolution providing for a UN Mission to monitor weapons and combatants and provide technical assistance to the election process.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/2">However, the process remains fragile and will require commitment from all parties as well as the support of the international community to continue to make progress towards free and fair elections to a constituent assembly in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/3">Peace in Nepal though has raised the expectations of ethnic and other minority groups who have long pressed for greater representation in Parliament. A failure to address these demands has led recently to violent disturbances, particularly in the Terai region where members of the Madhesi community are demanding proportional representation, a federal system of Government and a greater voice in the interim Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/4">Elections will be key to sustaining the momentum and giving voice to the marginalised. But there is a fine balance between the political imperative of rushing them through quickly and the risk of their being flawed so that the results carry no legitimacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/5">Another area of concern is the behaviour of the Maoists, who have yet to meet fully their obligations under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Intimidation and extortion remain commonplace. It will be vital for Maoists to take seriously their responsibilities as they come into the interim Government, end abuses, support the rule of law and work to deliver services through the state system rather than parallel systems of their own.</p>
	<p pid="b.89W.2/6">The UK has played a leading role in supporting the peace process. The long-standing relationship we enjoy with Nepal has allowed us to provide views and guidance which are welcomed. We will continue to work, with the EU and other international partners to help Nepal progress further towards a sustainable and peaceful future.</p>

	<p pid="b.90W.0/1">The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in November last year includes extensive human rights provisions. All parties are bound by the CPA to co-operate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Despite this unequivocal language, the Maoists, the Nepal army and the Government have failed to co-operate fully with the OHCHR.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.0/2">With Maoist combatants in cantonment sites and Nepal Army soldiers largely confined to barracks, human rights violations have decreased since the ceasefire. However, there are still regular reports of incidents of Maoist intimidation and extortion and the Government of Nepal have yet to establish rule of law throughout all areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.0/3">We are concerned about the human rights situation in Nepal and in particular reports that a number of human rights defenders, members of civil society and the media regularly face threats and intimidation. We have urged all sides in the peace process to allow human rights organisations to carry out their work free from intimidation and interference.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.0/4">We have also pressed the Government of Nepal and Maoists to take urgent steps to tackle impunity. The lack of a credible Government response to the question of impunity risks undermining the peace process and decreases public confidence in the state security system. In the run-up to elections to a constituent assembly, it is vital that the Government and Maoists work hard to create an environment that will enable all political parties to campaign and voters to cast their ballots in a free and fair atmosphere.</p>

	<p pid="b.90W.3/1">Elections to the constituent assembly are scheduled for June 2007. Credible, free and fair elections will be key to sustaining the momentum of the current peace process as well as giving a voice to marginalised groups in Nepal. But it is vital that conditions are right for holding the elections. There needs to be proper preparation for the elections including voter education and there needs to be an environment that allows all democratic political parties to campaign freely and people to vote without fear. A flawed election will serve no-one's interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.3/2">The Election Commission, supported by the UN election team, has made good progress. The registration of voters is almost complete (the overall increase in the voters list is estimated at around 20 per cent.) and almost all the 25 UN Electoral Advisers are now in Nepal. Through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we have committed funds directly to the Election Commission to assist in their preparations.</p>
	<p pid="b.90W.3/3">However, the Election Commissioner has recently declared that he is unable to make progress on preparations for the elections until the necessary legislation has been passed. This requires decisions in the Parliament on the type of voting system necessary and appropriate. At a press conference in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February</phrase>, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ian Martin, said that the Election Commission faced considerable challenges if an election is to take place in June (further information on the press conference can be found on the UN website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.2/1">Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of November 2006, the Maoists agreed that their People's Liberation Army (PLA) would be confined to seven main cantonment sites, spread across Nepal, while the Nepal army would be confined to barracks. Maoist weapons would be stored in sealed containers, to which they would keep the keys, but the UN would monitor the integrity of the containers and the confinement of combatants to the camps. Maoists moved the PLA and their weapons to the proposed cantonment sites almost immediately and the UN has moved quickly to complete the registration of combatants and storage of weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/2">The CPA required the Government of Nepal to provide the infrastructure of the camps and to ensure that combatants were given adequate shelter and provisions. However, this process has been slow and, in the early days, international donors provided some assistance (the Department for International Development provided practical support on the provision of water and sanitation for the camps and the Indian Government provided tents to house the PLA and containers to store the weapons).</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/3">Recently, we received reports that a number of former PLA combatants had temporarily left the Shaktikhor cantonment site in Chitwan complaining that the Government of Nepal were failing to provide sufficient food and water to the camps. However, their weapons remained under UN supervision. The question of Maoists leaving cantonment sites was reported to, and discussed by, the Joint Monitoring Co-ordinating Committee, chaired by the UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>. UNMIN had previously expressed its concern to the Government of Nepal about the living conditions at the cantonment sites and had called on the Government and Maoists to work together to make immediate arrangements to improve these conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/4">We were concerned at reports that former members of the PLA had left the cantonment site, in a clear breach of the Agreement on Monitoring of Arms and Armies of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase>. However, it is important to note that weapons storage and monitoring remained in place and that all sides to the agreement worked closely to ensure that combatants returned quickly to the cantonment site following the intervention of the Maoist leadership and a commitment from the Government of Nepal to meet their demands on funding, provisions and camp infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/5">We are confident that this incident will not affect the positive progress of the ongoing peace process in Nepal.</p>

	<p pid="b.94W.2/1">The UK has played a leading role in negotiating all the UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) on Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.2/2">Ministers and officials are in constant contact with the UN Secretariat about Darfur. My noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, visited New York on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase> to press the UN for more rapid action on deployment of the African Union/UN hybrid force and for urgent action on the political process.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.2/3">We believe that the next step is for the UN Security Council to impose tougher measures on the Government of Sudan and rebel groups in view of their failure to co-operate with the UN. We will be pressing the council for the extension of the existing arms embargo and for sanctions on more individuals in accordance with UNSCR 1591 (2005).</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.2/4">The numbers of Sudanese asylum applications received in the UK between 2004 and 2006 have dropped. The total number of applications, excluding dependants, at the height of the Darfur conflict in 2004 was 1,305; in 2005 the figure fell to 885; and in 2006 to 675. The 2005 and 2006 figures are provisional.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.0/1">The CAVR Commission for Truth and Reconciliation was appointed by the then UN Transitional Administration in East Timor at the urging of the National Council of Timorese resistence, a representative East Timorese political body. Its report was delivered to East Timorese President Gusmao in October 2005, who subsequently presented its findings to the Timorese Parliament. The report has not yet been discussed by the East Timorese Parliament. However, in addressing the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase> President Gusmao expressed caution about the recommendations contained in the report, noting the need to achieve restorative justice rather than punitive justice and warning of the need to consolidate democracy in East Timor and Indonesia. In the absence of further interventions by the East Timorese Government and Parliament, we do not believe it will serve the interests of the people of East Timor for the United Kingdom to call for the report to be placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.103W.2/12">The difference in costs over the period reflects the changing nature of the Home Office's business, in particular the growth of international terrorism, migration and international travel. Collaboration and information exchange with other countries on counter-terrorism activities and border control have become increasingly critical to the effective discharge of the Department's responsibilities for asylum, immigration and national security. This has involved higher levels of overseas travel.</p>

	<p pid="b.104W.8/1">It is not possible currently to estimate the likely effect on crime of heroin prescription to long- term addicts. The current evidence base indicates that heroin prescribing is only suitable in a small number of cases. In the vast majority of cases, it is not a safer or a more effective option than methadone prescribing.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.8/2">The National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS), the most important UK research on drug treatment, showed that for every &pound;1 spent on treatment, at least &pound;9.50 is saved, mainly in the costs of reduced crime. Thus there are clear economic benefits to treating drug misusers. However, this study provided no information of the relative impact of different types of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.104W.8/3">Research is under way to build our knowledge in this area. The Home Office has commissioned the Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study (DTORS) which will evaluate the impact of current drug treatment services on drug and alcohol use, offending, and health and social outcomes. Additionally, Government-funded projects to enhance the evidence base for the clinical use of heroin in drug treatment are currently under way.</p>

	<p pid="b.105W.2/3">The network will be supplemented by remote interview sites for remote communities, where applicants will conduct their interview by video conferencing. The contract for this office network was awarded in early 2006 to Mapeley, and the offices are currently being leased and fitted out for use by IPS.</p>
	<p pid="b.105W.2/4">These offices will open in 2007 and the network will subsequently be used for the National Identity Scheme. Where the network of enrolment centres needs to be further expanded, we will first seek to use high street offices that are already used by central and local government. We will also look at options for the private sector providing outlets and any contracts will be tendered as appropriate.</p>

When the RIP Bill was tabled, its regulatory impact assessment (RIA) estimated, accurately, total compliance costs to business (communications service providers (CSPs)) would not exceed the measure of significance (&pound;20 million) used by the Regulatory Impact Unit of the Cabinet Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.2/2">Chapter II of Part I of RIPA, which provides for the lawful acquisition and disclosure of communications data, entered into force in January 2004. In line with section 24 of RIPA, arrangements are in place for CSPs to recover the costs incurred by them in complying with disclosure required by public authorities. We estimate that in 2005-06 public authorities paid communications service providers less than &pound;20 million for disclosing communications data when required to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.112W.2/3">Part III of RIPA, which provides for the investigation of protected electronic data, is not yet in force although the Government have completed a public consultation on a draft code of practice which Parliament will be invited to approve shortly. The RIA for the RIP Bill estimated total compliance costs to business relating to Part III were not expected to exceed the measure of significance. That estimate is still valid.</p>

	<p pid="b.124W.0/1">Practice-based gives primary care professionals an opportunity to engage in commissioning and redesign services to better meet patients' needs. PBC gives general practitioners more responsibility for local health budgets. This acts as a driver for more responsive and innovative models of joined-up support within communities, delivering better health outcomes and well-being, including a focus on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="b.124W.0/2">All primary care trusts (PCTs) had arrangements in place to support general practitioners in commissioning and delivering services as part of PBC by December 2006, providing each practice with an indicative budget, information on activity and an incentive to become engaged. PCTs are expected to support practices that are innovative and entrepreneurial, working with them to redesign clinical pathways and secure the services that are needed locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.124W.0/3">New guidance published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase> sets out further obligations on PCTs to help advance PBC. Strategic health authorities are expected to assure themselves that there is a quality framework to support PBC.</p>

	<p pid="b.125W.0/1">The Government do not currently collect these data. Nevertheless, the 2006 World Health Report &quot;Working Together for Health&quot; looked at patterns of health care professionals migrating to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The report says that while statistics on global flows of health workers remain far from complete, nearly 25 per cent. of doctors trained in sub-Saharan Africa are working in OECD countries (from 3 per cent. in Cameroon to 37 per cent. in South Africa). Nurses and midwives trained in sub-Saharan Africa and working in OECD countries represent 5 per cent. of the current work force (again a wide range from 0.1 per cent. in Uganda to 34 per cent. in Zimbabwe). Table 5.1, a copy of which has been placed in the Library, says that among OECD countries there is a range as to the percentage of doctors trained abroad (from 4 per cent. in Portugal to 34 per cent. in New Zealand (33 per cent. for the United Kingdom) and for nurses (0 per cent. for Finland to 21 per cent. for New Zealand (10 per cent. for the UK). It is important to note that the report does not specify the number of these overseas-trained doctors and nurses who come from developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.130W.6/1">We are giving a three-year project grant to Infertility Network UK to help primary care trusts share best practice in the provision of fertility services and engage with fertility patients in the planning and prioritisation of services. In the current year, the project funding is &pound;21,000, increasing to &pound;25,000 in 2007-08 and 2008-09. This is in addition to three-year core funding of &pound;30,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.6/2">Once Infertility Network UK has completed an analysis of current provision, we will discuss taking the initial findings forward with including making the results of this work publicly available. As the project progresses, they will liaise with primary care trusts to discuss approaches to the provision of fertility services and the dissemination of good practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.131W.0/1">In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza any workers who have been or could be exposed to infection through their work activity will be offered the antiviral oseltamivir subject to an individual risk assessment by the Health Protection Agency. Such workers are likely to include poultry workers on the infected farm, vets, catchers and cullers of poultry, and contractors involved in carcase disposal and site decontamination.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.0/2">Our current United Kingdom strategy is to use antiviral drugs predominantly for treatment of people with pandemic influenza. We are currently considering the practicalities of giving short courses of anti-virals (as prophylaxis) to members of the household of a person with pandemic influenza. However, this would require a larger stockpile than currently planned.</p>

	<p pid="b.139W.8/1">The role of national programme local service providers (LSPs) is to deliver information technology systems and services across the national health service within clusters of strategic health authorities, in London (BT), the south (Fujitsu), and the north, midlands and east (CSC). LSPs ensure the integration of existing local systems and, where necessary, implement new systems so that the national applications can be delivered locally, while maintaining common standards. All LSPs have contracted to develop and deliver a fully integrated NHS care record solution, and are in the process of doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.139W.8/2">Like all contracts, those between the Department and the LSPs provide for obligations and undertakings on either party. Among the key requirements which the contracts place on the LSPs are that functions and services are shown to work before they are bought. If providers do not deliver to their contractual obligations they are not paid. In this way the cost of non-delivery rests with the supplier, not the taxpayer. So, for example, we have retained extensive rights under the contracts to defer payments, receive compensation for missed milestones and, if necessary, terminate contracts, for failure to achieve required performance or deployment activity. We also reserve the right to consent to the appointment of key personnel of the prime contractor and material subcontractors, and have an interventionist approach to assurance including step-in rights or the appointment of a third party in certain critical circumstances if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.139W.8/3">These arrangements have been devised to secure an optimum balance between cost, risk, incentive and quality of outcome for the provision of the systems and services that we have specified for the benefit of patients, the NHS and taxpayers.</p>

To date expenditure has covered releases 2 and 3 of the software, a number of minor enhancements increasing the breadth of functionality in response to user comments and changing policy requirements, the delivery and support of a demonstration environment to facilitate clinical engagement, and an additional test environment to ensure that the new software performs as required. An additional &pound;36 million has been spent on supporting the technical configuration of 109,000 local desktop computers and infrastructure to make them compatible with choose and book and with subsequent national programmes for information technology systems.

A one-off estimate was made in 2004 that approximately 20,000 households across the whole of England were in conditions of overcrowding that breached the statutory standard. This estimate was based on data from the Survey of English Housing for the period 2000-01 to 2002-03 and from the 2001 English House Condition Survey.

	<p pid="b.156W.8/5" class="indent">For a case under old rules where, a non-resident parent has care for a child for at least 104 nights a year (that is, two nights a week on average), an allowance can be made in the maintenance formula for sharing the care of that child.

	<p pid="b.156W.8/6" class="indent">For a shared-care case under the new rules, if a non-resident parent provides overnight care for a child for at least 52 nights a year, an adjustment is also made to the amount of child maintenance due.</p>

	<p pid="b.165W.5/1">Forecasts of incapacity benefits are constructed by extending historic patterns in benefit on-flows and off-flows into the future. Events such as entering the benefit, moving between rates, gaining additional entitlements and leaving the benefit are simulated on the basis past trends examined by age and gender. Assumptions covering these events give rise to a predicted future caseload.</p>

We understand that in order to do this we need to address the barriers that lone parents face in returning to work. The Department collects a range of evidence on the choices and constraints faced by lone parents in making decisions about paid work. Many of these have also been raised in two independent reviews by Lisa Marker and David Freud. We will need to consider these reports carefully before we move ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.170W.8/2">Personal accounts will be designed to complement rather than compete with existing successful pension provision.

	<p pid="b.170W.8/4">If at any age the holder receives income from the personal pension scheme, that income will be taken fully into account in the assessment of entitlement to an income-related benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.8/5">However, if a customer aged 60 or over fails to claim the income to which he would be entitled or fails to purchase an annuity with the funds available, the customer will be treated as possessing the amount of income forgone from the date on which it could have been expected to be claimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.170W.8/6">Up to 25 per cent. of any personal pension can be taken as a lump sum, and if this option is taken, that lump sum will be treated as capital for the purposes of income related support in the normal way.</p>

	<p pid="b.172W.5/5">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February</phrase> that I have asked the Department's commercial director to develop a centre of expertise within the procurement team working with the third sector, to specifically cover the needs of faith-based groups. In doing this, I want to make sure that access to contracts for faith groups can be on an even footing with all other private and voluntary sector organisations who wish to compete to deliver our services.</p>
