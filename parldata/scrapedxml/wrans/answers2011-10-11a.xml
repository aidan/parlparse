	<p pid="a.319W.10/1">The marginal cost of this year&#8217;s additional sitting has been relatively low as most operating costs are fixed costs and are therefore unaffected by the number and distribution of sittings, and there was sufficient notice to take the September sitting into account when planning the works programme. We estimate a marginal cost of around &#163;200,000 will be incurred as the direct result of the two-week sitting in September. To avoid an accumulating backlog of works, further September sittings would be likely to have a marginal cost of some &#163;1.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.321W.9/3">As Chair of the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility I have been asked to reply to your recent questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.9/4">The central forecast in our March Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) was for GDP growth of 1.7 per cent in 2011 and 2.5 per cent in 2012. Net debt was projected to rise to 66.1 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 and to 69.7 per cent of GDP in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.9/5">As always, there is considerable uncertainty around such point estimates. In light of this, we undertake extensive sensitivity and scenario analysis in order to illustrate the implications for the public finances of altering some of the key parameters and judgements in the central forecast.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.9/6">As set out in the EFO document, for these purposes we use a ready-reckoner that assumes a 1 per cent change in GDP in a given year will result in a 0.5 per cent of GDP change in public sector net borrowing (PSNB) in the first year, and a 0.7 per cent of GDP change in PSNB after two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.9/7">This gives a broad-brush guide to the scale of the impact, by assuming that the difference in GDP is structural; the composition of GDP remains unchanged; and that, given the state of the economy, there are no errors in forecasting receipts or expenditure. In reality, there are additional uncertainties around all of these factors. We illustrate some of the general uncertainty through the use of a fan chart, which shows the probability of different borrowing outcomes based on past forecast errors.</p>
	<p pid="a.321W.9/8">We will update our forecasts on 29th November. The Charter for Budget Responsibility requires us to produce each of our fiscal and economic forecasts on a date announced to Parliament by the Chancellor. In line with this, it would not be appropriate to publish new estimates in isolation prior to the publication of the November EFO.</p>

Paraguay has ratified the indigenous and tribal people&#8217;s convention of the International Labour Organisation and voted in favour for the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. However, Paraguay's institutional framework could more effectively protect and promote the rights of indigenous people. During the recent Universal Periodic Review of Paraguay's human rights record at the UN, the UK pushed for Paraguay to ensure land disputes involving indigenous people are resolved effectively. Paraguay accepted this recommendation and committed to establishing a proper process to do so. UK relations with Paraguay are conducted through our embassy in Buenos Aires. The UK will continue to monitor this situation from there and through the EU Delegation in Asuncion.</p>

	<p pid="a.327W.5/2">This work has been necessary to ensure that the plans agreed for individual NHS trusts to move forward to NHS foundation trust status, will support all these organisations in becoming established as clinically sustainable and financially viable organisations, and best placed to deliver the best health outcomes for patients using services. In a number of NHS trusts, this process has required difficult decisions to be taken by trusts working with SHAs to support the achievement of this objective, for which locally-owned, robust plans are necessary. This has been the focus of the work carried out since the previous answers. A significant number of these plans are now signed off and published, with all the remaining plans for NHS trusts to move forward to NHS foundation trust status scheduled to be agreed and signed by the end of September.</p>

We will encourage local areas to create networks of local smokefree ambassadors at a community level to encourage people to make their homes and family cars smokefree.</p>

	<p pid="a.330W.2/1">Support is currently provided to victims of domestic violence who have no recourse to public funds through a UK Border Agency (UKBA) funded project called Sojourner. This is limited to migrants who entered the UK as a spouse, civil partner, un-married or same-sex partner of a British citizen or person present and settled in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.2/2">The project provides refuge places to vulnerable victims for a limited period while an application for indefinite leave to remain as a victim of domestic violence is considered by UKBA officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.2/3">The Sojourner project is not a long term solution which is why, after April 2012, migrants on spousal visas in need of refuge places will be given a short period of leave so they will be able to access welfare benefits while their claim for indefinite leave to remain in the UK is considered. This is a major step to ensuring that this vulnerable group remains protected and safe from abuse.</p>

	<p pid="a.332W.0/2">The North of England Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health programme is a multi-agency partnership covering three Department of Health regions (North West, North East, and Yorkshire and Humber) where smoking rates are some of the highest in the country, and there are a number of major hot spots for illicit tobacco. The programme was launched in 2009 following a period of extensive research. Programme funding of &#163;1 million over three years has been provided by the Department of Health and subsequent funding from Department of Health and primary care trusts from tobacco control budgets has allowed the programme to extend into other activities such as evaluation support.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/3">The programme brings together regional public health, trading standards, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), local authorities and the police&#8212;all committed to reducing the supply and demand for illicit tobacco. The programme plan sets out the following eight key objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/4">Developing partnerships</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/5">Engaging health and community workers</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/6">Generating and sharing intelligence</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/7">Identifying informal markets and preventative action</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/8">Delivering enforcement</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/9">Marketing and communication</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/10">Working with business</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/11">Assessing progress</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/12">The North of England programme has enabled the HMRC to influence outside enforcement activity and improved joint working with Trading Standards in tackling illicit tobacco at the local level. The HMRC/Trading Standards Join Working Protocol has been updated to clarify responsibilities, develop data sharing practices and improve flows of intelligence for joint planning purposes to target illicit tobacco.</p>
	<p pid="a.332W.0/13">In addition the Intellectual Property Office Intelligence Hub manages the national Intellectual Property Crime Intelligence Database. The hub receives intellectual property crime intelligence from a number of sources, including industry anti-piracy and brand protection units, trading standards, police forces, HMRC, the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This intelligence is fed into the Intellectual Property intelligence database, to help co-ordinate the response to the national threat of counterfeit products.</p>

	<p pid="a.334W.0/1">Bullying and harassment are not tolerated in the armed forces. All service and civilian personnel, regardless of rank or grade, have a right to be treated with dignity. All MOD employees have a responsibility to do all they can to ensure that the working environment is free from all forms of bullying and harassment and that the dignity of others is respected. This is clearly laid down, along with the procedures to be followed if a complaint is made, in the Joint Service Publication 763.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.0/2">The policy has not changed since April 2004. Its implementation has, however, been reinforced following criticism from the then Equal Opportunities Commission and recommendations made by Nicholas Blake QC in his review of the deaths at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut. We have, for example, reviewed equality and diversity training to ensure it is delivered to all levels of personnel, and ensured that sanctions are brought against those found culpable of bullying or harassment. In response to the Deepcut review, we established the post of Service Complaints Commissioner in the Armed Forces Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.0/3">The Commissioner provides an avenue for individuals to raise an allegation of bullying, harassment or improper behaviour, which the Commissioner can decide to refer to the chain of command for investigation, and about which the Commissioner must be kept updated. In addition, independent scrutiny of our training environment is now provided through inspections carried out by Ofsted.</p>

It should be noted that during this period, the MOD refined its methodology for recording mental health statistics.

In addition, we have published draft legislative provisions to extend the electoral timetable for UK parliamentary elections from 17 to 25 working days, and will make a corresponding change for the by-elections timetable, to take effect in time for the next scheduled general election in 2015. These provisions will have particular benefits for service personnel stationed outside the UK as it will allow more time for the dispatch and return of postal votes to overseas locations.</p>

	<p pid="a.345W.2/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.345W.2/5">Failure to pay child maintenance is not a criminal offence, so parents can not be prosecuted. However, where a non-resident parent fails to pay maintenance, there are a number of enforcement actions available. Money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's earnings if the non-resident parent is employed, money can be taken directly from a non-resident parent's bank or building society account, or action can be taken to recover money through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.345W.2/6">The most serious forms of enforcement are commitment to prison or disqualification from driving. The decision whether to impose these, and the length of any order made, is at the discretion of a Magistrates' Court (or Sheriff in Scotland) where they are satisfied that a non-resident parent has &#8220;wilfully refused or culpably neglected&#8221; to pay child maintenance&#8212;but these are not criminal sanctions.</p>

	<p pid="a.346W.2/1">The DWP has a business travel policy and uses the services of a travel management company (TMC) to ensure best value is achieved when purchasing airline tickets.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.2/2">The TMC contract was sourced from Government Procurement Service (GPS) Travel Management Service Provision framework, which was let compliant with the public contracting regulations and EU procurement directives. This framework offers the most cost-effective travel management services available to central Government. The DWP is contracted with Expotel Hotel Reservations Ltd who access the airlines&#8217; global distribution system (GDS) and low cost carriers on our behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.2/3">The Department also complies with the Government Air Programme (GAP) which is a discount framework agreement, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August 2009</phrase> by the GPS on behalf of central Government. The TMC uses the Government Air Programme appropriately whenever it is most economical to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.2/4">Departmental policy is that staff must always consider use of video conferencing where appropriate or travelling by rail rather than air and this has resulted in a 67.4% reduction in ticket purchases since 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.2/5">To facilitate further reductions in air travel, policy now restricts air travel for flights within the British mainland to journeys of over 300 miles. Journeys under this limit require the use of an alternative mode of travel, to limit the Departments&#8217; carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.346W.2/6">It should also be noted that the Department has achieved a 40% reduction in spend on travel in the last year and the Department continuously reviews policies and processes with a view to driving out further efficiencies. For example, the Department has introduced a ban on first-class rail travel.</p>

	<p pid="a.351W.2/1">The Government wants to help individuals by having a stable economy with sustained and balanced growth, which is why we are taking action to tackle the deficit and support business in creating jobs. The Government's Growth Review will continue for the rest of this Parliament, providing ongoing focus on what the Government can do to support growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.2/2">We believe that pension provision is important and that is why we are introducing workplace pension reform. Automatic enrolment will be introduced from 2012 requiring all employers to enrol eligible workers into workplace pension saving and to make an employer contribution. It is for employers to choose the type of scheme they want to use to meet their employer duties and this could be a personal pension arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.2/3">The aim of automatic enrolment is to encourage people to start saving, continue saving and save for longer to meet their retirement needs. As a result of automatic enrolment we expect there to be around five to eight million people newly saving or saving more in all forms of workplace pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.2/4">Automatic enrolment is widely recognised as the best way to overcome people's savings inertia&#8212;rather than having to make an active decision to save in a workplace pension, an employee has to make an active decision not to save. Even where an individual opts out, the employer is required to re-enrol them every three years, encouraging individuals to rethink about the need to save for their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.2/5">A programme of communications and information is being designed to help people understand the need to save to meet their aspirations for retirement, build awareness of the changes and support a behavioural shift amongst working age people so that saving in a pension becomes the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.351W.2/6">And for future pensioners the Government are looking at reforming the state pension system which would be simple, easy to understand, efficient to deliver, affordable&#8212;providing a firm foundation for workplace saving.</p>

	<p pid="a.352W.0/77">In addition, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), an obligation on energy suppliers to deliver carbon savings in the household sector, is the primary existing driver of household energy saving measures&#8212;especially insulation. To ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits, the scheme requires a proportion of the carbon savings be achieved in the homes of 'priority' lower income households (aged 70 and over or on certain means tested benefits). In the first two years of the scheme, between April 2008 and March 2010, 3,861 Priority Group households in York benefited from subsidised loft and/or cavity wall insulation under the scheme. CERT runs to December 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.356W.0/1">We are supporting young people into work by investing in flexible, personalised employment support, apprenticeships, work experience and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.0/2">Jobcentre Plus advisers are now empowered to decide when and how to support claimants using a comprehensive menu of help including skills provision and job search support. The aim is to give individuals the right support at the right time rather than delivering set interventions at set times as in the past. District Managers have the flexibility to put in place the support appropriate to the local circumstances and needs of the unemployed young people in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.0/3">Work experience and apprenticeships are central to improving the prospects of young unemployed people across the country. This Government will deliver at least 250,000 more apprenticeships over the spending review period than the previous Government had planned and is funding 100,000 work placements over the next two years. Work Experience offers young people a placement with a local business for a period of two to eight weeks. Placements may be extended by up to four weeks where an employer offers the individual an apprenticeship and that offer is accepted. This extension will be one of the routes that will help to maximise the number of young people moving off benefits into the 40,000 extra apprenticeships, targeted at unemployed young people, that were announced in the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.0/4">Sector-based work academies are being set up to offer pre-employment training, work placements and a guaranteed interview in sectors with high volumes of current local vacancies. They are available to people of all ages but will be particularly beneficial to young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.0/5">We also have in place the Work programme for people who need further help to move into employment. Work programme providers will have complete flexibility to innovate and design support based on individual and local needs rather than having to follow a one-size-fits all approach. Young people aged between 18 and 24 years have priority access after nine months, however the most disadvantaged young people may enter even earlier after three months of unemployment.</p>

However, a review of each scheme's costs by the relevant local authorities and indexation savings has yielded &#163;500 million in savings. Further efficiencies are being sought by applying new ways of delivering this investment that will maximise value for money, as set out in Sebastian James's review of schools capital. The benefits of this innovative approach to driving out greater efficiencies is already evident in the Campsmount project in Doncaster, which is being built at significantly lower cost than BSF schemes of the same size.</p>

	<p pid="a.367W.6/3">Rather than a cap on the total cost of credit, research commissioned by the previous Administration considered the impact of flat rate interest rate caps in the high cost credit market. This research found that interest rate caps would in all likelihood be detrimental to those consumers who rely on this market for credit, reducing access to licensed credit and potentially forcing them to have to borrow from unlicensed illegal lenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.367W.6/4">The Department will give an update on the progress of the research in the spring and anticipates that the research will have been completed and the findings announced by summer 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.368W.5/1">There are no robust data about the impact of late payment upon the productivity of small and medium-sized businesses but we do know that late payment creates a climate of uncertainty in the supply chain, inhibiting investment and innovation and stifling growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/2">That is why Government have worked hand in hand with the UK's leading business representative organisations, finance bodies and banks to develop a multi-faceted strategy for addressing what is a long-standing and widespread culture of late payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/3">A critical issue in this regard is supporting business to better manage customer relationships: the majority of UK transactions currently take place with no pre-agreed payment terms and Barclays data show that only one in 10 suppliers regularly credit checks customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/4">The guides on managing cash flow, developed by the Institute of Credit Management and supported by all the UK's leading business organisations, finance bodies and banks, have proven to be very popular. They provide a simple checklist on a variety of cash flow actions, including agreeing payment terms and invoicing correctly.</p>
	<p pid="a.368W.5/5">While changing a long-standing culture takes time, the latest data we have on late payment across the UK economy (sourced from Experian) show speed of payment improving in the second quarter of 2011 and better than the same period in 2010.</p>
