	<p pid=".1W.3/4">The CPS has not conducted any formal market testing activity in the last five years.</p>

Another contract was let, after a further tendering exercise, for the Department's security guarding function in December 1999, as a consequence of the withdrawal of the previous (public sector) supplier.

	<p pid=".10W.6/2">The Government welcome the principles of EU trading to encourage European industry to gain early experience of trading in advance of international trading under the Kyoto protocol. The Commission's proposal for a EU emissions trading scheme does differ in some respects from the UK scheme; one significant difference is that the Commission's proposal is for a mandatory scheme whereas the UK scheme is voluntary. The Government are working with the Commission and other member states during the negotiation process to develop a less rigid emissions trading scheme for the EU that takes account of existing national trading arrangements and provides for them to run their course. It has always been the Government's intention that the transition between the UK scheme and any EU or international trading scheme will be as seamless as possible.</p>

For the time being, therefore, sinks and forest sequestration projects are not eligible for entry into the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. This approach to sinks and sequestration will be kept under review.</p>

A number of trades have already taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/2">A total of 34 organisations successfully joined the Scheme through a competitive auction held in March. In return for taking on legally binding emissions reduction targets, these organisations will each receive a share of the financial incentive that the Government are making available over the five years of the Scheme. They can choose to meet their annual targets by reducing emissions themselves or by buying surplus allowances from other participating organisations. To date, over 50 other organisations have opened trading accounts so that they can buy and sell allowances.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/3">We expect the volume of trades and number of participants to increase in the autumn and beyond when participation in the Scheme widens as some of the 6,000 companies in Climate Change Agreements begin buying allowances to enable them to meet their targets or selling any over-achievement to other participants. Projects that produce quantified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will also be able, in time and subject to prior approval from the Government, to earn credits that can then be traded through the Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.3/1">The European Union has agreed interim measures to limit adventitious presence of approved GMOs in non-GM seeds to 0.5 per cent. More specific proposals are under discussion within the European Union. These would set cross-pollination thresholds ranging from 0.3 per cent. to 0.7 per cent. (depending on the species) in seed, in order broadly to keep GM presence in the resulting produce below the 1 per cent. threshold set for food. The Government are also considering what measures might be required to facilitate the co-existence of ordinary (non-seed) GM and non-GM crops and who should be responsible for such measures. For seed production, the grower of the seed crop is normally responsible for observing rules to achieve the desired level of seed purity. With organic seeds and produce, as with conventional seeds and produce, it is not possible to guarantee that GM cross-pollination will not occur, but we would like to aim for the lowest practical level, bearing in mind relevant factors, including the need to protect non-GM produce, the views of stakeholders, the practicalities of detection at low levels, and the costs involved.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.8/1">All radioactive discharges from the UK are within national and international dose constraints. The UK has made substantial progress in reducing these discharges over the last 25 years. Discharges now are less than 1 per cent. of what they were then. In making these reductions we have concentrated on the most harmful radionuclides. However, we accept that more needs to be done to deliver further reductions.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.8/2">At a ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission at Sintra, Portugal in 1998, OSPAR members including the UK undertook to reduce radioactive discharges. Contracting parties must produce national plans by <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase> showing how they are going to achieve these reductions. The UK Radioactive Discharges Strategy will demonstrate how we are going to meet the targets for reducing radioactive discharges agreed at Sintra. The UK consulted about its draft strategy in June 2000 and we intend to publish the final version in time to meet the July 2002 deadline. Copies of the strategy will be placed in the House of Commons Library. We have also consulted on draft guidance to the Environment Agency which will help ensure that decisions on discharge authorisations for nuclear licensed sites in England are consistent with the UK strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.8/3">The Environment Agency has also carried out a public consultation on its review of Sellafield authorisations. The agency will put its recommendations to Ministers later this year. The agency carried out a fast-track review of Technetium-99 discharges ahead of the main Sellafield review. Their recommendations are currently with DEFRA and DoH Ministers for consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.5/1">In June 1997 the Prime Minister set a target for all local authorities in the UK to adopt Local Agenda 21 strategies by the year 2000. A Government Office survey showed that 93 per cent. of local authorities met this target.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/2">The Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on local authorities to prepare a community strategy for promoting or improving the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom. The Government want to see sustainable development become a mainstream issue for local authorities, their partners, and local communities. It believes that the most effective way to achieve this is to subsume Local Agenda 21 strategies within community strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/3">The Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions have introduced a Best Value Performance Indicator to report on local authorities' progress with community strategies. A survey of English and Welsh Authorities by the Local Government Association in autumn 2001 found that, of the 67 per cent. which responded, 27 per cent. of authorities had developed a strategy. Of those yet to develop a strategy, nearly 80 per cent. said they would have one by March 2002, and the remainder would be published by March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.9/13">In respect of sulphur dioxide, the most significant emissions reductions in recent years have come about as a result of changes in industrial practices as well as the regulatory controls we have imposed. We estimate, for example, that fuel switching from coal to gas in power stations (which began in 1992&ndash;93) has reduced sulphur dioxide emissions by one million tonnes from what it might otherwise have been. We also estimate that the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to two large coal power stations in 1993&ndash;94 has reduced emissions by 0.2 million tonnes; and that the use of lower-sulphur coal has reduced emissions by about 0.15 million tonnes.In respect of particles and oxides of nitrogen, the most significant contribution has come from the reductions in road transport emissions which are largely the result of the progressively tighter European Union standards for new motor vehicles and fuels. The introduction of three way catalysts on petrol vehicles in the early 1990s, for example, is estimated to have reduced emissions of oxides of nitrogen in 1999 by about 30 per cent. compared to what emissions might otherwise have been. Improvements in diesel vehicle technology have also made a significant contribution to reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particles. The UK Government have helped to incentivise the early uptake of clean fuels (such as ultra-low-sulphur diesel and petrol) by setting preferential duty rates for them.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.2/1">The increase of &pound;44,767.18 was largely due to the refurbishment and redecoration of the staff restaurant in our London offices at the start of 2000, involving the purchase of new catering equipment (freezers, cold counter and dishwasher), carpets and furniture. In addition, subsidies paid to catering contractors increased by &pound;6,800 per annum in our East Kilbride office and by &pound;7,300 per annum in London. The increase of &pound;6,935.57 in catering services was a result of greater usage of hospitality services (i.e. teas, coffees, buffets etc.) on offer at both locations, principally as a result of the contractors advertising the facility more widely, coupled with a sharp increase in the number of meetings being held in both locations.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.2/1">The Government have introduced a number of procedural reforms to ensure that criminal cases are brought before the courts with the minimum of delay. These include bringing charged cases before magistrates courts at the first available hearing; sending indictable only cases straight to the Crown court following first appearance in the magistrates court; and reducing by more than half the time taken to deal with persistent young offenders from arrest to sentence (from 142 days to 67 by December 2001).</p>
	<p pid=".30W.2/2">Looking ahead, the Government are also formulating a set of exacting targets to further reduce delay; running pilot schemes involving extended court sitting hours and closer Crown Prosecution Service/police liaison prior to charge.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.2/3">Her Majesty's chief inspectors of the Court Service and the Crown Prosecution Service are also conducting a national inspection of listing, to seek to identify how courts can manage their case loads most efficiently, and we look forward to making use of their findings and recommendations in order to make continued progress in reducing delay.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.5/1">Since 1997, the police in England and Wales have been involved in a number of initiatives. Some relate only to the police, while others, such as the introduction of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, bring together a number of partners to concentrate on those issues of greatest concern to the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.5/2">Police authorities are required to set targets for reductions in domestic burglary, vehicle crime and, in five major cities, robbery. This month the Street Crime Action Team was set up to help deliver these robbery targets. The police service also has a key role to play in delivering Government targets relating to, for example, drug misuse and persistent young offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.0/1">The latest survey of violent crime is contained in the 2001 British Crime Survey, which indicated that violent crime fell by 19 per cent. between 1999 and 2000. Recent recorded crime statistics produced by the Metropolitan Police show a rise in recorded street robbery. That is why we have launched an initiative aimed at reducing the level of street crime in the 10 areas of England and Wales with the highest levels of street robbery. The programmes will focus on curbing the rise in street robberies and the number of illegally held weapons, as well as the adoption of fast track prosecutions to ensure that offenders are brought to justice speedily. The budget contained &pound;180 million in new money and a further &pound;100 million to be drawn from the Criminal Justice Reserve. These funds will be used for extra police, extra support staff, an increase in police operations and an additional 2,300 additional prison and remand places.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.9/1">The street crime initiative starts operation this month across the 10 force areas with the highest levels of robbery: Avon and Somerset, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Metropolitan Police, Merseyside, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, Thames Valley, West Midlands, West Yorkshire. It involves the police in targeting offenders who commit robbery, snatch theft, carjacking and offences involving the illegal possession and use of firearms. The criminal justice'agencies will prioritise these cases to ensure that those taken off the streets by the police are dealt with quickly and effectively from arrest to disposal in specially designated street crime courts in each area. We have also strengthened the powers of the courts in the 10 areas by introducing electronic tagging to ensure that young people comply with bail conditions, and by giving magistrates enhanced powers to remand juveniles in secure accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.9/2">The initiative also brings together the resources and expertise of non criminal justice system agencies to help tackle the causes of street crime and take preventive action. The initiative will include, for example, more schemes in place involving police in schools, more truancy sweeps, better information exchange between schools, the police and social services, diversionary activities and advice and services for young people, and early access to drug treatment provision.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.8/2">S.I. 2002/440 does not set any technical standards. It enables self-certification by prescribed persons for certain types of building work. With regard to windows, S.I. 2002/440 introduces a new Building Regulation that enables members of the Fenestration Self-Assessment (FENSA) Scheme to self-certify their installation work complies with the applicable technical requirements. FENSA members may certify that work consisting only of the installation, as a replacement, of a window, rooflight, roof window or door in an existing building complies with regulation 4 of the Building Regulations. This regulation requires that the work complies with the applicable requirements of Schedule 1 of those regulations (S.I. 2000/2531, as amended by S.I. 2001/3335).</p>
	<p pid=".43W.8/3">For building work comprising replacing windows guidance on compliance with the Building Regulations is given in Approved Documents L1 and L2. This includes guidance on what is reasonable provision for listed buildings. In addition to this, my Department has been working closely with English Heritage on a new publication advising on making reasonable energy efficiency provisions in conservation work. The publication is aimed at building control inspectors as well as builders, and I understand it will be published soon.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.2/2">In the regulatory impact analysis we undertook prior to laying the regulations, we considered that there would be no cost to local authorities from the introduction of S.I. 2002&ndash;440, as the provisions effectively relieve them of the burden of enforcement through building control. The builders of new homes will similarly not face a cost as the provisions deal solely with the installation of windows, and gas, solid fuel and oil-fired appliances, and plumbing in existing buildings. The cost for all installations of new windows in existing buildings through the need for installers to obtain membership of the fenestration self-assessment scheme was estimated at &pound;1,715,000 against savings of &pound;91,885,000 in the first year There will be no cost for applying for building regulation permission, as none of those registered with these schemes is required to give a building notice and pay a fee, in relation to carrying out work for which they are registered, and which is permitted not to be notified in the circumstances prescribed in the S.I.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.8/3">There are British Standards Institution Kitemark quality assurance schemes for window products, but none currently covers overall window U-values. More importantly however, as manufactured product schemes, they cannot address the compliance of installation work with the technical and workmanship requirements of the building regulations.</p>

Separately, school age children are often allowed half-fare travel, either funded by local authorities or by transport operators on a commercial basis&mdash;usually on all journeys they make, not just to and from school or college. Many transport operators offer discounted fares to &quot;Jobseekers&quot;. In addition, the Department for Education and Skills is developing the Connexions Card which will offer a range of commercial discounts for all 16&ndash;19 year olds. The card will be capable of carrying existing travel concessions and is expected to be available nationally from autumn 2002.</p>

As illustrated in the table, below increasing the rate of the Savings Credit to 90 per cent. would require an additional &pound;2 billion for a full year. It would also mean the Pension Credit would be payable to single pensioners with incomes over &pound;300 per week (nearly &pound;16,000 per year) and over &pound;430 for pensioner couples (around &pound;22,500).</p>

	<p pid=".61W.8/2">The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to achieving equality of opportunity and diversity. All applicants and employees are treated fairly to enable them to develop and fulfil their potential, valuing the contribution each person can make to the organisation. Vacancies other than those for positions in the Senior Civil Service are open to everyone up to the age of 65 and a person's age is not taken into account at any stage of the selection process.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.8/3">At present the normal retirement age for staff in the Senior Civil Service is set by the Cabinet Office at 60, although there is the option to retain members beyond the age of 60 if it is judged to be in the public interest and the Department is satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.</p>
	<p pid=".61W.8/4">We are committed to ending age discriminatory practices and Government Ministers, through the Cabinet Office, are actively working towards removing the current barriers for members of the Senior Civil Service.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-10">10 April 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/2">The Department continuously commissions tightly focused market research to help develop and evaluate advertising and publicity campaigns. This research will often focus on views of customers about its services.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/3">For example in 2001&ndash;02, campaigns where strategic communications research or creative development research have been commissioned include the drive to widen participation in Higher Education; the promotion of the relevance of science to teenagers, as part of Science Year, the child care recruitment campaign; the campaign to help those adults with basic skills gaps; and the promotion of foundation degrees and modern apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/4">It is seldom possible to publish the findings of this type of research as these projects test creative work commissioned from advertising agencies as part of the development of the publicity campaigns and are regarded as commercial-in-confidence. This research is subject to the usual strict rules that spending must represent good value for the taxpayer and must not be used for party political purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/5">The Department also conducts research to help us understand the education, skills and communication needs of our customers. It has sampled and consulted on the views of teachers, parents and other groups affected by the Department's policies on specific issues. For example the project &quot;Causes of truancy by pupils of compulsory school age&quot; gathers the views of pupils, parents, school and LEA staff on the causes of truancy and what measures could be taken to address the issue. One of the aims is to examine the issue of absence that is condoned by parents. &quot;A longitudinal study of factors contributing to variations in teacher effectiveness&quot; will investigate the factors which contribute to the effectiveness of teachers at different stages of their career, working in a range of schools in different contexts, and how this changes over time. Part of this study is to track 300 teachers over three years measuring their effectiveness by pupil outcome measures and other qualitative techniques. Again it would not be possible to give details of every project without disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/6">The Department is committed in particular to consulting its youngest customers and enthusiastically supports the Government's core principles on involving children and young people. We arranged a consultation day with pupils on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-05">5 November 2001</phrase> on the Education White Paper and our consultation on the 14&ndash;19 Green Paper which started in February includes a young persons' document and events with young people. Most Connexions Partnerships are successfully involving young people in the design, delivery and evaluation of the service. The views of young people are also gathered through the millennium volunteers national and regional fora. We will build on these examples to promote consultation with children and young people across the Department's activities.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.6/7">The Department's website has details of its research programme from 1997 on http://www/dfes.gov.uk/ research. Information about opinion polls, focus groups and other forms of research commissioned by the Department's agencies and non-departmental public bodies is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.2/1">It is not the role of the Department to decide when and where to build new schools. Local Education Authorities (LEAs) have a duty to ensure that there are sufficient school places available for children in their area. To help identify where additional places are needed, LEAs are required to produce annually a locally agreed School Organisation Plan which sets the context for the provision of school places over a five year period. Where Authorities can demonstrate a need for additional places, they can apply for capital funding support from the Department in the form of a basic need allocation. Since 2000&ndash;01, Lancashire LEA has received basic need allocations in respect of 587 secondary school places. It is, however, for the LEA to decide how best to use these allocations in line with the locally agreed priorities identified in its Asset Management Plan. Any proposal to establish a new school would be made and decided locally.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/1">Section 118 of the School Standards and Framework Act sets out the duty of the local education authority (LEA) in respect of nursery education. It imposes a duty on the LEA to secure that sufficient nursery education for children who have not attained compulsory school age is provided for their area, whether or not by the LEA. However, section 562 of the Education Act 1996 provides that none of the LEA's duties under that Act are to apply in respect of any person in custody because of a court order or because of an order of recall made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</p>

The targets in the EDPs are for the academic years 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 and were set for:</p>

NHS trusts with the greatest challenges will receive &pound;75,000 to fund a full-time manager and support from doctors to tackle the problem. They will have to meet specific targets set by the Modernisation Agency and their performance will be subject to monthly reviews.

To ensure that the friends and families of those people with mental health problems receive the information they need to support them in their role, the Department has produced a leaflet, &quot;A Commitment to Carers&quot;, that informs families and friends what they should expect from mental health services. This leaflet was widely distributed not only to service users and their families but also to mental health services and helps to outline that modern, responsive mental health services need to acknowledge the importance of the support networks that families and friends provide to those people with mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.8/9" class="indent">by 2004, 700 more staff will be recruited to increase the breaks available for carers, and to strengthen carer support networks. There are very few such staff at present. By then around 165,000 carers will be receiving the support they need to continue to provide care.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.2/2">We have set out in &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power: the Next Steps&quot; the public health functions and responsibilities of NHS bodies. Necessary and appropriate legislation and regulations to implement these functions are being laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/3">The NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Bill currently before Parliament includes a requirement for each primary care trust to have a director of public health as a board member. This will form part of a public health delivery system which will have a strong public health team in every PCT focused on improving health, preventing serious illness and reducing health inequalities in the populations served to ensure maximum improvement to health through prevention and other interventions.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/4">In future the intention is that allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts subject to the passage of legislation through Parliament. PCTs will receive an allocation for their relevant population. Therefore the small number of PCTs who have partial co-terminosity with strategic health authorities will not be affected adversely nor will their use of funding to support public health programmes locally.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.11/1">The National Radiological Protection Board's Radiation, Risk and Society Advisory Group (R,RSAG) was set up by NRPB in 2001. The R,RSAG is an independent advisory group that reports to the board of NRPB whose minutes are published on the NRPB website (<a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a>). R,RSAG membership and terms of reference are set out. Members have been drawn from a number of academic disciplines. Criteria for membership are academic experience in how to explain risk in general and radiological risk in particular to the public and a willingness to serve. The constraints on membership are the need for a group that is not too big to allow views to be debated adequately and the need for several academic disciplines to be represented.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.11/2">The group has discussed disclosure of its proceedings. It was agreed that the group's considerations and discussions would remain confidential until an agreed position was ready to be made public. Papers and reports from the group would be published but would not be released during the drafting process. Minutes of meetings would be published on the web.</p>

NHS Direct is handling about 10,000 dental calls a month and directing patients on how to access local services. Where local dentists are not registering new patients, NHS Direct will be able to inform them of other local arrangements providing access to NHS dentistry.</p>

In supporting this commitment the Government have invested over &pound;100 million in the last two years.

	<p pid=".120W.2/2">The appointment of primary care trust chief executives is a matter for each individual PCT. However, I am aware that the Department's north west regional office placed advertisements in early December for the appointment of chief executives to seven prospective PCTs, including Warrington. It is disappointing that this has not resulted in an appointment in Warrington. However, I understand the PCT chair is actively seeking to appoint the high calibre person needed to take on the full range of responsibilities required for this large PCT and is currently re-advertising the post.</p>

Of the 13 candidates subsequently interviewed, six (46.2 per cent.) live in Warrington, North and seven (53.8 per cent.) in Warrington, South. All of the three non-executives appointed to date live in Warrington, South. A further two appointments will be made shortly.</p>

Prior to its establishment, the PCT raised the profile of health inequality in Warrington with the Local Strategic Partnership and particularly through the Health and Wellbeing Partnership. A health inequality sub-group has been established as part of the Health and Wellbeing Partnership to bring a multi-agency focus and resource to tackle poor health in central Warrington. The PCT is working with partners to identify a Warrington Health Improvement Zone, which will form the focus for targeting resources in the future.</p>

	<p pid=".122W.11/1">The Mobile Telephone Health Research (MTHR) Programme was set up in February 2001 following the publication of a report in May 2000 by an Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE on &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot;. Radio signals from handsets were identified as a research priority because localised exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from base stations. In both cases, however, exposures need to comply with exposure guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.11/2">The first group of proposals agreed for funding by the Programme Management Committee has generally related to the areas of research identified in the Stewart Report. Although the main focus of much of the funded research relates to the use of mobile phones, in practice many of the experimental studies will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to radio frequency (RF) radiation from base stations. The agreed programme includes a study on exposures from the newer types of base station that are being introduced in urban areas. Details of research now underway are given on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.11/3">A second call for proposals was issued last year and applicants have been invited to submit more detailed research applications which will be considered by the Programme Management Committee in the summer. The aim of this call was to extend the range of research being carried out under the aegis of the MTHR programme and some of the proposals are of direct relevance to exposures to RF radiation from base stations.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.2/16" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/17">1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/18">2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/19">3. The expenditure is the total expenditure of the health authority and the commissioning expenditure of the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of drugs expenditure in 1998&ndash;99 and a smaller element in 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/20">4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&ndash;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/21">5. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties or training which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.</p>
