	<p pid="d.493W.5/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government is committed to tackling poverty and social exclusion in the most deprived areas of the country. Successful mixed communities bring together the economic, social and physical aspects of renewal and development to create sustainable change in communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.493W.5/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government is working with a number of demonstration projects around the country to test the mixed communities approach. The projects are all at early stages of development and we are working with them to evaluate progress and learn lessons. Where appropriate the approach will be rolled out more widely across other deprived areas.</p>

Real income growth is represented by the percentage change in decile or quintile income medians that have been adjusted for inflation. Year on year growth estimates are volatile.  3. Comparisons for the bottom decile should be treated with particular caution. Decile medians for the bottom 10 per cent. are more volatile as they are affected to a greater extent by fluctuations in households reporting very low incomes.  4. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data covers selected years from 1979 until 1995-97 where information is available. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) data is for all financial years 1994-95 until 2004-05.  5. Comparisons of estimates between the two sources should be treated carefully: FES figures are for the United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain;<br/>  The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years in 1979, 1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to1992-93 and two financial years combined from 1993-95 to 1995-97;<br/> The FRS was established by the then Department of Social Security in order to meet the Department's analytical demands; A review, available on the internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons. Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for overlapping years mean that a spliced time series may be no more accurate than the unadjusted series. 6. Page 5 of the Child Poverty Progress Report showed growth by quintiles AHC and much higher growth for Q1 than Q5. This is borne out in this PQ. However, BHC progress was only slightly better for the bottom quintile than the top quintile.  <i> Source:</i>  The Family Resources Survey (FRS)</td> </tr>

There is no intention of going further than this.

The Department for Transport has discussed the situation with train manufacturers and will seek to provide them with better information on future procurement timescales and to facilitate a more even spread of train orders, thus enabling longer term decisions to be made on the maintenance of UK manufacturing capability. It is worth noting that 70 per cent. of the trains procured between 1996 and 2005 were manufactured or assembled in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.513W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the child support agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply for the chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will list occasions on which a decision has been made under section 29 of the Child Support Act 1991 to opt not to collect maintenance; why the decision was taken in each case; and whether the decision was made in respect of all maintenance collection options allowed under the Act in each case.</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/6" class="indent">Section 29 of the Child Support Act 1991 empowers the Secretary of State to collect child support maintenance. However, the wording of Section 29 enables the Secretary of State to decide, in a very limited range of circumstances, not to collect maintenance. Each case will be treated individually after careful investigation on its own merits and examples include:</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/7" class="indent">Death of a non-resident parent;</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/8" class="indent">Where a parent with care felt that to continue to collect would put her or her children at risk; and</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/9" class="indent">Where an interim maintenance assessment cannot be converted to a full maintenance assessment the Agency will not pursue the punitive element of the debt.</p>
	<p pid="d.513W.2/10" class="indent">As each case is individually considered it would require disproportionate effort to detail every decision.</p>

Estimates cover all those aged 60 and over in the private household population of Great Britain.  4. For the purposes of this analysis, the unit of analysis is the benefit unit. This is either a single person aged at least 60 years old or, if a couple, both will be termed pensioners if one is aged at least 60 years old. This is consistent with both the definition used in &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-up&quot; publications, and with the fact any individual aged 60 or over is entitled to pension credit.  5. The data source for eligibility estimates is the Family Resources Survey. Estimates of eligibility for 2005-06 and 2006-07 are based on Family Resources Survey data for 2003-04 and 2004-05, with incomes and benefits projected forward into the future in order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey. They are calibrated to the 2004-05 National Statistics estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.  6. All figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.  7. Projections of eligibility may be adjusted following publication of future editions of the National Statistics take-up estimates.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.522W.5/1">We are broadly satisfied with the operation of the Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) and the Regulations made under it. The Department estimates that some 190,000 premises have been successfully licensed under the 2003 Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/2">However, as with any large-scale reform, there is a need to ensure that the actual operation of the 2003 Act reflects the purposes for which it was introduced, and to examine and address any anomalies as far as is possible. That is why the Government established an Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel in May last year to consider whether fees had been set at the right level. Their final Report is due for publication in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/3">We are also currently monitoring and evaluating the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 nationally through, for example, the Scrutiny Council initiative, in which officials from my Department are working with council officers and through them with local police and other responsible authorities, residents' groups, businesses and other stakeholders, to gather information about how the new regime is working on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/4">In addition, our two-stage review of the Guidance issued under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>. We expect to lay a revised version of the Guidance before Parliament by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.5/5">In the course of these monitoring and review processes, a number of representations have been received concerning matters covered by the 2003 Act and the regulations made under it, including the Licensing Act 2003 (Premises licences and club premises certificates) Regulations 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.522W.8/1">I believe that the Licensing Act 2003 will benefit sports in the long term by removing the need for clubs to obtain a number of different permissions for different activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.8/2">However, I recognise that some concerns have been expressed about how sports clubs will adapt to the new licensing regime. An independent Licensing Fees Review Panel was established by the Government in May 2005 to consider whether fees had been set at the right level for community groups, including sports clubs, businesses and local authorities. The Panel&mdash;which is chaired by Sir Les Elton&mdash;published its interim findings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase>. This identified a number of areas for more detailed work. The full interim report can be accessed on my Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.522W.8/4">The Panel is continuing to receive information from a number of stakeholder interests in order to gather the evidence that will inform their final Report, which is due to be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.522W.8/5">As implementation continues, my Department is working closely with Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and other sports bodies. The Department has asked the CCPR to provide any information about how sports clubs are adapting to the new licensing regime and in particular, to feed in any evidence about the impact of the fees into the Independent Fees Review Panel.</p>

	<p pid="d.528W.6/2">The main strategy is to gain efficiencies as a result of the reduction of the physical size of the estate and the number of buildings. As a result the DTI London HQ estate has been reduced by approximately 30 per cent. with significant associated reductions in the Department's overall energy usage.</p>
	<p pid="d.528W.6/3">The Department has also implemented a number of energy efficiency initiatives since the target was published. In 1 Victoria Street this included a number of energy efficiency projects to improve lighting and environmental controls as well as occupant awareness. The Department has also undertaken a study into the use of localised micro-generation of energy on the estate. Energy efficiency is taken into account in any estate project undertaken and has included the introduction of energy minimising technology within the recent IT systems refresh.</p>

	<p pid="d.533W.5/1">No specific guidance has been issued to schools on this issue. The liability for the actions of health professionals working on school sites rests with the primary care trust (PCT), or NHS trust which employs them. School governors are responsible for ensuring that the school has consulted parents on the nature and scope of any health services available in the school; and ensuring that a protocol exists with the PCT/trust that makes clear which services will be delivered by PCT/trust staff working on the school site.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.5/2">In terms of the individual scenarios described in the question:</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.5/3" class="indent">(i) where the drug has been supplied on school premises with the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but the employer (PCT/trust) may also be held vicariously responsible for the nurse's actions.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.5/4" class="indent">(ii) where the drug has been supplied on school premises without the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but will still have vicarious liability protection with their employer (PCT/trust) if acting with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.5/5" class="indent">(iii) where the drug has been supplied off school premises but as a result of a referral by a school nurse on school premises, without the sanction of the governors, the nurse will be personally accountable for their practice, but will still have vicarious liability protection with their employer (PCT/trust) if acting with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="d.533W.5/6">Emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) is a 'prescription-only' medicine, prescribed by GPs, qualified nurse independent prescribers and nurses and pharmacists working under a patient group direction (PGD). A PGD is where a doctor has delegated authority and the supply will therefore always be under medical supervision. The safety profile of EHC for under-16s is considered to be similar to that for older women. Fatalities and strokes are not associated with use of EHC.</p>

	<p pid="d.534W.8/1">The current measure of higher education initial participation is the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR), which is used to measure progress against the Government's target of increasing participation towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by 2010. This covers English-domiciled 17 to 30-year-old first time entrants to HE courses, at UK HEIs and English FECs, who remain on their course for at least six months. The figure is expressed as a proportion of the 17 to 30-year-old population of England. The HEIPR cannot be disaggregated by smaller areas. The provisional 2004/05 figure for England is 42 per cent., and the 2005/06 figure will be available in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.534W.8/2">The latest available figures on participation by region were published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in January in &quot;Young Participation in England&quot;, which is available from their website at: <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05_03/">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05 _03/</a>. HEFCE has calculated a Young Participation Rate (YPR (A)), which is the proportion of young people in a given area who go on to enter full-time higher education at age 18 or 19. This measure covers the period 1997-2000. This proportion is disaggregated by Government office region, and the figures for England are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="d.542W.5/2">Changes to local school organisation, including school closures, are decided under local decision making arrangements. Individual proposals are determined by the local authority if they published the proposals and there are no objections. In all other cases the proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or the Schools Adjudicator, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.5/3">SOCs and schools adjudicators must have regard to 'Decision Makers' Guidance' issued by the Secretary of State when deciding proposals. The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals but also stresses that all cases must be considered on their individual merits. For school closures the factors include: the impact on standards and diversity, the impact on the supply of school places, the cost effectiveness of the proposals, the impact on the community, the views of interested parties and the nature of the journey to any alternative provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.542W.5/4">The guidance also sets out a presumption against the closure of rural schools. The 'Decision Makers' Guidance' is available on the Department's School Organisation website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.543W.2/2">In order to achieve Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) trainee teachers need to demonstrate they have met the standards for QTS. These standards ensure that all new teachers have the subject knowledge, the teaching and learning expertise they need and are well prepared for the wider professional demands of being a teacher.</p>
	<p pid="d.543W.2/3">Further to this, it is for schools to the set their own improvement priorities, which may include social exclusion and inclusive teaching. They also decide what professional development is required in order to achieve their priorities, taking into account local circumstances and the needs of their teachers.</p>
	<p pid="d.543W.2/4">Support is available to schools through a variety of programmes. In particular the National Strategies' consultants focus on helping schools facing the greatest challenges. This year the National Strategies will be providing training for teachers in the use of catch-up lessons for pupils who have fallen behind, which will help to tackle the problem of children from disadvantaged backgrounds under-achieving. Excellence in Cities is a programme targeted in areas of highest deprivation giving schools access to additional resources through programmes such as Learning Mentors, Learning Support Units and expertise for CPD to meet the teaching and learning needs of teachers in dealing with the barriers faced by disadvantaged young people.</p>

	<p pid="d.544W.2/1">The information requested is not routinely collected. However, that engagement in education and training is a protective factor against poor outcomes for teenage mothers and their children. That is why increasing the proportion of teenage mothers in education, employment or training (EET) is one of the key aims of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. Evidence shows that there were higher rates of participation in EET among under-16s in the Sure Start Plus pilot areas, where young parents were provided with a holistic package of support from a dedicated Personal Adviser.

Similarly, it is for each department to determine what bargaining arrangements are appropriate for their own organisation and in their executive agencies.

	<p pid="d.548W.6/1">During my visit to Helmand on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>, I announced a new Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme (HARDP), which will run from 2006 to 2009 with a budget of &pound;30 million. The purpose of HARDP is to increase the economic opportunities of the rural poor in Helmand, including those that make a living from growing and harvesting poppy, through integrated support to improve their livelihood options.</p>
	<p pid="d.548W.6/2">In designing this programme, DFID used extensive UK-funded field studies on the effect of poppy production on households in Helmand. The evidence shows that a variety of forces drive poppy farmers' decisions, including both poverty and the lack of risk of law enforcement. Providing alternative livelihoods opportunities in itself will not reduce poppy cultivation in Helmand. This requires an integrated approach including assistance, law enforcement, better governance and better security. The UK is helping the Government of Afghanistan to deliver such an approach in Helmand. It will take several years to reduce cultivation substantially.</p>

	<p pid="d.548W.9/1">Ensuring better regulation of the arms trade is essential for conflict prevention and development. As a result, DFID has worked very closely with the FCO and MOD to promote our commitment to an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). When the first committee of the UN General Assembly meets this year, the UK will aim to secure a UN resolution which will establish a formal UN-based ATT process. Significant progress has already been made, notably the endorsement of an ATT by the EU Council and Commonwealth Heads of Government and other influential countries such as Brazil.</p>
	<p pid="d.548W.9/2">DFID has contributed to a range of FCO-led initiatives, including the May 2005 meeting of experts at Lancaster House in London and a Geneva meeting of representatives to the Conference on Disarmament in March 2006. DFID and Whitehall partners have also developed a joint strategy to encourage other countries and regional bodies to actively promote the ATT. This focuses on building wider support for a first committee resolution, and includes awareness raising events. DFID will use ministerial visits and dialogue with partner countries, regional and international organisations to generate support for a resolution.</p>
	<p pid="d.548W.9/3">In parallel DFID is working closely with the FCO and MOD to strengthen controls over the transfer of small arms and light weapons within the existing UN Programme of Action (UN PoA). Small arms and light weapons (SALW) pose a particular challenge for development because they are widely available in developing countries and are the weapon of choice in the majority of conflicts worldwide. We are working internationally with a wide range of partners in advance of the UN PoA Review Conference in June to build support for global guidelines for national controls governing transfers of SALW.</p>

	<p pid="d.550W.5/2">DFID is a strong supporter of the elimination of child labour. Trade unions are important partners in this work. They are, for example, actively involved in the International Labour Organisation's programme for the elimination of child labour in Andhra Pradesh, India, which is funded by DFID. They are also active members of the DFID funded Ethical Trading Initiative. This is an organisation in which trade unions work with business and NGOs to ensure the working conditions in companies supplying the UK meet or exceed international labour standards, including eliminating child labour from the work force.</p>

This is an encouraging start but Kenyans are calling for more to demonstrate full political accountability. When I met President Kibaki again recently, I stressed the importance of continued progress in the investigations.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.5/2">The UK does not provide direct budget support to Kenya precisely because of our concerns about corruption, and all DFID's projects have rigorous safeguards to ensure that our assistance is not being misdirected.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.5/3">For example, all our projects work through special, earmarked and fully audited accounts, independent financial management agents or are provided directly to non-government organisations or other direct service delivery. All projects over &pound;1 million are subject to annual reviews and audits, and expenditure is closely tracked. Accountable grants to non-governmental organisations are paid retrospectively only once invoices have been checked and the spending is accounted for. Occasional cases of fraud do still occur, but are investigated immediately and swift and decisive action taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.552W.5/4">Despite recent announcements that the Dutch Government has frozen any new commitments to Kenya, I do not foresee the corruption allegations making a significant impact on international assistance in the short term. Most of the development agencies, including DFID, believe that just because poor people live in a country where corruption is a major problem, it does not mean that they do not deserve our assistance. In Kenya our assistance is improving many lives. Our support will mean textbooks for each of the 18,500 primary schools in Kenya and 12,000 new classrooms. It will also deliver 11 million insecticide treated bednets, saving 167,000 children's lives. We have provided &pound;23.7 million to drought affected regions of Kenya since December 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.553W.2/1">DFID has no regular bilateral assistance programme to the Maldives because it is relatively wealthy and our limited finances are better used in poorer countries where needs are greater. However since 2001 support for small developmental programmes has been provided through the Small Grants Scheme (SGS) which, though financed by DFID until 2005, is managed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The SGS has focused almost exclusively on training awards. These targeted public officials in the health and education sectors and on governance, with a focus on:</p>

	<p pid="d.553W.2/8">In 2005, following the Asian tsunami, DFID provided &pound;1.7 million to the Maldives for emergency humanitarian assistance. These funds were channelled through the United Nations and the Red Cross.</p>

	<p pid="d.554W.0/1">DFID provided &pound;1.7 million in emergency assistance to the Maldives immediately after the tsunami. Our support was channelled largely through the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environmental Programme and the World Health Organisation and the Red Cross. However we do not maintain a regular programme to the islands and have not provided any subsequent assistance. The Maldives are relatively wealthy and our limited resources are better used in poorer countries where needs are greater. DFID has not therefore undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness and impact of individual European Commission programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.554W.0/2">However, DFID does monitor overall recovery in the Maldives, drawing on reports produced by the International Monetary Fund and other development agencies. It is encouraging to note that the fishing and tourist industries, the mainstay of the country's economy, have recovered very strongly following the tsunami. Economic growth is expected to be between 12 per cent. and 13 per cent. in 2006, restoring the pre-tsunami growth trend.</p>
	<p pid="d.554W.0/3">Government and donors are well aware of the difficult environmental challenges facing the Maldives, including the problem of differential settlement of the substructure of the islands following the tsunami. This issue adds to the complexity and expense of the reconstruction task, but is being taken into account when designing recovery programmes.</p>

	<p pid="d.556W.2/2">The development of the Crumlin Road Gaol and Girdwood sites will be taken forward on an integrated basis through a master planning approach. This will be subject to full public consultation. Listed building consent and planning approval was granted in March 2004 for the demolition of non-listed buildings and other works at the Gaol. Planning permission for the installation of CCTV cameras at Girdwood was granted in February 2006. Planning applications were submitted in March 2006 for repair and restoration works to the Gaol.</p>

	<p pid="d.560W.3/1">In response to Patten Recommendations 69 and 70 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland set up a NIO-led UK Steering Group to lead the research programme into alternative policing approaches towards the management of conflict. The development of the Attenuating Energy Projectile (AEP), as an operational replacement for the L21A1 baton round from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June 2005</phrase>, formed only part of the Group's ongoing activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.560W.3/2">I am advised that the cost breakdown in terms of testing, acquiring and training police personnel in the use of AEP cannot be provided without disproportionate cost. However, the total cost of replacing the L21Al with the AEP for operational use was estimated to be &pound;291,000. This figure is the only top-line cost available for the project and PSNI cannot readily extrapolate testing, acquiring and training figures for the following reasons: testing was conducted externally as well as internally; acquisition costs would involve various aspects of the procurement process; and training costs were incurred across many PSNI departments.</p>

	<p pid="d.561W.2/1">EU Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework for combating discrimination in employment and occupation, on the grounds of disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief. Article 15.1 of this directive provides a specific derogation that allows for the policy of 50:50 recruitment to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as legislated for in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.561W.2/2">I am advised that the European Commission is duty-bound to review and provide a report on the directive routinely every five years. This procedure involves input from member state Governments on the implementation of the directive in their own country.</p>
	<p pid="d.561W.2/3">The first five-yearly report on the directive for the United Kingdom was completed in December 2005. As part of the United Kingdom's submission to the European Commission's report, the Northern Ireland Office provided specific input in relation to the working of article 15.1. This process involved discussion and written communication with the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the European Union and the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="d.561W.2/4">I am advised that this report is not a means of pursuing any revisions to the current legislation, therefore no consultation was required.</p>
	<p pid="d.561W.2/5">The 50:50 recruitment provisions are reviewed every three years, and can only be renewed by a majority vote in both Houses. This is next due in March 2007. The Government remain committed to the use of these temporary provisions as means of achieving 30 per cent. Catholic composition among Regular PSNI Officers by 2010-11. The provisions shall only be renewed, however, following extensive review and consultation with interested parties. It is our intention to commence the review and consultation process shortly.</p>

Bury St. Edmunds and Ipswich are the only two county courts in Suffolk which deal with insolvency matters.</p>

However, the insolvency jurisdictions of particular county courts are not directly comparable with standard geographies such as counties or parliamentary constituencies. For these reasons, figures shown in the table will not be an exact measure of bankruptcies in Suffolk.</p>

	<p pid="d.577W.5/1">The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom (UK) comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for one in 16 hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States. The study did not differentiate between prescribed and unprescribed medicines; however, the majority of ADRs were associated with prescribed medicines.</p>
	<p pid="d.577W.5/2">This study highlights the importance of effective systems for monitoring and responding to issues relating to the safety of medicines, a process called pharmacovigilance. This study, which was funded by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), underlines the MHRA's commitment to improving the evidence base for pharmacovigilance in the UK. As part of this commitment to improving pharmacovigilance, the MHRA is working to strengthen and widen access to the yellow card scheme for reporting suspected ADRs. Access has recently been widened to allow patients to report under a pilot reporting scheme.</p>

	<p pid="d.578W.0/1">The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill involves issues of conscience and the Government's stance is to remain neutral and to listen to the debate. It is appropriate that Parliament should lead on debates of this nature and allow all shades of opinion to be heard. As with all legislation, the Government's position has been agreed with the legislative programme committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.578W.0/2">The Department has received around 1,380 letters, emails and postcards about the Bill from the public and organisations since the beginning of March 2006 expressing a range of views and opinions. The petition that the Care Not Killing alliance submitted to the Prime Minister has been passed to the Department and officials have been provided with a list of the alliance's member organisations.</p>

	<p pid="d.582W.2/1">Revenue allocations are made to primary care trusts (PCTs) on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. Allocations are made on a fair funding formula that directs funding to those in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.2/2">A principal cause in the variation in the level of demand for health services is the age structure of the population. The very young and the elderly, whose populations are not evenly distributed throughout the country, tend to make more use of health services than the rest of the population. The funding formula is age weighted to take account of the varying elements of the health need associated with the age structure of local populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.2/3">Once allocations have been made, it is for PCTs to commission services based on their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.2/4">Council funding for adult social services is derived from a number of sources: a share of overall formula grant allocated by the Department for Communication and Local Government, specific grants distributed by the Department, revenue from council tax, income from fees and charges and local decision making.</p>
	<p pid="d.582W.2/5">The greater part of Government funding for adult social care is allocated to councils without conditions. Local authorities have a significant degree of flexibility to manage and direct their resources in accordance with local priorities, and the needs of the communities to which they are accountable. It is not therefore possible to identify the proportion of allocated funding that is directly attributable to services for the elderly in the South West region.</p>

	<p pid="d.587W.8/1">The Select Committee on Health concluded in March 2001, following its inquiry into access to national health service dentistry, that the general dental services (GDS) remuneration system was at the heart of the problems facing NHS dentistry and that there was an urgent need to bring dentistry into the mainstream of the NHS. 'NHS Dentistry: Options for Change', published in August 2002, set out proposals to give primary care trusts direct responsibility for commissioning primary dental care services to meet the needs of their local populations and to alter the system of GDS remuneration. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provided the legislative framework for implementing these proposals, replacing section 35 of the National Health Service Act 1977 with new responsibilities upon primary care trusts to commissioning dental services.</p>

	<p pid="d.594W.8/1">Funding is allocated centrally to Drug Action Teams, who provide funding for local services that are appropriate to local needs. In 2005-06, funding streams which contributed to drug services at a local level included the Building Safer Communities Fund; the Drug Interventions Programme main grant; the Drug Strategy Partnership Support Grant; the Pooled Treatment Budget; and the Young People Substance Misuse Partnership Grant. Local partnerships also received funding for specific projects or programmes under the Drug Interventions Programme which were operating in the area, such as additional throughcare and aftercare provision, Restriction on Bail, the Rent Deposit Scheme, or the combined Criminal Justice Integrated Team-Prolific and Priority Offender scheme.

	<p pid="d.597W.11/1">The introduction of the National Offender Management Service will result in changes to working practice for many staff in the prison and probation services, as it includes the implementation of the new offender management model, as well as the introduction of new shared information and offender risk assessment systems. However, it is too early to tell what effect the introduction may have on jobs in the prison and probation services in Gloucestershire. For example, the change from probation boards to probation trusts and the introduction of commissioning are likely to have only a gradual impact at working level and much will be dependent on the response of the range of possible providers under the new commissioning regime.</p>

Companies that hire security firms whose personnel include unlicensed staff are not committing any offence, since the Act places the onus on the individual and the company that provides security services, not on the customer.
