	<p pid="a.1358W.5/1">The Department for Transport issued a discussion note inviting comments on this in September 2004. The principle of a graduated scale was supported by the majority of respondents, and the Road Safety Act 2006 provides an enabling power to graduate the fixed penalty points awarded for speeding offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.5/2">The Department's objective is to help drivers to travel at safe and legal speeds at all times. The proposals for graduated speeding penalties are designed to recognise there are considerable differences in the degree of excessive speeding by motorists and for the punishment to better fit the crime. A graduated structure would allow more careful consideration of drivers who through lapses of concentration breach the speed limit by a relatively small amount and where even two penalty points are expected to act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent re-offending. It would also allow for a higher penalty of six penalty points to act as a strong deterrent against more extreme speeders who exceed the speed limit by large amounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1358W.5/3">The proposed final graduated penalty structure will be subject to statutory public consultation before it is considered by both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1362W.3/1">When on training exercises at Westdown Camp (or any other training location), units have the option, during pre-exercise planning, to request that laundry facilities be secured via established contractual arrangements from service providers within the local area. Such services are publicly funded and therefore free of charge to the soldier. It is a matter for Units to decide whether or not to take advantage of these arrangements, they may either utilise the facilities available at Westdown Camp or they may hand-wash and dry their laundry themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.3/2">The facilities at Westdown Camp are self-operated facilities provided under contract for the convenience of soldiers. During the period January 2006 to June 2007 the income to the contractor arising from the use of the washing/drying machines at Westdown Camp was approximately &pound;7,500. A further &pound;1,500 was taken in commission by the Defence Training Estate Strategic Partner LANDMARC Support Services (LSS). Under established revenue sharing arrangements 70 per cent. of this total (&pound;1,050) was reinvested back into the maintenance of the training estate. The cost to each soldier to use these facilities is &pound;2.00 for washing and &pound;1.00 for drying.</p>
	<p pid="a.1362W.3/3">Soldiers are responsible for maintaining their own personal hygiene, and this is instilled through effective training, leadership, education and example setting, particularly by Commanders. Personal hygiene is covered in soldiers Phase One training and reinforced annually through Military Annual Training Test 6 (Values and Standards). It is also covered in all pre-operational and exercise deployment health and hygiene presentations delivered by service environmental health staffs.</p>

The Department has circulated a new call for research, in the form of a Limited Tender Call, with the aim of taking forward any research on or after April 2007. The aim is to obtain independent scientific evidence so that a decision can be taken as to whether or not there is a need for regulation in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1366W.5/1">No such discussions have taken place. However, I am aware that in Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), pupils learn to &quot;take and share responsibility&quot;, which can include looking after animals properly. In addition, many local authorities run their own animal welfare education schemes in schools. For example, both Coventry city council and the London borough of Lambeth give regular performances and presentations on animal welfare at primary and secondary schools. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also provides teaching resources for animal welfare education for use in classrooms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1376W.2/2">Increased flood risk, from both rivers and the sea, is one of the top predicted impacts of climate change in the UK. We are considering the rising risk from climate change as part of our long-term strategy, 'Making Space for Water'. The strategy takes a holistic approach to the management of risk across Government, together with increasing awareness and emergency preparedness within communities to help them better cope with flood events when they occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/3">In January 2007, as part of 'Making Space for Water', we announced the start of 15 integrated urban drainage pilot studies around the country. The projects, made possible by &pound;1.7 million of funding from DEFRA, will test new approaches to reduce the risk of urban drainage flooding, both from sewers and storm water.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/4">While the pilot projects will not directly fund capital improvements, they should bring greater clarity on responsibilities for funding urban drainage management between water companies, local authorities, the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards and the Highways Agency. Following completion of the pilot projects in the spring of 2008, DEFRA will produce new guidance on effective partnership working to deliver integrated drainage solutions in high-risk urban catchments and prepare a regulatory impact assessment for any proposed legislative changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1376W.2/5">In addition, water companies' price limits for 2005-10 allowed a programme of nearly &pound;1 billion to safeguard homes against the risk of sewer flooding. This would resolve or mitigate every known high-risk problem of internal flooding from overloaded sewers where companies' plans said is needed by 2010. By then the proportion of properties at risk would reduce to 0.01 per cent. of households.</p>

This is an effective way of increasing the coverage of FWD and the agency aims to repeat the process in south Yorkshire later this year.</p>

Given the limited scale of the trials and the management conditions that have been imposed, it is not expected that there will be any transfer of a GM presence into non-GM potato crops. In that context, and given that the GM potatoes will not be used for food or feed, it would not be appropriate in our view to require detailed food safety studies as a pre-condition for the trials to take place. Such studies will be necessary if BASF decides in due course to seek authorisation to market the GM potatoes for food and feed use in the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.1380W.5/1">Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally. The sector accounts for 37 per cent. of methane and 67 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions in the UK, but only 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. About 86 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive systems of animals (mainly cattle, sheep, pigs and horses) and 14 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.1380W.5/2">DEFRA has established research programmes to help build the evidence on reducing emissions from livestock through nutrition, husbandry, genetics, and nutrient management. We currently have two projects looking at both nutritional and genetic potential for reducing methane and nitrogen emissions from livestock. The first will identify feed strategies in collaboration with industry to ensure knowledge transfer, and the second will identify areas where genetic research can add value. We are also taking a critical look at the configuration of the livestock sector and how this might need to change in order to meet emissions and other environmental targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1381W.5/1">Methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) has been isolated from dairy cows, pigs and chickens outside the UK and the international picture is being assessed on an ongoing basis. There is no current evidence that food-producing animals form a reservoir of infection in the UK and the organism has not been detected in farmed livestock in the UK. DEFRA has initiated a study undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to test <i> S. aureus</i> isolates obtained from bovine clinical submissions for MRSA. This project commenced in autumn 2006 and, to date, more than 500 samples have been tested, with no MRSA identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.5/2">The issue of MRSA in other livestock species was discussed at a meeting of the DEFRA Antimicrobial Resistance Coordination MRSA subgroup in January. The subgroup was set up to advise on how best the Department can contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the role of MRSA in animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1381W.5/3">Members felt that, at present, broadening the scope of work in this area should only be considered after analysis of the current findings relating to humans in the UK with MRSA infections. The particular, strain of MRSA (ST398) occurring in pigs in some other parts of Europe was not reported to have been detected so far in humans in the UK and this was a key consideration in reaching the decision taken. However, the position will be kept under active review, taking into account the latest findings in humans and animals, as well as developments in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

These inspections can (and when appropriate do) include sampling and testing. A positive result for either a non-allowed product, or an allowed product that was either incorrectly used or had not been approved for use as required, would result in the imposition of sanctions ranging from decertification of the product to decertification of the farm dependant on the severity and cause of the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1383W.2/1">Levels of algal blooms are recorded continuously at one site in Liverpool Bay and less regularly elsewhere. Relatively high levels of algae occur in Liverpool Bay in spring and summer, in comparison to offshore regions or shallow regions not in the vicinity of major rivers. However, they do not cause a problem and are similar to other regions around the coast of England that are in the vicinity of major rivers. An exact comparison of levels is difficult due to differences in the frequency of measuring algal blooms. They also vary greatly from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383W.2/2">Algal blooms eventually sink to the sea bed, and are consumed by predators or transported by tides and currents to other regions. Certain types of bloom-forming algae can, under certain conditions, be transported onto the shore and may result in visible scums along the shoreline. These present no health hazard to humans and pose a limited threat to organisms that live on the shore.</p>

	<p pid="a.1390W.11/3">There are no statistics for wood's use as building materials, but in 2005 construction markets were reported to take 34 per cent. of all sawnwood from larger softwood sawmills in the UK (each producing more than 5,000 cubic metres of sawnwood). Within this UK total the larger softwood mills in England sold 23 per cent. for use in construction. Not all sawn timber produced in England came from logs harvested in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.1391W.3/2">There are currently no plans to record incidents of graffiti as a sub-category of criminal damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/3">Information on graffiti is not routinely recorded by all police forces as part of their information on criminal damage. There is also an absence of a precise legal definition of graffiti, which would result in inconsistencies in data that is held by forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/4">Currently, the main sub-categories of recorded criminal damage are based on the type of property damaged. They are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/5" class="indent">Damage to a dwelling;</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/6" class="indent">Damage to a building other than a dwelling;</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/7" class="indent">Damage to a vehicle;</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/8" class="indent">Other damage;</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/9">These four are then sub-classified according to whether the offence is racially or religiously aggravated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/10" class="indent">Arson (damage to property by fire, regardless of the type of property); and</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/11" class="indent">Threats, or possession with intent, to commit criminal damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391W.3/12">Police forces may have their own local methods for recording incidents of graffiti. Some local authorities have also made great efforts to make it easier for the public to report graffiti, so any attempt to estimate a total for graffiti would ideally include local authority data.</p>

Some individuals may have received more than one type of bonus payment in any given year, which is why the information has been presented separately, and not as an aggregated total.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="a.1399W.5/1">The PSNI recognise the very real and genuine concerns regarding the protection of young children from sex offenders. Specific measures include the 'Multi-agency Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Risk Management' process, which involves PSNI, Northern Ireland Probation Service, Northern Ireland Prison Service, Health and Social Services, Northern Ireland Housing Executive and representatives from the voluntary sector. The primary purpose of the agencies' work is to help protect the public from harm by reducing the opportunities available for offenders to gain access to victims, and also to reduce their propensity to offend at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.5/2">Effective collaboration is also incorporated into the day-to-day work of police officers and social workers, to ensure that the welfare of children remains paramount. These measures are enshrined in the 'Protocol for Joint Investigation by Social Workers and Police Officers' and in the Area Child Protection Policy and Procedures documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1399W.5/3">Police are also actively involved in various other campaigns around this issue, for example, 'Stop-it-Now'&mdash;a campaign which encourages early recognition and responses to the problem, and 'Leisurewatch' (currently piloting in three areas) whereby leisure staff are trained to be observant and aware of ways to minimise the risks from sex offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1401W.2/1">The Government believe that the best child care market is a diverse one which offers parents real choice about the type of child care they can access. Accordingly, the Childcare Act 2006 builds on our 10-year child care strategy to help maintain and strengthen the great diversity that already exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.2/2">The Act requires local authorities to complete, by April 2008, an assessment of the sufficiency of child care in their area, including the extent to which parents' requirements for different types of provision are being satisfied, It then requires local authorities to secure the provision of sufficient child care to meet the requirements of working parents, with particular attention to the needs of those with low incomes or disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401W.2/3">From October this year, the Act will place a restriction on local authorities providing child care where there are alternative and appropriate means of delivery available in the market. Before providing new child care themselves, local authorities will have to determine whether another provider is willing to provide it and whether it is appropriate, in all the circumstances, for the authority to provide the child care itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.1402W.2/1">Sure Start children's centres serving communities in the most disadvantaged areas must include, as part of their offer to parents, integrated full day care and early learning places for children under five. In many cases, this will build on existing provision, like Sure Start Local programmes or Neighbourhood Nurseries. 58 per cent. of children's centres have child care provided by the private, voluntary or independent sectors. In less disadvantaged areas, if existing provision is meeting parents' needs; centres will simply provide parents with advice and information about local child care options.</p>
	<p pid="a.1402W.2/2">In planning their children's centres, local authorities must consult with existing private, voluntary and independent child care providers to determine the best way of ensuring parents have access to sufficient, good quality provision. In addition, from October this year, the Childcare Act 2008 will place a restriction on local authorities providing child care where there are alternative and appropriate means of delivery available in the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1402W.2/3">The assessments of child care sufficiency that local authorities are required to complete by April 2008 can be expected to give a clear indication of how child care provided by Sure Start children's centres fits with other child care in their areas. Local authorities will be expected to act in accordance with their assessments when fulfilling the duty to secure, from April 2008, sufficient child care for working parents.</p>

The code requires local authorities to ensure settings are funded equitably, transparently and fairly, according to local need and market dynamics.

	<p pid="a.1403W.5/2">Currently all Waldorf Steiner kindergartens and Montessori pre-schools offering the free entitlement to 3 and 4-year-olds must comply with the Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage. No exemptions have been sought, or granted, from the Foundation Stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1403W.5/3">From September 2008 the Foundation Stage will be superseded by the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) which will be a statutory requirement for all early years providers and will be legally enforceable. The Government carried out a formal public consultation between <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May 2007</phrase> on the circumstances under which exemptions to the Early Years Foundation Stage learning and development requirements might be granted and the process for such exemptions. I am considering the responses to the consultation exercise and the representations made by Waldorf Steiner and Montessori and expect to publish the Government's response to the consultation this month and regulations will follow in the autumn. The Early Years Foundation Stage is a very flexible set of requirements which is designed to be inclusive and compatible with the vast majority of educational philosophies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1404W.2/1">The code of practice on the delivery of nursery education places for 3 and 4-year-olds is statutory guidance to which local authorities must have regard when planning and managing the delivery of the free entitlement. The code states that local authorities should put in place appropriate accounting and auditing procedures to ensure that funding paid in respect of free places is administered properly. Local authorities do so, in consultation with providers, through delegated local conditions of funding, which may in some cases require settings to provide access to accounts relating to administration of public funding. Local authorities may also ask providers for sight of their accounts in order to assess their financial viability before contracting with or providing funding to the setting. However, settings are under no obligation to comply with requests for inspection of accounts related to activity not undertaken in respect of public funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405W.0/1">The free entitlement is delivered by a very diverse range of providers in the maintained, private; voluntary and independent sectors; which would make it impossible to identify a single unit cost for delivery of nursery education and care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.0/2">Because of this diversity. local authorities&mdash;in consultation with their school forums&mdash;are responsible for deciding how best to apply their total school and early years funding across all age groups and between different types of provider, based on an assessment of local circumstances. The code of practice on the provision of free nursery education places for three and four-year-olds requires local authorities to ensure settings are funded equitably, transparently and fairly, reflecting local need.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405W.6/1">Local authorities, schools, early education settings and those who help them&mdash;including health and social services&mdash;must have regard to the special educational needs (SEN) code of practice (2001), These bodies must fulfil their statutory duties towards children with SEN in the light of the guidance in the code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/2">Although there are no regulations on interventions, 'Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings' DfES/DH (2005) is designed to help all schools and all early years settings and their employers develop policies on managing medicines, and to put in place effective management systems to support individual children with medical needs. It provides specific advice on the supply, possession and administration for controlled drugs such as methylphenidate (commercial name Ritalin). Where a child has an ongoing health need, including medicines, schools are advised to produce an individual health care plan for a child with medical needs that identifies the level of support that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/3">The SEN code and 'Managing Medicines' guidance make clear that education staff should work closely with, and take advice from health professionals to form the whole 'package' of support required for children taking medicines as a means of managing a special educational need or disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/4">In order to be awarded qualified teacher status, all trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their responsibilities under the code, know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of SEN, can differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with SEN, and can identify and support pupils who experience behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/5">We are proposing that from September 2007 the standards for qualified teacher status will be strengthened to require teachers to know and comply with current legislation on the well-being of children and young people, to know and understand the role of others when dealing with children who have SEN or disabilities, and to communicate effectively with parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/6">The current induction standards require newly qualified teachers to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with SEN, with or without a statement. The standards also demand that they work collaboratively with both other teachers and specialists to ensure that provision is suitable for SEN pupils. The revised standards framework will reinforce, build on and strengthen the current standards surrounding SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/7">All schools receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. A wide variety of courses are available covering SEN, ranging from awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers, other staff and their schools to determine their own particular training and development needs. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, under certain conditions, to provide specific training and development of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405W.6/8">We are also launching later this year an inclusion development programme (IDP) which will deliver continuing professional development for teachers and other staff, in key areas of SEN. The opening round will focus on children with speech, language and communication needs and dyslexia as the ability to communicate is fundamental to learning and progression. The IDP will subsequently address behavioural, emotional and social difficulties, including children with ADHD.</p>

However, if we are to realise the stretching ambition set for us by Lord Leitch, and transform the UK into a truly world-class skills economy by 2020, then we will need to scale up the number of working adults who are engaged in higher-level learning, and this in turn will necessitate even greater engagement between employers and HEIs. A growing list of universities have expressed an intention to make their core mission &quot;business facing&quot;; several of these have already received grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to take forward employer engagement projects which will help to build capacity and develop best practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1408W.2/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is responsible for widening participation in higher education, including the Aimhigher programme. The Aimhigher programme, in particular, brings together universities, colleges and schools in partnership to raise the attainment levels of young people and their aspirations towards higher education. Higher education institutions themselves will also often have well developed programmes of activities to raise the aspirations of pupils in schools and colleges which are built on strong local partnerships. These links are already well established and I will continue to work closely with my colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families to ensure they are maintained and strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408W.2/2">Improving the attainment and outcomes at all stages of education for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly low socio-economic groups, is a shared Government objective. As part of our strategy to widen participation my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase> a further package of improvements to the financial support available in England to students from hard working families on modest incomes; so that no one from such backgrounds is held back from realising their potential by concerns about the affordability of university study. This package includes an expansion of the popular and successful Student Associate Scheme involving high achieving HE students helping out as mentors and assistants in school classrooms where, as role models, they can inspire young people to achieve and progress into higher education. Our two Departments will continue to work together on this and a range of other programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1411W.7/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.7/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what average hourly pay was for each (a) quartile, (b) decile and (c) duo-decile in each year since 1992. (148767)</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.7/4" class="indent">Levels of earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) and from the New Earnings Survey (NES), and are provided for all full-time employees on adult rates of pay, whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.7/5" class="indent">I attach tables showing, where available, the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th, 45th, 55th, 60th, 65th, 70th, 75th, 80th, 85th, 90th and 95th percentile of Gross Hourly Pay, corresponding to each quartile, decile, and duo-decile. It is not possible to obtain deciles and duo-deciles from the New Earnings Survey results, other than the published 10th and 90th deciles. Therefore only these deciles, and the published quartiles, are available prior to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1411W.7/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It replaced NES from 2004, although ASHE methodology has been applied to NES datasets to provide continuous results from 1997 onwards. Both surveys feature a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.</p>

There remains much variation between the recording of stage that it is likely to reflect differences in what is meant by &quot;stage&quot; by the cancer registries, rather than real differences across England in what clinicians use to classify the patients. It is not therefore, possible to provide England data on cancer incidence broken down by stage.</p>

We are increasing provision of social rented housing to 30,000 homes in 2007-08 and have said that social housing will be a priority in the 2007 spending review. And we have plans to help 120,000 people into low cost home ownership in the five years to 2010.</p>

The matters on which information must be provided art specified in the Housing (Right to Buy) (Information to Secure Tenants) (England) Order 2005 (Statutory Instrument 2005 No. 1735), and relate to the terms of the scheme (including eligibility and exceptions), the costs of home ownership (including mortgage, stamp duty, valuation fees and maintenance costs) and the risk of repossession if regular mortgages payments are not made.</p>

This sets standards across nine areas of sustainability and goes significantly beyond the standards set in building regulations. Private build houses are not required to meet standards above building regulations. However in our consultation document 'Building a Greener Future' published in December 2006 we suggested that all new homes (public and private) should be required to have a mandatory rating against the code from April 2008, indicating whether they have been assessed and, if so, the performance of the home against the code. We believe that this will encourage higher take-up of the code in the private sector.</p>

However, where works would affect the external appearance of a building, planning permission is likely to be required. Where planning permission is needed, local planning authorities can already prevent the merger of shop units through imposing planning conditions in the context of their planning strategy for their town centres. &quot;Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres&quot; (PPS6) gives further advice on the effective use of planning conditions to ensure that the character of a development cannot subsequently be changed to create a form of development that a local authority would originally have refused.</p>

	<p pid="a.1430W.8/5">In addition, from the commencement of the new East Midlands Rail Franchise timetable in December 2008, rail passengers will benefit from a new hourly service between Kettering and London (including Wellingborough), increasing the number of off peak services on the midland main line to five trains per hour. It has also been agreed in principle to extend this service to a new station at Corby from December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.1432W.2/1">The Government have already made a number of positive changes to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). Planning permission is now needed to convert a shop under Class Al: &quot;Shops&quot; into a coffee shop under Class A3: &quot;Restaurants and Caf&eacute;s&quot;. This class was designed specifically for businesses where the primary purpose is the sale and consumption of food and light refreshments on the premises. The Use Classes Order also allows Class A3 uses to change to Class Al uses without planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1432W.2/2">In 2005 the Government changed the Use Classes Order to expand Use Class Al to include internet caf&eacute;s which are premises where the primary purpose is to provide access for members of the public to the internet. Internet caf&eacute;s provide a valuable service to the public and contribute to the vitality and viability of high streets. Planning permission is therefore not needed to convert a shop into an internet caf&eacute;, and the Government has no plans to change the Use Classes Order in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1432W.2/3">Local authorities have a range of tools available to them to plan proactively for the character and future vitality and viability of their high streets and Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for town centres advises on the scope of some of these. In addition, the Planning White Paper, Planning for a Sustainable Future, published in May 2007, set out proposals to introduce a new impact test which will improve consumer choice and promote competition and which will enable local authorities to better test the likely impact of development proposals outside town centres on town centre shops and services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1433W.2/1">The Government set the overall level of grant to local authorities in the spending review and will be considering all identified future pressures on local authorities, and the ways in which these can be mitigated, as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007. However, primarily the route for assistance with funding for local authorities for subsidence caused by historic non-coal mine workings is through the Land Stabilisation Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/2">The Land Stabilisation Programme (LSP) can provide local authorities with help with funding for land instability works due to abandoned non-coal mines which are likely to collapse and therefore pose a problem to life and property. Local authorities in England are eligible to apply to English Partnerships, the non-departmental public body managing the programme on behalf of Communities and Local Government. Extensive guidance on the assistance available, eligibility conditions and how to apply for funding can be found on the English Partnerships website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.englishpartnerships.co.uk">www.englishpartnerships.co.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/4">Cumbria county council approached English Partnerships in August 2005 to explore the possibility of LSP funding after the collapse of a mineshaft in June 2005 at Greenmoor Road, Egremont. Following a meeting with and receipt of information from the council, English Partnerships concluded that the mineshaft treatment proposals did not comply with the terms of reference of the LSP. English Partnerships wrote to the council in September 2005 advising that the proposed project was not eligible for LSP funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.1442W.2/1">The Implementation Group established by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to take forward the recommendations made by the independent Expert Scientific Group (ESG) held its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-27">27 September 2006</phrase> and has met a further four times since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/2">The MHRA assesses the starting doses to be administered to volunteers in clinical trials based on available toxicology and pharmacology data.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/3">In general, the calculation of the first dose in man is based on the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) determined in non-clinical safety studies performed in the most sensitive and relevant animal species. However, a calculation of the minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) is also used and this approach is considered to be more appropriate than the NOAEL when the results of animal studies are thought less likely to predict the effect of the molecule in man.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/4">The MHRA has established an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) to advise on applications for clinical trials on higher risk substances, and it held its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-18">18 March 2007</phrase>. Prior to this, and since the ESG formulated its interim advice in July 2006, advice on applications for clinical trials on higher risk substances was obtained from the CHM.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/5">Progress is being made on implementing the ESG report recommendations as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/6">Recommendation one concerns the drug development process itself and the need for those involved in such programmes to be appropriately trained. The former will be addressed in the revised European Union guidance which we expect to be published by the end of July 2007. The MHRA is having discussions with relevant bodies on the latter with a view to developing a training and accreditation scheme for investigators for Phase 1 trials. We do not expect this recommendation to be implemented before 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/7">Recommendation two proposes a regular review of the regulatory process and has already been implemented as one of the responsibilities of the newly formed EAG.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/8">Recommendations three and four propose that clinical and pre-clinical unpublished studies relevant to the safety of human exposure need to be collected in a format that can be shared confidentially between regulators. Discussions on the proposal have taken place with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and they will discuss the recommendations with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with the International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) to involve the wider regulatory population. The EMEA will also ask the European Commission about raising the issue of data sharing with other countries. The EU databases will need amendment to enable the information to be collected. We do not expect these recommendations to be implemented before 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/9">Recommendation five and eight recommend earlier dialogue between regulator and drug developer, and better communication between regulator and ethics committees. The recommendation on earlier dialogue has been implemented through establishing a procedure that allows for informal discussion and submission of data on higher risk substances in advance of submission of the formal clinical trial application. This will avoid the need to lengthen current formal approval times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/10">The recommendation on better communication was implemented in October 2006 through adoption of a Memorandum of Understanding between MHRA and ethics committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/11">Recommendation six and seven recommends the regulator should have access to additional advice from experts and was implemented by establishment of the EAG of the CHM in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/12">Recommendation nine to 17 concern determining and administering the initial doses of a drug in man and are addressed in the guidance being developed by the EU scientific committee, which should be published by the end of July 2007. In the meantime the MHRA is operating interim arrangements that take account of these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/13">Recommendation 18 refers to the training of principal investigators and is being progressed with recommendation 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/14">Recommendation 19 proposes development of a treatment strategy when drawing up protocols for trials involving higher risk substances and will be addressed in the EU guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/15">Recommendation 20 specifies the facilities that should be available for first in man studies of higher risk substances. The MHRA is developing a voluntary accreditation scheme for Phase 1 units which will provide assurances that they have appropriate facilities available. This scheme will be available from April 2008, although we expect an informal self assessment scheme to be implemented shortly, prior to the scheme being finalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/16">Recommendation 21 advocates widening availability of &quot;hands-on&quot; experience in the conduct of clinical trials and has wide-ranging implications for industry and those responsible for the training of medical personnel. Although discussions are under way, it is unlikely that this recommendation will be implemented before 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.2/17">Recommendation 22 considers the need for specialist Phase 1 centres, and we propose this should be addressed via the proposed accreditation scheme, which should provide assurance in the longer term that trials are conducted only in units with suitable facilities and staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.1447W.5/1">The purpose of departmental Capability Reviews is to use honest and robust assessments of future capabilities to identify the specific measures that are needed if central Government Departments are to play their part in enabling the United Kingdom to meet the considerable challenges of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/2">The Cabinet Office's Capability Review of the Department was based on evidence from the Department itself, interviews and meetings with a wide range of external stakeholders, as well as a cross-section of departmental staff. The judgments reflect a considered overall view of the Department, and the permanent secretaries have welcomed the report as a timely and valuable assessment of the Department as a whole, and the challenges it faces, including challenges in the area of policy-making. However neither this nor any other review was designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the particular strengths and weaknesses of individual parts of departments and their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/3">The report describes the aspects of policy-making that are not consistently strong. The Department is already taking action on these. Better policy-making, the Department's plans for a system of policy governance to improve policy-making capability across the organisation, was published in April 2007. In addition, the Department's analytical capability has been relocated from central teams to individual policy directorates to improve the use of evidence in policy-making, and a horizon scanning capability is being established to bolster the Department's ability to predict future trends in healthcare.</p>

	<p pid="a.1449W.8/1">The provision of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, in the national health service and the independent sector, has been regulated under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 since <phrase class="date" code="1991-08-01">1 August 1991</phrase>. No assessment has been made of the changes to the cost of IVF following the introduction of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1449W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase>, the Act was amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Quality and Safety) Regulations 2007, to bring the provisions of the European Union directive on the safety and quality of human tissues and cells for human application fully into force in respect of gametes and embryos. The regulations require establishments providing IVF to meet environmental and practice standards intended to ensure that only safe, high quality tissue is used in a patient's treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1449W.8/3">While many of the provisions in the directive mirrored existing requirements in the 1990 Act and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's code of practice, IVF clinics are likely to incur some costs in meeting the standards, although costs are likely to vary significantly between establishments. The regulatory impact assessment (RIA), prepared for the implementation of the directive, commented on potential costs to the fertility sector of complying with the standards. A copy of the RIA is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1458W.5/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has recently carried out an informal consultation on an initial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) that sets out the current position in the United Kingdom with respect to food supplements and seeks information from stakeholders to measure the potential impact in advance of future EC proposals for setting daily dosage levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The information will be used to inform the draft RIA, which will then be subject to a formal consultation process. Since we do not yet know what the Commission will propose, the FSA sought information on a wide range of possible options.</p>
	<p pid="a.1458W.5/4">The impact assessment will be updated to take account of future Commission papers and a full public consultation will be carried out when the Commission publish proposals. The UK negotiating position on maximum levels will take into account all stakeholder comments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1459W.5/1">The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, on which the Government proposed a referendum, is now defunct. The mandate for a Reform Treaty agreed by the European Council states clearly:</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The constitutional concept, which consisted in repealing all existing Treaties and replacing them by a single text called &quot;Constitution&quot;, is abandoned&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.5/3">As my right hon. Friend the then Prime Minister (Mr. Tony Blair) set out in his statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>, the Reform Treaty will differ fundamentally from the Constitutional Treaty in both form and substance. Among other things, we have ensured that there is nothing in the mandate for the Reform Treaty which will require us to change our existing labour and social legislation. Our common law system and our police and judicial processes will be protected. Our independent foreign and defence policy will be maintained. Our tax and social security system will be protected.</p>

	<p pid="a.1460W.8/2">In 2004 the Council of the European Union invited the European Commission to prepare a Green Paper on the conflict of laws in matters of succession and related issues. The Green Paper was published in 2005 and suggested there was a need for the harmonisation of private international law rules in the field of succession.</p>
	<p pid="a.1460W.8/3">The UK response to the Green Paper made clear that although the Government support, in principle, the development of proposals to help people with inheritance matters that have a cross-border element, it has serious concerns about the proposals that might emerge from the Commission's Green Paper. The UK detailed response is available on the EU website:</p>

	<p pid="a.1465W.2/1">Couples are free to make pre-nuptial agreements and apply them in the event of relationship breakdown. In those circumstances the courts will only intervene in their financial affairs if one party wishes to dispute that agreement. Even if the parties dispute it, an agreement is a factor taken into account in any ancillary relief proceedings relating to the couple who made the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1465W.2/2">The welfare of any child is the court's first consideration when resolving a couple's financial affairs. Enforcement of prenuptial contracts regardless of their content would displace that principle. An agreement which is very old, or one which does not deal with the couple's current circumstances, or on which the parties had not taken independent legal advice, could be unfair. The agreement might not have considered changes in circumstances, such as the illness of one of the parties, or the birth of children, which would change the parties' earning capacity.</p>

However, we believe that pre-nuptial agreements are most often used by wealthier couples. We think that pre-nuptial agreements could never fully oust the jurisdiction of the court without putting vulnerable parties and children at risk.</p>
