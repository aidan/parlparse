In the interim, the mine route-proving capability of the UK Task Force has not been affected by the lack of Tempest, as other vehicles within the EOD Task Force have been able to complete required tasks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1031W.11/2">In addition, while not designated a 'mine protected vehicle' the newly procured Mastiff, a wheeled patrol vehicle with a less intimidating profile than our tracked vehicles, offers good protection against a range of threats including mines. We are rapidly procuring around 100 of these vehicles for use in both Iraq and Afghanistan. An effective Mastiff capability is now operational in Iraq, and reports indicate that UK forces there are pleased with them. They will start to be delivered to Afghanistan this spring. I am withholding the precise number of each type of vehicle available, as the information would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.1031W.11/3">Following my written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>, we have sent two additional CH-47 Chinooks to Afghanistan, making a total of eight, and have increased the number of flying hours. Commanders on the ground have made clear that they have sufficient helicopter assets to conduct current operations. We will continue to keep our helicopter requirements under review to ensure that we have sufficient support to meet current and anticipated tasks. The exact number of helicopters available on any given day will fluctuate subject to routine repair and maintenance work. I am withholding the precise number that are currently in working order as the information would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="d.1034W.11/1">The Department provides support to serving personnel with mental health problems but at service termination the primary responsibility passes to the relevant civilian agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1034W.11/2">Considerable mental health support is already available to veterans. If a veteran is a war pensioner he or she will be entitled to priority NHS treatment for the accepted condition(s); priority is decided by the clinician in charge and is subject to clinical need. The Government also fund care provided by Combat Stress, to the value last year of some &pound;2.8 million, for those with an appropriate condition accepted as being caused or made worse by service.</p>
	<p pid="d.1034W.11/3">The Veterans' Programme, launched in 2001, aims for excellent delivery of public services for veterans, including families, through cross-governmental partnership, involving MOD, other Government Departments and ex-service organisations. Examples of this include improvements to the arrangements for transfer of veterans from military to civilian or charitable care and welfare arrangements; also measures to raise awareness of military and veterans issues among the civilians health community, for example through contact with the Chief Medical Officers and the Royal College of General Practitioners. Similarly, last year we introduced the Reserves Mental Health Programme offering enhanced medical services to those reservists with operational service since 2003 whose general practitioners consider that their deployment may have affected their mental health.</p>
	<p pid="d.1034W.11/4">Some veterans appear reluctant to access available help for reasons relating to their military culture. Advised by national clinical experts, we are working with the health departments and the ex-service organisations, including Combat Stress, to develop a new, culturally aware community-based mental health service for veterans. It is hoped that the proposed model will be trialled at sites around the United Kingdom from spring 2007. The approach will be holistic, providing evidence-based treatment and other support, as required, to veterans, their families and carers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1035W.2/1">From April 2007, a range of weather information, weather-related warnings and supporting programmes from the Met Office, will be brought together in a new public weather service. Funding for broadly comparable activities from the MOD, and other sources, in each of the last five years has been as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/4"> <td></td> <td><i> Total PWS funding (&pound;000)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/5"> <td>2001-02</td> <td>76,684</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/6"> <td>2002-03</td> <td>77,992</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/7"> <td>2003-04</td> <td>79,017</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/8"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>80,623</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/9"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>83,809</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1035W.2/10"> <td>2006-07 (forecast)</td> <td>84,835</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.1035W.2/13">The services provided by the Met Office over this period have delivered very good value for money to the UK taxpayer, in terms of the benefit provided by increasingly accurate weather forecasts and warnings which are free at point of use, as exemplified by the recent snow-events that were well forecast many days ahead. These have enabled members of the public, and the public bodies charged with their safety, to make informed choices about day-to-day activities and to enhance the protection of life, property and essential infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="d.1036W.2/1">We have historically enjoyed close defence links with both Australia and New Zealand, dating back to before world war one. Similarities in the way the Australians and ourselves organise, train and employ our forces facilitate close co-operation. Australian forces currently operate alongside UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. UK and New Zealand troops currently co-operate in Afghanistan and have also worked together in UN missions, including Bosnia, East Timor and the Gulf. In addition, we hold a number of joint exercises with Australia and New Zealand, mainly under the auspices of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) and there are a number of military personnel exchange programmes with both countries. Australian and New Zealand defence personnel also routinely participate in UK training and staff courses and vice versa.</p>
	<p pid="d.1036W.2/2">UK/Finnish defence relations are good and growing ever closer, with expanding military co-operation. Finnish armed forces participate in a number of NATO and EU operations in which UK forces are also involved, including in Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia. Finland has undertaken to participate in EU Battlegroups, including the Swedish-led Nordic Battlegroup, for which the UK will provide the operational headquarters at Northwood.</p>

Half of the efficiency gains are to be cashable. No target has yet been set for years beyond 2007-08, but it remains vital for the police service to identify and to realise opportunities for further efficiency gains.</p>

	<p pid="d.1060W.8/1">Two audits were carried out in August 2002, and the Home Office reported to Lord Falconer that the general position on data accuracy was far more favourable than had previously been suggested. The exercise found that in 94 per cent. of cases, the key information was recorded entirely accurately, and that in the remaining 6 per cent. some inaccuracies were found but, in the majority of instances, the inaccuracy was not critical.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/2">In 25 cases (involving 11 persons), the PNC record contained some inaccuracy as to name or date of birth. Nevertheless, nine persons would have been correctly matched on PNC, and the other two (0.08 per cent. of the total sample) might have been matched through other available information.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/3">In nine cases (involving nine persons), there was a minor error in the details of the offence or disposal recorded on the PNC. None of these was considered likely to impact on an employment decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/4">In 64 cases (28 persons), there was no trace of the person on the PNC. This is clearly a potentially worrying problem. But, in practice, the offences involved were less serious (although some 16 per cent. had resulted in a custodial sentence). Of the 48 cases brought by the police, 29 were various driving offences, eight related to theft, burglary or robbery, five to failure to surrender, and five to other offences classified as not serious and non-violent. The one remaining case was of ABH. No sexual offences, or more serious offences of violence, were involved. The research found that the more serious offences are more likely to be recorded correctly on the PNC.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/5">It is important to note here that the first exercise did not take specifically into account other factors which might explain why a conviction is correctly not recorded on the PNC. The later exercise on sex offences revealed that, in a number of instances in which the PNC had appeared to be in error, subsequent events had led to a record being wiped&mdash;for example, where there had been a successful appeal, or the offender had died.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/6">There were 29 &quot;impending prosecution&quot; cases (i.e. where an arrest/summons report had been entered on the PNC but the court results had not been logged). The programme of work which HMIC has been overseeing to improve the timeliness of data inputting has improved the position here. In the case of an enhanced disclosure, a local police intelligence check should identify an &quot;impending prosecution&quot; case and result in the court result being added if it is available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/7">Finally, there were 125 other cases in which the PNC had a record of the person concerned but details of an offence and conviction were missing. Again, the offences were less serious in nature. 79 per cent. were various driving offences, failure to surrender, false accounting and various other offences categorised as non-violent. There were three offences of assault or ABH, three drugs-related offences, and 16 grouped as theft, burglary or robbery.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/8">Of 67 persons on PNC who were found to have an offence missing, 85 per cent. had at least two previous equivalent or more serious convictions (and 66 per cent. had five or more previous offences). In a high proportion of these cases, a missing conviction is considered unlikely to have a material impact on an employment decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1060W.8/9">Two thematic inspections were carried out by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary (HMIC) during 2001-02 with a specific focus on the timeliness of input of initial reports or arrest or summons and finalisation of case results post court appearance. Since that time, HMIC has continued to audit individual forces on a risk-based annual schedule, examining performance against nationally agreed targets for input of records. Both the thematic inspection reports from 2001-02 and all subsequent force audits are available on HMIC's website.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.2/1">A person may only be convicted of an offence if the prosecution proves his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is a fundamental principle, enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998, that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. In certain circumstances, a defendant who seeks to rely on a particular defence has the burden of raising or establishing the defence. For example, at common law, there is a presumption of sanity and the onus is on the defendant to establish the defence of insanity. Some statutory offences are phrased so that it is for the defendant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he has a defence for behaviour which would otherwise be criminal. However, that is unusual, and such defences are usually ones where the facts of the defence would only be known to the defendant.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.5/2">As the Government have said on previous occasions, we believe that without this reservation the interpretation of the UNCRC might come into conflict with the UK's own domestic legislation on immigration. For this reason we think that it is right to retain the reservation as presently worded. The retention of the reservation, however, does not mean that vulnerable children do not have the protection of the UK's own laws. We are satisfied that asylum-seeking children in the UK receive adequate care, protection and support. In addition, domestic legislation also provides protection under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Children Act 2004.</p>

	<p pid="d.1082W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.11/2">I refer to the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 599W, given by the Minister of State for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality. At the national level, there are no plans to increase regulation in this area. Creation and use of websites is not a regulated activity. However, arrangements are in place under the Electronic Commerce Regulations to enable internet service providers in the UK to take down inappropriate content when they are notified of its existence. Activities conducted through websites are subject to the general law in the same way as any other offline activity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.11/3">All published material including violent pornography, is subject to the Obscene Publication Act 1959, which makes illegal the publication of an article whose effect, taken as a whole, is to tend to deprave and corrupt those likely to read, see or hear it. Responsibility for the prevention of the physical importation of obscene material lies with HM Revenue and Customs under the terms of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 and section 170(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.11/4">The Obscene Publication Act applies equally to material published over the internet, though the overwhelming majority of obscene material published on the internet originates abroad and beyond our jurisdiction. This raises a challenge to our controls on obscene material. The Government are therefore proposing to make illegal the possession of a limited category of extreme pornographic material in measures to be introduced in the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.1082W.11/5">The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) supported by the UK industry and the European Union works to minimise the availability of illegal internet content, particularly child abuse images, by means of a telephone hotline to report incidences of potentially illegal content on websites. Reports are passed on to the relevant authorities for action. Since 1996 the amount of potentially illegal content hosted in the UK has declined from 18 per cent. to less than 1 per cent. The work of the IWF is an example of responsible self-regulation by the UK internet industry.</p>

Since 2000 the Government have made a number of additional improvements to the scheme to increase its flexibility and remove barriers to giving.</p>
	<p pid="d.1086W.2/2">Donations using Gift Aid have increased from &pound;905 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;3.4 billion in 2005-06. The amount of Gift Aid tax relief paid to charities has increased from &pound;208 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;750 million in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="d.1086W.2/3">HMRC does not collate figures for the total number of people giving using Gift Aid but sector estimates for 2004-05 suggest that around 10 million UK adults use Gift Aid for one or more of their donations in an average month.</p>
	<p pid="d.1086W.2/4">Details of charitable donations and Gift Aid relief are available to the public on the HMRC website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1096W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned any research specifically in response to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's recommendation regarding trials of efficacy of social support interventions for socially isolated and vulnerable groups of people with depression that was included in their clinical guidelines issued in 2004. However, the Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the national health service and as part of its Policy Research Programme (PRP) has undertaken a study on &quot;Mental health, social inclusion and arts: developing the evidence base&quot;. This has been commissioned by the Department for Culture Media and Sport and the Department in response to the Social Exclusion Unit's report on mental health and social exclusion. The study relates to participatory arts and mental health work in England with people with mental health needs aged 16 to 65. The study is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1096W.2/2">As part of the policy to introduce new roles into the mental health work force to help meet the needs of service users, the NHS plan included a commitment to train support, time and recovery (STR) workers who provide a range of social support to people with mental illness. At the end of January, over 3,100 STR workers were either in post or in training in the NHS. As part of PRP, the Department has commissioned a piece of research entitled &quot;New roles in the Mental Health Workforce: Implementation and Experience&quot; which is intended to provide systematic and conceptually connected snapshots of the ways in which new roles, including STR workers, operate and the impact of work force changes on the experience of users and carers with differing levels of need and expectation. This evaluation, led by Dr. Pauline Pearson, University of Newcastle, started in September 2006 and is ongoing.</p>

Local authorities' overview and scrutiny committees have the power to refer any proposal to the Secretary of State if they believe the proposal is not in the interests of the health service or if consultation has been inadequate. The Secretary of State can refer the matter to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel for advice, require further consultation or endorse the decisions of the local NHS organisations responsible for them. However, very few such local reconfiguration decisions are referred to the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="d.1106W.3/2">As we have made clear in the 2007-08 NHS Operating Framework, strategic health authorities (SHAs) will not generally require the scale of contribution to SHA reserves seen in 2006-07, because of the return of the NHS to overall financial balance. Where continuing contributions are required, they must be subject to transparent rules clearly covering the purpose of the reserves and the timescale over which each organisation will recover its contribution. SHAs have been asked to ensure financial plans for 2007-08 for individual organisations are prepared on this basis.</p>

	<p pid="d.1111W.0/1">Since Paroxetine (brand name Seroxat) was first licensed its safety and that of other medicines in this class has been continually reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and has been considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM, the predecessor to the Commission on Human Medicines) on a number of occasions (in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001). In May 2003, in response to continuing public concern, an expert working group of the CSM was established to further review the safety of these medicines, with a particular focus on suicidal behaviour and the risk of withdrawal reactions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.0/2">The conclusions and key findings of the expert group were communicated to health professionals on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase>. Overall, the expert group concluded that the balance of risks and benefits of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adults remains positive. The key findings of the expert group in relation to suicidal behaviour in adults concluded that based on the available clinical trial data, both published and unpublished, a modest increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm for SSRIs compared with placebo cannot be ruled out. It was also recommended that prescribers and patients should be made more aware of the side effect profile of these medicines and recommended the need for close monitoring of patients, particularly young adults, being treated for depressive illness or anxiety disorders.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.0/3">In reaching its conclusions the expert group considered a large body of evidence from a wide range of sources including spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (from health professionals and patients), clinical trials, epidemiological databases and the published literature. The published literature included studies which had examined the effect of recent increases in antidepressant prescribing (including SSRIs such as Paroxetine) on national suicide rates. With some exceptions, these studies generally conclude that recent rises in antidepressant prescribing have contributed to declines in suicide. Many factors influence suicide rates and generally definitive explanations for fluctuations in these rates cannot be ascertained. It is encouraging that the latest figures on suicide rates in England show that the national suicide rate continued to fall in 2005 and stood at its lowest ever level.</p>
	<p pid="d.1111W.0/4">The safety of Paroxetine remains under continual review. The United States Food and Drug Administration has recently completed a review of adult clinical trials for SSRIs and related antidepressants examining the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. These data are under consideration by the MHRA and other European regulatory authorities and new prescribing advice will be issued if any update is considered necessary.</p>

It did not look at support staff, teaching and research responsibilities and is intended as a benchmarking tool to support investigation of productivity and best practice at a local level.

	<p pid="d.1114W.2/1">Funding for developing the healthcare work force through the Multi Professional Education and Training levy (MPET) was allocated to SHAs in 2006-07 as part of a bundle of central budgets. This was done to allow strategic health authorities (SHAs) greater flexibility to use resources to address local priorities including financial deficits.</p>
	<p pid="d.1114W.2/2">For 2007-08 allocations for MPET have again been included in the bundle of central budgets. The MPET share of the bundle has been increased to reflect the costs of increasing numbers of trainees especially medical students and training grade doctors. Although MPET funding will not be ring fenced, there will be a more robust service level agreement which will seek to ensure that SHA decisions on what training to fund and the level of commissions of training places required are made on the basis of long term work force need. SHAs will be held to account on the basis of key outputs and not on the basis of spending a particular amount of money on work force development.</p>

The remaining rebel group, the Forces Nationales de Lib&eacute;ration, responsible for many human rights abuses, finally signed a ceasefire agreement with the Burundian Government in September 2006. Since then, the number of violent attacks against the rural population has decreased. This ceasefire is a significant step towards sustainable peace in Burundi.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117W.2/3">We will continue to press for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Special Chamber, to bring justice to the Burundian people.</p>

	<p pid="d.1120W.3/1">We remain concerned at the security situation in Gaza. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase> the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that in 2007 86 Palestinians including 11 children had been killed in intra-Palestinian violence and 486 injured. Hamas and Fatah have since renewed the ceasefire, which is still holding. Israeli military actions have also killed civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. We have repeatedly raised our concerns with the Government of Israel. We have also raised our concerns about the firing of Qassam rockets at Israeli towns with Palestinian President Abbas. We welcome his call for the firing of these rockets to stop</p>
	<p pid="d.1120W.3/2">We welcome Saudi Arabia's efforts to broker a National Unity Government with a meeting between the parties in Mecca. The news from Mecca is an interesting and important development. We will need to study these proposals carefully and discuss them with our European and other partners. We also welcome the outcomes from the Quartet meeting in Washington on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-02">2 February</phrase>, particularly the commitment to a renewed political process with the aim of launching meaningful negotiations, the upcoming meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, President Abbas, and US Secretary of State Rice and the Quartet's commitment to meet regularly at both the principals' and envoys' level.</p>

	<p pid="d.1129W.5/1">Housing associations are independent not-for-profit organisations who are regulated by the Housing Corporation, a non-departmental public body.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/2">Sections 18, 20, 21, 27 and 28 of the Housing Act, 1996 set out the statutory provisions to provide and recover grant via the Housing Corporation to registered social landlords (RSLs) and other developers in respect of housing activities as specified under Section 2 of the Housing Act 1996 of refurbishment of existing stock, new build and replacement of existing stock.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/3">The Department has not published guidelines on the conduct of these activities but approves the Housing Corporation's prospectus for the Affordable Housing Programme. More specifically Housing Corporation policy on providing grant is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/4" class="indent">(i) for work to existing stock: funding for maintenance is available only for pre-1988 stock and is provided only exceptionally taking account of the level of housing associations' own resources and their ability to fund such works themselves. For re-improvements to existing stock, funding will be available only if the improvements meet a regionally identified priority need (such as for supported or sheltered housing);</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/5" class="indent">(ii) for new build, grant is awarded based on a competition, for schemes that meet regionally identified priorities, following a value for money assessment by the Corporation;</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/6" class="indent">(iii) for replacement of existing stock by higher density new build, grant is awarded based on a competition, for schemes that meet regionally identified priorities, following a value for money assessment by the Corporation. Additionally, in some regions (those where this is supported by the Regional Housing Board advice) there is a requirement that replacement schemes should show a net gain in the number of social rented properties.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/7">The Department also enters into gap funding grant arrangements with RSLs who take negatively valued housing stock through voluntary transfer from local authorities. Current guidance is contained within the Department's published Housing Transfer Manual 2005 (and 2006 Supplement).</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/8">In June 2006 the Department issued &quot;A Decent Home: Definition and Guidance for Implementation for all local authorities and RSLs&quot;. The guidance explains a number of Decent Homes policy amendments and seeks to clarify issues that have arisen in the implementation of the programme. It also sets out how we see social landlords building on the success of the programme working more flexibly to go beyond the Decent Homes programme to undertake more radical solutions to transform some of the poorest neighbourhoods into mixed sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.5/9">We also want to encourage local authorities, ALMOs and RSLs to ensure they are considering the need for new build in their area alongside decent homes.</p>

Not everyone on the waiting list is necessarily in urgent housing need. The waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&mdash;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time.</p>

	<p pid="d.1131W.2/1">Electric heating will always have a place in homes. The industry has indicated it will continue to improve efficiencies and innovate in conjunction with the other building interests and the electricity supply industries so that annual carbon burdens can be reduced while still providing the internal environments that householders need.</p>
	<p pid="d.1131W.2/2">Building regulations set overall performance standards expressed in terms of annual carbon emissions. They do not prescribe means of meeting these standards. The electric heating industry was extensively consulted in advance of the amendments to the building regulations that came into effect in 2006 and I expect that they will respond to our consultation on &quot;Building a Greener Future&quot; published last month. The consultation proposes further amendments of the building regulations in 2010, 2013 and 2016 and in the normal way there will be detailed technical consultations before changes are made.</p>
