Annual conferences for the CPS area homophobic crime co-ordinators are held and good practice promulgated. Each area's performance on prosecuting cases of homophobic crime is monitored and reviewed each quarter.</p>

	<p pid="b.894W.0/1">As part of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) response to Operation Pentameter, updated guidance has been issued to specialist crown prosecutors in each CPS Area. This guidance focuses on trafficking for sexual exploitation and has been informed in part by the experiences of those who have handled trafficking cases and supported trafficked victims. It has also been taken from best practice gleaned from research from other jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.0/2">The guidance emphasises the importance of adhering to the standards set out in the CPS Public Policy Statement on the Delivery of Service to Victims, which places the needs of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. This emphasises the importance of obtaining the best evidence from the victim. To do this crown prosecutors have been advised to view the case from a victim's perspective, and not purely from a lawyer's perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.0/3">Further specific guidance for trafficking cases &quot;Dealing with the Victim&quot; has been issued to assist crown prosecutors in understanding the varied and complex needs of trafficked victims and the support required. This guidance has been developed for the police by CENTREX (the Police Training Organisation) in partnership with REFLEX (the Government's multi-agency response to organised immigration crime).</p>

	<p pid="b.894W.6/1">In such circumstances, a member of the prosecution team, normally the police officer in the case, will contact the victim to assess the reasons why they wish to withdraw from the prosecution process. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police will then consider using a range of measures to re-engage the victim in the prosecution process, such as the police installing a panic alarm, clearing the public gallery at the trial, using screens or giving evidence via a video link.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.6/2">The prosecution team works to the achieving best evidence guidance issued in 2002 which deals with the care of vulnerable and intimidated witnesses.

In its &quot;Vision 2016&quot; document, launched in 1997, the Government recognised that Botswana needs to diversify its economy within the next 20 years. For this to happen, mining, agriculture, industry, manufacturing services and tourism all need to make a substantial contribution to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/3">DFID no longer has a bilateral programme in Botswana. DFID Southern Africa's regional programmes in health, trade, and infrastructure will support the Government's plans for economic diversification.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.5/1">Research funded by the Government at the Hadley Centre suggests that climate change could lead to a drier climate in the Amazon basin. A less disturbed forest will better adapt to these conditions, a more fragmented one will be more vulnerable to fire and therefore less resilient. Most climate models agree that complete removal of the Amazonian forest would lead to a drying of the climate, because local rainfall depends on recycling of water via the forest. Removal of the Amazonian forest could also affect local climates in neighbouring regions through changes in atmospheric circulation. The effect on agriculture could be profound and research by Brazil's national meteorological service suggests that the rainfall in the La Plata basin (where much of Brazil's hydroelectric power is generated) depends on moisture transported via the atmosphere from Amazonia. In addition to these potential impacts on agricultural production and power generation, loss of forest as a result of climate change would result in significant reduction in biodiversity and access to forest products which contribute to local livelihoods. Conflicts related to access to natural resources would be exacerbated.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.5/1">The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations were suspended in July by the director general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and WTO General Council. This was due to a failure by the G6 countries (US, EU, Japan, Brazil, India and Australia) to reach an agreement on the core triangle of issues at the heart of the talks: market opening in the agricultural sector; cuts in subsidies paid to farmers; and increased market opening for industrial goods. While this suspension is disappointing, we will continue to press for the negotiations to be restarted at the earliest opportunity and to seek an ambitious outcome to the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.5/2">We are committed to seeking to ensure that the DDA negotiations achieve the best impact for sustainable development and poverty reduction, by unlocking the development potential of trade and giving developing countries the flexibility to sequence the opening of their markets in line with their own national development plans and poverty reduction strategies. To help achieve this, DFID has supported a number of activities to increase understanding of the impact of the DDA on development and poverty reduction and to inform negotiations. These have included a study on the impact on developing countries of the various scenarios of non-agricultural market access being discussed in the DDA negotiations, as well as a collection of expert papers on the impacts of the DDA on trade and poverty. DFID also supports a comprehensive research programme by the World Bank that covers a range of trade issues and is aimed at supporting developing countries in the context of trade negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.5/3">Our assessment is that the DDA remains the best opportunity to make progress towards the UK's long-term vision: a world trading system that is fair as well as free, with greater prosperity for developing and developed countries, resulting in reduced levels of global poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.901W.0/1">The cornerstone of preventing obstetric fistula is prompt access to good quality health care when needed. DFID is committed to helping countries expand access to health care, including family planning, safe abortion services, antenatal and obstetric services, all of which are vital for preventing fistula. Meeting the existing demand for family planning services would reduce maternal deaths and injuries by over 20 per cent. DFID is the only major bilateral donor to have a strategy focused on reducing maternal mortality. Copies of the first progress report on the strategy can be found in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.0/2">The effects of fistula can be devastating for the lives of girls and women, whose babies often die. Rendered incontinent they are often rejected by their husbands, thrown out of their homes and excluded from community life. DFID is therefore committed to promoting the rights of girls and women, particularly their sexual and reproductive rights, and to the elimination of harmful practices such as early marriage and female genital mutilation, which can significantly increase the risk of fistula.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.0/3">DFID targets some funding through NGOs to tackle obstetric fistula. For example, DFID has provided a grant of &pound;558,000 to the EngenderHealth and Women's Dignity Project to combat obstetric fistula in Tanzania and Uganda, and &pound;140,000 to the Obstetric Fistulae in Africa Project. To compliment our country level support, DFID channels funds through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). DFID provides &pound;20 million a year core funding and in 2004 provided &pound;10 million specifically for reproductive health supplies. DFID also provides an annual contribution of &pound;19 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and &pound;12.5 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose programmes support work on women's empowerment, maternal and reproductive health.</p>

	<p pid="b.901W.6/1">DFID draws on the analysis of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for data regarding obstetric fistula and does not conduct its own assessments. WHO estimates that more than two million women and girls are living with fistula in developing countries, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases occurring each year. However, these figures are based on the number of women seeking treatment and are likely to be gross underestimates. The full extent of the problem has never been mapped and reliable data on obstetric fistula is scarce. In 2004 UNFPA and EngenderHealth conducted a groundbreaking needs assessment study in nine African countries to provide the basis of our understanding on obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.5/1">Last month the Chancellor and I announced that we expect UK spending on aid for trade, including economic infrastructure, to increase to $750 million by 2010. A major proportion of this will flow to Africa, including funding for transport, energy, ports and communications, as well as capacity building for trade policy and trade facilitation.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/2">DFID supports efforts to improve regional integration&mdash;key to facilitating African trade&mdash;at both pan-African (support to African Union&mdash;New Partnership for Africa's Development and African Development Bank) and sub-regional levels. For example in southern Africa, DFID supports a regional trade facilitation programme and is also initiating two new programmes to facilitate trade: one to implement one stop border posts to make cross border trade easier, and a Regional Standards Programme to increase capacity of the region to produce goods of export quality. DFID is also developing an extensive programme to improve the state of transport infrastructure in southern Africa, to reduce transport costs and improve the logistics of moving freight across long distances.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/3">DFID also provides support at national level. For example, DFID assists Lesotho's labour-intensive garment sector to retain and build its market share in a time of global upheaval.

	<p pid="b.904W.3/1">Local authorities (LAs) have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future air quality in their areas. The first step of the review and assessment process is an updating and screening assessment (USA), which is to be undertaken by all LAs, every three years, to identify those matters that have changed since the last round was completed. Where LAs consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These LAs must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.3/2">When the local air quality management system was first introduced in December 1997, LAs were advised to complete the review and assessment process by December 1999. My Department assessed Milton Keynes' air quality report in December 1999. The report concluded that further investigation was needed in respect of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10). Following monitoring and modelling, Milton Keynes concluded from the additional work that they did not need to declare an AQMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.3/3">The second round of reviews and assessments started in 2003 and LAs had to submit USAs by the end of May 2003, and were expected to submit either a detailed assessment or a progress report by April 2004 and April 2005 respectively. Milton Keynes submitted their USA in July 2003 and a Progress Report in both July 2004 and July 2005. They concluded that there was no need to proceed to a detailed assessment or declare an AQMA.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.3/4">The third round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities were asked to submit new USAs by the end of April 2006. We received Milton Keynes' report in May 2006. Our consultants have assessed the report and agreed that there is no need for Milton Keynes to carry out further work in respect of any of the pollutants.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.2/1">Last year the Government launched the Courtauld commitment, a voluntary agreement between 13 major retailers and the waste and resources action programme (WRAP), to reduce packaging waste. There are three broad objectives to meet, which are:</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/2" class="indent">i. to design out packaging waste growth by 2008;</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/3" class="indent">ii. to deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/4" class="indent">iii. to identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/5">I will shortly be meeting with the retailers and WRAP to assess progress against these objectives, and to agree next steps. I am also meeting retailers on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October</phrase> to discuss ways in which we can take action to reduce the amount of plastic bags offered at the point of sale and encourage their reuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/6">There are also two sets of regulations in place which address the environmental impact of packaging in the UK; both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle, and the cost of doing so, is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/7">The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.2/8">Both regulations have led to decreases in packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is produced. We have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and recommend ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>

	<p pid="b.908W.2/1">According to the British Plastics Federation, an estimated 19-21 per cent. of the total plastics consumed in the UK in 2005-06 were recycled. The Government are taking action to support the reduction of plastic packaging in the waste stream and the recycling of plastics more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/2">There are numerous different types of plastics in use, which would require separate collection (or separation after collection) and treatment facilities to recycle. It inevitably takes time for that capacity to develop. Local authorities have understandably tended to focus their attention on waste streams that make a greater contribution to their targets and for which recycling infrastructure and markets are more developed. However, with targets for household waste recycling and composting becoming ever more demanding, all local authorities will have to start tackling the more difficult waste streams like plastics.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/3">The waste and resources action programme (WRAP) is working to further develop efficient markets for recycled materials. WRAP'S targets for 2004-06 are to work with the plastics industry to increase the acceptance of recycled plastic throughout the supply chain, to deliver an additional 20,000 tonnes of domestic plastic bottle recycling capacity, and to ensure that an additional 11,000 tonnes of non-bottle plastics are recycled.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/4">The Packaging Regulations set targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste to be met by obligated businesses each year so that the UK can meet the relevant EU directive targets by the specified deadline. The directive requires the UK to recycle 22.5 per cent. of the plastic packaging waste entering the UK waste stream by 2008. Currently around 20 per cent. of plastic packaging is recycled in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/5">Defra is working closely with the devolved administrations, WRAP, SWAG (Scottish Waste Awareness Group) and businesses to promote reusable bags and reduce the number of plastic bags entering the waste stream. More information is available on the Defra website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/localenv/plasticbags/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/localenv/plasticbags/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.908W.2/7">As a consequence of the Agricultural Waste Regulations coming into force, which ban agricultural plastics from being burnt or buried on farms, the Government are developing producer responsibility regulations for the collection and recovery of non-packaging farm plastics. It is envisaged that any collection scheme developed will collect both packaging and non-packaging farm plastics. The Secretary of State has allocated &pound;1 million of the business resource efficiency and waste (BREW) funding to research this and other issues; provide recommendations on the most economical way to collect plastic waste from farms; and how best to implement producer responsibility for non-packaging farm plastics.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.2/1">Waste is a devolved matter and, in Wales, it is dealt with by the National Assembly. However, recycling by UK businesses, according to the most recent Environment Agency report, showed waste recovery rates were at record levels in 2002, with 45 per cent. of all business waste recycled or re-used.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.2/2">The landfill tax escalator gives businesses a strong financial incentive to re-use or recycle their waste. Revenue from the landfill tax escalator is recycled to businesses through the business resource efficiency and waste (BREW) programme, which provides funding to organisations who can offer support and advice to businesses who wish to improve their resource efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.2/3">The revised Waste Strategy for England, which we will publish this winter, will outline what steps are being taken, and what more needs to be done, to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfill. The public, businesses and Government all have roles to play in following more sustainable waste management practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.8/1">The Government have already assessed the viability of a policy of open access to rivers and waterways in England. We have no plans to provide a statutory right of access to water since research has shown that overall supply is roughly in balance with demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.8/2">However, we recognise that there is some unmet demand for white water canoeing and canoe touring. Therefore, we are supporting the Environment Agency in its work with other stakeholders to develop regional strategies for water-related sport and recreation with the aim of identifying exactly what is needed and where. Plans for two pilot regions will be in place in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.8/3">In addition, Defra commissioned the Environment Agency to pilot four demonstration projects to develop best practice access agreements for canoeists on key stretches of English water.

	<p pid="b.913W.0/2">The package of measures set out by the Government provides the Mayor with increased powers and responsibility to deliver his municipal waste management strategy and spatial development strategy for London. The Mayor sets out policies relating to new technologies and renewable energy, which may include hydrogen production, in his municipal waste management strategy. The enhancement of his powers to require waste authorities to deliver services in general conformity with his strategy, along with his existing power of direction, will help ensure the strategic vision the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.0/3">The waste and recycling forum announced as part of the package will be led by the Mayor to co-ordinate activity across different sectors and address the key strategic issues facing London. The waste and recycling fund is associated with this and should be used to link waste with other London priorities such as transport and climate change. The Mayor leads on the London Hydrogen Partnership, which has just released a report on hydrogen as the bus fuel of the future, where he is working to introduce 70 hydrogen vehicles. I will be interested to see how he takes this forward and links it with waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.0/4">In addition, there will be a dedicated London element to the waste infrastructure development programme (WIDP), which was announced in May 2006, providing a strong role for the Mayor in working with local authorities and the regions to accelerate the building of new waste diversion infrastructure. These revised arrangements should enable the Mayor, boroughs and central Government together to consider more strategically the role of new technologies for treating London's waste, including the scope for hydrogen generation.</p>

	<p pid="b.916W.5/2" class="indent">(i) the Supporter Programme provides impartial information, advice and training to local authorities, including those in London, on a variety of aspects related to new and emerging waste management technologies;</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/3" class="indent">(ii) the Education and Training Programme provides opportunities for those working in the waste industry to gain formal qualifications in sustainable waste management and new waste management technologies;</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/4" class="indent">(iii) the Technology Research and Innovation Fund provides funding for Research and Development projects into innovative new technologies which will help England's obligations to reduce the amount of BMW going to landfill; and</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/5" class="indent">(iv) the Demonstrator Programme provides &pound;30 million of assistance to establish new waste treatment technology demonstration projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/6">The waste and recycling forum was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July</phrase> as part of the package of measures which provides the Mayor with increased powers and responsibility to deliver his municipal waste management strategy and spatial development strategy for London. It will be led by the Mayor to co-ordinate activity across different sectors and address the key strategic issues facing London. The waste and recycling fund is associated with this and should be used to link waste with other London priorities such as transport and climate change. This is likely to include looking at the role of renewable energy and new technologies in treating London's waste.</p>

	<p pid="b.917W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July</phrase> this year, the Government announced the outcome of their review of the powers and responsibilities of the Mayor of London and the Greater London Authority. As part of this, the Government announced a package of measures which provides the Mayor with increased powers and responsibility to deliver his municipal waste management strategy and spatial development strategy for London. The enhancement of his powers to require waste authorities to deliver services in general conformity with his strategy, along with his existing power of direction, will help ensure the strategic vision the Mayor sets out for London is delivered on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.2/2">As part of the proposals, the Mayor will lead a London-wide waste and recycling forum to co-ordinate activity across different sectors and address the key strategic issues facing London. The waste and recycling fund is associated with this and should be used to link waste with other London priorities such as economic development, transport and climate change. Other improvements, such as providing stronger powers for the Mayor to determine strategic waste planning applications and the London component of the waste infrastructure development programme, will also help establish facilities and infrastructure necessary to co-ordinate the management of municipal and other waste streams within London.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.2/3">The Mayor is producing a wider waste strategy for London that will be looking at non-municipal waste streams and I look forward to seeing this when it is released for consultation.</p>

Improvements in close-following were also observed in the unmarked, outside lane. Following the trial, advice and guidance about the use of chevron markings was published.

	<p pid="b.925W.6/1">Safety camera partnerships are not a legal entity, but complement existing local authority and police statutory responsibilities and powers in respect of road safety. Communications activity is an important part of the safety camera programme and in order to help bring about a change in driver behaviour, Partnerships are encouraged to work with local agencies involved in road safety and to support wider road safety activities including driver education programmes. However, under the netting-off funding arrangements the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales for 2006-07 permits only those costs directly linked to speed, red light running and/or safety camera enforcement to be reclaimed.</p>

	<p pid="b.926W.6/1">The DfT published a consultation document on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-29">29 September 2006</phrase> which set out four options for implementation of the Brighton main line route utilisation strategy [RUS]. The principal focus of the RUS is on delivery of increased capacity to relieve crowding on peak London commuting services and improved operational performance. However, all the options are also expected to deliver an improvement in journey times between Sussex coast stations and London termini due to the provision of separate services to and from the east and west coastway routes in place of the present combined services. Elimination of the time penalty when trains split or join at Haywards Heath is expected to reduce the overall journey time of these trains by between three and seven minutes, though this is subject to confirmation as the details of the new timetable are developed.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.2/1">Academies are established with the involvement of sponsors from the voluntary, private or faith sectors.

	<p pid="b.928W.2/2">Independent consultants carry out a thorough due diligence check on all potential sponsors during the pre-feasibility stage, and Ministers apply a public interest test to sponsors on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the funding is from an appropriate source. We give preference to British or foreign sponsors with business interests in the UK; who are long standing UK residents; or who have businesses interests in jurisdictions with effective and open business governance where it is easier to assess risk against the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.930W.8/1">DfES guidance relating to children with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD) is directed to both local authorities and head teachers. This includes the SEN Code of Practice (2001), and Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings (2001). With the Department's BESD Working Group, which includes head teachers, leaders of pupil referral units, educational psychologists, representatives from CAMHS and key voluntary and professional organisations, we are currently considering further, targeted guidance for schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.8/2">In addition to guidance, specialist training materials and opportunities for accreditation have been made available for some 500 staff across the country who have particular responsibilities for BESD.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.8/3">Our guidance on exclusion from school also makes it clear that schools must do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for pupils with special educational needs and that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, schools should avoid permanently excluding pupils with statements. We will be revising our guidance on school behaviour policies to strengthen advice on making reasonable adjustments for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.8/4">On suitable environments for children with BESD, the SEN Code of Practice requires all local authorities to provide appropriate settings, either through mainstream schools, BESD special schools, or PRUs, with a flexible continuum of provision to meet the particular needs of children with BESD. Where a child has complex needs the statutory framework makes clear the need for children to be assessed individually and for authorities to take into consideration the views of parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.930W.8/5">Further details on the Government's programme for BESD will shortly be announced in our response to the House of Commons Education and Skills Committee SEN Third Report of Session 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.935W.2/1">The single substantive change to the delivery of the free early education entitlement made in the 2006 code of practice was the extension of the free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks. We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code from June to October 2005, to which 585 responses were received, the majority from private providers who were generally content with the proposed extension to 38 weeks. A summary of responses is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.935W.2/3">Additional funding of &pound;82 million in financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 has been made available to local authorities to deliver the additional weeks and a number of measures were included in the code of practice to aid the transition, to support parental choice and to reflect provider circumstances. These included: allowing that the 38 weeks provision could be delivered by a single provider or by providers in cooperation; indicating that where a parent decided explicitly that they wanted to take their provision with a provider offering only 33 weeks they could do so and the provider would be paid for that period; and recommending that the transition be phased over a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.935W.5/1">We are committed to increasing the number of pupils achieving grade C or above at GCSE level. Over 365,000 pupils are achieving grade C or above in English, and nearly 329,000 are doing so in mathematics. Compared to 1997, around 52,000 more pupils are now achieving five or more A*-C GCSEs including English and mathematics. For the first time, in 2008, local authorities and schools will be required to set targets for the proportion of pupils achieving five A*-C GCSEs, including English and mathematics.</p>
	<p pid="b.935W.5/2">Throughout all key stages we have made efforts to ensure that standards of attainment in English and mathematics continue to rise. We know from experience that children who achieve level 4 (the expected level for their age) or above in English and mathematics at the end of key stage 2 tests are more likely to achieve grade C or above in their English and mathematics GCSEs. The reforms we are pushing through at primary level, particularly the renewed primary framework for literacy and mathematics, will play an important part in helping children achieve more at GCSE.</p>
	<p pid="b.935W.5/3">The secondary national strategy is improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom by providing a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, including training, materials and support from local consultants who are experts in their field. Support is also available to help teachers deliver effective tailored interventions for pupils who have fallen behind, particularly in English and mathematics. This includes additional funding, structured teaching resources for use with individuals and small groups, and training on how to use these resources effectively. We are also piloting a model, &quot;Study Plus&quot;, of extra support for key stage 4 pupils at risk of missing a grade C.</p>
	<p pid="b.935W.5/4">The 14-19 education and skills White Paper set out our proposals to strengthen and improve GCSEs, with a particular emphasis on English and mathematics. We will continue work to reform mathematics and improve motivation and progression. In response to Professor Adrian Smith's post-14 maths inquiry, we have withdrawn the three-tier mathematics GCSE and replaced it with a two-tier qualification, meaning that all pupils will have the opportunity of achieving a grade C; and have established a national centre for excellence in the teaching of mathematics. We are also making changes to the mathematics curriculum to better meet the needs of diverse employers and individual pupils. As part of our overhaul of literacy and numeracy qualifications, mathematics and English GCSEs will be restructured to place functional skills at their heart. In addition, the review of the key stage 3 national curriculum will provide greater flexibility for teachers to meet pupils' needs and opportunities to concentrate on securing the basics in English and mathematics.</p>

	<p pid="b.939W.0/1">The phonics pilot scheme referred to (the early reading development pilot) was designed to test whether phonic work could be taught faster and more systematically to bring about better literacy outcomes for children while still maintaining the benefits of the broader foundation stage curriculum. The scheme, which began before Jim Rose's report was published, was based on existing primary national strategy teaching materials and therefore did not generate information on the effectiveness of alternative interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.939W.0/2">In line with statutory guidance for the age group involved (four and five-year-olds), children were assessed against the relevant early learning goals within the foundation stage profile. Teachers regularly assessed children's progress in acquiring knowledge of the 44 phonemes (sounds) in the English language and in their ability to use this knowledge to read and spell unfamiliar words. Feedback from the programme suggests the approaches used have led to improvements in the development of phonic knowledge and skills, without compromise to children's wider development. An independent consultant reviewed the work undertaken by schools and early years settings as part of the pilot, looking at areas such as data and the progress made by practitioners and children in following the pilot approaches. This confirmed that there had been a positive impact on children's progress and on practitioners' confidence and expectations of children's attainment.</p>
	<p pid="b.939W.0/3">We are implementing Jim Rose's recommendations through the new primary framework for literacy and mathematics and will be using the outcomes of the pilot to help inform implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.953W.8/5">In 2004, the Department of Trade and Industry, commissioned analysis from the energy consultants E4Tech, Element Energy, and Eoin Lees. This analysis indicates that for the UK, the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel offers significant opportunities for cost-competitive carbon dioxide reduction by 2030. Six different types of transport energy chain have this potential and also offer increased energy security. None is readily available today and each would require significant changes to the energy system. However, they are sufficiently promising to be worth pursuing as energy options for the UK.

	<p pid="b.954W.5/1">Take-up of paid maternity leave is not recorded centrally. It is possible to make an estimate of the numbers of women taking maternity leave based on employer returns to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of the statutory maternity pay (SMP) they recover (from 2003 this covered the first 26 weeks of leave and has recently been extended to 39 weeks in respect of births due from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>). On this basis around 300,000 women currently receive SMP each year, which compares with around 280,000 women in 1998, the first year for which consistent data are available in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.954W.5/4"> <td></td> <td><i> SMP recipients</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.954W.5/14">In addition, there will be some women who will qualify for maternity leave but not SMP (because they do not meet the earnings or length of employment criteria for SMP) and similarly some who qualify for SMP but not leave (because they are employed earners for the purposes of SMP but not employees in order to qualify for leave).</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.5/15">Furthermore employers may offer occupational maternity pay and leave schemes over and above the statutory minimum. Results from the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey indicated that 57 per cent. of all workplaces offered some degree ofpaid extra-statutory maternity leave.</p>

However, the DTI, in conjunction with Ofgem, established the Transmission Working Group (and its predecessor the Transmission Issues Working Group) to monitor progress in identifying and delivering GB-wide grid infrastructure upgrades necessary to accommodate the Government's renewable targets. The DTI is also working closely with the National Grid Company on studies to review the future performance of GB Transmission system with a renewable generation capacity commensurate with achievement of these targets. I hope that the outcome of these studies will be available early in the new year.</p>

We do not have any bilateral contacts with the Union of Islamic Courts, which is not a single entity, but officials take part in multilateral meetings outside Somalia where various of their representatives are present. We continue to urge all parties inside and outside Somalia to refrain from action that could provoke violence, to respect the UN arms embargo on Somalia and to pursue a peaceful resolution through dialogue under the Khartoum process.</p>

	<p pid="b.968W.3/3" class="indent">is worth around &pound;30 billion annually;</p>
	<p pid="b.968W.3/4" class="indent">could create up to 600,000 new jobs; and</p>

	<p pid="b.968W.3/8" class="indent">could create up to 135,000 new jobs; and</p>

	<p pid="b.968W.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials discuss Iran frequently with their US counterparts. They have discussed possible measures, including financial measures, that the international community might have available should Iran not come into compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency Board and UN Security Council resolutions. In resolution 1696, the Security Council made mandatory on Iran a suspension of all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities and expressed its intention to adopt appropriate measures under article 41 of the UN charter if Iran did not comply. Iran has not put in place a full suspension and the 'E3+3' (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) are presently consulting on appropriate measures, as a first step towards wider consultations; decisions have not yet been taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.968W.6/2">Members of the US Administration have also briefed Ministers and officials, including from HM Treasury, on their concern that Iranian-owned banks are being used to facilitate the transfer of funds to organisations involved in terrorism and proliferation related activities. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-08">8 September</phrase>, the US announced that it had taken measures to exclude Bank Saderat from the US financial system, on the grounds of its alleged involvement in transferring funds to terrorist organisations. US officials subsequently travelled to a number of countries, including the UK, to explain the US action and to underline the need for vigilance. The Government take the financing of terrorism and proliferation-related activities extremely seriously and will continue to work closely with the US and other countries to ensure that international financial markets are not abused.</p>

	<p pid="b.974W.11/1">We have always said that we would only convert old scheme cases to the new scheme when it was working well. As part of his proposals for the redesign of the child support system, Sir David Henshaw recommended a radical approach allied to his proposal to create a new organisation. He has proposed that both of the existing schemes are closed down and that people are asked to re-apply to a new, simplified system. We think this has considerable merit and will help ensure that the new organisation is not contaminated by the failures of the past. However, we need to do more analysis to assess the most appropriate way to enable existing clients to either move to private arrangements or make a claim under the new system.</p>
	<p pid="b.974W.11/2">We will still continue, however, to convert cases on the old scheme where they are linked to a new scheme case.</p>

The total number of Pathways starts and NDDP take-up is higher as an individual can have multiple spells on Pathways. 3. It would not be appropriate to infer a precise NDDP take-up rate from the data supplied in this response as it would be an underestimate of the true underlying NDDP take-up rate due to the fact that more recent cases will have had less time to take up NDDP. 4.

	<p pid="b.978W.0/1">The timetable as proposed is designed to broadly keep pace with the projected rises in average life expectancy and so maintain at a roughly constant level the same proportion of adult life spent in receipt of the state pension following the proposed increase in state pension age as set out in the Pensions White Paper Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pensions System.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/2">Our intention is that each increase will be implemented gradually over a two-year period. The first increase from 65 to 66 will be phased in between April 2024 and April 2026; the increases from 66 to 67 and from 67 to 68 will be implemented in the same way, starting from April 2034 and April 2044 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/3">Increasing state pension age with no transitional period would mean that two people born a day apart could have a year between their respective state pension ages, while a more extended transition period would increase complexity. We consider that our proposal, which follows a similar model as will apply to the increases in state pension age for women between 2010 and 2020 under the Pensions Act 1995, strikes a reasonable balance between fairness and simplicity.</p>

We will also assess what the regeneration and other economic outcomes have been.

	<p pid="b.1002W.5/1">Since 1997, there has been considerable progress in tackling exclusion among lone parent households. Provisions in the New Deal for Lone Parents have been successful not only in improving job readiness of lone parents, but also in moving them into work. Indeed, employment rates for this group increased from 45.3 per cent. in 1997 to 56.6 per cent, in 2006. There are now around a million lone parents in work for the first time ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002W.5/2">The Social Exclusion Action Plan announces a series of new demonstration projects to support families at risk of, or already experiencing, social exclusion. One of the guiding principles of the action plan is that we need to move towards more sophisticated approaches for identifying the specific factors which place people at risk of, or protect them from, negative outcomes. This is vital to ensure that programmes are targeted at those who need support most and at those who are likely to benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006W.9/23" class="indent">You will note that in the past five years, almost &pound;1 million has been spent on this road resulting in almost six miles of the A20 being resurfaced or surface dressed. This represents approximately 18 per cent. of the entire budget for the Ards area. This funding has also promoted a variety of other schemes including, carriageway reconstruction, sidelining, drainage, coastal protection, guard rail and traffic calming.

	<p pid="b.1006W.9/24" class="indent">With regard to your two questions on vehicle numbers using the A20, I should explain that Roads Service collects traffic volume data by means of 270 automatic census points strategically located throughout the Northern Ireland road network.

The results are published in Roads Service's Annual Traffic and Travel Information Report, which presents the traffic volumes in a variety of formats for each site.</p>

It sets a maximum commission level of 13.5 per cent. a reduction of 1.5 per cent. on the previous commission rate. There is an expectation that agencies will deliver discounts below this figure. The protocol for the operation of the Framework sets new standards for briefing agencies, setting targets and measuring effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018W.0/1">Sustainable development is a key theme underlying the Government's overall approach to planning in Northern Ireland. This is already recognised in Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 1 'General Principles' and the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland, 'Shaping Our Future'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/2">The key role played by the planning system in the delivery of sustainable development is underpinned by the Planning Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2006. The order 2006 introduced a requirement for development plans and planning policies prepared by DOE to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/3">In addition, there is a range of other planning policies, set out in Planning Policy Statements that also contribute to the delivery of sustainable development. However, the Planning Service has no plans, at present, to amend legislation to introduce sustainability targets for new buildings. An amendment to part F of the Building Regulations (Conservation of Fuel and Power) will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. It will raise energy performance standards, and should reduce carbon emissions by up to 40 per cent., for all new build and major refurbishments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/4">Sustainability is not one of the matters for which building regulations may be made at present. However the principles contained in the Building Regulations (NI) Order 1979 will be amended during 2007 to allow the Department of Finance and Personnel to regulate the promotion of sustainable development. The list of matters on which the Department may regulate will be extended to include the sustainable use and management of water, the re-use and recycling of materials, the use of renewable energy sources, the durability of materials and materials life-cycles and pollution (emissions).</p>

	<p pid="b.1021W.0/2">The potential withdrawal of cancer patients from Hammersmith to Kingston and the Royal Marsden will mean a reduction equivalent to a 20 per cent. drop in patient numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1021W.0/3">The commitment in the NHS Cancer Plan is to provide a target of four linear accelerators per million by 2006. Current radiotherapy centre provision varies between 3.3 to 7.9 per million head of population. The Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust radiotherapy centres currently has six per million head.</p>

This target is supported by a wide ranging programme and includes the &quot;Saving Lives&quot; package of best practice measures all acute trusts have signed up to.

	<p pid="b.1030W.5/1">There are no Green Goddesses available for use in emergencies. Green Goddesses, built in 1953-56, lack the range of advanced fire fighting equipment carried by modern appliances; their acceleration and handling is worse than modern appliances and Green Goddesses only possess low-pressure pumps, whereas modern high-pressure pumps are capable of shooting out a dense spray. The Green Goddess fleet is outdated and we are now able to use modern fire appliances as part of our contingency planning arrangements. The Fire and Rescue National Framework 2006-2008 makes clear that fire and rescue authorities will be responsible for supplying all appliances and equipment in the event of any industrial action.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030W.5/2">The size of the fleet in previous years was: <i> (a)</i> 1,085 in 1997; <i> (b)</i> 1,040 in 2001; <i> (c) </i>975 in 2005. These figures include Green Goddesses held by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Scotland and 'Yellow' Goddesses for Northern Ireland.</p>

This estimate is based on summary claims submitted by local authorities to the National Asylum Support Service in spring 2006 for reimbursement of the costs of supporting them. A precise figure can not be determined on this basis as some local authorities will have received separate funding, not from the Home Office, for a small number of accompanied children who have been taken into care.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045W.2/1">Vehicle crime, including both theft of and theft from motor vehicles, is addressed in the Milton Keynes Community Safety Partnership's (CSP) overall strategy for crime reduction, which is supported by a detailed Police Basic Command Unit (BCU) Crime Reduction Plan. The CSP continues to target vehicle crime through enforcement, prevention, intelligence and communication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.2/2">Police operations have been targeted both at known offenders and at those areas where offences have been committed. These have been supported by regular dedicated automatic number plate recognition operations and the daily use of this technology by the Thames Valley Police Roads Policing Department in the Milton Keynes area. The CSP has also made effective use of CCTV, and has both a fixed and a mobile capability to target known 'hotspot' locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.2/3">There are currently 45 adult offenders on the Milton Keynes Prolific and Priority Offenders scheme, receiving intensive supervision by both the police and probation service. Of these, 23 have offending histories of, or current links to, vehicle crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.2/4">The CSP and police have undertaken a number of actions to raise awareness of vehicle crime and advise the public on how to protect their property. For instance, as more than 20 per cent. of vehicle crime in Milton Keynes since January 2006 has been associated with satellite navigation systems, specific communications activity has taken place to raise public awareness and reduce offending opportunities. In the longer term the partnership continues to seek to improve the overall security of its car parks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1045W.2/5">At a national level, officials have produced a crime prevention leaflet on the internet aimed specifically at theft of satellite navigation devices and have liaised with four of the biggest manufacturers, resulting in the introduction of improved security features in a number of devices that have recently come on the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.1050W.5/1">Accountability for the IMPACT programme is vested in the senior responsible owner, a Home Office director who is also chief executive (designate) of the National Policing Improvement Agency. The SRO is accountable to the Secretary of State through the responsible director general and the permanent secretary. He is advised by a steering group on which the main stakeholder interests are represented at a senior level. The programme is governed by a Programme Board chaired by a representative of the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050W.5/2">The IMPACT programme has produced a number of business cases covering the development of the IMPACT nominal index, which has subsequently been delivered to forces and is proving to be a valuable tool in child protection work; the Cross-Regional Information Sharing Project (CRISP), which is currently in the early stages of a competitive procurement exercise; and the Police National Database (PND), which is due to be delivered in 2010. The Home Office has yet to give approval to the programme to contract for the CRISP service and to initiate procurement of the PND pending further work which is due to be concluded in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050W.5/3">The cost of producing the business cases cannot be disaggregated from other programme costs without disproportionate cost. The total cost of the IMPACT programme is &pound;31 million in 2005-06, and &pound;45 million (budget) in the current financial year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1050W.8/1">Home Office officials attended a meeting with the police, representatives from the hospital and forensic medical examiners from Kent in May this year, to discuss the future of the Darent Valley Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC). They advised those present that the SARC model provides the highest level of support for victims of sexual violence. It was on this basis that a start-up grant of &pound;30,000 was provided by the Home Office to Kent police in 2003-04. The ongoing running costs of a SARC are the responsibility of local police forces and primary care trusts, and national service guidelines have been produced for these organisations on developing and sustaining SARCs.</p>

In addition, the sale of donated goods by a non-profit-making organisation or a charity subsidiary is zero rated when any profits from the sale are transferred to a charity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1075W.11/3">Under agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs throughout the EU, successive Governments have agreed with European partners not to extend any existing VAT zero rates or introduce any new ones. The scope of the exemptions from VAT and reduced rates is also limited by European VAT agreements. It is therefore not possible for the Government to introduce any new VAT zero rates, or to extend the existing exemption for fundraising supplies. Similarly, our European VAT agreements would not allow a reduced rate of VAT that applied only to sales of merchandise by non-profit-making organisations on behalf of charities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1077W.12/2">HMRC's policy is set out in CoP26, &quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit.&quot; When HMRC seek recovery of an overpayment they seek to do so in a manner which will not put a family in financial difficulty. PBR 2005 announced that from November 2006 HMRC will apply automatic limits on recovery of excess amounts paid where awards are adjusted in-year following a reported change. These limits will be the same as the current limits on cross-year overpayment recovery, and will ensure that no low- to middle-income family faces unexpected reductions in tax credit payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1082W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/2">The &quot;Cross-Government Review of Water Affordability Report&quot; was published in December 2004. It concluded that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/3" class="indent">(i) that the Vulnerable Group's Regulations should be extended to increase eligibility, with measures put in place to increase take-up;</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/4" class="indent">(ii) a local scale pilot scheme should be set up to target water affordability assistance to lower income households;</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/5" class="indent">(iii) and that companies, Government and Ofwat should investigate the likely distributional consequences of costs for water consumers and the case for suitable tariff changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/6">Work is continuing on these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/7">The Vulnerable Groups Regulations are intended to offer targeted protection to customers with particularly low incomes, who have water meters and who use large amounts of water for essential purposes. This includes families with three or more children, and people with specified medical conditions who are on income-related benefits. Following a review and consultation, the criteria for eligibility were amended from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The criteria now include a more inclusive list of qualifying medical conditions and families with three or more children in full time education under the age of 19. In July, DEFRA held a workshop, attended by water companies and other interested stakeholders, to promote good practice in administrating the tariff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/8">A pilot study is currently under way in the South West which is looking at the combined impacts of several measures on water affordability, including benefit entitlement checks, meter installation and water efficiency measures. We expect the results of the pilot study in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1082W.11/9">DEFRA is also working with water companies and Ofwat to look at the distributional impact of tariffs on low income households. We expect the results of this work towards the end of 2006.</p>
