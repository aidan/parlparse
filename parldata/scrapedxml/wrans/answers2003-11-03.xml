	<p pid=".387W.3/1">The Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Nottinghamshire is a very active member of the Local Criminal Justice Board and chairs two of its sub groups. One of these, which includes Victim Support, has engineered considerable improvements for dealing with vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The group are now pioneering a system to provide updates and guidance to victims about their cases.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.3/2">The Chief Crown Prosecutor also leads a group which is working on ways to improve communications between the agencies and the community. A regular bi-monthly bulletin is to be published for MPs and community groups which will explain the work of the board and the progress it is making in dealing with the offences that disrupt and disturb local communities. On behalf of the board, the Chief Crown Prosecutor is also leading an initiative to ensure all schools in Nottinghamshire are aware of the work and structure of the Local Criminal Justice Board.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.3/3">The Crown Prosecution Service is also a major contributor to the board's delivery group which is tasked with narrowing the justice gap, bringing more persistent offenders to justice, and decreasing the cracked and ineffective trial rate.</p>

	<p pid=".392W.3/1">Section 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 states that the Lord Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, can, by means of a practice direction, determine the cases or classes of cases suitable for allocation to High Court Judges, Circuit Judges and Recorders. From time to time successive Lord Chief Justices have issued such practice directions. In October 2001, the current Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, issued a practice direction entitled 'Directions by the Lord Chief Justice for the Classification of the business of the Crown Court and Allocation to Crown Court Centres'. This Practice Direction again determined that all High Court Judges and those Circuit Judges and Recorders, approved for that purpose by the Senior Presiding Judge, with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, can hear rape cases.</p>
	<p pid=".392W.3/2">Judges trying rape cases are, of course, under constant public scrutiny. Where problems about judicial conduct become apparent to the Court of Appeal, the papers are referred to the relevant Presiding Judge, or to the Senior Presiding Judge personally. Any complaints, as well as any information suggesting possible inappropriate judicial behaviour, are immediately investigated, and reports in the media of judicial behaviour which, if correct, would give rise to concern, are checked for correctness and completeness by the Presiding Judges. It is, of course, open to the Lord Chief Justice, acting on his own initiative, or on the recommendation of the Senior Presiding Judge, to remove any individual authorisation. The Lord Chief Justice has not had occasion to do this in the last two years.</p>

	<p pid=".394W.14/1">Following proposals from the Commission, the countries of the South-East Europe electricity market signed a Memorandum of Understanding&mdash;the Athens Memorandum&mdash;in November 2002 which would create a single electricity market in the area by 2005, with rules reflecting those of the EU's internal market.

	<p pid=".395W.0/1">The DTI is promoting the use of information technology solutions in a number of ways, both in conveying key messages to the business community and in the way the Department itself enables its own business processes.UK Online for Business was launched in September 2000 with the aim of promoting the benefits of information and communication technologies. The programme provides impartial advice on how e-business can help businesses reduce costs and increase efficiency by integrating their internal processes and working with customers and suppliers online. This core use of ICT and the more specific usage of e-business technologies to engage, for example, in e-procurement, accounts and collaborative design will provide business with the real potential to reduce and replace paper work.</p>

The ECO has also recently introduced a facility to enable applications to be made over the Internet.</p>

Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office for Government Commerce. This contract provides a call-off arrangement for DTI users at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is the total expenditure with DTI's main suppliers of mobile telephony.

	<p pid=".397W.5/1">The Clear Skies criterion does not stipulate the use of a digital thermometer where a differential temperature controller is used that can be set to limit the temperature of the water in the cylinder. Systems that do not employ this type of controller are required to use a digital thermometer as these give the clearest indication the system is working efficiently and also due to the high temperatures that can be reached give the most accurate temperature readings, therefore acting as a safety device to ensure individuals do not touch the system in error and get burnt in the process.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.0/1">I am not planning to extend the provisions of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003 to Northern Ireland or to introduce equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has made it a requirement on Health and Social Services Boards to invest part of the annual additional allocations for community care services to ensure timely discharge from acute care in hospital. Furthermore the Secretary of State's Draft Priorities and Budget paper, which is currently out for consultation, proposes a new target for the Health and Personal Social Services designed to reduce the maximum waiting time for community care services for people who are medically fit for discharge so that by March 2006 no assessed person should wait for more than eight weeks in an acute hospital, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.5/2">The Government has introduced disadvantaged areas relief which provides an exemption from stamp duty land tax for transactions in non-residential land in Enterprise Areas. There are 237 wards in Northern Ireland which qualify for this relief, representing the bottom 42 per cent. of areas in the national index of deprivation. The measure provides a major boost to businesses investing in commercial premises in Northern Ireland.</p>

The UK provided financial assistance worth &pound;21.25 million in order to support the new regime's commitment to tackle drugs production but it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to administer the system of payments. We understand from the Afghan authorities that they provided compensation of $1,750 per hectare. Information about the total number of farmers who took part is not available.

	<p pid=".410W.6/2">We submitted papers to the European Commission in support of our case for further changes to the DBES and our request for restrictions to be lifted so that the UK can trade on the same basis as other member states in April 2003 and June 2003 respectively. These papers as updated are currently being considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In addition, we have extended the period of rebates on DBES eligibility checks and Meat Hygiene Service supervision charges until the end of June 2004 for slaughterhouses entering the Scheme before the end of 2003. We have also identified with industry a number of key markets so that lobbying can be targetted effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.5/3">All but the smallest Defra sites work to reducing energy below a site-specific benchmark. Energy audits are regularly commissioned for those above benchmark and remedial action is taken as necessary, On-going energy efficiency awareness campaigns seek co-operation from staff in economy of use.</p>

	<p pid=".411W.5/103"><sup>(6)</sup> All data for fossil/heating energy is weather corrected to the 1990&ndash;91 20 year degree day average This is for consistency sincere old campaign was weather corrected to the 1990&ndash;91 20 year average and the new campaign to the 1999&ndash;00 20 year average. This explains any differences between these figures and those published in the new campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/104"><sup>(7)</sup> The Cabinet Office had four agencies transferred out of its control between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/105"><sup>(8)</sup> The Cabinet Office had nine Regional Government Offices transferred to its estate between 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/106"><sup>(9)</sup> Previously the Lord Chancellor's Department</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/107"><sup>(10)</sup> The Department for Culture, Media and Sport have inconsistencies in their data for 2000&ndash;01 and so 2001&ndash;02 was used as their base year for the new campaign. This explains why their figures are the same for 1999&ndash;2000 to 2001&ndash;02 These inconsistencies also mean it is not meaningful to compare 2001&ndash;02 with data prior to 1999&ndash;2000</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/108"><sup>(11)</sup> DFES use some heat that is produced by a CCL exempt source. This has been included with the fossil fuel</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/109"><sup>(12)</sup> Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs energy performances for the Main Estate and Laboratories in 2001&ndash;02 include consumptions from the additional buildings and longer worked hours by staff dealing with the foot and mouth emergency The Main Estate also reflected additional fully air-conditioned buildings as part of a new Agency in DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/110"><sup>(13)</sup> The Department for International Development moved offices during 2001&ndash;02, therefore their floor area for this year has been calculated based on the proportion of the year they were in each office</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/111"><sup>(14)</sup> The Department for Trade and Industry had 3 Regional Government Offices transferred out of their estate in 2001&ndash;02</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/112"><sup>(15)</sup> The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions previously known as Department for the environment, Transport and the Regions.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/113"><sup>(16)</sup> The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions had six Regional Government Offices transferred out of their estate in 2001&ndash;02</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/114"><sup>(17)</sup> The Department for Work and Pensions is the result of an amalgamation of the Department of Social Security and Employment Services which occurred in full in April 2002. Therefore previous separate returns for the two departments have been added together to allow comparison.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/115"><sup>(18)</sup> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office returns for 2000&ndash;01 include their Wilton Park executive agency for the first time. This accounts for approximately 4 per cent. of the increase.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/116"><sup>(19)</sup> In 2000&ndash;01 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office brought back into use the Old Admiralty Building, progressively relocating staff from 8 Cleveland Row, Cromwell House, 1 Palace Street and 20 Victoria Street. It retained reporting responsibilities for the vacated buildings until March 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/117"><sup>(20)</sup> It was not possible to report consistently on a small proportion of prisons throughout the three years This was mainly due to missing or incomplete data on those specific prisons.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/118"><sup>(21)</sup> Inland Revenue 1999&ndash;2000 data was fell to be too inconsistent to be used in the comparison, therefore 2000&ndash;01 has been used in its place.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/119"><sup>(22)</sup> The Army included energy consumption from overseas bases other than Germany for the first time in 2001&ndash;02; therefore this is entered separately</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/120"><sup>(23)</sup> For the new campaign the financial year 2001&ndash;02 is the baseline for the Army and this figure has been applied retrospectively to 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 but with energy consumption from 2 sites of the Joint Helicopter Command (Odiham and Benson) removed from the 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01. This therefore takes into account the fact that these two sites were transferred from the RAF to the Army in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/121">Actual figures for these two sites have been used since they were recorded by the RAF prior to their transfer, hence the Army retrospective figure is not the same across these three years.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/122"><sup>(24)</sup> The Civil estate of the MOD figures do not include the London offices, with the exception of 3&ndash;5 Scotland Yard This is due to difficulties in obtaining the data as these buildings are run under PFI contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/123"><sup>(25)</sup> The civil estate of the MOD have not been able to provide figures prior to 2001&ndash;02, therefore this is being used in previous years to allow comparisons 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 have been entered using figures from the last year the Civil estate completed a return</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/124"><sup>(26)</sup> Defence Logistics Organisation were not in existence prior to 2000&ndash;01, therefore the figures for 2000&ndash;01 have been used in 1999&ndash;2000 to allow comparison</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/125"><sup>(27)</sup> In July 2001 the Defence Research Agency was split into DSTL and a private company, QinetiQ Therefore since July 2001 consumption in buildings used by QinetiQ have not been included</p>
	<p pid=".411W.5/126"><sup>(28)</sup> The RAF have made significant savings in 2001&ndash;02 in part due to the transfer of two Joint Helicopter Command sites (Odiham and Benson) to the Army in April 2001</p>

	<p pid=".415W.2/1">Government's targets and goals include the following:</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/2">On climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy efficiency <i>(e, u, a),</i> the UK Climate Change Programme is designed to deliver our Kyoto Protocol target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&ndash;12, as well as set us on a path towards our domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2010. The Government stated in the Energy White Paper our expectation for more than half the emissions reductions in the Programme to come from energy efficiency. In the White Paper, the Government also accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's recommendation that the UK should put itself on a path towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/3">For renewable energy and wind power use <i>(f, q)</i> the Government's aim is that by 2010, 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity should be supplied from renewable sources and our aspiration is that by 2020, to double renewables' share of electricity from our 2010 target. There are currently no specific targets for particular forms of renewable energy such as wind power.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/4">On fuel poverty <i>(o)</i> the goal of the Government and Devolved Administrations is the eradication of fuel poverty as far as reasonably practicable by 2016&ndash;18, and in England and Wales for vulnerable households by 2010. In addition, in England we have a target to reduce fuel poverty among vulnerable households by improving the energy efficiency of 600,000 homes between 2001 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/5">For domestic waste management, recycling and landfill <i>(l, r, t)</i> the targets are to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&ndash;04 and 25 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06 and, from the Landfill Directive, by 2010 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995; by 2013 to 50 per cent. and by 2020 to 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/6">For waste minimisation and incineration <i>(b, k)</i> there are no set targets, but Government policy is to drive waste management up the waste hierarchy; this hierarchy has landfill at the bottom and minimisation at the top.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/7">For packaging <i>(h),</i> current (2002 and 2003) targets are 59 per cent. for recovery and 19 per cent. for material-specific recycling. A consultation on targets for 2004&ndash;08 has just closed.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/8">For the disposal of hazardous waste and industrial waste <i>(j, s)</i>, the Waste Strategy 2000 set a target to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of the 1998 level by 2005. This target includes hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/9">On end of life vehicles, the End of Life Vehicles Directive has not yet entered into force in the UK. The main targets will be 85 per cent. of all ELVs reused or recovered and 80 per cent. reused or recycled by January 2006, rising to 95 per cent. reused or recovered and 85 per cent. reused or recycled in 2015.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/10">There are currently no targets for fly-tipping <i>(g)</i>.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/11">For air quality <i>(d)</i>, the Air Quality Strategy sets targets for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particles, sulphur dioxide, benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/12">For water quality <i>(m)</i>, the Government has targets that at least 91 per cent. of English rivers achieve their river quality targets by 2005; and that at least 97 per cent. of bathing waters in England meet the mandatory coliform standards in the 2005 bathing season.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/13">For marine pollution <i>(c)</i>, the targets for reducing and eliminating marine pollution are generally those set out in the strategies on hazardous substances, radioactive substances and eutrophication agreed in the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic and relevant EC Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/14">For coastal erosion and flood defence <i>(n, p)</i>, targets are to aim, by the encouragement of sustainable defence measures (including timely and effective flood warning systems), to have no loss of life through flooding; and by investing &pound;397 million over the Spending Review period (2003&ndash;06), to reduce the risk of flooding to life, to major infrastructure, environment assets and to some 80,000 houses.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.2/15">On timber procurement <i>(v)</i> the UK Government are committed to, seek to procure products made from timber that has been legally felled and grown in a forest or plantation managed to sustain biodiversity, productivity, vitality and to prevent harm to other ecosystems and indigenous or forest dependent people. Targets for sustainable public procurement will be published in early 2004 as part of the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate.</p>

Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services covers a wide range of services totalling more than &pound;10 billion each year.

Grant paid to all authorities in England (in cash terms) is set out as follows. The figures in the table include items such as contributions to the Environment Agency for their work on flood warning including public awareness, catchment flood management plans and the new National Flood and Coastal Defence Database. They exclude supplementary credit approvals for local authorities and grant for projects to manage coastal erosion although significant flood risk benefits often arise from the latter.</p>

In addition, where timber is used, Defra encourages operating authorities to obtain tropical and native timbers from certified and sustainable sources.</p>

That report was made in the light of consultations with stakeholders, primarily at a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-25">25 March 2002</phrase>. A second consultation meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-02">2 September 2002</phrase> and written comments were received from various interested parties too.

	<p pid=".426W.8/1">Although recent attacks in Iraq have received wide coverage, we should not forget that much of the country is remarkably stable. The vast majority of attacks against the coalition are concentrated in a limited area in and to the North West of Baghdad. Coalition forces, under US leadership, are working hard to counter these threats and will not be deflected from that mission. Across the country, meanwhile, increasing numbers of Iraqi police are on patrol, reconstruction continues and normal civil activities are pursued without incident.</p>

Goods and services provided to the department or other agency or authority having policy and therefore financial responsibility should be charged for unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".430W.2/22">In 2001 MOD simplified its charging regime in the UK for MACC assistance, allowing emergency assistance to be given free where there is a danger to life (rather than only &quot;immediate&quot; danger which applied previously), and at full cost once the danger has passed. Emergency MACC is a rapid response by the Services to sudden disaster. Search and rescue tasks in support of the UK Ambulance Authorities for Medevac transfers, attract a charge at the &quot;no-loss cost&quot; rate, that is levied by the MOD to recover its out of pocket expenses. The basis for other charges for search and rescue tasks is currently under review.</p>

I discussed the improvement of European military capabilities, in particular the creation of a European Defence Agency for capability development, with my EU counterparts at the Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers in Rome on 3&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">4 October</phrase>.</p>

Commanding Officers on all RN ships are given guidance on the threat, and on recommended courses of action. Responses to individual incidents of maritime armed crime in territorial waters are a matter for the State which holds jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.3/1">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) wrote to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence in March 2001 about allegations of fraud in connection with a sub-contractor to BAE Systems. The SFO informed the Permanent Secretary that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal investigation of the fraud allegations, but wished to bring it to his attention in case Government money might be involved. The Permanent Secretary established that the allegations were not of direct relevance to the Ministry of Defence, as they related to the role of a sub-contractor (Robert Lee International) to BAE Systems, and Government money had not been involved. Having been informed, however, that the Chairman of BAE Systems was already aware of this matter, the Permanent Secretary raised it with the Chairman, in the context of the Government's robust anti-fraud policy, for any further inquiries he deemed appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.3/2">Since the allegations of fraud were not a matter for the Ministry of Defence, it was not considered necessary to bring them to the attention of the Secretary of State. Ministers and officials at the Ministry of Defence have discussed issues related to Saudi Arabia with representatives of BAE Systems on numerous occasions since 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".439W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.3/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is extending the range of tools that social landlords can use to tackle anti-social behaviour. These include broadening the range of landlords who can take out injunctions against tenants who behave in an anti-social manner, introducing a power for social landlords to demote secure and assured tenants to a less favourable form of tenancy, and generally ensuring that the responses to anti-social behaviour are appropriately focused on the needs of the community. In addition, social landlords will be required to prepare and publish policies and procedures in relation to anti-social behaviour, which will be available to tenants and other residents.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.3/3">It is the responsibility of social landlords to ensure that they use the appropriate enforcement measure to address the variety of anti-social behaviour cases that may arise. However, the general purpose of the measures in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill is to encourage and facilitate social landlords taking a more active approach in their dealings with anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.3/4">The definition of anti-social behaviour used in Part 2 of the Anti-social Behaviour Bill refers to conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance rather than behaviour which has actually caused nuisance or annoyance to named individuals. This makes it clear that landlords can use evidence from people other than the direct victims of the behaviour in proceedings for injunctions or demotion orders. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hopes that this will encourage more social landlords to be proactive in their management of such behaviour, for example by using professional witnesses in situations where individual victims are too scared or intimidated to give evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.3/5">Regarding the specific case mentioned, it does not have any significant implications for the Anti-social Behaviour Action Plan, as the judgment is specific to that case. However, the broadening of injunctive powers included within the Anti-social Behaviour Bill mentioned earlier should make it easier for registered social landlords, including Tower Hamlets Community Homes, to undertake successful court action.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.3/1">The Government believes that there should be no change in the law relating to anonymity. In our view, informed and strengthened guidance to the police and the media is preferable to any change in legislation. The Police Code of Conduct provides that information which comes into the possession of the police should be treated as confidential. It should not be used for personal benefit and neither should it be divulged to other parties except in the proper course of police duty. Unauthorised disclosure of information on a suspect by a police officer is likely to be considered a breach of this Code. Such a breach would mean that an officer's conduct had not met the appropriate standard for the purposes of the Police (Conduct) Regulations, and disciplinary proceedings might commence. An officer could face dismissal or even prosecution, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

Similarly, Ministers are in discussion with media representatives to assess how unhelpful or intrusive reporting of such cases can be avoided with a view to amending and strengthening the Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice.

	<p pid=".441W.2/2">The Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative funded 684 CCTV schemes across England and Wales. The main areas covered by these schemes were town centres/shopping centres, car parks, residential areas, community shopping areas, hospitals, and rail stations.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/3">Under the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas (SRDA) Initiative, &pound;15 million was provided to improve security of small retailers, including the provision of CCTV where appropriate. In year one of the initiative (2001&ndash;02) approximately 50 per cent. of the projects involved the installation or upgrading of CCTV in either individual shop units or covering shopping parades or precincts. In year two (2002&ndash;03) it rose to almost 70 per cent. and in year three (2003&ndash;04) it is 63 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/4">Both the CCTV and SRDA Initiatives are fully committed and drawing to a close. Future CCTV schemes can be financed through the Building Safer Communities (BSC) Fund, which is used to strategically tackle local crime reduction priorities through a number of interventions including CCTV. For 2003&ndash;04 the fund provided local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships with &pound;72.3million.</p>
	<p pid=".441W.2/5">Section 5 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires the responsible authorities of the CDRP to work in co-operation with other bodies, including education, in completing a crime and disorder audit and strategy. This engagement should ensure access to funding if it is considered a priority for the area. The CDRP can then consider whether installing CCTV cameras in schools and town centres fits with its local priorities.</p>

Broadly, the NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of crimes recorded by the police.

	<p pid=".443W.9/1">The Government takes very seriously the issue of trafficking people for sexual exploitation. At present, the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 contains an offence of trafficking for prostitution, which makes it an offence, punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment, to traffic someone (whether an adult or a child) into or out of the United Kingdom for the purposes of exploiting them in prostitution.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.9/2">The Sexual Offences Bill, introduced into the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-28">28 January 2003</phrase> proposes new comprehensive offences of trafficking for sexual exploitation to replace the stop-gap offence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. These new offences tackle the movement of people into, within and out of the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and will also carry maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment. The offence relating to trafficking within the UK applies equally to UK nationals trafficked from place to place in the UK, and to foreign nationals brought here and then moved around from place to place within the UK. This is the first time that the trafficking of UK nationals within the UK has been tackled in legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.9/3">Internationally, we are committed to addressing the issue of trafficking by our involvement with the EU Framework Decision on combating the trafficking of human beings, and the UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".443W.9/4">We believe 14 years is the appropriate maximum penalty for trafficking an adult or child. This is the highest determinate penalty available to the courts and we consider that it provides a proportionate response to the range of criminal behaviour involved in trafficking. Where the trafficked person is also subjected to a sexual or violent offence, this can be charged in its own right and the offender will then additionally be liable for the penalties that attach to those offences.</p>

Changes in financial recording systems from 2001 mean that it is no longer possible, without disproportionate cost, to separate the cost of Ministerial from non-Ministerial offices. Consequently this figure is not directly comparable with those provided prior to 2001&ndash;02, which did not include the cost of the offices of the Permanent Secretary, the Director General, Resources and Performance, Special Advisers, as well as the Typing Centre and the Ministerial Briefing Unit, which was largely created by bringing together existing staff in other Directorates.

We have addressed these concerns by taking independent expert advice and setting up a long-term research programme. The experts concluded that it was unlikely that TETRA technology could pose a risk to health, and this has been confirmed by the research results to date.

In its first year of operation, over &pound;31 million has been distributed through the Community Fund's grants programmes targeted at fair share areas; grants of between &pound;200,000 and &pound;2.2 million have been committed under the New Opportunities Fund's 'fair share: transforming your space' programme; and a &pound;50 million fair share Trust has been set up, to be delivered by the Community Foundation Network. The programme has achieved 90 per cent. of its projected funding target for 2002&ndash;03. Now that these building blocks are in place, I expect to see a steady increase in the flow of funding over the remaining two years of the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.0/1">The assessment of the cost and benefit implications of bidding for and staging the Olympics and Paralympic Games in London in 2012 undertaken by Arup in May 2003, drawing on London Tourist Board figures, projected up to 200,000 rooms in hotels/guest houses as potentially available within International Olympic Committee (IOC) visitor travel time requirements of one hour.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.0/2">Detailed information on accommodation is required by the IOC for the applicant city questionnaire, and London 2012 Ltd., the company set up to prepare the Olympic bid, are undertaking further work to verify and refine these figures. We would look to the LDA, working in partnerships with local authorities, agencies and businesses, to consider what action or investment they might take, including the development of their existing tourism infrastructure, to capture the benefits from the Olympics.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.6/1">We are not aware of any such classification. In November 2002, the London Development Agency (LDA) report 'Improving the Quality of Visitor Accommodation in London' (commissioned by DCMS) estimated that 38 per cent. of London's serviced accommodation establishments were covered by the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) schemes for serviced accommodation. The LDA is working hard to encourage further subscription. The report also found that 57 per cent. of hotel rooms in London belonged to branded hotel chains.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.6/2">This Department is committed to raising accommodation quality through the NQAS schemes, and through supporting skills and training in the industry. To tackle under-performing establishments that are ineligible for NQAS, we are currently piloting a 'Fitness for Purpose' initiative in six local authorities, including the London boroughs of Greenwich and Camden. The aim is to help failing accommodation providers to meet minimum legal requirements on health and safety, food hygiene, trading standards and fire safety.</p>

	<p pid=".454W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/2">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Competition and Consumers (Mr. Sutcliffe), represented the UK at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-20">20 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/3">The Council held a public debate on the Commission Communication on Immigration, Integration and Employment.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/4">The UK stated that immigration alone would not solve Europe's demographic problem and that the Employment Strategy provided the appropriate framework for improving the participation of immigrants in the labour market. Several delegations argued that member states should meet their demand for additional labour from national and European sources before seeking immigrants from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/5">On integrating immigrants, the UK stressed the need to provide language, skills and citizenship training for recent and next generation immigrants to prevent social exclusion and burdens on the public purse and argued that a job was the best means of social integration.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/6">The Council adopted Conclusions on the open method of co-ordination of adequate and sustainable pensions. There will be a progress report to the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase> about pensions indicators.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/7">The Council reached political agreement on a Directive protecting workers from the risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves, as well as on the decision to renew the spending programme to prevent and combat violence against women, young people and children (Daphne II). The UK supported both decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/8">The Council agreed an orientation towards political agreement on Chapters 7 and 8 of Regulation 1408/71 on social security coordination. The chapters cover pre-retirement benefits and family benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/9">The Council agreed an orientation towards a political agreement on a Regulation amending Regulation 1408/71 to align provisions in readiness for the launch of European Health Card in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/10">The Council approved the opinion of the Social Protection Committee on a Commission Communication on streamlining open co-ordination in the field of social protection.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/11">The Council adopted without discussion a resolution on transforming undeclared work into regular employment in the context of the European Employment Strategy, and a resolution encouraging member states to consider the provision of various services for victims of trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/12">Under Any Other Business, the Belgians presented a short paper on Growth and Competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/13">No Health or Consumer Affairs items were on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.6/14">No votes were taken at this Council.</p>

	<p pid=".456W.0/1">No assessment has been made of the implications of access to fieldwork in schools for the promotion of environmental awareness. It is important to note, however, that there are requirements for Education for Sustainable Development both in Geography and in Science, including science GCSE and AS/A Level qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/2">Although the National Curriculum is not designed to provide vocational training, under the proposed 14&ndash;19 reforms set out in the Green Paper 'Excellence and Opportunity', young people would have greater flexibility in selecting their options, and may choose to pursue courses which cover environmental impacts.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/3">No assessment has been made of whether the encouragement of fieldwork as a teaching method is adequately supported by teacher training courses. However, under the standards for qualified teacher status and requirements for initial teacher training, teacher trainers use non-school settings such as fieldwork, visits to museums and other off-site locations. All newly qualified teachers are now required to be able to plan opportunities for pupils to learn in out-of-school contexts. Teacher training providers can also take trainees' prior achievement into account. This means, for example, that a trainee teacher who has previously worked in a fieldwork centre can have this experience taken into account when their training needs are assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/4">In addition to this, we anticipate that, over time, our new Science Learning Centres, the preferred suppliers for six of which along with a national centre were recently announced, will help science teachers and technicians to develop their skills in out of the classroom teaching.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/5">No assessment has been made of the Growing Schools Programme providing an alternative to out of classroom activity for Science GCSE or 'A' level biology because it is not an alternative. Growing Schools supports teachers in using the outdoors for teaching subjects across the curriculum for pupils of all ages, including in Science GCSE and Biology A level.</p>
	<p pid=".456W.0/6">The Department's Sustainable Action Plan for Education and Skills does not specify the need for out of classroom activity as part of the National Curriculum. However the Geography programmes of study at Key Stages 1, 2 and 3 do specify the requirement for all pupils to carry out fieldwork investigations outside the classroom.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.2/2">Many primary teachers already receive non-contact time as part of their regular timetable. As a result of the National Agreement on raising standards and tackling workload, all teachers will be entitled to 10 per cent. guaranteed time for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.2/3">The costs of implementing this contractual change in primary schools will vary. Many schools have already done so; others will need to take a rigorous look at how they use their existing resources. The more radical approach a school takes in pursuing workforce reform, the lower the cost is likely to be. Schools that abandon unnecessary tasks; reform their use of support staff; maximise the contribution of ICT and reduce reliance on expensive supply teachers will be able to deliver guaranteed PPA time from their base budgets.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.2/4">The announcement, on <phrase class="date" code="">29 October</phrase>, of a package of measures to deliver greater stability in school budgets for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 will also help primary schools plan for the introduction of guaranteed PPA time.</p>

	<p pid=".459W.9/1">In September 2003, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport and I launched an Action Plan to encourage more children to walk, cycle and take the bus to school where it is safe for them to do so. We are encouraging all schools to put in place School Travel Plans, which will be developed jointly by schools, parents, local authorities and others. Safety will be an important consideration, and my Department is providing capital funding which can be used for safety related changes to school premises. Outside school premises, local authority highways departments are responsible for road safety and are an integral part of the school travel planning process.</p>
	<p pid=".459W.9/2">Local education authorities arrange home to school transport where they consider it is necessary for pupils to get to school. In deciding on appropriate provision, they must consider several matters including pupils' ages and the nature of their routes to school. In &quot;Travelling to School: an Action Plan&quot;, we set out proposals to encourage local authorities to trial innovative school transport arrangements, and we identified pupils travelling along routes that their parents consider unsafe as a group who could benefit from exemplar schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".460W.5/2">The Department for Work and Pensions believe that most people moving from one job to another will be able to manage until they receive payment from their new job, as wages are paid in arrears. For those in receipt of working tax credit, continuity of payment is maintained when people move from one job to another, as long as the gap between jobs is no more than seven days. The new working tax credit has been extended to people aged 25 and over without children. If people receive the child tax credit, this continues to be paid direct to the main carer throughout any changes in employment. People in low paid employment may also be entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".460W.5/3">People who are unable to manage while waiting for payment of wages, leading to a serious risk to their own health or safety or that of their family, may be able to get an interest free Crisis Loan. Repayment of a Crisis Loan does not start until the period of crisis is over and the rate of repayment takes account of a person's income and other commitments to avoid hardship.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.0/1">Student loans are not commercial loans. The Government uprates the value of the outstanding loan in line with the general rate of inflation, to make sure that all borrowers pay back the same amount that they borrowed in real terms. We understand that some students believe that this precludes them from taking out such a loan. However, a recent survey of students by religious group, conducted for the report &quot;Minority Ethnic Students in Higher Education&quot;, found that 64 per cent. of Muslims reported having a student loan; that was only slightly less than Hindu groups (66 per cent.), Sikh groups (66 per cent.) and Christian groups (69 per cent.) <sup>1</sup></p>
	<p pid=".461W.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has met representatives from the Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase> to discuss their concerns regarding student loans. Officials from my Department have also held further discussions with FOSIS representatives recently and will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.3/1">The similar geography of teenage pregnancy and deprivation suggests that while there is still much work to do, the encouraging 10 per cent. decline in England's under 18 conception rate from 1998 to 2001 has been largely achieved through targeted work in deprived localities with high numbers of conceptions by:</p>
	<p pid=".461W.3/2" class="indent">The allocation of funding to teenage pregnancy partnerships based on teenage pregnancy rates.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.3/3" class="indent">The use of research and toolkits to address the needs of vulnerable groups. For example, &quot;Teenage Pregnancy and Neighbourhood Renewal: Learning from New Deal for Communities&quot; which details good practice in new deal for community areas and share the main learning points from that practice.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.3/4" class="indent">New deal for communities and other neighbourhood renewal pathfinder programmes are given support and guidance in tackling teenage pregnancy as an issue through learning events and written guidance.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.3/6" class="indent">The development of a programme of work to improve our understanding of the relationship between teenage pregnancy and socio-economic factors.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.3/7">The association between deprivation and teenage pregnancy is well established and reflected in the under 18 conception rates for local authorities across England. To achieve its national targets of halving the under 18 conception rate and reducing the inequality in rates between wards by at least 25 per cent. by 2010, the teenage pregnancy strategy must focus its work on deprived areas with high conception rates.</p>

The gold sales between July 1999 and March 2002 reflected a prudent decision to reduce over-exposure to a single asset in the net reserves portfolio. Thus, the difference between these two figures quoted do not represent the real financial impact of the sales, as the proceeds from the gold sales were invested in euro, dollar and yen interest-bearing assets that have also increased in value over this period. The gold sales reduced risk by around 30 per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term; the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.5/1">Pension credit is designed to target more money on the poorest pensioners and to reward those making modest provision for their retirement. Where an individual has disposed of capital, consideration may be given as to whether the expenditure was reasonable in the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.5/2">The main purpose of this is to guard against people giving away capital, (or an income) to increase entitlement. However, it is not necessarily the case that a pensioner would be able to increase their entitlement by purchasing an annuity. The actual income generated by the annuity would be taken into account whereas if the money was treated as capital the first &pound;6,000 would be ignored.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.5/3">If a person purchased a deferred annuity, (or another product which does not give them an income straightaway) for example, the deprivation rule may be considered in the light of the considerable body of case-law which has developed on similarly worded provisions.</p>

The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances, including a textphone number and a paper application form. An application form can be downloaded from the Pension Credit website at <a href="http://www.thepensionservice.gov.uk">www.thepensionservice.gov.uk</a>.

The estimates for basic state pension are based on uprating (in April) of an average 0.25 per cent. above the relevant (previous September) 12 months' Retail Price Index. This is to reflect the current policy for uprating the basic state pension by 2.5 per cent. in years where RPI uprating would be lower than 2.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.3/1">Information is available from local Jobcentre Plus and Social Security offices, and the Department for Work and Pensions website gives information about Bereavement Benefits together with leaflets and claim forms for downloading. A fully revised version of leaflet NP45 'A guide to Bereavement Benefit' for professional advisers and members of the public was published in May this year. Leaflets D49 &quot;What to do after a death in England and Wales&quot; and D49S &quot;What to do after a death in Scotland&quot; are reviewed and revised as necessary annually.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.3/2">In addition, we have been working with funeral directors, Registrars and voluntary groups such as Cruse, National Association of Widows and Citizens Advice Bureaux who may be contacted by bereaved people.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.3/3">We have worked with Registrars to amend the social security form for notifying the Department of a death (BD8) to draw greater attention to the fact that it can be used to initiate a claim for bereavement benefits, this went to print in April 2003 and has been in use by Registrars since then. Within the last year we have also arranged for Funeral Directors to be able to obtain Bereavement Benefit claim packs so that they can be given directly to bereaved people.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.3/4">We keep under review the way that information is made available about bereavement benefits so that bereaved people, at this very difficult time in their lives, know about their potential right to benefit and can act on it at the right time.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.4/1">Since 2000 the UK has provided 687 million to Afghanistan. Distinctions between reconstruction or development assistance, and emergency or humanitarian assistance are problematic, especially in situations like Afghanistan after the initial emergency in 2001 was over. For example, assistance managed by our Humanitarian Affairs department to support re-opening of schools or the immunisation of children, clearly has an immediate effect as well as contributing to longer-term development.</p>

Most of this went to humanitarian needs because our reconstruction effort was just beginning. &pound;220 million (83 per cent.) was spent on military operations.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.4/4">In financial year 2002&ndash;2003 the UK contributed a total of &pound;396 million. &pound;86 million (21 per cent.) was spent on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. This was shared roughly equally between humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. &pound;310 million (79 per cent.) towards supporting military operations in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".484W.4/5">In the current financial year the UK, to date, have provided &pound;26 million for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. The great majority of these funds have focused on reconstruction.

	<p pid=".485W.2/1">The UK has a long-term financial commitment to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria which will provide the fund with a total contribution of $280 million by 2008. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of the fund in combating these key diseases of poverty. We are working closely with the fund to ensure it has effective working procedures so that it can meet its overall goals.</p>
	<p pid=".485W.2/2">We have therefore made it clear that UK funding will be subject to the GFATM reflecting a clear poverty focus, achieving a better financing system, integrating the fund's activities more effectively with national programmes and meeting agreed benchmarks to monitor its effectiveness. I am pleased to report that good progress was made at the recent sixth board meeting in Thailand on many of these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.5/1">The principal provider of food aid in Angola is the World Food Programme. WFP's current programme began in July 2002 and is due to end in December this year. It is 90 per cent. funded. The operation has both emergency relief and recovery, or rehabilitation, elements.</p>

The World Food Programme will continue to give priority to the sick and malnourished under social and nutritional programmes and these vulnerable groups will continue to receive full rations. This will minimise the negative humanitarian effects of the disruption of deliveries. However, there will be reduced availability of food aid for rehabilitation and recovery programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".489W.8/1">DFID's approach to GM food and developing countries is based on the principle that both the health of people and the environment are of primary concern. Developing countries are entitled to make their own informed choices about whether or not to adopt GM technologies, and to build the capacity to manage their safe development and use. The following principles are therefore employed in relation to UK food aid contributions:</p>
	<p pid=".489W.8/2" class="indent">Recipient governments should be given adequate information on the type of food they receive and its characteristics, including whether genetically modified;</p>
	<p pid=".489W.8/3" class="indent">Recipient governments should be allowed to decide on its acceptability; and</p>
	<p pid=".489W.8/4" class="indent">Donors should accept the decisions of recipients and accommodate them as far as possible. For example, if milled cereals are preferred rather than whole grain to avoid GM grain being planted as seed then this should be arranged.</p>
	<p pid=".489W.8/5">While respecting the need and sovereign right of recipient governments to take an informed decision, I believe that issues raised by GM crops do need to continue to be addressed separately.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.5/1">The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in the developing world. The factors recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) that can improve poor peoples' access are; affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/2">Clare Short chaired a UK high level working group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World, which examined the factors above in detail. The working group made a series of recommendations for action, which are being taken forward by a number of major stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/3">The UK has played a leading role in setting up initiatives such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM), which supply both generic and patented drugs. We want to play our part in making the Global Fund an effective instrument in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria and recognise that to do this, it needs predictable and sustainable financing. With this in mind, the UK pledged an additional US$80 million to the GFATM (US$40 million per annum over two further years). This will extend our current commitment to 2008 and bring our total contribution to the GFATM to US$280 million. Our funding will be subject to the GFATM achieving a better financing system, agreed benchmarks to monitor effectiveness, and to improve integration of the fund's activities with national programmes. This is one of a range of mechanisms for tackling HIV/AIDS; the UK also works with other partnerships, such as the Global TB drug Facility, that procure both generic and patented drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/4">In addition an agreement was reached at the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Cancun in September that will enable poor countries with no, or insufficient, manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector to import generic versions of patented medicines. The UK Government worked to secure this agreement and believe it to be a very significant step. The option to use compulsory licensing provides a useful bargaining tool for governments negotiating prices with suppliers of patented medicines and should encourage the latter to reduce prices. We will monitor its impact and work with developing countries to ensure that its implementation helps promote access to essential medicines.</p>

Each country that has qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' (HIPC) Initiative must develop and implement a nationally-owned and led poverty reduction strategy.

Our Public Service Agreement includes the commitment to increase the share of our bilateral programme going to low income countries to 90 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06. As a consequence of the temporary increase in funding for Iraq, which we expect to return to middle income status soon, we will also need to move a further estimated &pound;50 million from middle income country Programmes to low income country programmes. This is in line with our commitment to the 90 per cent. target.

	<p pid=".494W.5/1">The Baiji refinery provides more than half of Iraq's refined oil products. Major maintenance work on it is much needed and long overdue. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, the most urgent work will begin in December 2003, with one of the refinery's three units being taken out of service at a time. It is expected that the initial focus will be on the gasoline equipment, while keeping the diesel and kerosene plants working as far as possible throughout the winter. Major work is expected to be deferred until the spring in order to allow for additional fuel reserves to be built up. Taking the refinery off-line when demands are high and reserves are low could risk disrupting supplies significantly. Meanwhile, fuel is being imported to help meet current demand.</p>

The UK is also training the Iraqi Riverine patrol service to monitor the Shatt al Arab waterway and Khawr Zubayr.

	<p pid=".495W.2/1">With the exception of kerosene, the supply of fuel in Iraq at the end of September was the best since the cessation of hostilities. This was largely due to extensive imports of gasoline, LPG and diesel by the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organisation. Imports are expected to continue into 2004 while Iraq's refining capacity recovers and the country regains self-sufficiency in fuel. The Ministry of Oil is also working towards establishing adequate reserve stocks to provide a buffer for unexpected disruptions in supply or surges in demand.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.2/2">The distribution of fuel is a challenge. Pipelines are susceptible to sabotage and theft, and the dilapidated state of many limits their capacity. Road and rail transport, which is being used to help compensate for these problems, also faces capacity constraints. The Coalition Provisional Authority is taking steps to strengthen security for pipelines and other installations by providing better communications, centralised control systems, a more integrated approach and improved incident response times.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.9/1">The most authoritative figure for the proportion of people living in poverty in Malawi came from the 1998 Integrated Household Survey. It estimated that 65 per cent. of the population of Malawi were poor of whom 27 per cent. were classified as &quot;ultra-poor&quot;. The survey will be repeated later this year. A UN survey in 1993 estimated that 63 per cent. of the population of about 12 million were poor.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.0/1">According to the Malian National Campaign Against Tuberculosis, the number of reported tuberculosis cases in Mali has risen from 1,886 cases per year in 1995 to 2,757 in 2002. This is partly due to the prevalence of the disease among HIV/AIDS sufferers. The Malian Government have recently launched a fresh initiative to persuade tuberculosis patients to come forward for treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.0/2">DFID does not have a direct development assistance programme to Mali. Our assistance is mostly channelled through multilateral agencies, including the EC, and amounted to an estimated &pound;12 million in 2001. However, DFID is playing a major role in supporting tuberculosis control worldwide. We support tuberculosis research programmes at the London and Liverpool Schools of Tropical Medicine, as well as providing significant contributions to the Medical Research Council and the World Health Organisation to tackle tuberculosis and other diseases. We have also committed US$280 million over seven years to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). Decisions on which countries receive assistance are made on the basis of technical merit by the GFATM. Mali has not received support from GFATM for tuberculosis programmes, but will have another opportunity to apply in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".497W.3/1">DFID works with international partners to monitor global trends in progress towards the Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health and its associated target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75 per cent. between 1990 and 2015. The report on maternal mortality in 2000 published on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and the UN Population Fund estimates that there were 529,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2000, with a maternal mortality ratio of 400 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The majority of the burden is borne in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.3/2">The report is important in highlighting the magnitude of the problem. Inadequate information systems in many poor countries mean there is a high degree of uncertainty around the estimates and so they are less useful in assessing trends over time. A proxy indicator for monitoring trends is the proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker. Skilled attendant coverage in developing countries increased from 42 per cent. in 1990 to 52 per cent. in 2000 but there was substantial variation between regions. Coverage rose significantly in East and South East Asia and in Northern Africa. It is highest in Latin America, at 85 per cent. In contrast, there has been little progress in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where women give birth without assistance from skilled attendants in more than half of cases.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.3/3">Evidence from middle-income countries suggests that significant progress can be made through improved access to skilled attendance at birth, timely access to emergency obstetric care in the event of life-threatening complications, family planning services and action to address unsafe abortion. Strengthening the health system is central to an effective response. If poorer countries are to make similar progress, substantially increased action is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".497W.3/4">DFID is focusing attention on this Millennium Development Goal. Our Public Service Agreement includes targets on skilled attendance in Africa and Asia. Our approach includes advocacy in the international arena, support to countries to strengthen health systems and maternal and reproductive health services, and support for research and improved measurement tools. Since 1997 we have committed approximately &pound;1.5 billion to support countries to strengthen health systems. In addition we are supporting the maternal health work of international multilateral agencies and international NGOs.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.2/2">Funding for the reconstruction of Iraq will not affect programmes for middle income countries in this financial year. However, in the light of the needs in Iraq and our commitment to increase the proportion of our direct assistance to low-income countries to 90 per cent. by 2005&ndash;06 we will make reductions beyond those currently planned, to other middle income country programmes over the next two years, particularly in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".498W.2/3">Final decisions have not yet been taken on where reallocation will occur, However, in order to protect funding for the poorest countries they are likely to involve reductions in planned spending of around &pound;100 million for middle income countries, other than Iraq, over the two years 2004&ndash;06. This includes the reallocation of &pound;50 million for Iraq. As a consequence of the temporary increase in funding for Iraq, which we expect to return to middle income status soon, we will also need to move a further estimated &pound;50 million from planned middle income country programmes to low income country programmes. This in line with our commitment to the 90 per cent. target. The reallocations of planned expenditure should be viewed in the context of a development assistance budget that will increase by &pound;900 million over the current spending review period 2003&ndash;06.</p>

There is no hard information on the motives for these killings and we await the outcome of on-going investigations by the Somaliland authorities. We and the rest of the international community continue to monitor the security situation in Somaliland closely, and we are reviewing our travel advice.</p>
	<p pid=".500W.0/2">Elsewhere in Somalia the situation remains unsettled without any form of effective Government or early prospect of elections. IGAD-sponsored reconciliation talks in Kenya are being reassessed following last week's IGAD Summit and could make progress soon. The region is principally run by armed factions, and there is no guarantee of stability or security there. The UK currently advises against travel to Southern Somalia, where a Kenyan aid worker was recently murdered. UN agencies and international organisations still run humanitarian operations in the south. Somalia has been in a volatile situation since the onset of the civil war in the late 1980s and collapse of the government in 1991.</p>

	<p pid=".500W.3/1">As a result of earlier studies, which had identified high fuel costs of power generation and significant potential for wind energy, three wind turbines were installed on Deadwood Plain in St. Helena in 1999. The cost, which totalled approximately &pound;300,000, was met by DFID from our development assistance programme to St. Helena. Due to various technical problems, the turbines operated only intermittently until October 2002. Since then, they have not been in operation at all. Although this performance of the turbines has been extremely disappointing, fuel savings totalling some &pound;140,000 did accrue to St. Helena while they were operational. This suggests that wind power should be economically viable for St. Helena, under conditions of continuous wind turbine operation. With further DFID support, therefore, the St. Helena Government has commissioned work to investigate the problems that arose and to propose options for the future. The report, which should be available by the end of this year, will be carefully considered jointly by the St. Helena Government and DFID.</p>

	<p pid=".501W.2/1">All embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in St. Helena entails transit by launch between the harbour steps at Jamestown and ships anchored offshore. The St. Helena Government's policy, which we fully support, is that safety must be paramount in this process. All reasonable precautions are taken, and are regularly reviewed, to ensure that this is the case; and, on occasions where sea conditions are particularly difficult, passenger transit may be suspended altogether. Past studies have not demonstrated to DFID satisfaction that a breakwater, which could be costly to construct, would substantively improve the situation and/or be justifiable on technical and economic grounds. Although the St. Helena Government remains committed to the concept, therefore, we hitherto have not agreed to fund it. In their current proposals for possible European Union assistance, however, the St. Helena authorities are including plans for wharf improvements and an investigation of alternative options for passenger landing arrangements at Jamestown. We shall be monitoring this proposed work very carefully; and we will keep the matter under regular review, in consultation with the St. Helena Government.</p>

	<p pid=".501W.5/1">The Government acknowledges the damaging impact that dumping and trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries' agriculture sectors. We fully support the commitment made at the Doha Ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</p>
	<p pid=".501W.5/2">The UK has long advocated the reform of the CAP to reduce its trade distorting impacts and to enable farming in Europe to become more sustainable and market focussed. The deal agreed by EU Agriculture Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June</phrase> this year marks a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The decoupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which results in dumping and harms developing countries. Proposals for reform to other EU commodity regimes, including cotton have been submitted and are currently under discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".501W.5/3">The UK is committed to ensuring real reductions in OECD agricultural subsidies, as well as to making progress in other areas of concern not only to African developing countries. These include improving market access for agricultural products and establishing fair rules for special and differential treatment to safeguard food security and rural development in Africa.</p>

The field work was undertaken in February 2003 and the results were shared with the donor community in June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".503W.2/2">In addition, DFID has been the major contributor to the vulnerability assessments that have been undertaken in the affected countries of southern Africa. These have been used to identify the most vulnerable groups and communities in Zimbabwe. Three assessments were undertaken between June 2002 and May 2003. In addition, we are supporting, together with the EU, the first urban vulnerability assessment in Zimbabwe. This should be completed by the end of November 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".505W.6/1">Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy is calculated for each authority taking account of actual interest costs incurred on borrowing to finance approved capital investment in housing, plus an amount that each authority currently has to set aside to repay the principal. Nationally, the average amount met by HRA subsidy in 2002&ndash;03 was some &pound;1.6 billion, 10 per cent. of outstanding borrowing. Arms length management organisations (ALMOs) in Rounds 1 and 2 of the programme are also eligible for additional HRA subsidy, currently calculated at a flat rate of 10 per cent. of assumed additional capital investment by the ALMO. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has proposed that these flat rate arrangements, which were designed to provide incentives to authorities setting up the first ALMOs, will be harmonised for future years and brought into line with the normal arrangements for supporting capital investment in housing, based on actual interest rates.</p>

	<p pid=".506W.5/1">The Government use the new earnings survey (NES) for the area cost adjustment (ACA). The NES is the best data for the purpose because it is drawn from a 1 per cent. sample of everyone in employment, a far larger sample survey than the main possible alternative the labour force survey (LFS).</p>
	<p pid=".506W.5/2">The Elliott review recommended that the LFS should be used as the data source for the ACA. This was on the grounds that the LFS includes data on the educational attainment of survey participants. However detailed occupation data is included in the NES. A report by the Warwick Institute for Employment Research (IER) concluded that the use of the NES for calculating the ACA does not result in any significant bias as a consequence of the inability to standardise for education, because of the detailed information on the occupation and industry of survey participants contained in the NES.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.3/1">Our substantial increased investment in the national health service will have the effect of improving access to treatment for all patients, including those with chronic diseases. Over the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2007&ndash;08, expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent. a year over and above inflation&mdash;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent. in real terms. This will take the total spent on the NHS in England from &pound;56 billion in 2002&ndash;03 to over &pound;90 billion in 2007&ndash;08 and lead to better services for all patients.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.3/2">Maximum waiting times have fallen over the past few years and will continue to do so. By the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant will fall to three months and the maximum wait for in-patient treatment will fall to six months. This will help all NHS patients, including those with chronic disease.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.3/3">We are also producing a national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. The NSF, which we hope to publish by December 2004, will concentrate on neurological conditions and also have generic value for people with other long-term conditions and disabilities and will inform the future planning of services.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.0/1">This Government recognise that to build quality services, the national health service relies upon the skill and dedication of staff, of whom over 70 per cent. are women.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.0/2">Part-time working and extended maternity leave are well-established features of NHS employment, and have been for some time. However, as part of the drive to support all staff in the NHS, the NHS Plan, launched in July 2000 introduced the Improving Working Lives Standard, requiring a commitment by every NHS employer to offer a wide range of flexible employment opportunities by April 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.0/3">The NHS increasingly offers a wide variety of flexible working opportunities for all staff and supports this as a principle in all cases. A central requirement is to deliver practical measures which address the potential conflict between offering people the opportunity to work more flexibly and maintaining continuity of care on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.0/4">The NHS childcare strategy has provided central funding of over &pound;70 million over three years to develop up to 150 extra on-site nursery facilities by 2004. So far, 140 nursery schemes, including both new and extensions to existing nurseries have been funded. Funding has been provided to help trusts and primary care trusts to employ childcare co-ordinators. The Government have committed a further &pound;100 million to extend the NHS childcare strategy to ensure that the needs of all staff are met, including other forms of childcare for pre-school children and for older children, and to upgrade and subsidise existing NHS nurseries.</p>

	<p pid=".520W.2/2">Meat sold for human consumption at retail or in catering establishments has to comply with the Food Safety Act 1990 and regulations made under the Act. These regulations require animals slaughtered in licensed slaughterhouses to undergo veterinary ante-mortem inspection, and their carcasses to be subjected to post-mortem inspection and health marked, if found fit for human consumption, under the supervision of an official veterinarian. There are no specific regulations dealing with origin of meat served in restaurants. However, if origin information is provided it must not be false or misleading.</p>

	<p pid=".524W.8/1">The package of new information technology applications and systems will greatly reduce the requirement for general practitioners to chase test results, referral letters, appointments, process non-standard summaries and information around prescriptions. The wasted time through patients failing to attend appointments will also be reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.8/2">There are significant efficiency opportunities for GPs, and the high degree of computerisation across GP practices already collects and maintains much of the data that will become standard.</p>

Indeed, the availability of accurate and up-to-date information through the integrated care records service will improve the quality of care that GPs are able to provide to their patients.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.5/2">The National Health Service University (NHSU) will provide additional high quality learning opportunities at all levels for people working in health and social care. It will not generally levy charges on students for the learning opportunities offered in its initial roll-out phase. The NHSU is currently working with local employers and commissioners, through strategic health authorities, to develop its longer-term business model, and expects to attract income from a wide range of public and private sources. Any decision to levy charges on NHS staff will take account of the need to increase and widen access to education and training within health and social care. There will be appropriate consultation on these matters with all the relevant stakeholders, including employers in the sector and trades unions.</p>

	<p pid=".531W.5/2">Mail order and internet-based pharmacies are governed by the provisions of the Medicines Act 1968 and, if they provide national health service pharmaceutical services, by the NHS Act 1977. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Medicines Act and related legislation which regulate the sale and supply of medicines. The MHRA does not routinely monitor internet-based pharmacies. However, its enforcement group investigates any allegations of illegal activity of which it is made aware.</p>
	<p pid=".531W.5/3">In addition, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is responsible for inspecting all pharmacy premises for registration purposes under the Medicines Act, including mail-order and internet based pharmacies. Its code of ethics and standards sets out the further professional standards required of remote delivery and on-line pharmacy services including safe and secure transportation and delivery of medicines, patient confidentiality, provision of information and advice and record keeping.</p>

	<p pid=".533W.8/1">The table shows the number of National Health Service sight tests paid for in West Sussex Health Authority for 1997&ndash;98 to 2002&ndash;03. Figures for the number of sight tests by age are not collected centrally. The table shows the number of sight test in the categories &quot;children aged 0 to 15&quot; and &quot;patient aged 60 and over&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.8/2">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>. There was an increase of 2.4 million sight tests between 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000 in England. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.</p>
	<p pid=".533W.8/3">However, some patients aged 60 and over will be eligible for sight tests for other reasons as well, for example, on income grounds. The classification for such patients will depend on the patient and the practitioner. The increase in the number of sight tests for those over 60 may therefore reflect an increasing awareness of the eligibility of over 60s.</p>
