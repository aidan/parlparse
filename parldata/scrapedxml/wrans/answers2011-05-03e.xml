	<p pid="e.607W.3/1">The two Houses have one cleaning contract. The contractor has worked with the principal supplier of the cleaning materials that they use on the parliamentary estate to improve sustainability and minimise environmental impact. Although the particular products supplied to Parliament do not carry the EU Ecolabel they are super-concentrates, which are designed for use on a large scale and can provide even better sustainability benefits, typically in terms of transport, packaging and CO2 emissions. Super-concentrates are also considerably cheaper. Some essential supplies such as sanitisation products are, by their nature, incompatible with the requirements of the EU Ecolabel.</p>

This is a 10-year plan published by DEFRA in 2009 to achieve a sustainable and healthy population of honey bees. The Food and Environment Research Agency is working closely with beekeepers to implement the plan. An important part of this work is education and training of beekeepers, given their important role in sustaining the population of honey bees. These are a managed species whose population size is determined by the number of beekeepers, which has grown in recent years due to an increasing interest in beekeeping, the number of colonies they manage, their beekeeping skills and the time of year, given seasonal fluctuations in the size of colonies.</p>

In the case of caterers, these state that they should be able to provide the origin of the meat, meat products and dairy products either on the menu, on accompanying literature or, at the very least, when the information is requested by the consumer. Among the criteria being considered for the forthcoming Government buying standards for food and catering services is the inclusion of these principles for all central Government catering operations.</p>

Annual local expenditure at the sites surveyed in the New Forest and Thetford forest were over &#163;60 million and &#163;10 million respectively.</p>

	<p pid="e.610W.6/3">DEFRA conducted a public consultation at the end of 2010 on the Government's approach to tackling bovine tuberculosis (TB) and a badger control policy, which highlighted a number of planned changes to existing cattle measures to ensure that that they are better targeted on the basis of disease risk. We will be announcing a comprehensive and balanced TB eradication programme for England as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.6/4">We have reviewed the implementation of the Veterinary Surveillance Strategy to ensure that risks and emerging threats are effectively identified and prioritised. We continually monitor and assess the global animal health situation to help inform risk-based controls on imports of animals and animal products.</p>
	<p pid="e.610W.6/5">The way we respond to disease outbreaks is also an important factor in reducing risk. The evaluation report of Exercise Silver Birch, a major national exercise designed to test the Government's ability to deal with a significant outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD), demonstrated the benefits of changes introduced since the 2001 FMD outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="e.612W.2/1">Work under the water framework directive involves assessing the current status of water bodies in each river basin and, for those that are failing, confirming the cause of failure. Where a failure is due to a water company discharge or abstraction, measures are included in the improvement plans for the water companies, which form part of their business plans. For the first cycle of river basin management plans, 25% of water body failures were due to water company discharges. However, 82% of the cost of all improvement measures is being funded by water companies. The last set of water company environmental improvement plans were approved in November 2009 and are published on the Environment Agency website.</p>
	<p pid="e.612W.2/2">For the second cycle, improvement plans will be confirmed in 2014 and included in the water company business plans.</p>
	<p pid="e.612W.2/3">The Environment Agency also measures environmental regulatory performance of the 10 major water and sewerage companies on an annual basis. This feeds into a published performance assessment, and leads to financial penalties and incentives for the companies depending on performance. The last assessment took place on 2009 data and was reported in October 2010. The collation and assessment of the 2010 data has now commenced.</p>

	<p pid="e.624W.2/1">NOMS is folly committed to zero tolerance to violence in prisons. No act of violence is acceptable, be it verbal, physical or directed at property. Zero tolerance is a proactive approach to reducing violence in all its forms, in our prisons, and is subject to ongoing and robust monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="e.624W.2/2">The Incident Reporting System (IRS, now integrated onto the NOMIS system) is used to record events that undermine the safety of those within an establishment. Assaults are one category of IRS data. The data-entry process is largely reliant on each establishment accurately recording incidents as they occur.</p>
	<p pid="e.624W.2/3">Every assault incident entered onto NOMIS is subject to a central check to ensure that the incident has been reported correctly on the reporting system. If the incident has been reported incorrectly then the establishment is contacted and asked to rectify the error. Once the incident has been entered correctly it is locked and the establishment is no longer able to modify the incident report without contacting NOMS HQ. At regular intervals NOMS HQ will follow up any outstanding incidents with establishments to ensure they are captured accurately and in full.</p>
	<p pid="e.624W.2/4">NOMS uses NOMIS data to undertake quarterly monitoring on levels of violence, referrals to the police and the number of successful prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="e.624W.2/5">NOMS is committed to open reporting and since 2009 data on violence in prisons has been published in the Ministry of Justice Safety in Custody statistics.</p>

	<p pid="e.625W.2/1">The following two tables show the cost per place and per prisoner for the four years 2006-07 to 2009-10. Figures for 2010-11 are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="e.625W.2/2">For each year the direct cost is shown. Additionally, for 2007-08 to 2009-10 an overall cost is also shown (this information was not collected prior to 2007-08). The direct cost reflects mainly the direct contract costs for each private prison. The overall cost also includes costs met centrally by NOMS, including rates, depreciation, cost of capital, major maintenance, prisoner transport, etc. This includes some estimation.</p>
	<p pid="e.625W.2/3">The capital repayment element is not normally included in the cost per place/prisoner as it is not part of the annual resource operating cost. In table 2 it has been added to the direct cost only, as the overall cost figures in Table 1 already include depreciation and cost of capital charges.</p>
	<p pid="e.625W.2/4">Doncaster and Wolds are privately managed prisons, while the remainder are run under private finance initiative contract arrangements. Due to changes in accounting treatment over the period covered, the figures are not necessarily directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="e.625W.2/5">Cost per prison place is expressed in terms of the baseline certified normal accommodation number of places, which will generally give a higher unit cost than the cost per prisoner.</p>

	<p pid="e.632W.6/1">The implementation of the online infringement of copyright initial obligations has been affected by a number of factors. We now have the judgment from the judicial review, and are currently considering the changes which will need to be made to the cost-sharing statutory instrument in light of this. This will inevitably impact on the timetable for implementing the notification provisions of the Digital Economy Act. The report by Ofcom into the workability of sections 17 and 18 of the Act is due shortly. I will set out what action we plan to take as soon as we have had an opportunity to consider the report and all other relevant factors.</p>

The UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) brings together over 170 organisations including Government Departments such as the Department for Education, the Home Office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, children's charities, law enforcement and academia. UKCCIS members are committed to working together to help keep children and young people safe online.</p>
	<p pid="e.633W.2/3">The UK has a very successful model of industry-led self-regulation. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) works closely with internet service providers to ensure that webpages which provide access to images of child abuse, including those hosted outside of the UK, are reported and removed or blocked at source. Government are also working closely with industry as part of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety to improve many aspects of children's digital safety.</p>
	<p pid="e.633W.2/4">In addition, I hosted a discussion in February with internet service providers, UKCCIS, the IWF and other interested groups to look at how parental controls can be further improved. A further discussion has been arranged to look at progress on this issue in May this year.</p>

	<p pid="e.649W.5/1">The information requested is not recorded centrally by the UK Border Agency and could be obtained only through examination of individual case records at disproportionate cost. However, in response to the Family Removals: Thematic Inspection report by the Independent Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency, the UK Border Agency has committed to improving the management information held on families. The UK Border Agency takes its responsibilities for safeguarding children seriously and where possible ensures that families remain together. Typically, separations would take place only in cases where a member of the family is also a former foreign national prisoner and a decision has been made to maintain their detention pending deportation. Under the new arrangements for managing family returns, families without any criminal history would only be separated in exceptional circumstances and after advice had been sought from the independent Family Returns Panel.</p>

	<p pid="e.654W.2/1">S24 and s24A of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 places a legal duty on civil registrars to report any reasonable suspicions they may have that a marriage or civil partnership is or may be a sham marriage, these are known as s24 reports. The Anglican Church in England and Wales operates its own system of preliminaries and its clergy are not under the same legal obligation to report suspicions as civil registrars, although they are strongly encouraged to do so voluntarily, the Agency does not hold data on the number of reports that come from members of the Anglican clergy.</p>
	<p pid="e.654W.2/2">The Agency received 934 s24 reports from civil registrars during 2010, however as s24 reports represent a suspicion rather than a definite finding and do not include the Anglican church in England and Wales this figure can be not be seen as an absolute representation of the number of sham marriages in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.654W.2/3">Since January 2010 two periods of targeted enforcement actions have been conducted against those involved in sham marriages which resulted in 155 arrests. As entering in a sham marriage, in itself, is not a crime it is not possible to obtain definitive information on how many people have been prosecuted for involvement in sham marriages</p>

This fee increase will directly fund the administration costs of the retained elements of the Scheme, such as the operation of the barring function operated by the Independent Safeguarding Authority.</p>

	<p pid="e.666W.0/1">At the spending review the Government announced changes to the level of employee contribution rates which would lead to total savings of &#163;2.8 billion a year by 2014-15, to be phased in from April 2012. Discussions about how this will be implemented are ongoing with unions in the context of wider ranging pension discussions. The Government will put forward proposals in due course, and will then begin formal consultation on the necessary changes to scheme regulations.</p>

The Government are looking to remove unnecessary, old and outdated statutory burdens imposed on local councils from Whitehall. It is not aimed at removing those which protect vital frontline services or the vulnerable. Until now, there has been no comprehensive list of the legal duties placed on councils. To remedy this, the Government agreed with the Local Government Association (the national body representing councils) that we should compile such a list so that everyone is clear what legal obligations local councils have and check whether the duties are still relevant.</p>
	<p pid="e.667W.3/2">There is no implication that any particular duty on the list is being considered for removal, and there is certainly no intention to remove the duties on councils with respect to support for disabled children and children with special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="e.672W.9/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) provides a comprehensive programme of medical support for service personnel, and the strategic defence and security review included a commitment to maintain and further develop the medical support provided by the Defence Medical Services and the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="e.672W.9/2">We train armed forces personnel and their commanders about the need to recognise mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and how to seek help if necessary. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide assessment and treatment, and have successfully introduced an informal peer-led programme known as TRiM (Trauma Risk Management). In the UK, we provide community-based mental health care, both at local unit level and through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health across the UK (plus centres overseas), which provide out-patient treatment. In-patient care, when necessary, is provided in specialised psychiatric units under contract with the NHS. We are working with the Department of Health to enhance existing healthcare services by implementing recommendations made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> in his &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221; report into the health of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="e.672W.9/3">For operational trauma casualties in Afghanistan, those whose injuries are too serious to be treated at the Camp Bastion Field Hospital are aeromedically evacuated back to the UK, where they will usually be admitted to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham. This brand-new NHS hospital is at the leading edge in the medical care of serious polytrauma, as commonly sustained by our operational casualties. We can be sure that by admitting them to that hospital they will have immediate access to some of the best clinical specialists and medical equipment available in the UK today.</p>
	<p pid="e.672W.9/4">Post-hospital rehabilitation and ongoing treatment is also available through a range of specialist MOD facilities, including 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units around the UK and overseas, which offer a range of rehabilitation and physiotherapy to those requiring it. For those needing the most specialist treatment, such as amputees, the dedicated Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court in Surrey provides a first-rate facility on an in-patient basis to service personnel from all parts of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="e.680W.6/1">Budget 2011 abolished the fuel duty escalator and replaced it with a fair fuel stabiliser. Duty will increase by inflation only, when oil prices are high. If the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis duty will increase by RPI plus 1p per litre. The Government will consult informally before setting the level and mechanism for the trigger.</p>
	<p pid="e.680W.6/2">Average fuel price data suggest that generally there has been a pass through of the 1p per litre reduction in duty on deliveries from refineries, although ongoing increases in the price of oil have also impacted pump prices. The duty reduction potentially helps to ease the cost pressure of peaking oil prices on the logistics industry.</p>

	<p pid="e.685W.5/1">For strategic purposes HMRC does not use employment forecasts by age group as they do not always prove reliable and are not critical to its planning. HMRC bases its planning on population growth, and predicted churn in the working population. It does identify the assumed population reaching working age to forecast broad numbers of NI numbers issued. Employment levels by age band are not used, as even if employment is fluctuating HMRC will continue to experience &#8220;churn&#8221; in the PAYE, tax credit and self-assessment populations, and there is no clear correlation with employment levels that we can rely on.</p>

DEFRA and DECC are also working closely with industry to draw up a joint programme of work to tackle other barriers to the deployment of AD. The aim is to publish this in an AD strategy in June.</p>

	<p pid="e.692W.2/1">The Environment Agencies (the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency), together with the Food Standards Agency, undertake independent monitoring programmes for radioactivity in the terrestrial and aquatic environments around nuclear installations in the UK.

It includes 95 monitors stationed across the UK to detect increases in background levels of radiation. Any evidence of a nuclear incident abroad, of radiological significance for the UK, would result in a national alert being raised.</p>

	<p pid="e.693W.5/14">In terms of the amount of radioactive waste that would arise as a result of a future new build programme this would depend on such issues as the number and the type of reactors. Based on an assumption of a new build fleet comprised of four AP 1000 reactors and four EPR reactors operating for 60 years and generating 10GW, disposability assessments undertaken by NDA suggest that the estimated amount of intermediate level waste could be of the order of 25,000 cubic meters and an estimated amount of spent fuel of about 20,000 cubic meters. Based on the same assumptions, the low level waste management company, LLW Repository Ltd, has estimated that approximately 80,000 cubic meters of LLW might be produced.</p>

This will clearly identify how the 2020 renewables target will be achieved, and will give clarity to markets of what will be required, helping to provide greater certainty to investors and the developers of new technology.</p>

	<p pid="e.696W.0/2">Faster than anticipated reductions in the cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) mean that it does not need as much subsidy to be competitive. Under the proposed new tariffs for solar PV installations between 50kW and 250kW, community based projects should continue to benefit from the scheme but at a lower rate. We are currently consulting on these proposed new tariffs and will consider all views expressed, including any from community groups and charities, in finalising the policy.

	<p pid="e.696W.10/1">The Government recognise how important it is that children have safe, free local places to play, and the benefits these places bring to the wider community more generally. However, it is not for central Government to determine what play facilities are available in local areas, or to tell the experts in the play sector how to deliver play provision.

	<p pid="e.696W.10/2">The play capital programme finished at the end of March 2011, as originally intended under the previous administration's Play Strategy. The Government are giving councils more freedom over how they spend their money, giving communities more control over developments in their neighbourhoods, and making it easier for volunteers and charities to get involved. This should provide the opportunities for committed people and local groups to continue to influence play provision in their areas, leaving responsibility for play provision where it belongs: with local areas and their communities.</p>

Clause 12 of the Health and Social Care Bill (subject to parliamentary approval) amends the National Health Services Act 2006 to remove from the Secretary of State the duty to provide high secure mental health services and place a duty instead on the National Health Service Commissioning Board to arrange for the provision of these services. The Secretary of State informed the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April</phrase> that the Department is taking the opportunity of a natural break in the passage of the Bill to pause, listen, and engage with all those who want the NHS to succeed, and subsequently to bring forward amendments to improve the Bill further.</p>
	<p pid="e.702W.2/2">Following on from this, the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State launched an engagement exercise on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-06">6 April</phrase>. To oversee the NHS listening exercise, the Department has brought together the NHS Future Forum, a group of patient representatives, clinicians and others from the health field, including frontline staff, to drive the process of engagement with staff, patients and communities. Further information about the NHS Future Forum and the listening exercise is available on the website at:</p>

	<p pid="e.702W.2/4">People who wish to get involved can read more about the listening exercise and leave comments publicly on the website. By June, Ministers will decide how to take forward the Bill in a way that reflects what has been heard. Following this, decisions about the commissioning of secure and community forensic mental health services in the new NHS will be made.</p>

The NSF focused on achieving a better experience and better outcomes for those with a long-term condition but did not prescribe the processes by which this should be achieved. Delivery was left by the last Government to the national health service to resolve locally.</p>
	<p pid="e.704W.3/2">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill through Parliament, general practitioner (GP) led commissioning consortia will be responsible for commissioning the great majority of NHS services. GPs, in partnership with other local health care professionals such as therapists and community nurses, are best placed to understand the health needs of local populations and how to work with their local populations&#8212;including patient-led organisations such as the Neurological Alliance&#8217;s Commissioning Support organisation, and other service users&#8212;to design services that meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.704W.3/3">The NHS Commissioning Board will be responsible for assessment of the performance of GP consortia. The board will draw on the national outcome goals in the NHS outcomes framework to develop a new commissioning outcomes framework. Measures from the commissioning outcomes framework will be used by the board to hold GP consortia to account for the quality of services they commission and the health outcomes they achieve for patients.</p>

	<p pid="e.710W.0/1">The UK is obliged under the UN Charter to promote the well-being of the inhabitants of the Overseas Territories (OTs). The 2002 International Development Act exempts the Territories from the poverty criteria that apply to the rest of the aid budget. Successive White Papers on international development, including those produced since 1997, have committed the British Government to meeting the &#8220;reasonable needs&#8221; of the OTs as a first call on the aid budget.</p>
	<p pid="e.710W.0/2">Rigorous results and value for money assessments form part of aid settlements that are agreed with OT governments requiring assistance from the British Government. Capital investments and technical co-operation programmes agreed with OT governments are subject to competition to ensure the best value for taxpayers. Commitments are monitored regularly. The Department of International Development (DFID) now uses Her Majesty's Treasury's business case model for all new investments. This further ensures that aid spent in the OTs is focused on clear results and value for money outcomes. Unlike DFID's country aid relationships, our support to the territories is not discretionary. The ultimate goal is to accelerate aid-dependent territories towards self-sufficiency.</p>

Conflict funding for 2008/09 and 2009/10 was provided as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review (CSR) settlement.

The personal identifiers must be replicated by postal voters when they cast their postal vote, and they will be cross-checked with the original samples to ensure votes are valid. Legislation requires returning officers and counting officers to undertake a minimum of 20% verification of personal identifiers of postal votes which are returned. For the specific purposes of the referendum on the voting system, the chief counting officer has directed that counting officers will check the personal identifiers on 100% of postal votes.</p>
	<p pid="e.714W.6/2">The Electoral Commission, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, has issued guidance to minimise the potential for malpractice in the electoral process.</p>
	<p pid="e.714W.6/3">The Electoral Commission has led work with police forces, political parties and returning officers to raise awareness of integrity issues and strengthen systems to ensure that fraud is detected and prosecuted and to draw attention to existing good practice. There is evidence of effective working between returning officers and local police at recent elections with the police engaged on election issues and committed to the detection of electoral fraud.

	<p pid="e.715W.6/1">Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) are part of the power shift away from central Government and towards local communities in promoting business and driving local growth. As we said in the White Paper for local growth, the Government do not intend to define LEPs in legislation. We envisage that LEPs could take on a diverse range of roles including private sector job creation and establishing skills and training priorities. Partnerships will differ across the country in both form and functions in order to best meet local circumstances and opportunities. We have not prescribed the leadership roles for LEPs on skills or any other activity to support growth in the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="e.715W.6/2">A key reform of the skills system is the Government's commitment to freeing colleges and training organisations from central bureaucracy so they can determine the training offer which responds directly to what learners and employers want. Colleges and training organisations will be encouraged to form self-organised networks to engage more easily with LEPs on skills priorities and how they can best be delivered. In turn, we will encourage LEPs to develop effective working relationships with the further and higher education sector to agree, for instance, how to generate the demand for agreed priorities locally.</p>

It is estimated that in steady state, without time-limiting, around 77% of contributory ESA claimants in the Work Related Activity Group or Assessment Phase would have duration of 12 months or more.

	<p pid="e.727W.5/3">There are two types of unfilled vacancy data available, total unfilled and live unfilled, and these can be broken down by occupation using the 2000 version of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Standard Occupational Classification (SOC 2000). The latest data available is for March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="e.727W.5/4">The lowest-level occupational data available on NOMIS is for care assistants and home carers (SOC code 6115). This includes senior care workers, as well as domiciliary care workers, home carers, personal carers, carers (welfare services) and caseworkers (welfare services). The Jobcentre Plus unfilled vacancy data available on NOMIS cannot be broken down any further to identify unfilled vacancies for senior care workers only.</p>
	<p pid="e.727W.5/5">In March 2011, Jobcentre Plus held 42,787 unfilled vacancies for care assistants and home carers. This includes all unfilled vacancies held by Jobcentre Plus including vacancies which have been suspended pending closure, and as such are not available to jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="e.727W.5/6">The live unfilled vacancies data therefore provides a better reflection of the number of vacancies available to jobseekers.

	<p pid="e.728W.2/3">The Secretary of State has asked Darra Singh to reply to your question concerning how many jobseekers who missed interview sessions were contacted by jobcentre staff to prompt their attendance during the Newcastle jobcentre pilot project in 2010; and how many of these (a) lost their benefit and (b) were paid benefit. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to Darra Singh as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. As Darra Singh is currently on annual leave, I am replying in his absence.</p>
	<p pid="e.728W.2/4">In June of 2010, Newcastle-Under-Lyme Jobcentre conducted a short trial during which they tried to contact by telephone jobseekers who had missed a mandatory appointment. Jobseekers were asked to attend the Jobcentre for their appointment the same day to help avoid any potential loss of benefit. The trial was carried out for a period of six weeks. Early evaluation showed that the number of successful calls was very low and the trial was discontinued. No records were kept about the number of jobseekers who lost or were paid benefit as a result of these telephone calls.</p>

The Government will also extend eligibility for the higher rate to children who are severely visually impaired (currently only entitled to the disabled child element). Eligibility for the disabled child additions will, as now, be linked to the rate of disability living allowance they receive. The impact on child poverty of this approach will be included in the next version of the Welfare Reform Bill's impact assessment which we expect to publish before the Lords Committee stage.</p>

	<p pid="e.733W.6/1">We recognise that attending any medical assessment can be a stressful experience, and that these will not be carried out if there is enough existing evidence on the customers current condition to decide entitlement to the particular benefit in question. The healthcare professionals who carry out the examinations are trained in assessing vulnerable customers, and when people are asked to come for an assessment they are positively encouraged to bring someone with them, this may be an advocate.</p>
	<p pid="e.733W.6/2">Additionally, there are already provisions in place for individuals who have more severe conditions and are unable to act on their own behalf. In these circumstances an advocate may be appointed to act on the individual's behalf and take responsibility for all matters relating their welfare benefits.</p>
