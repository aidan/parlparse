	<p pid=".3W.9/1">The NHS Cancedr Plan made clear the crucial role that family doctors and community nurses have to play at all stages along the cancer patient pathway. One of the actions in the NHS Cancer Plan was the establishment of a new partnership between the National Health Service and Macmillan Cancer Relief to provide around &pound;3 million a year for three years to support a lead clinician in cancer within every primary care trust (PCT). These leads have a key role to play by providing strategic leadership within the PCT, contributing to the development of cancer networks, improving communication between sectors, raising standards of cancer care through the PCTs and ensuring services are responsive to the needs of people affected by cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.9/2">A recent workshop to develop a vision for primary care cancer services examined the role of community-based services in all aspects of cancer care including patients at risk of cancer, patients with symptoms suggesting a possible diagnosis of cancer and the care of patients with known cancer. The workshop was attended by a number of stakeholders including representatives from PCTs. It also provided an opportunity to consider the cancer elements of the proposed general medical services contract quality and outcomes framework. This includes some cancer and palliative care specific indicators as well as other generic organisational indicators that are of particular relevance to cancer patients wuch as sharing information out of hours.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.9/3">Responsibility for commissioning of cancer services now rests with PCTs and it is for PCTs in parnership with strategic health authorities (SHAs) and other local stakeholders to determine how best to meet national priorities, including the targets set for cancer, in &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform: the next three years&mdash;Priorities and Planning Framework 2003 to 2006&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".3W.9/4">PCTs and SHAs were required to produce local delivery plans (LDPs) for the three years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06 setting out how the would deliver the national targets set out in the Priorities and Planning Framework and supporting guidance was provided to assist with this. It is the SHA who are responsible for delivering the targets or outcomes in their LDP.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.2/1">Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for scans, endoscopy or radiotherapy treatment. The length of time that a patient may have to wait is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be treated.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.2/2">Where these procedures form part of the pathway for cancer patients the NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first definitive cancer treatment. From 2001, there was a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month wait from urgent referral to first treatment for children's cancers, testicular cancer and acute leukaemia. From 2002, there was a maximum two month wait from urgent referral to treatment for breast cancer. By 2005, there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to first treatment and a maximum two months from urgent referral to first treatment for all cancers. Performance data on current cancer waiting times targets are published on the Departments website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/cancerwaits">www.doh.gov.uk/cancerwaits</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.5/1">The national health service provides a variety of types of care for women during pregnancy and childbirth, including home birth and natural birthing opportunities. The Department of Health advocates local decision making in designing appropriate, effective services that fit in with the ethos of woman-centred care. It is inevitable that the requirements of women will vary in different parts of the country and this is why it is so important that decisions about service provision are made at a local level.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.5/2">The Department of Health is currently developing the children's national service framework (NSF) which includes a maternity module. The NSF will focus on extending maternity choices, so that women in all parts of the country have a greater choice in the place and type of birth.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.2/2">The meeting was to inform the companies of our requirements for smallpox vaccine and to find out whether the company was in a position to meet our requirements and if so, to invite them to submit their written proposals for vaccine supply. Since the award of the contract to Powderject, there were regular ad hoc meetings between officials from the Department and the Ministry of Defence with Powderject to resolve matters of detail concerning labelling and packaging and delivery of the vaccine.

An adjudication meeting was held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-12">12 May 2003</phrase> with representatives of two companies whose bids met the criteria for supply. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-30">30 July</phrase>, the Government announced its intention to award the contract to Aventis Pasteur MSD. It is regarded as best practice, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, that the names of those unsuccessful companies who submitted bids are not revealed.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.6/1">Ensuring high levels of take-up of online services by all users is an essential part of the e-government strategy. The Government is acting upon the recommendations of the National Audit Office report, &quot;Progress in making e-services accessible to all&mdash;access and use by older people&quot; to ensure that people over 65 are encouraged to take advantage of online services.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.6/2">This report highlights that older people are more likely to use online services when they can access them in places they would normally visit, such as libraries and community centres. The Government has established over 6,000 UK online centres in these locations where people can access the internet for free or at low cost with support to help them do so.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.6/3">The report also mentions that one factor preventing older people from using the internet, especially among those who have never used computers, is the feeling that it is of no relevance to them. One of the challenges for government is to demonstrate the benefits of the internet to older people. This we have done during the &quot;Get Started&quot; campaign which ran throughout May and June. The retirement pension is just one of the government services regularly used by older people that we are prioritising as part of our e-government programme.</p>

	<p pid=".22W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received no representations from the Scottish Executive specifically on the operation of Awards for All in Scotland. However, there was correspondence in June 2003, before we published the National Lottery Funding Decision Document. That document proposes to increase the upper grant limit of Awards for All in England. We believe that given the local community focus of Awards for All, any changes to the programme in other parts of the United Kingdom should be considered separately within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.0/2">In respect of legislation, DCMS complies with guidelines by compiling Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) for proposals that have an impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector. RIAs include details of the obvious costs, risks and benefits of the proposal but also the wider economic, social and environmental impacts. There is no separate section within an RIA specifically for environmental impacts, but where a proposal has an impact on the environment, it should be set out in the RIA. The impact will usually be included in the analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposal, or may be covered in the unintended consequences section.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.0/1">The Government recognise that the simplest way of establishing the necessary link between buying a Lottery ticket and funding a Lottery project is to use the same brand for both. The Lottery Distributors are currently working with Camelot to develop an appropriate design. It is expected that, from autumn 2004, this will be offered on a voluntary basis to projects which have received Lottery funding. The display of the logo will then become mandatory for most future Lottery awards. Over a longer timescale, other ways of using the crossed fingers logo throughout the whole distribution process will be explored.</p>

Supporters Direct received &pound;250,000 a year in public funding for 2000&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03, and will receive core funding of &pound;325,000 for 2003&ndash;04.

	<p pid=".31W.7/1">Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs), the most common type of 'no win no fee' agreements, were first introduced in 1995. In April 2000 success fees and after the event insurance premiums were made recoverable from the losing party to help redress the problem of the legal system being open only to people who were legally aided or who had adequate private means. The intention was to make it easier and more affordable for a wider range of people to enforce their rights. The reforms also provided defendants and their insurers with a fairer system by which to recover costs in successfully defended cases, whereas under Legal Aid, defendants were rarely entitled to recover costs from their legally aided opponent. The reforms provided increased deterrents to the bringing or defending of weak claims and stronger incentives for parties to settle cases early and cheaply because of the increased potential liability in costs.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.7/2">It is not possible to say yet whether legal costs to insurers have increased directly as a result of the introduction of CFAs, recoverable success fees and ATE insurance premiums. Recent research by Fenn, Gray and Rickman (January 2003) for the Civil Justice Council on the cost of road traffic accident cases up to &pound;15,000 in value found that data on costs and damages from around April 2002 onwards showed large fluctuations in the volume and duration of settled claims and could not be relied upon. However, the research did indicate that there seemed to be little difference between CFA and non-CFA claims with respect to agreed base costs and disbursements, and that success fees and ATE premiums remain a relatively small part of overall costs recovered from insurers.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.7/3">The OFT commented in its recent fact finding study of the liability insurance market that it seemed unlikely the cost of individual claims has risen substantially as a result of the reforms and it was unclear whether they have had a significant impact on the frequency of claims. The OFT also said that while it had frequently been suggested the number of claims has risen because the reforms have made the claiming process easier and associated publicity has drawn more attention to the availability of compensation, the evidence for this was in fact largely anecdotal.</p>

However, not all units received ceramic plates due to supply difficulties within theatre.

We acquired a range of new equipment to ensure that UK land forces capabilities either complied with or exceeded the mandated standard. We also acquired sufficient sets of the US's recently developed satellite-based Blue Force Tracking tool to help our units operate with US forces. GPS navigation aids and the short-range Personal Role Radio, a part of the Bowman programme brought into service early, were widely available.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.2/1">Internal audits within the Ministry of Defence are conducted primarily by Defence Internal Audit (DIA) but there are also audit-style reviews by functional and business unit compliance teams as well as specific quality inspections against formal standards. The periodicity of internal audit review is now governed by an assessment of the risks inherent within any particular system or process and agreed by the Defence Audit Committee. As such, there are no longer routine or cyclical audits per se. It is not therefore possible to state how often audits of maintenance programmes may occur. Judgments regarding risk are made by senior managers responsible for the delivery of defence objectives rather than by auditors.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.2/2">There remains, however, flexibility within the internal audit process to undertake ad hoc reviews as well as consultancy and business development assignments and in recent years DIA has undertaken individual audits examining repair processes, prime contracting and estates maintenance at the request of management.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.8/1">It is not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the distance an armoured brigade can travel in 24 hours because the rate of progress is governed by a wide range of variable factors, such as the type of terrain, climatic conditions, and the nature of any hostilities.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.8/2">The introduction of the new Oshkosh transporters will, however, introduce a significant increase in capability. Even though there will be 28 fewer transporters than we currently hold, the old vehicles have become increasingly difficult to maintain and the availability levels are therefore low. The new Oshkosh Tank Transporter fleet will be operated under a public private partnership initiative and payment is based on performance. Availability levels will be guaranteed, using vehicles leased from civilian hauliers if necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.8/3">Additionally, the Oshkosh has a number of features that vastly improve its capability. These include a Central Tyre Inflation System (CTIS) giving the fleet an increased off road capability. It also has a dual winch system and can double load Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicles unlike the Scammell Commander which was restricted to carrying only single Warriors. This double loading capability frees up considerable trailer space for the movement of Challenger 2 Tanks vital in the deployment of an Armoured Brigade.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.0/1">The ability of deployed personnel to maintain contact with their families is a key part of the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) which was introduced in 2001 to replace the ad hoc welfare provision which had previously varied between operations, The OWP followed a comprehensive review of operational welfare, completed in December 1999, which took into account the views of hundreds of Service personnel across a wide range of operational theatres, as well as drawing on lessons from our allies. The OWP communications package includes free use of Forces Aerogrammes ('Blueys') and electronic-Blueys, 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week and access to internet and email facilities. The Ministry of Defence recognises the need to continually keep under review its Welfare Support Policy. In light of the experience's gained on various operational deployments during the last two years the Department is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the policy. It is too early to say what the outcome will be of this review.</p>

The Home Office's Drugs and Alcohol Research Unit is shortly to embark on a detailed study to assess the level of harm caused by Khat. It is expected that a final report will be completed in September 2004, with interim findings being available in April 2004. The report will inform future decisions on whether Khat should be controlled within the 1971 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".59W.6/3">The Government is considering ways to address the problems of Khat misuse as part of a wider diversity initiative to ensure that the national drug strategy meets the needs of all our communities.

	<p pid=".64W.2/1">The United Kingdom signed this Optional Protocol in September 2000 and intends to ratify it at the earliest opportunity. To be able to ratify, we need to introduce a range of new offences to ensure that we are fully compliant with the instrument. Several of these, relating to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and the sexual exploitation of children for gain, are included in the Sexual Offences Bill currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".64W.2/2">The Optional Protocol also requires the criminalisation of behaviour which does not fall within the scope of the Sexual Offences Bill, such as trafficking people with the aim of: exploiting their labour; organ transfer and illegal adoptions. These measures are being pursued separately and will also require primary legislation. It is not therefore possible to say precisely when we will be able to ratify the instrument.</p>

Delivery of these funds is dependent on progress by the Government of Sierra Leone on key areas such as security sector reform, regulation of the diamond industry, corruption, government and media reforms, and the development of a poverty reduction strategy.</p>

Our initial portfolio of projects was announced during President Putin's state visit to the UK in June 2003. These include the dismantlement of two nuclear submarines, the construction of a new storage facilities for Spent Nuclear Fuel, and a series of projects to assist in the eventual safe removal of Spent Nuclear Fuel from Andreeva Bay&mdash;a former Russian Navy storage site for Spent Fuel from navy vessels and ice breakers. During this visit the Foreign Secretary signed a bilateral Agreement with the Russian Foreign Minister, which provides the legal cover for these projects to proceed. During the visit the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/784" name="Ivor Caplin">the Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin)</phrase> also signed the Arctic Military Cooperation Agreement (AMEC) that will allow a number of environmental nuclear clean up projects associated with submarine dismantlement to proceed. The AMEC assistance projects will be managed and provided with financial support under the DTI managed FSU Programme. In undertaking all these projects , the Department is working closely with both the MOD and FCO together with our Moscow embassy. We plan to publish by the end of the year a detailed report setting out the achievements in establishing this programme over the past two years.

	<p pid=".78W.8/1">The Government have introduced a range of measures to encourage electricity companies to invest in renewable energy. The recently published Energy White Paper, &quot;Our Energy Future&mdash;Creating a Low Carbon Economy&quot;, sets out the policy on the increasing role renewable technologies will play in our overall energy policy, and highlights many of the successes that have already been achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/2">Our initial target is that 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity sales should be from renewable-sourced electricity by 2010. To help achieve the necessary growth to reach that target, we have introduced a number of initiatives:</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/3" class="indent">The Renewables Obligation (and associated Renewables Obligation Scotland). Introduced in April 2001, these require all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their sales from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/4" class="indent">The Obligation is underpinned by a package of funding worth nearly &pound;350 million, which will support our on-going New and Renewable R&amp;D programme, and extensive programmes of capital grants for new and emerging technologies such as energy crops and other forms of bio-energy, offshore wind, solar photovoltaics, wave and tidal power.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/5">In order to develop our offshore wind potential, last year we published a consultation entitled &quot;Future Offshore&quot;, which sets out a strategic framework to support the development of that industry. We have announced that future development should take place in three strategically significant areas&mdash;namely the North West (including Liverpool Bay), the Greater Wash and the Thames Estuary and plan to announce next month the names of successful bidders for projects within those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/6">The Renewables UK unit to was set up last year within DTI with the specific aim of maximizing the benefits of renew ables to UK industry, and to help that industry develop.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.8/7">Industrial users of renewable sourced electricity also benefit from exemption from Climate Change Levy payments.</p>

	<p pid=".80W.8/2">In May of this year three people were killed, 30 houses destroyed and 70 partially damaged as a result of heavy rainfall and flash floods in Baghlan, Kunduz and Takhar provinces in north eastern Afghanistan. Most personal belongings and food reserves were destroyed or buried in mud. Large swathes of arable land were also covered in mud following the floods.</p>

	<p pid=".80W.8/4">DFID is supporting the work of the UNHCR in Afghanistan (&pound;5.8 million so far in 2003) who supplied tents, soap and food items to affected families through the local disaster management structure. Also the FAO has provided advice on remedial action, which can be taken by farmers to salvage their crops.</p>

	<p pid=".86W.5/1">The New Partnership of for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is a continent-wide plan with ambitious aims of tackling poverty in the whole of Africa through increased investment, better governance and a partnership with donors based on mutual accountability. The UK fully supports the aims of NEPAD and recognises that it is a long-term plan.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.5/2">NEPAD has made substantial progress since it was founded in 2001. 16 countries have signed up to the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a voluntary initiative to improve political, economic and corporate governance in Africa. The first reviews are due to take place later this year. NEPAD has also made progress in drawing up plans for an African Peace Keeping Capacity, and plans on priority areas including infrastructure, agriculture and environment. This progress will lead to long-term improvements in governance, peace keeping and investment in southern Africa as well as other African regions.</p>
	<p pid=".86W.5/3">Of the southern African countries, both Mozambique and South Africa have signed up to the APRM. Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique are particularly keen supporters of NEPAD and both Presidents are on the Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee of NEPAD. NEPAD is reflected in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Regional Indicative Strategic Paper. The Government of South Africa has a NEPAD outreach programme and a NEPAD coordinating point in its Department of Foreign Affairs- it is also seeking to establish NEPAD focal points in all Ministries. NEPAD is a long-term programme, it will take time to deliver, but it is gaining increasing support across the continent.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.5/1">Routine immunization coverage in Nigeria reaches about 27 per cent. of children with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). Due to the poor state of routine immunization services, the Federal Government of Nigeria established in 1997 the National Programme on Immunization (NPI). The NPI has focussed on providing supplementary, door-to-door coverage with OPV using National and Sub-national Immunization Days (NIDs and SNIDs). Around 40 million doses are administered through NIDs and SNIDs every year.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/2">Interruption of the transmission of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) had been achieved in 29 out of 37 states by 2001, but unfortunately the situation has again worsened, with confirmed cases in 15 states in the first half of 2003. All these states are in the north, and the south remains polio-free. Adverse propaganda by religious leaders is alienating some sections of the population from the immunization workers.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/3">My Department is working with the Nigerian Government and with other international partners to meet the challenge of polio eradication in Nigeria. This includes a grant of &pound;50 million to the World Health Organization for polio work in the ten global priority countries.</p>

This provides education, health, relief and social services to Palestinian refugees in all five fields of operations: Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. UNRWA determines the allocations between fields, and between sectors. In 2002, DFID contributed &pound;13 million to UNRWA's General Fund. A similar contribution is planned for 2003.

The main bilateral donors are Portugal, France, Spain and Taiwan and the principal multilateral donors are the World Bank, European Community and the African Development Bank. Most development projects focus on infrastructure, agriculture, health and education. The recent coup brought the country to a standstill for a few days. But apart from temporarily slowing down the efforts of the donor community, recent events seem to have had no other negative impact on development programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.0/1">Exact numbers of child soldiers within the regular Ugandan Army have yet to be confirmed. We believe that the Government of Uganda is taking serious steps to address this issue. In May 2002 it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It has reinforced army recruitment systems in an attempt to screen out underage recruits. The issue remains a problem for the auxiliary forces, although the numbers are believed to be relatively small. UNICEF, diplomatic missions (including the UK) and the Uganda Human Rights Commission have brought specific cases to the Army's attention. With UNICEF's co-operation, we understand that these children are in the process of being demobilised. We will continue to monitor this issue closely.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.0/2">UNICEF Uganda also estimates that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group operating in Northern Uganda, has abducted 20,400 children since 1990. Abduction and forced conscription of children is the chief recruitment method of the LRA. 6,000 of these children have yet to be accounted for.</p>

This is 41 per cent. higher than last year, but 51 per cent. below the 2000&ndash;01 harvest, which was itself significantly below average. Production of maize, the main staple, is forecast at 803,000 tonnes.

The UK government have just approved support for another &pound;8 million for food aid through organisations such as CAFOD, Save the Children and Christian Aid.

	<p pid=".92W.2/1">The food crisis in Zimbabwe is part of a wider crisis of economic collapse and failure of governance. There is no definitive account of the overall effect on the region. However, it is clear that the dramatic shift in Zimbabwe's fortunes from a significant exporter of food to a massive importer&mdash;with the majority of its population needing food aid last year and perhaps half this year&mdash;has affected food security throughout the region. Food security in other countries in the region has improved significantly following the May harvests. While this short-term progress is welcome, long-term efforts to reduce the likelihood of further food crises in Southern Africa will be unlikely to succeed without significant policy reform and economic recovery in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/2">Long-term efforts to increase investment and build economies in Southern Africa will also be hampered so long as present Zimbabwean policies continue. There has been a significant fall in trade with Zimbabwe; increased debt arrears to its neighbours primarily by Zimbabwean state-owned enterprises; and a negative regional image to investors, which has affected levels of foreign direct investment. The poor control of foot and mouth disease now widespread in Zimbabwe has also affected Botswana and threatens South Africa. The increase in illegal trade avoiding government controls between Zimbabwe and its neighbours is an additional negative impact.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.2/3">The crisis is also leading to higher vulnerability to HIV infection through greater movement of people and higher levels of unsafe prostitution, and has prevented more positive measures to control this pandemic in Zimbabwe, which will impact on the region in years to come. Large-scale migration has also occurred, especially to Botswana and South Africa. This has had a negative impact in terms of the numbers, and sparsely populated Botswana's capacity to absorb such large numbers makes it especially affected. However given the relatively high levels of education of Zimbabweans, it will also have a positive impact on their economies at great cost to Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.0/1">Zimbabwe's maize crop was harvested in April/May, but some parts of the country are already in need of food aid. Although the maize crop is 41 per cent. higher than last year's, this is still less than half of the 2001 crop. The Government of Zimbabwe has prepared its appeal for humanitarian assistance, but has committed few resources of its own due to the dire state of the economy. The amount of food requested from the international community is therefore greater than last year.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.0/2">The UN and Non-Governmental Organisations are starting to scale up feeding operations. The World Food Programme fed just over one million people in July and this has increased to 1.5 million in August. Approximately another one million are being fed by other international organisations. The UN predicts that 5.5 million people in Zimbabwe (46 per cent. of the population) will require humanitarian assistance by the end of the year. The UK government has just approved support for another &pound;8 million for food aid through organisations such as CAFOD, Save the Children and Christian Aid. This includes food aid for vulnerable groups such as farm workers, children and the chronically ill. The European Commission has also contributed euro 25 million (of which the UK share is about euro 5 million) to this year's WFP emergency appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.0/3">The UK Government, along with other development partners, is concerned that a new Government of Zimbabwe policy on NGOs could undermine the independence of NGO controlled feeding programme. The UN has already informed Zimbabwe Government that this policy is undermining contributions to this year's emergency appeal. We will be monitoring the situation on the ground carefully and will be prepared to suspend feeding programmes if there are reports of political interference in food distribution.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.3/4" class="indent">Work is continuing within the Office for National Statistics (ONS), taking account of the evaluation of all aspects of the 2001 Census, to gain in particular, a better understanding of differences between the Census results and the previous mid-year population estimates. This research is wide ranging, including address-matching studies in Westminster and Manchester, a review of migration statistics and comparisons of census results with national and local administrative data sources.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.3/5" class="indent">ONS recently published 'A demographic statistics service for the 21st century', a wide ranging review of population statistics issues that set out the areas for development in the next decade.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.3/6" class="indent">More specific research into the future of the census is also underway, considering the modifications that could be made to a traditional census, taking account of the lessons from the 2001 Census and the potential of new technologies. Alternatives to the traditional census approach are also being explored including: a rolling census, covering successive sections of the population each year; a sample census, only covering a percentage of the population; producing statistics from existing person-based data held by government for administrative purposes; or some combination of these. The first phase of this research will result in recommendations being published in late 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.0/4" class="indent">The cost for the 2001 Census in England and Wales, is &pound;207m over the life of the project (1993&ndash;94 to 2005&ndash;06). This cost includes amounts in respect of initial planning, development, for the funding of major tests in 1997 and the conduct of the Census Rehearsal in 1999. Costs also include scheduled contract payments, recruitment and training of all the field staff, the publicity campaign and those incurred in making any final adjustments, prior to live running, to procedures and systems following the Rehearsal.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.0/5" class="indent">Compared to the previous Census in 1991, the 2001 Census incurred additional real costs to cope with increases in the number of households and the increased difficulty in contacting households in today's social conditions. There were also costs resulting from expanding the census outputs to meet more demanding user requirements. However, there were savings derived from the introduction of automation of many processes.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.0/6" class="indent">The 2001 Census included the processing of 100% of responses to all questions, which was a major user requirement. This was not a viable option for the 1981 and 1991 Censuses using the technology available at the time, and for a number of questions only a 10 per cent sample of forms from these Censuses were processed. The cost of the 2001 Census also included the Census Coverage Survey as a key part of the methodology. This was a validation exercise on a much larger scale than the small post-enumeration surveys carried out in previous Censuses.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.0/1">To meet the challenge of modern smugglers, Customs across the UK are changing their tactics and becoming more intelligence-led and less predictable. While it is important to maintain a level of deterrence at all locations&mdash;both at high-traffic, high-risk ports or airports, and at smaller, lower-risk locations&mdash;Customs cannot provide an effective detection capability nor any meaningful deterrence with small numbers of staff on regular and predictable rotas. Flexible, mobile teams can be deployed in larger numbers and with greater impact. Customs managers use risk assessment when deploying these teams to locations in the south and south west where they will have the greater impact on smuggling.</p>

	<p pid=".102W.2/1">The Government offers lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits of the fuel in question, but they also take account of other factors, such as costs of production and supply, and wider social and economic benefits, including fuel security and the potential to encourage the recycling of waste products. In the light of all these factors, we have set a duty incentive of 20 pence per litre in the case of biodiesel and bioethanol. For road fuel gases the incentives, when converted from pence per kilogram to the equivalent pence per litre, are 39.72 pence per litre for natural gases and 40.42 pence per litre for liquefied petroleum gas.</p>
	<p pid=".102W.2/2">It would not, however, be appropriate to compare the duty incentive for biofuels with those for road fuel gases. The latter are directed predominantly at improvement in local air quality rather than as a carbon saving measure. They also face significant market barriers: they require a dedicated and separate re-fuelling infrastructure and vehicles have to be converted or be specifically designed to use gaseous fuels. In contrast, incentives for biofuels are focused on climate change issues and greenhouse gas reductions. Biofuel blends can be supplied through the existing re-fuelling infrastructure and used in existing vehicles.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.5/1">Regulations introduced in April 2001, set minimum nutritional standards for school lunches in maintained schools in England. The standards are based on the four main food groups pictorially represented in the Government's 'Balance of Good Health' diagram, which suggests the types and proportions of foods that make up a balanced diet. Food from the four groups: fruit and vegetables; meat, fish and non-dairy sources of proteins; starchy food; and milk and dairy, are required to be available in schools at lunchtime and allow pupils to choose healthy and enjoyable school lunches. It is the responsibility of local education authorities or, where a budgetary element for school meals is delegated to them, a school's governing body to ensure that the standards are met. School governing bodies and LEAs (as the employer) have a general responsibility for protecting the health and safety of staff and pupils. This responsibility would extend to the quality of school meals.</p>

Many schools and Local Education Authorities (LEAs) offer learning activities after school as part of their study support provision. Funding for study support of &pound;75 million is available this year through Standards Fund grant 206. National Voluntary Youth Organisations (NVYOs) receive funding to promote personal and social education. The NVYO Grant Scheme is a three year cycle of funding. There are 88 NVYOs running 98 projects which receive grants in the current cycle (2002&ndash;05) within a total budget of &pound;18 million (&pound;6 million a year).

	<p pid=".112W.6/1">Provisional statistics on teacher and support staff numbers and teacher vacancies at January 2003 were published in April in &quot;Statistical First Release 10/2003&quot;. Statistics due to be released on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-09">9 September</phrase> will provide regional and LEA level breakdowns of these figures; provisional national figures for January 2004 are due to be published next April. In May this year, in response to concerns about the difficulties some schools are facing as a result of changes to the funding arrangements, my Department liaised with local education authorities (LEAs) to make a broad assessment of the extent to which schools were making changes in their teaching staff complements. This included whether teachers were being made compulsorily redundant, and the possible reasons for changes in staffing, including falling rolls. LEAs' assessments were based on the best information available to them at that time; many told us that definitive information was not available and that the situation was changing rapidly as schools finalised their budgets and their staffing. In addition they advised that a significant number of the redundancy notices were &quot;protective&quot; and were likely to be withdrawn as the situation within schools and the LEA became clearer. My Department will continue to work closely with our national partners, including representatives of teachers, and have regular contact with LEAs.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.0/1">My Department makes available an annual grant which funds UFI's infrastructure and operating costs such as product development. In 2003&ndash;04 UFI has set aside &pound;23.636 million to cover administration costs and &pound;1.818 million to cover buildings costs. UFI does not allocate separate local funds for either administration or buildings.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/2">In 2002&ndash;03 UFI central expenditure on marketing and advertising was:</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/3" class="indent">(a) &pound;10.126 million for marketing</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/4" class="indent">(b) &pound;8.652 million for advertising.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/5">Much of the marketing developed centrally is also used locally by learndirect centres and hubs. Marketing and advertising at local level does however remain the responsibility of learndirect hubs and centres, many of which are private organisations who set their budgets accordingly. No central information is held on this local expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/6">In 2003&ndash;04 UFI have allocated &pound;1.867 million for spend on consultants centrally. UFI uses consultants to support the development of the national learndirect network and does not allocate consultancy budgets at local level.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/7">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC)'s administration budget for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;218 million. This includes provision for expenditure on buildings. No specific amount for such provision is, however, earmarked. How the LSC allocates the &pound;218 million funding for use centrally and locally, the amounts spent on marketing and advertising, and funding allocated for spending on consultants are matters for the Learning and Skills Council. I have therefore asked John Harwood, the Council's Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Gentleman with this information and to place a copy of his reply in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/8">For 2003&ndash;04 my Department has allocated &pound;6.098 million for the salaries and associated administrative costs of staff comprising the Connexions Service National Unit. In addition, &pound;2.625 million has been allocated to the Government Offices for the salary and associated administration costs of their staff managing Connexions.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/9">It is not possible to disaggregate the building costs associated with Connexions Service National Unit staff from the costs of other departmental staff using the same head office building, nor those costs associated with Government Office staff working on Connexions from those associated with other Government Office staff.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/10">When allocating funding locally to Connexions Partnerships no part is ring fenced specifically to meet administration and buildings costs. Partnerships have flexibility to use their funding in a way which best meets local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/11">In 2002&ndash;03 central expenditure on marketing and advertising was:</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/12" class="indent">(a) &pound;1.815 million for marketing</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/13" class="indent">(b) &pound;1.451 million for advertising</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/14">Locally, Connexions Partnerships are able to use their funding flexibility to address their own particular circumstances. Data is collected centrally on the broad areas of Partnerships' expenditure but not at a level detailed enough to enable identification of how much has been spent on marketing and advertising.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/15">No funding is allocated specifically for spending on consultants either nationally or regionally. However budget holders may decide to engage consultants where it is judged to be the most cost-effective method of achieving objectives. When allocating funding locally to Connexions Partnerships no part is ring fenced for consultants. Partnerships have flexibility to use their funding in a way which best meets local needs.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.6/1">Broadband is currently being rolled out through 10 Regional Broadband Consortia (RBCs). Each RBC is developing appropriate connectivity solutions for their area to ensure the Prime Minister's target of having all schools connected to broadband by 2006 is achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.6/2">Where cabling infrastructure is not available, RBCs are successfully deploying a range of other technologies to ensure schools have access to reliable, high bandwidth connectivity. In a number of rural areas for example, wireless technologies such as Satellite and radio are being used effectively to connect schools.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.6/3">The DfES is also supporting the Government's Broadband Aggregation Project announced in July. From next April, nine Regional Aggregation Bodies will aggregate demand and procure broadband across the public sector. This will ensure best value and stimulate supply in areas where very little broadband is currently available.</p>

Floor targets have set clear expectations about minimum acceptable performance levels and these will drive up performance in colleges and providers whose learners currently have the lowest chance of securing the qualifications for which they are aiming. Through their agreed three year development plans, colleges and providers will set out their plans for improving student services and teaching standards. These approaches will benefit all learners, helping ensure more learners receive a high quality learning experience. In particular, they will benefit learners enrolled with colleges and providers whose performance is least good and this will enhance equality of opportunity for learners.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.5/1">The additional cost in employers' national insurance contributions in 2003&ndash;04 for all further education institutions in England is estimated to be &pound;25 million. Further education institutions receive funding for staff costs from a variety of sources, both public and private, so the element of the increase to be covered from public sources will be only a proportion of this. In 2003&ndash;04 assumed total funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council will increase by 6 per cent. in real terms compared with 2002&ndash;03. This places further education colleges in a good position to meet cost increases and invest in improving services for learners and employers.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/2">The likely cost of the increase in national insurance contributions in future years depends on a number of variables including the number of staff employed and the level of their pay. These are matters for colleges to determine within the resources that are available to them. Given this, the Department does not provide estimates of such costs for future years.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.5/1">In 2002&ndash;03 Further Education colleges were allocated &pound;142 million pounds for the Teaching Pay Initiative, and &pound;53 million for the staff development component of the Standards Fund. These funds were consolidated into participation funding for the academic year 2003&ndash;04 and the funding rate was increased by 3.5 per cent. to reflect this. Colleges will receive &pound;138 million from the 3.5% increase. A further &pound;50 million will be allocated to some colleges to meet the costs of implementing increased funding for colleges with high area costs and disadvantage factors, and to fund additional participation through pilots such as those in adult skills and partnerships for progression in 2003&ndash;4.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.5/2">As well as consolidation of these funds, further education colleges will also receive an increase of &pound;63 million or 2 per cent. in their core unit of funding per full time equivalent learner in return for agreeing a three year development plan. The real terms increase in the participation unit of funding, together with the consolidation of previously targeted funds and three year funding agreement, are what colleges were calling for.

In the 2003 Key Stage 2 tests 73 per cent. of 11 year olds achieved the expected level in mathematics, a 14 percentage point increase since 1998.

Through the continuing success of the Key Stage 3 National Strategy, where improving the teaching of mathematics remains a key priority, we expect standards to continue to rise.</p>

The level of Standards Fund allocations will therefore be guaranteed separately. The guaranteed minimum per pupil increase will refer to school budget shares, excluding the part funded through the Learning and Skills Council, for which separate arrangements will be in place as outlined in the statement. The Department is working with local education authorities on the methodology for the guarantee, and aim to issue draft regulations and guidance during the autumn.</p>

Information has been collected on this basis since the 1960s on the Annual Survey of Teachers in Service and Teacher Vacancies (Form 618G).</p>
	<p pid=".135W.5/2">The Department has used regular teachers as its standard definition for the number of teachers in the maintained sector for most purposes since 2000. This provides a stable measure of teacher numbers that is not affected by the relatively large year-on-year fluctuations in the demand for occasional teachers. The number of occasional teachers rose markedly between January 1999 and January 2001 and then fell in both 2002 and 2003. Both regular and occasional teacher numbers continue to be provided in official publications.</p>

It does not appear to the Government that ordinarily the decision of a governing body to set a deficit budget is an act of bad faith such that individual governors would lose the protection of corporate status, and potentially be personally liable. However, such issues clearly turn on their own particular circumstances; and relevant matters would include whether members had conscientiously considered the relevant facts and circumstances, and had not knowingly misled the local education authority.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.9/1">This government aims to improve school laboratories in line with the recommendations of Sir Gareth Roberts report in 2002 on the supply of scientists, so that there are no unsatisfactory laboratories by the end of this spending review period in 2005&ndash;06, and all school laboratories are good or excellent by 2010. Capital funding available for investment in school buildings, including in laboratories, is 3.8 billion this year, and it will rise to over &pound;5 billion by 2005&ndash;06. Most of this funding is allocated by formula to schools and to local education authorities so that they can invest in their school buildings in line with priorities determined locally through a rigorous, transparent and consultative asset management planning process, which reflects local needs and government aims. Guidance to schools and local education authorities on capital funding reflects its aim to improve school laboratories.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.9/2">Further, earlier this year, we launched Building Schools for the Future, which aims to renew all secondary schools in England so that they are suitable for the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century, in ten to fifteen years from 2005&ndash;06, subject to future public spending decisions. This programme includes developing a number of exemplar designs for secondary schools, including laboratory provision, which will reflect our ambitions for schools for the future.</p>

On standards in England, the most comprehensive studies have been the evaluations of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies by Ofsted and by the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, which found that the Strategies have had a significant impact on the standards attained and on the quality of teaching in primary schools. On international comparisons, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study found that children in England are among the most able readers in the world at the age of 10. England was ranked third of the 35 countries involved.</p>

	<p pid=".149W.8/1">The Primary and Key Stage 3 National Strategies are designed to raise standards for all students but include a strong focus on under-achievement. At Primary stage we provide several programmes to help pupils reach the expected level for their age by the end of Key Stage 2, plus targeted local support to schools and LEAs on addressing under-performance. Further measures being introduced this September, such as the Primary Leadership Programme, are also designed to tackle lower attainment. Evidence of the impact of our programmes is reflected in the Key Stage 2 results. The 2003 results show that 75 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the expected level for their age in English and 73 per cent. in maths. This represents a 10 percentage point increase in English and a 14 percentage point increase in maths since 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.8/2">We are using a similar model to address under-performance for pupils aged 11&ndash;14 through the Key Stage 3 Strategy. There are tailored support programmes in each of the three years at Key Stage 3 to help lower-attaining pupils reach the expected level at age 14. We are also targeting schools and LEAs that we believe would benefit from additional support. After only the first full year of the Strategy, the Key Stage 3 tests results stand at their best ever, Maths is up by three percentage points to 70 per cent. achieving level 5 (the expected level) and science and English are both up by one percentage point to 68 per cent.. There have also been improvements in level 6 attainment of four and seven percentage points in maths and science respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.8/3">At Key Stage 4 we are also supporting schools where pupil performance is too low. We are directing substantial resources through Excellence in Cities to transform standards in urban areas facing the challenges associated with cities. We are also supporting schools in difficult circumstances to address under-performance through the Leadership Incentive Grant.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">Unions have a key role in promoting learning and skills in the workplace, and to help them achieve this, the Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1998. The Union Learning Fund is now in its sixth year and has supported over 400 projects from over 50 different unions, working in almost 3,000 workplaces. Many Union Learning Fund projects are specifically aimed at widening participation in learning: basic skills, social inclusion and equal opportunities and improving access to learning. Evaluation up to 2002, together with performance management data for July 2003, has shown that over 36,000 people have completed learning courses, over 6,500 Union Learning Representatives have been trained and around 180 new learning centres have been opened. Unions have been very successful in engaging non-traditional learners including older males and shift workers.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">One of the Union Learning Fund's greatest strengths is the success of Union Learning Representatives, a new type of lay union representative whose main function is to advise union members about their training and development needs. Union Learning Representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly the lowest skilled and those with literacy and numeracy problems. They share a level of trust with union members who would be embarrassed about admitting their learning needs to their employer.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/3">Following a consultation exercise in 2001, we introduced legislation to give Union Learning Representatives the same rights to paid time off for training and for carrying out their duties as those enjoyed by shop stewards and other union representatives at workplaces where a union is recognised for collective bargaining purposes. The legislation on Union Learning Representatives came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-27">27 April</phrase> along with the revised ACAS Code of Practice.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/4">Additional funding for Union Learning for the next two financial years, announced in the last budget, will help us continue to build on the positive contribution made by Union Learning Representatives.</p>

	<p pid=".151W.2/1">The Government published its national Skills Strategy on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-09">9 July</phrase> in 21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential. It is a cross-Government strategy that sets out our approach to meeting skill needs, including making sure that qualifications are appropriate to the needs of businesses. There were frequent discussions between the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry during its development, and was a co-signatory to the White Paper published in July. This close involvement will continue in the implementation stage.</p>
	<p pid=".151W.2/2">At the heart of the strategy is a shared aim that learning programmes and the qualifications that accredit them will respond fully to the skill needs of employers. DTI are closely involved in the joint remit for improving vocational qualifications which is being taken forward by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Learning and Skills Council and Sector Skills Development Agency. The high profile, business-led Modern Apprenticeship Task Force is taking a key role in promoting Modern Apprenticeships to employers, improving their quality and increasing take-up. Sir Robin Young, DTI Permanent Secretary, is a member of the Task Force. A close working relationship is also being established with DTI in promoting the development of foundation degrees to meet the growing demand for skills at the higher technical and associate professional level. The White Paper also set out the intention for the DTI to be joint sponsors of the Sector Skills Development Agency. All of this action demonstrates the close working relationships between the two Departments to ensure that qualifications are appropriate to the needs of employers.</p>

The Government have detailed their vision for achievement in the recently published White Papers covering the development of 14&ndash;19 year olds and the Skills Strategy for 21st Century. These reveal the importance the Government are giving to vocational development from school to the workplace and the need for cohesion between education and the world of work to achieve the challenging target outlined in the reports. The Government launched a Modern Apprenticeship (MA) Task Force, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, in February 2003 to oversee and steer the promotion and integration of modern apprenticeships, including vocational qualifications, into the workplace. This Task Force will report regularly to Government on progress widening the choice for young people to take up modern apprenticeship opportunities.</p>

	<p pid=".153W.9/1">In 1999, in its &quot;working together&quot; framework, the Government set the National Health Service trusts three targets to reduce the number of incidents of violence against NHS staff:</p>
	<p pid=".153W.9/2" class="indent">by April 2000, to have systems in place for recording incidents of violence to staff and publish strategies to achieve reductions in the levels of violence by: 20 per cent. by April 2001&ndash;02; and 30 per cent. by April 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.9/3">A recent National Audit Office (NAO) report, &quot;A safer place to Work &mdash; Protecting NHS Hospital and Ambulance Trust Staff from Violence and Aggression&quot;, reported that:</p>
	<p pid=".153W.9/4" class="indent">around 90 per cent. of NHS trusts have violence policies and systems in place for recording incidents; and</p>
	<p pid=".153W.9/5" class="indent">the majority of NHS trusts did not meet the 2001&ndash;02 target for reducing incidents by 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".153W.9/6">The NAO acknowledged that the increase in reported violent and abusive incidents in the majority of NHS trusts was mainly due to improved reporting rates, generally among NHS staff and in particular increased reporting of verbal abuse. The NAO suggests in its report, and this appears to be reflected in the data held by the Health and Safety Executive, that levels of physical assaults are stabilising.</p>

	<p pid=".162W.11/1">Patients are usually treated with medical therapy or in more serious cases, surgical revascularisation to relieve symptoms of angina. The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) recommends patients receive the following medical therapy:</p>
	<p pid=".162W.11/2" class="indent">sublingual nitrates for immediate treatment control</p>

	<p pid=".162W.11/7">The Priorities and Planning Framework requires that primary care, update practice-based registers so that patients with CHD continue to receive appropriate advice and treatment in line with NSF standards and by March 2006, ensure practice based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking.</p>

The Department and the MRC worked together with Diabetes UK and the Wellcome Trust on the &quot;Review of Current and Future Research on Diabetes&quot;, published in October 2002. The review identified a need for genetics and molecular biology to be brought into large-scale epidemiological studies, with definition of lifestyle and environmental factors.

Where people on the autistic spectrum have mental health problems, they may find mental health day care services helpful. Adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may ask statutory services for an assessment of their social functioning and communications skills in order to establish their level of need.</p>

	<p pid=".165W.5/1">The Learning Disability White Paper, &quot;Valuing People&quot; (Cm 5086), published in March 2001, details training and qualification requirements for staff working with adults and children who have both autism and learning disability. It states that, from April 2002, all new entrants to learning disability care services should be registered for qualification on the learning disability awards framework (LDAF) and that by 2005, 50 per cent. of front-line staff should have achieved at least National Vocational Qualification Level 2.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.5/2">The LDAF contains two vocational qualifications&mdash;a level 2 certificate and a level 3 certificate in working with people with learning disabilities. Both these certificates include a module about autism. The LDAF modules can be used as part of the induction and foundation training that new care staff should undertake.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.5/3">Parent carers of autistic children receive help from local authorities (under section 17 of The Children Act) and the National Health Service on how best they can support their child. This could include skills training, both on an individual basis and in groups. Much of this support is provided in partnership with parents in their own homes and takes into account the family's individual circumstances. Other support available includes the National Autistic Society's &quot;Help&quot; programme, which offers training to parents in caring for their newly diagnosed autistic children. The Government helped to fund the development of this programme.</p>
	<p pid=".165W.5/4">Carers of people with autism may be employed by local authorities, local or national voluntary sector organisations such as the National Autistic Society and the Disabilities Trust or private sector care providers. The wage levels of paid carers are a matter for individual employers and would take account of the grade and experience of the individual staff.</p>

Early diagnosis and early intervention are key issues being addressed as part of the development of the children's national service framework (NSF), which will set national standards for health and social services departments. We have already announced that autism will be used as an exemplar in the NSF. This is being informed by the National Autism Plan for Children which was published in March.</p>

Given that there are some 10,000 wards in use, this is a significant achievement. A number of new hospitals and health care facilities are currently in construction, which will ultimately bring all wards to the required standards.</p>

	<p pid=".169W.2/1">Some of the cancer research funded by Government (an estimated total of &pound;190 million in 2001&ndash;01) is on quality of cancer care. The National Health Service Research and Development Programme on Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO) is currently commissioning projects on the evaluation of cancer services quality with an expected total value of around &pound;0.6 million. The SDO Programme is also funding a &pound;0.4 million project studying patient experience of cancer services. The NHS R&amp;D Health Technology Assessment Programme commissions research on the comparative clinical effectiveness of interventions in cancer care.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.2/2">The NHS Plan set out the intention to make available authoritative, evidence-based guidance on all aspects of NHS cancer care. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence was therefore asked to build on the existing cancer service guidance programme by commissioning a comprehensive package of guidance for cancer services covering all cancers. The Department's policy research programme has funded the evidence-based reviews underpinning the development of this guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".169W.2/3">The findings of the National Cancer Patients Survey were published in July 2002, with 65,500 responses covering all 172 NHS trusts in England with eligible patients agreed to participate in the survey. In this, patients were commenting on treatment they received between July 1999 and June 2000&mdash;before publication of the NHS Cancer Plan in September 2000. The survey provides a benchmark against which implementation of the National Cancer Plan can be monitored.</p>

	<p pid=".172W.12/1">The Department of Health contributes &pound;1 million annually to support a national programme of Sexual Health and HIV research which informs our work to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The current programme does not include specific research into links between HIV and AIDS awareness and the incidence of chlamydia, although we do know that the widespread HIV prevention campaigns of the 1980s did lead to a reduction in the prevalence of many other STIs. Our regular surveys which measure the impact of the Teenage Pregnancy campaign, also provide data on the awareness of STIs among young people. This shows that awareness of HIV is high among this group and that awareness of chlamydia is increasing, possibly as a result of increased publicity on the subject, such as the Government's 'Sex lottery' campaign.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.0/1">The closure of Community Health Councils (CHCs) was first announced in the NHS Plan in July 2000. Since then, this subject has formed part of the discussions Ministers have had with CHC staff and members as part of various visits around the country and there have been meetings with Stakeholder groups, including the Association of Community Health Council in England and Wales and trades unions. Officials in the Department of Health have had similar meetings and local employers and CHC leads have held open meetings to discuss the closure with staff and members.</p>

	<p pid=".179W.2/2">The most significant known risk factor for dementia is age. It is estimated that about 5 per cent. of people over 65 have dementia, rising to about 20 per cent. in the population over 80.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.5/1">District nurses have an important contribution to make in improving health and health care. The implementation of policies to improve access, promote earlier discharge from hospital and the national service framework for older people require district nurses and others to develop their roles. To support their development I launched a strategy for nursing in primary care, in November 2002. 'Liberating the Talents: helping nurses and PCTs deliver the NHS plan' provides a framework for district nurses and other primary care nurses, for developing their roles based on the needs of patients. Workshops on implementing 'Liberating the Talents' have been held for all primary care trusts in England. It is for PCTs to determine locally how to maximise the role of nurses in delivering Government priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.9/1">The majority of laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors takes place in private hospitals, which are regulated by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC), which is currently monitoring developments in this area. Providers of laser eye surgery are required to be registered with the NCSC and to keep records for inspection by the NCSC of each surgical procedure undertaken, including accidents or adverse events. Service providers are subject to annual inspection by the NCSC.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.9/2">The National Health Service does not routinely provide laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors. However, it is considered when a specific clinical need could justify its use. Examples could include adjustment of the refractive error of one eye to make it similar to the other <i>(a)</i> condition known as anisometropia) or patients shown to be severely depressed by the need to wear glasses (and where contact lenses are contra-indicated). These are rare occurrences and are evaluated on an individual patient basis.</p>

	<p pid=".188W.8/1">Since its inception the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has operated under the three guiding principles of putting the consumer first, being open and accessible and being an independent voice. To do this effectively the FSA consults widely before making recommendations, unless urgent action is required, and engages with a plethora of stakeholders as part of its general policy-making process. It uses a wide range of consultative methods such as open/public meetings, specific stakeholder meetings, focus groups, standing consultative groups and questionnaire-based surveys. For formal written consultations, the FSA has published 331 on its website since its establishment in April 2000: 46 between April to December 2000, 80 in 2001, 128 in 2002 and 77 between January to July 2003.</p>

Therefore, it is not possible to express accurately the percentages of the population that are covered. This is due to &quot;list inflation&quot;.

	<p pid=".194W.0/1">The NHS Plan set a target of recruiting an additional 2,000 general practitioners (GPs) between 1999 and 2004. A range of measures have been put in place to increase GP recruitment:</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/2" class="indent">The number of GP registrars has increased from 1,340 in 1997 to 2,070 in March 2003 providing a substantial increase in the number of qualified GPs.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/3" class="indent">The GP Returner Scheme launched in November 2002 provides a clear, supported route back into general practice. Under the scheme returning GPs receive paid, individually tailored refresher training (full- or part-time) a dedicated return co-ordinator with whom they meet regularly, and a contribution towards their professional expenses.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/4" class="indent">The Golden Hello Scheme offers up to &pound;5,000 to new GPs or those returning to practice from the Retainer Scheme, with up to a further &pound;7,000 if they take up post in an area designated as under-doctored. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-29">29 November 2002</phrase> the scheme was extended to qualified doctors who are not currently working in national health service general practice who return to take up an NHS post.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/5" class="indent">In November 2002 the Flexible Careers Scheme, which only applied to hospital doctors, was extended to offer GPs new options to work more flexibly, to work part-time and to give them a route back to practice when they want to return to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/6" class="indent">The NHS Delayed Retirement Scheme (formerly Golden Goodbye Scheme) which pays &pound;2,000 per year to GPs between the ages of 60 and 64 inclusive who continue to work in a substantive primary care post.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/7" class="indent">Increased funding for locum cover for family doctors for maternity, paternity and adoptive leave.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/8" class="indent">A &pound;22 million training package to increase the number of GP trainers and training practices.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/9" class="indent">A &pound;55 million package to improve primary care premises in deprived parts of the country including new premises to train and employ more GPs.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/10">Alongside these initiatives there is the new general medical services contract, which will provide GPs with the opportunities and funding to improve their working lives by allowing them to opt out of providing out-of-hours arrangements and additional services. This will make it easier for them to work flexibly and move in and out of salaried and independent contractor status and enable a new portfolio approach to career development which will make it easier for GPs to adapt their career to suit their aspirations.</p>
	<p pid=".194W.0/11">We are now starting to see significant increases in the number of GPs. In the six months to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, GP numbers grew by 500. 1,240 of the NHS Plan target has now been delivered and we expect to see further increases as these measures take effect.</p>

	<p pid=".200W.5/1">There are two kinds of test that can be performed to determine whether an HIV-infected patient has a drug-resistant strain of the virus. Genotypic testing, which involves identifying mutation in the viral genetic material, has been adopted for widespread clinical use and is undertaken by specialist clinical virology laboratories. Mutations are associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs and this information can be used to predict which drugs are likely to work for a particular individual. Phenotypic testing is more complex, requires high-containment laboratory facilities, and is not routinely available in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid=".208W.2/1">The Department of Health does not publish guidelines on what should be recorded in a patient's medical record; the judgment of what is relevant is left to the responsible health care professionals. However, the General Medical Council (GMC) in its 'Good Practice' guidance provides general advice on the use and content of medical records.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/2">At present the patient's total national health service medical record consists of a series of paper sub-records divided according to the organisations where the patient has received health care. This means that a patient could have a record for each hospital and other health organisation he/she has attended as well as a general practitioner record. The health care professionals of each organisation are responsible for compiling and maintaining the medical records.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/3">Should the patient's health care professional judge that some information, from whatever source, could make a contribution to the patient's health care, then it would be appropriate for it to be included in the patient's medical record. The fact the information is contained in the medical record is accepted as having been vetted by health care professionals and relevant to the patient's health and care. The patient cannot at present ask for information from an external source to be added to the medical record.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/4">Work currently being taken forward by the national programme for information technology will provide an electronic summary record for each patient in England. This record will either hold or provide access to the key information provided by all NHS organisations involved in the patient's care.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/5">A section of this record will be under the patient's control. They will be able to add comments, including information from third parties (with or without medical qualification), to their records to ensure those records will contain the views and information that they wish to have, in addition to the normal information provided by the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".210W.2/1">The latest information available on electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is that contained in the Department of Health's publication, &quot;Statistical Bulletin Electro Convulsive Therapy: Survey Covering the Period from January 2002 to March 2002, England&quot;. This was a follow-up to an earlier survey of the period January to March 1999. Both surveys were undertaken to provide data on ECT that are not currently available elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/2">The 2002 survey confirmed the continuing downward trend in the number of administrations of ECT. It collected information from national health service and independent sector care settings, including nursing homes, on the total number of administrations of ECT in NHS and independent sector care settings including data on sex, age ethnicity, legal status and method of consent. It found that in the period January to March 2002:</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/3" class="indent">2,300 patients received ECT treatment compared to 2,800 in 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/4" class="indent">there were 700 male patients receiving treatment, compared with 1,600 female patients;</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/5" class="indent">there were 12,800 administrations of ECT compared to 16,500 in January to March 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/6" class="indent">the ethnic group with the highest number of patients receiving ECT treatment was 'white', that is white British, Irish or from other white background, with 1,800 of the 2,300 who received ECT treatment;</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/7" class="indent">the ethnic group with the lowest number of patients receiving ECT treatment was the 'multi-ethnic origin' group with six of the 2,300 who received ECT treatment. However, the rates for this and some other ethnic groups were based on very small numbers of patients; and</p>
	<p pid=".210W.2/8" class="indent">the spread of the ECT patients among the various ethnic groups was broadly similar to the spread seen in the general population. However, it should be noted the ethnicity category 'not stated' accounted for 18 per cent. of all ECT patients in this survey, more than twice the rate in the 1999 survey. Comparing only those patients receiving ECT whose ethnic origin was reported, 96 per cent. were white, similar to the results from the 1999 survey. However, the proportion of the general population who are white is slightly down to 91 per cent. compared with 92.7 per cent. in 1999. Further information on the ethnicity of ECT patients can be found in Table 8 of the 2002 Survey.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.5/1">The Government's agenda for modernising mental health services in England includes a modern service framework, which sets national standards for the delivery of modern services; a thorough review of the legislative basis for mental health care to reflect modern patterns of treatment and care; and significant additional investment of over &pound;300 million to support the delivery of these targets and services.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.5/2">More detailed information about the mental health modernisation programme can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth">www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth</a>. However, to summarise briefly, the programme includes action to reduce suicide rate and deaths by undetermined causes by 20 per cent. by 2010; reduce the duration of untreated psychosis to a service median of less than three months, (individual maximum less than six months) and providing support for the first three years for all young people who develop a first episode of psychosis by 2004; offer 24-hour crisis resolution to all eligible patients by 2005; deliver assertive outreach to the 20,000 adult patients with severe mental illness and complex problems who regularly disengage from services by December 2003; increase breaks available for carers and strengthening carer support and networks to the benefit nationally of approximately 165,000 carers of people on the care programme approach by 2004; improve mental health care in prisons so that all prisoners with severe mental illness have a care plan by April 2004 (approximately 5,000 prisoners nationally) and ensure appropriate use of secure and forensic facilities by 2004, contributing to the national target of moving 400 patients from high secure hospitals by 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".216W.5/3">The Department aims to expand the mental health workforce by employing 1,000 new graduate workers in primary care, 500 community mental health &quot;Gateway&quot; workers, 700 more staff to support carers, 300 prison in-reach staff, 400 staff to support secure step-down by 2004; and 300 extra prison in-reach staff, 500 community development workers for black and minority ethnic communities, 200 staff and six outreach teams for personality disorder and training of 3,000 support, time, recovery, &quot;STR&quot; workers by 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".216W.5/5">The Department is also committed to ensuring that, by April 2004, protocols are in place across all health and social care systems for the care and management of older people with mental health problems; and that all child and adolescent mental health services provide comprehensive service including mental health promotion and early intervention by 2006.</p>

In pursuance of this target, all regular carers of people with mental health problems will have been identified, received an assessment and have their own care support plans by 2004 and local support networks for these carers will have been developed.

	<p pid=".232W.5/1">The Government have made a commitment to developing greater diversity and plurality in healthcare provision in the future. This means that the national health service will be able to explore a range of options to help it deliver shorter waiting times and increase patient choice. These options include more effective use of the independent sector in the United Kingdom, innovative use of capacity in the NHS, and using NHS and independent sector diagnosis and treatment centres. The policy is that wherever possible the NHS should seek to attract overseas providers to the UK. However, where it makes sense in terms of value for money and convenience for patients, overseas treatment does offer a further means to add to the capacity of the NHS, to reduce waiting times and extend the choice available to patients.</p>

For emergency care, distance standards would be similar to those for other National Health Service emergency services.

	<p pid=".236W.3/1">The average cost of a call to NHS Direct is currently about &pound;18.00, although this is expected to fall further in the future as call volumes rise. The National Audit Office has found that half of callers are directed to forms of care they would not have chosen and that this tends to be care of a lower level and cost of intervention. More than half of NHS Direct costs are saved in this way.</p>

	<p pid=".238W.3/1">The Department of Health monitors and manages the performance of the national health service in the delivery of the key targets set out in the NHS Plan. In addition, the NHS is subject to external independent audit by the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office. They publish a number of studies each year on the value for money of aspects of the NHS. The Department of Health considers each of these reports, and implements their recommendations where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.3/2">The Counter Fraud Service, now Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS), was formed in September 1998, with a remit to tackle fraud and corruption within the NHS. It established a risk measurement programme to carry out an exhaustive examination of valid samples of cases in each area of NHS spending and to produce statistically robust estimates of fraud accurate to plus or minus 1 per cent. of losses. These exercises are among the first of such exercises to be undertaken anywhere in the public or private sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.3/3">The first measurement exercise concentrated on patient fraud. To deter and prevent patient evasion of NHS charges and to increase the anti-fraud culture, point of dispensing and point of treatment checks were introduced. These checks require patients to provide proof of exemption to charges. The measurement exercises have already demonstrated a reduction in fraudulently claimed exemption to these charges from approximately &pound;170 million to &pound;109.17 million per year, a reduction of 36 per cent. since 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.3/4">Over 1,400 cases of potential fraud have been detected and investigated. This has resulted in 160 successful criminal prosecutions with 98 per cent. success rate, 215 civil and disciplinary sanctions have been applied and over &pound;14 million recovered. Additionally, over &pound;31 million of fraud has been identified and stopped.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.3/5">As action takes place to counter fraud in the NHS the measurement process will be repeated to demonstrate what progress has been made to reduce fraud to an absolute minimum.</p>
	<p pid=".238W.3/6">In addition, governance arrangements have been improved to ensure the necessary standards of accountability, probity and openness through the introduction in 1999 of the Controls Assurance Standards.</p>

	<p pid=".247W.2/1">The Government is implementing a range of measures to increase the numbers of staff working in the national health service, including practice nurses. These include an increase in pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer through the &quot;Improving Working Lives and Positively Diverse&quot; programmes, increasing training commissions, reducing student attrition, running national and local recruitment and return to practice campaigns, and supporting international recruitment where appropriate. In addition, we have recently developed a dedicated NHS Careers factsheet on practice nursing, to promote further careers and opportunities in this field. A copy of the factsheet is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".247W.2/2">As a result of these measures, there are now over 2,500 more practices nurses working in the NHS since 1997 (NHS Workforce Census). This has contributed in helping to meet the NHS Plan target for 20,000 more nurses two years ahead of schedule.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.2/1">The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in childhood obesity and we have put in place cross-Government programmes of work to improve diet and nutrition and increase physical activity levels. Commitments for action on obesity, diet and physical activity are outlined in the NHS plan and the national service frameworks, particularly those outlining action on coronary heart disease and diabetes.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/2">The Department of Health is leading on developing a cross-Government food and health action plan.

These initiatives will be of direct relevance to the prevention and management of obesity in children and adults.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/3">Current action on diet includes initiatives to increase breastfeeding (breastfed babies may be less likely to become obese later in life than formula fed babies); reform of the welfare foods programme to use the resources more effectively to ensure children in poverty have access to a healthy diet; a five-a-day programme which includes the National School Fruit Scheme; the Healthy School Programme; the Food in School programme and nutritional standards for school lunches. Work is also under way with the food industry to improve the overall balance of diet including salt, fat and sugar in food, working with the Food Standards Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.2/4">Current action on physical activity includes the transformation over the next three years of physical education, school sport and club links and the building and refurbishment of physical education and sports facilities in schools. In addition, the Department of Health, together with Sport England and the Countryside Agency is leading on a local exercise action pilots (LEAP) programme, which includes children and young people as one of its target groups.</p>

	<p pid=".251W.2/1">Pain management is an important component of most patients' care. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report on pain services, published in 2000, highlighted variations in access to pain services throughout the country. The report made recommendations to National Health Service acute trusts and commissioners on how pain services should be delivered in order to reduce the variations to access. It recommended that primary care trust commissioners should review local provision of pain services, looking particularly at the provision of more specialised treatments on a networked basis. In this review, account should be taken of the needs of both adults and children, and include patients with acute pain resulting from sudden illness or accident, as well as post-operative pain and chronic pain. Trusts should agree with commissioners the services that are appropriate to meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".251W.2/2">All medicines are assessed before licensing by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with independent expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). A licence will not be granted unless the MHRA and the CSM are satisfied that the medicine meets appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy at the time of licensing.</p>
	<p pid=".251W.2/3">Details of the different classes of medicines used in the treatment of persistent pain and their side effects are contained within the British National Formulary (section 4.7, page 208, BNF 45, March 2003), a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".258W.3/1">This Government are committed to reducing population average intakes of salt, and as 75 per cent. of the salt comes from processed foods, has called on industry to take a meaningful lead in reducing the salt content of processed foods. The Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) 2002 Annual Report urged:</p>
	<p pid=".258W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;the food industry&mdash;including manufacturers, retailers and caterers to drive down the salt content of food&mdash;a potentially life saving measure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.3/3">The Department along with the Food Standards Agency is holding meetings with food sectors representing the main contributors to salt intake and other key stakeholders to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.3/4">CMO endorses and supports the recommendation to reduce the population average intake of salt, which is the principle source of sodium, from 9g to 6g/day and the recent recommendations for children's salt intake by the Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition. Even a small reduction in sodium intake can help to reduce the burden of high blood pressure, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in our population.</p>

	<p pid=".258W.6/1">The Department of Health is committed to providing equality of opportunity in all aspects of its work. All policy development must support the core principles of the NHS Plan, one of which states that the national health service of the 21st century must be responsive to the needs of different groups and individuals within society and challenge discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality.</p>
	<p pid=".258W.6/2">While as yet there is no official published Directive text, once a draft Directive is put forward by the European Commission (EC) the United Kingdom Government will aim to work positively and constructively with the EC and other member states on extending the existing sex discrimination legislation to cover goods and services and to ensure that the final agreement fully reflects UK priorities and concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".262W.9/1">The Chief Medical Officer's report should leave no-one in any doubt that second-hand smoke is an important public health issue, and the Government are looking very closely at the Chief Medical Officer's recommendations. We wish to ensure real progress is being made in the availability of smoke-free public places.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.9/2">In our 1998 White paper, &quot;Smoking Kills&quot;, we agreed that completely smoke-free places are the ideal. The World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which the UK signed in June 2003, also called for action to protect people from tobacco smoke. Taking action on smoking in the workplace and in public places is an important element of international best practice in tobacco control.</p>
	<p pid=".262W.9/3">We also want to increase the public's awareness of the real health risks from second-hand smoke: not merely the discomfort caused by being in a smoky atmosphere. That is why we have launched an education campaign, making everyone aware of the need to protect others, particularly children, from the harm caused by second-hand smoke. From <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the Department of Health has also taken a lead in making all our buildings smoke-free and we will be encouraging others to follow this lead.</p>

	<p pid=".267W.6/2">The suicide rate for the single year 2001, the most recent available, was the lowest recorded. The European Age Standardised Rate in 2001 was 8.9 per 100,000 population, a decrease of 5 per cent. on 2000 which was 9.3. There was also a fall in mental health in-patient suicide in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".267W.6/3">As the only full-year figures we have since the publication of the &quot;Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&quot; strategy are for 2000 and 2001, it is still too early to assess progress in meeting this target. Current trends do not as yet provide a robust indication of the effect of the strategy. If the trend of the last three years continues, then the target will be met, however this is much too short a period from which to extrapolate a robust trend.</p>

We have set targets to reduce the waiting between referral and first out-patient appointment in all cases to 16 weeks by <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Each year maximum waiting times will fall so that, by the end of 2005, the first out-patient appointment will be cut to three months. Urgent cases will continue to be treated much faster.

Together, these emphasise the importance of innovative solutions to maintain local access to services while achieving compliance with the WTD.

	<p pid=".273W.2/2">To assist trusts in meeting the WTD and to support increases in consultant numbers the Department has increased significantly the number of specialist registrar (SpR) training opportunities, including 80 in accident and emergency. I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-17">17 July 2003</phrase> that postgraduate deans will be instructed to give priority to hospitals facing WTD challenges when considering the allocation of 1,500 additional locally funded SpR training opportunities available this year. This will ensure that training posts are focused on those hospitals under the greatest pressure in complying with the WTD. Further training posts will also be approved where this can help trusts with compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.2/3">Successful implementation of the WTD will mean staff working differently. A programme of 19 pilot projects has been set up to develop and test innovative solutions to implementing the WTD. The &quot;Hospital at Night&quot; pilot project utilises a central multi disciplinary emergency team to provide cover across the hospital at night.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.3/1">In the United Kingdom, 296 coastal lifeboats are provided for front line search and rescue purposes by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) which, as a charity, receives no Government funding. In addition, there are 42 independent rescue boats which are made available for search and rescue purposes. These boats are usually part of local charitable organisations or privately funded and again receive no Government funding.</p>

	<p pid=".280W.7/13"><sup>(88)</sup> In the calculation of the trade gap the values of exports and imports are measured slightly differently. For exports, values include the costs allowed under &quot;free on board&quot; which refers to the total export values of goods leaving the country. For imports, values include the costs allowed under &quot;cost insurance freight&quot; which refers to the total value of the goods imported into the UK. Thus for imports into the UK the cost of transportation between the port or place of dispatch and the UK port or place of importation is included. As a result imports are overstated relative to exports by about 5 per cent. The figures are not seasonally adjusted.</p>

	<p pid=".281W.6/1">The central thrust of the Department's efforts to raise awareness of environmental regulations and legislation is the NetRegs project. NetRegs aims to provide clear and coherent guidelines for businesses (principally small/medium-sized businesses) on environmental legislation, and how to comply with it. Sector-specific guidelines for 100 industry sectors will be available on its website (<a href="http://www.netregs.gov.uk">www.netregs.gov.uk</a>) by the time the project finishes at the end of March 2004; currently there are guidelines for over 55 business sectors already published on the site. NetRegs is a partnership between the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Environment and Heritage Service Northern Ireland, and the DTI. It is funded by the Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.6/2">To publicise NetRegs to its target audience, the NetRegs team has successfully engaged the support of the relevant trade media, associations, and business support organisations in 'spreading the word' on a sector-by-sector basis, as each sector's guidelines are launched on the website. So far NetRegs has generated over 700 pieces of media coverage since October 2002 and over 180 organisations have to date actively supported and or promoted the site.</p>
	<p pid=".281W.6/3">Defra also undertakes initiatives in relation to specific areas of new legislation. For example, between September 2002 and February 2003 Defra, DTI and the Small Business Service ran over 30 seminars across the UK to raise awareness of the European Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), which must be transposed into UK legislation by the summer of next year.</p>

	<p pid=".282W.3/1">Antibiotics cannot be used in animal feed unless they are authorised either as veterinary medicinal products or as zootechnical feed additives (which are used as growth promoters).</p>
	<p pid=".282W.3/2">The Government recognises the important role that authorised antibiotics play in maintaining animal health and welfare. However it takes very seriously the possibility of their contributing to the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans. The Government has therefore developed a comprehensive strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of antimicrobial products and reducing the overall pool of antibiotic use in animals. A key element in this strategy is promoting the prudent use of authorised antibiotic medicines and feed additives in animal husbandry.</p>
	<p pid=".282W.3/3">The Government is satisfied that the four feed additives authorised as antibiotic growth promoters are not related to any therapeutic antibiotics currently used in human or animal medicine. However it supports the phasing out of these products on a precautionary basis from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> under new EU legislation on Feed Additives coming into effect next year. The Government believes that this provides sufficient time for the industry to introduce new husbandry methods before the authorisations for antibiotic growth promoters are withdrawn. Defra is working closely with the industry's Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture (RUMA) alliance in drawing up plans to assist industry to adjust to the loss of these products from January 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.2/1">European Community legislation lays down procedures for controlling avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in EU member states. The measures taken by the Dutch, Belgian and German authorities and endorsed by the European Commission follow the rules laid down in this legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/2">Following the confirmation of AI in the Netherlands and Belgium in March and April 2003 respectively, the Dutch and Belgian authorities imposed a standstill on the transport of live poultry and hatching eggs within those countries. The Dutch and Belgian authorities also stopped their exports of live poultry, hatching eggs and fresh unprocessed and non-heat treated poultry manure and litter. In May 2003, AI was also confirmed in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and the German authorities took similar action. In each instance the European Commission put in place Community legislation to reinforce the action taken by the countries concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/3">In each case following the confirmation of AI, Defra issued Declarations under domestic animal health legislation to ban imports of live poultry, hatching eggs, racing/show pigeons, fresh unprocessed and non-heat-treated poultry manure or litter and dead day-old chicks from the Netherlands, Belgium and the affected part of Germany. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also introduced similar Declarations. EU legislation does not permit trade in fresh poultry meat if it was obtained from poultry originating in established surveillance zones in those countries. In light of Germany and Belgium's confirmation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-26">26 June</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-16">16 July 2003</phrase> respectively, that there had been no further outbreaks and that the disease had been successfully eradicated, restrictions were lifted from Belgium and the affected part of Germany. Defra revoked the declarations and have informed the trade that they can import live poultry, hatching eggs, racing/show pigeons and fresh unprocessed and non-heat treated poultry manure and litter from the whole of Germany and Belgium.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-22">22 July 2003</phrase>, Defra issued a Declaration lifting all import restrictions on live poultry, their hatching eggs and racing/show pigeons from the Netherlands except from the area between the provinces of Utrecht and Gelderland and the area North of Limburg in the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/5">The European Commission is keeping all member states informed of the AI situation in the Netherlands. The Government are satisfied that the German, Dutch and Belgian authorities have done all that was needed to control the disease. Defra will continue to monitor the situation in the Netherlands.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/6">Officials have reviewed and updated the AI contingency arrangements. In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in the UK, the structures, frameworks and systems that are set out in Defra's Foot and Mouth Disease Contingency Plan will be put in place as appropriate. In support of these plans are operational instructions detailing the actions to be taken to deliver the plan. As part of the review of our state of readiness, we have taken powers which would allow a pre-emptive or firebreak cull should that be necessary (The Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease (England and Wales) Order 2003).</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/7">Defra has also kept the industry informed and up to date information on the AI situation may be obtained from the Defra website. Defra also reminded egg and poultry producers in the UK about the need for stringent biosecurity measures at all times. Officials asked poultry producers in the UK to be vigilant for any signs of respiratory disease in birds and contact their local veterinary office immediately if they have any concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".284W.2/16"><sup>(89)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.0/1">If the over-thirty-month rule is amended, the costs of testing for BSE over-thirty-month cattle for sale for human consumption would be shared by Government and industry. The Government will pay for the rapid test kit and the testing process. The precise cost is commercially sensitive but it is within the EU's state aid limit of 40 euros. Abattoirs will pay for the sampling, packaging and transportation of samples to laboratories and other in-abattoir costs. A significant number of abattoirs have indicated that they may be interested in slaughtering cattle aged over-thirty-months if the rule is amended.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.3/1">The Over-30-Month Scheme (OTMS) provides an outlet for cattle which are excluded from the food chain by the Over-30-Month (OTM) Rule. The Food Standards Agency has carried out a review of the OTM Rule, and has advised the Government that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the OTM Rule by BSE testing of cattle older than 30 months in two stages. Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food supply, after being tested for BSE, at the earliest from January 2004, with the possibility of complete replacement of the Rule by testing from July 2005. The Government are considering this advice. Any change to the OTM Rule is likely to lead to parallel changes to the OTMS.</p>

	<p pid=".288W.12/1">I have discussed with the Countryside Agency the way in which it manages its finances in view of the &quot;hold&quot; placed on some budgets, including Vital Villages, at the start of this financial year. This was done by the Agency because of the very high level of applications received and the consequent need to target money at the areas of greatest need, but it is unfortunate that this caused uncertainty to a number of organisations who were dependent on the Countryside Agency grant for continuity of their work. I am drawing to the attention of the Agency and other organisations funded by Defra the requirements on finance contained in the Government's compact with the Voluntary Sector. It should be noted that the Agency's grant in aid has been significantly increased this year.</p>
	<p pid=".288W.12/2">It is for the Countryside Agency to manage its finances within the budgets set for it and has been doing so against the background both of the major and novel task of access mapping, whose costs depend on public responses which are hard to predict, and of the demand-led nature of its major grant programmes. Despite these factors the budget for Vital Villages has been held to the level set at the start of the year. Budgets have also been agreed for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>

However, the Agency has assured me that rather than cuts to the Rural Transport Partnership scheme, the budget for 2003&ndash;04 has been increased by &pound;2 million since the original budget announcement. Demand for the scheme has been high and the funds available have had to be shared among as many projects as possible.

It explains that buyers should ensure that specifications do not discriminate against or prevent local businesses from competing in the supply market, while pointing out that the EC Treaty and EC procurement directives do not permit discrimination on the basis of nationality. The guidance is aimed at the public sector as a whole and should help to increase the opportunities for local and UK producers to compete for public sector contracts.

	<p pid=".290W.8/1">The Government recognises the benefits of local food and is keen to encourage a flourishing local food sector. Over the last 12 months, we have made provision under the England Rural Development Programme for grants for activities such as the establishment of farmers' markets and other direct sales outlets, the development of local branding initiatives and the formation of collaborative groups to market produce. Defra has also helped to finance workshops organised by the IGD designed to bring together supermarkets and small local producers to explore how barriers to local sourcing can be overcome. One practical area where the Government can have a direct effect on the local food sector is public procurement. Defra has published guidance on its website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/ sustain/procurement/index.htm</a>) that, among other things, should help to increase the opportunities for local and UK producers to compete for public sector contracts. We have asked Government Departments to produce their own action plans on public procurement. We are also encouraging local authorities to do the same.</p>
	<p pid=".290W.8/2">We have recently drawn up a local food policy paper examining the rationale for public support and setting out a framework within which support will be given. The paper is published on the following website address: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/specialfoods/localfood/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/specialfoods/localfood/index.htm</a>.The framework focuses on added value at national level, the public procurement initiative and spreading best local food practice nationwide. We will also continue to deploy our various funding schemes to encourage a flourishing local food sector. This activity will complement measures at a regional level which the Regional Development Agencies will be implementing as part of their wider food and drink strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.2/1">Local trade fairs and farmers' markets are an excellent way to raise awareness about local and regional food. In the last 12 months, we have made provision under the England Rural Development Programme for grants for projects promoting farmers' markets and other direct sales outlets. For example, within this period we have awarded 100,256 to the National Association of Farmers' Markets to raise the profile of farmers' markets across England and increase public awareness of them. In addition, in November last year Lord Whitty wrote to all Local Authorities outlining the benefits farmers' markets bring and the role they play in bringing urban and rural communities together. Finally, Defra provides funding to Food from Britain, which has responsibility for promoting the production and consumption of quality regional food and drink. One of the measures for doing this is by providing business support, through the network of Regional Food Groups, to those producers wishing to exhibit at trade fairs both at a local and national level.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.3/1">There are no specific measures in place to maintain the UK market share of indigenous fruit and vegetables. However, Defra funds strategic research and development, worth some &pound;11 million pa, which helps our fruit and vegetables producers to increase their competitiveness. Growers can also take advantage of assistance available under the England Rural Development Programme and other grant schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.6/1">This Department is committed to supporting the growing of energy crops in England. We have allocated &pound;29 million under the Energy Crops Scheme to support the planting of short rotation coppice (SRC) and miscanthus, and the setting up of producer groups to supply SRC to energy end-users. &pound;3.5.million has been allocated to develop supply chains for energy crops and woodfuel, from harvest to energy end-users. Energy crops can be planted on set-aside land and receive payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.6/2">&pound;66 million is available to develop markets for biomass, including energy crops, in heat, combined heat and power, and power generation. Officials are working closely with project developers and others, including the Local Support Teams set up under the Countryside Agency's Community Renewables Initiative, to promote the potential of energy crops. Recently, over 200 farmers attended one such event near Swindon. The co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels is permitted under the Renewables Obligation. To encourage the market for transport biofuels, which can be produced from energy crops, the Government introduced a cut in the duty rate for biodiesel in July 2002 and has announced the intention to cut the duty rate for bioethanol in January 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.2/1">An assessment of the environmental performance of various alternative fuels, including LPG, was carried out by the Cleaner Vehicles Task Force in 2000. The research showed that LPG can have air quality benefits over conventional fuels in terms of reduced emissions of particulates and oxides of nitrogen, and reduced noise, although progress with conventional engine and fuel technologies is reducing this advantage. A copy of the report &quot;The environmental impacts of road vehicles in use&quot; is available on the Department for Transport's website, at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dftroads/documents/page/dft">www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft roads/documents/page/dft</a> roads 506888.hcsp</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/2">The Government recently published a consultation document seeking views on the future structure of the Government's support for the road fuel gases LPG and natural gas in the short to medium term, to ensure that future support continues to reflect environmental and other policy objectives. A copy of the consultation, which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-17">17 September</phrase>, is available at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dftroads/documents/page/dftroads508355.pdf">www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft roads/documents/page/dft roads 508355.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">An assessment of biodiesel was commissioned by Defra from Sheffield Hallam University in 2001. The report found that emissions of carbon dioxide are significantly reduced for biodiesel compared to conventional diesel. Consistent air quality benefits from biodiesel in terms of emissions of particulates and oxides of nitrogen have not been established. A copy of the report &quot;Evaluation of the comparative energy, global warming and socio-economic costs and benefits of biodiesel&quot; is available on the Defra website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/projectdata/DocumentLibrary/NF0422/nf0422.pdf">www. defra.gov.uk/science/project data/DocumentLibrary/NF0422/nf0422.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/4">A number of reports show that life cycle emissions of carbon dioxide are significantly lower for a range of vehicle types run on bioethanol compared to petrol or diesel. Research includes &quot;Energy and Greenhouse gas balance of biofuels for Europe&mdash;An update&quot;, CONCAWE, April 2002 and &quot;Well-to-wheel analysis of energy use and the greenhouse gas emissions of advanced fuel/vehicle systems&mdash;A European Study&quot;, L-B-Systemtechnik Consultancy, September 2002. Research has also been carried out on local air quality benefits. An assessment of the emissions performance of bioethanol undertaken by AEA Technology plc (Ethanol Emissions Testing, March 2002) was published by the Department for Transport. The report found that tailpipe emissions of particulates are significantly reduced for bioethanol compared to petrol but as petrol engines are very low emitters of particulates, the large reduction in emissions from bioethanol results in only a marginal improvement in air quality. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen are not significantly changed compared to petrol.</p>

	<p pid=".299W.5/1">The principal aim of the Convention on the Future of Europe, as set out in the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, is to address the following issues:</p>
	<p pid=".299W.5/2" class="indent">a better division and definition of competence in the European Union;</p>
	<p pid=".299W.5/3" class="indent">simplification of the Union's instruments;</p>
	<p pid=".299W.5/4" class="indent">more democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union;</p>
	<p pid=".299W.5/5" class="indent">a Constitution for European Citizens&mdash;not changing but simplifying existing Treaties.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.5/6">The draft EU Constitution does not extend Community Competence over fisheries, but clarifies the present situation. We support the current framework because effective management of fisheries requires close international co-operation, and the Common Fisheries Policy provides this. If the CFP has failings, the answer is to negotiate improvements, as we did at the Council last December.</p>

	<p pid=".300W.0/1">EU enlargement represents a considerable expansion of the single market. The increase in the size of the single market presents UK producers with additional markets for their output as well as potential competitors for current markets. However, the implications for UK producers are not expected to be significant in the short term, both because of the continued application of CAP market measures and because trade liberalisation between the EU 15 and CE 10 is already well under way.</p>
	<p pid=".300W.0/2">In the longer term the effect of enlargement will depend, in large part, on rates of productivity growth, and we have commissioned a detailed study to examine this issue. The objective of this project is to analyse the potential for changes in relative productivity growth in the new member states and the existing EU and the impact that this will have on agricultural markets. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year and will be published.</p>

	<p pid=".304W.2/1">Defra provides grant aid as a percentage of eligible costs to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities in England&mdash;the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and internal drainage boards&mdash;to assist with capital works and studies to manage flood risk. Since May 1997 approximately 800 such capital construction projects have been approved by Defra for grant and/or completed by the operating authorities. However information is not held centrally as to whether these defences were adjustable or not. I regret this information could not be provided except at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.2/2">The Environment Agency is by far the largest flood risk operating authority in England, being empowered to manage flood risk from all rivers designated as &quot;main&quot; and from the sea. The agency undertakes analyses both upstream and downstream of new defences, both adjustable and fixed, prior to construction in order to understand the river regime. These &quot;river models&quot; provide a tool for understanding how different types of flood defence structure can influence the river regime and assist in the final selection and detailed design processes. By undertaking this in advance of construction any potential adverse impacts should be avoided or minimised.</p>
	<p pid=".304W.2/3">Unless particular circumstances arise it is not usual to revisit river models soon after the construction of new defences given the pre-construction activities. However, periodic modelling of many rivers/locations is undertaken through other agency activities such as periodic reviews of defence performance and improvement strategies, broad scale modelling for flood mapping, flood risk assessments and catchment flood management plans.</p>

These strategies are implemented through maintenance regimes and capital improvement works, and are subject to regular review. Responsibility for maintenance of other flood defences in Lincolnshire rests with the agency, local authorities or internal drainage boards.</p>

We propose that Government funding of the Environment Agency's flood defence service should in future come from a single stream of Defra block grant which will replace the existing requirement to approve individual projects for capital grant and the levies currently paid by local authorities to the Agency. These changes will provide more assured flood defence funding for the Agency and allow better long-term planning. The introduction of block grant to replace individual project approvals relies on successful passage of provisions in the Water Bill and, subject to this, we aim to implement the changes as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".305W.5/1">Fluorine is a natural environmental contaminant and both feeding stuffs and water for livestock contain fluorides. Some fertilisers and ingredients of livestock and poultry diets contain relatively high concentrations of fluorides. Drinking water limits are designed to accommodate exposure to other sources of fluorides in the diet and in the environment. The best available evidence suggests that safe upper fluoride concentrations in livestock and poultry drinking water are up to 2 mg/l.</p>
	<p pid=".305W.5/2">If the water fluoridation provisions in the Water Bill before Parliament were enacted, all local farmers or their representative organisations would be able to participate in public local consultations. There would be no new water fluoridation schemes unless the majority of the local population were in favour. Arrangements for the conduct of local consultations, and the assessment of public opinion will be set out in regulations under powers in the Water Bill. It will also be possible to alter the target fluoride concentration by statutory instrument.</p>

	<p pid=".308W.0/1">Genomics is a set of technologies central to the public sector investment underpinning crop breeding. The Government fund genomics research through a range of research programmes in Defra, Research Councils, and other Departments. As a technology, the potential of genomics is addressed in relevant strategic plans. In addition, research funders have their own mechanisms to assess the potential of their research both at programme and project level.</p>
	<p pid=".308W.0/2">Defra's current research underpinning crop breeding is informed by a specially commissioned research project that provided an assessment of the potential of publicly-funded genomics research. The project entitled 'The Role of Future Public Research Investment in the Genetic Improvement of UK Grown Crops' was completed in September 2002. The assessment provides a strong rationale for public investment and has informed the Defra Science and Innovation Strategy. It has been widely distributed within the research and crop breeding community, and is available on the Defra website.</p>

	<p pid=".310W.0/1">The first case of phocine distemper virus (PDV) was reported at Anholt, Denmark in May 2002. This was the same place that the previous PDV outbreak in 1988 originated. The epizootic reached the east coast of England in August 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/2">Drawing on the lessons learned during the last outbreak, Defra helped voluntary organisations prepare and cope with the PDV outbreak as it hit UK waters. Discussions were held about the disposal and vaccinations options for seal carcases and the resulting guidance notes were published along with other useful information on the dedicated Defra PDV website (<a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/ewd/seals/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/ewd/seals/index.htm</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/3">Defra commissioned the Institute of Zoology (Zoological Society of London) to monitor, report and produce information about the progress of the virus. The helpline was funded by Defra and the Devolved Administrations. We worked closely with voluntary organisations and other Government Departments, including The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), The Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Scottish Executive Environment Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD), National Assembly for Wales Agriculture Department (NAWAD), The Department of Environment (Northern Ireland) (DoE NI), and the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU).</p>
	<p pid=".310W.0/4">The outbreak was formally declared to be over in the UK at the end of February this year, and was responsible for the deaths of almost 4,000 seals. The Sea Mammal Research Unit continues to monitor seal mortality in UK waters to provide an early warning system for any future outbreaks.</p>

In projecting these trends, analysts will take account of likely levels of world food production, consumption and trade flows. Population changes may influence these trends.</p>

These targets relate to the percentage of household waste sent for recycling, not the amount collected. Individual local authorities are responsible for deciding how to meet these targets in the light of local circumstances which will include settlement patterns, waste characteristics and the market for recycling. Where authorities are contracted to supply paper (and other materials) to selected reprocessors, they will be required to supply materials in the form specified by the reprocessors, which will influence their collection practices.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.2/1">Details of planning applications for proposed facilities which have yet to be determined by the respective local planning authorities are not held centrally. The table gives the number and status, as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-16">16 June 2003</phrase>, of proposed new municipal waste incineration plants in England and Wales of which we are aware. The table contains information shared with the Environment Agency by prospective applicants for pollution control permits. There may also be other planning applications or amendments which have been submitted to local authorities over which the agency has not been consulted. The planning status may have been changed since the data were supplied.</p>
