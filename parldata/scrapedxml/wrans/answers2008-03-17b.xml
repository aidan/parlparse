	<p pid="b.744W.0/3">A carer who receives state pension at a lower rate than carer's allowance can receive an amount of carer's allowance to make up the difference. Carers who are entitled to a rate of state pension equivalent to or more than the rate of carer's allowance cannot receive both benefits. However, entitlement to carer's allowance also attracts the additional amount for carers in pension credit, currently &pound;27.15 per week, for those eligible. More than 220,000 carers in lower-income households are gaining from this measure.</p>

This is a likely explanation for the drop in count of FCEs in 2006-07 compared to the data received in previous years.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> For 2001-02 no data were received from the trust for the speciality 'Paediatrics'. This has been investigated with the trust but no conclusive cause has been found.<br/> <i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. Data Quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 2. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 3. FCE<br/> A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> 4. Specialty<br/> Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. Trusts may change the way they manage speciality codes through time. The number of specialities can change over time depending on the patients being treated and the consultants employed by a trust in a particular year.<br/> 5. Ungrossed data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ies the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.768W.6/2">Parliamentary pre-legislative scrutiny was carried out by select committees in respect of three draft bills. The Climate Change Bill and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (then called the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill) were both considered by Joint Committees of both Houses, while the Local Transport Bill was considered by the Transport Select Committee. The Climate Change Bill was also examined by the Efra and Environmental Audit select committees. All these committees provided facilities for outside bodies and individuals to submit evidence electronically. In addition, on-line forums on aspects of the proposed Bills were conducted by the Joint Committees on the Climate Change Bill and the Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. It is the responsibility of individual committees as to how they involve and take evidence from the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.768W.6/3">In all cases the public consultation by departments on the draft bills included opportunity for the public and interested bodies to submit views electronically. In respect of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill, an online discussion space was also provided on the Cabinet Office website.</p>

	<p pid="b.769W.9/1">The Transport Act 2000 (or for those resident in London, the Greater London Authority Act 1999) make provision for concessionary travel to a wide range of disabled people. Categories of disability were drawn up following representation from local government and support from the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. The people eligible are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/2" class="italic"> Any person who:</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/3" class="indent">is blind or partially sighted;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/4" class="indent">is profoundly or severely deaf;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/5" class="indent">is without speech;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/6" class="indent">has a disability, or has suffered an injury, which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his/her ability to walk;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/7" class="indent">does not have arms or has long-term loss of the use of both arms;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/8" class="indent">has a learning disability, that is, a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning;</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/9" class="indent">would, if he/she applied for a grant of a licence to drive a motor vehicle under part III of the Road Traffic Act 1988, have his/her application refused pursuant to section 92 of the Act (physical fitness) otherwise than on the ground of persistent misuse of drugs or alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/10">The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 does not change the criteria for those eligible for a concessionary pass. The Act retains the discretion of travel concession authorities to offer their residents more than the statutory minimum concession. Any such enhancements are subject to their assessment of local needs and their overall financial priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/11">The Secretary of State issued guidance to local authorities which sets out the statutory minimum requirement which they must observe to satisfy the law, and to which they must have regard in reaching a decision on eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/12">We have no plans at present to consult on changes to the eligibility criteria for statutory concessionary bus travel to include other groups of people, such as those with mental health illnesses. Our current focus is on the successful implementation of the new all-England off-peak bus travel concession from April this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/13">Local authorities retain the ability to offer discretionary concessions over and above the statutory minimum at their own expense. This can include offering concessionary travel to groups of people other than those currently defined in legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.9/14">Initial analysis suggests that the estimated annual cost of extending the statutory concession to people with a mental impairment would be at least &pound;49 million.</p>

Records of audits performed by the Department's internal audit functions, including those involving third party partners and their associated costs, are not maintained centrally but are kept locally by each of those functions. Furthermore, because of the decentralised nature of management responsibility within the Department and its agencies, specific record-keeping arrangements for other similar audits commissioned by line management vary between the Department and individual agencies and are not maintained centrally.

	<p pid="b.784W.5/1">This is an operational matter for the Audit Commission and I have asked the Chief Executive of the Audit Commission to write to the hon. Member directly.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-17">17 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/3" class="indent">Your Parliamentary Question which asks with what frequency each local authority will be assessed under the new comprehensive area assessment and how those frequencies will vary according to (a) the previous inspection rating of the authority and (b) the type of authority has been passed to me to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/4" class="indent">The Audit Commission is working in partnership with Ofsted, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the Healthcare Commission, HMI Constabulary, HMI Probation and HMI Prisons to develop the Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) framework. The first CAA reports are planned for the autumn of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/5" class="indent">Outline proposals for the CAA framework were set out by the inspectorates in our joint consultation paper of November 2007. This explained that the three-yearly rolling programmes of corporate assessments of all single tier and county councils and joint area reviews of children's services would both end in 2008/09. The annual service assessments of adult social care, children and young people, housing, environment, culture and benefits will also end with the final set of Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) scores in 2008/09. The CPA framework for district councils, which does not involve annual service assessments or a rolling programme of corporate assessments, will also end in 2008/09.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/6" class="indent">In place of CPA, CAA will require fewer major inspection events and will shift the focus of the inspectorates from detailed service management issues to the outcomes being achieved in partnership by the public bodies in each area. Greater reliance will be placed on self assessment and the improvement activity of local authorities themselves, and the volume of inspection will reduce significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/7" class="indent">The government's policy priorities for CAA were set out in a joint ministerial commissioning letter to the inspectorates in April 2007. That letter stated that:</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/8" class="indent">The CAA will comprise:</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/9" class="indent">annual publication of the performance of all areas against all the measures in the single set of around 200 national indicators;</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/10" class="indent">an Annual Risk Assessment for every area&mdash;to be delivered jointly by the Audit Commission working with other inspectorates;</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/11" class="indent">an annual scored Direction of Travel judgement for every local authority which assesses the effectiveness of each local authority in driving continuous improvement; and</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/12" class="indent">an annual scored Use of Resources judgement for all local authorities, Primary Care Trusts, Fire &amp; Rescue Authorities and Police Authorities by the Audit Commission, building on the current such judgements to provide public, independent assurance about the organisational effectiveness of these key local partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/13" class="indent">The November joint inspectorate consultation document set out a proposed approach to delivering these elements of CAA. Although each element is proposed to be reported annually, the inspection work required will be heavily influenced by the performance of the local authority and, where relevant, its partners and the inspectorates' assessment of risk. In this way, high performing local authorities and partnerships will experience significantly less inspection activity than their lower performing peers, and the total volume of inspection activity will be significantly less than at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/14" class="indent">The inspectorates are currently evaluating the 327 responses to the November consultation, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-15">15 February 2008</phrase>, and will be considering changes to the proposed CAA framework both in the light of those responses and their early field testing of different elements. Any proposed changes will be subject to thorough discussion with all stakeholders, including local and central government, other local public services and the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/15" class="indent">A further joint consultation paper due in July 2008 will present the revised proposals and will include a more detailed explanation of how the inspectorates will ensure that the CAA framework reduces the burden of assessment on local authorities, and their partners, and reflects a proportionate approach to risk and performance. After a further round of pilots in the summer and autumn, the final CAA framework will be published in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/16" class="indent">I trust that this reply is helpful and I would be happy to provide further details or meet to discuss the development of CAA at any time.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.5/17" class="indent">The text of this letter will be placed in Hansard.</p>

	<p pid="b.801W.0/1">The UK maintains the security of its own border controls and does not participate in EU visa facilitation agreements. The EU visa facilitation agreements concluded with the Western Balkan states, and therefore have no direct effect on UK border control. The agreements allow the UK to consider whether it should conclude bilateral visa facilitation agreements with the Western Balkans states. Were we to do so, we would ensure that they were consistent with the protection of the UK border and wider visa policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.0/2">The UK regards European Community Readmission Agreements as a key part of co-operation with third countries and an essential component in the fight against illegal immigration. These agreements (with the exception of Albania) have only recently come into force, and it is therefore too early to gauge their effectiveness. However, we do expect them to ensure effective and rapid procedures for the identification, documentation and return of persons (nationals of the EU member states and the third country involved; third country nationals and stateless persons) illegally entering or remaining, and to facilitate the transit of persons, in the spirit of co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.0/3">The Western Balkan states are all either candidate countries to join the EU (Croatia, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) or potential candidate countries. Progress in achieving EU-level standards, including in border control and organised crime, is part of the candidate process and is assessed each year by the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.5/8" class="indent">agreed to include schemes to help prevent homelessness in the reimbursement package; this would effectively give local authorities an additional six months to find solutions for individual families.</p>

ICAT is not contracted to fly military personnel and so UK military personnel do not travel on these flights. I am pleased with the effects of the ICAT contract, which is making a useful contribution to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, including by reducing pressures on military air and aviation assets. The contract is funded from NATO Common Funding, of which the UK contributes 12 per cent. as a standing share. Of the assets currently used by the contractor for the ICAT contract, 87 per cent. are rotary and 13 per cent. are fixed wing.</p>

	<p pid="b.815W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.2/2">The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is explicitly excluded with two limited exceptions. The ECJ will be able to monitor the boundary between the CFSP and other EU external action, as is currently the case; it will, in addition, be able to ensure that the CFSP cannot be affected by other EU policies as a distinct and equal area of action. In addition, individuals who are subject to CFSP sanctions will be able to challenge these in court. Individuals can already challenge economic sanctions to which they are subject and the Government welcome this closing of the gap in the judicial protection of the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.815W.2/3">The Maastricht treaty established that the Union should define a CFSP covering all areas of foreign and security policy. The treaty of Lisbon reconfirms that the CFSP shall cover all areas of foreign policy and all questions related to the Union's security. It further specifies that the CFSP shall be defined and implemented by the European Council and the Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.817W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.8/2">The duty of loyal co-operation as described in Article 11(3) (Article 24(3)) in the consolidated version of the treaties (as amended by Lisbon) is not new. It was introduced by the Maastricht treaty and it has not prevented the UK from pursuing its own foreign policy when required to. The language is identical to that currently used in Article 11(2) of the EU treaty with the addition of the phrase that member states &quot;shall comply with the Union's action in this area&quot;. The latter is a statement of the obvious point that when&mdash;and only when&mdash;member states decide on Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) action they must abide by what they agree&mdash;a point which is already reflected in current EU treaty provisions on the CFSP.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.8/3">Title V of the treaty of Lisbon sets out the general provisions on the Union's external action and specific provisions on the CFSP. The CFSP will remain intergovernmental: when EU members all agree, we act together, but where we do not, the UK acts independently.</p>
	<p pid="b.817W.8/4">The European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over the CFSP, except for those limited areas set out in the answer I gave to the hon. Member today (UIN 191936). And the Commission will not be able to commence infraction proceedings against member states under Title V.</p>

In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented. In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate Departmental expenditure statistics by gender.</p>

Some limited information about the assumptions used is available from the regulator's analysis of the first tranche of 1,292 scheme funding recovery plans, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-26">26 September 2007</phrase>. The assumptions about life expectancy at age 65 used in the majority of these recovery plans was 21.9 years for men and 24.8 years for women. This information only relates to schemes where a valuation was completed between September 2005 and April 2006, however, and is not a reliable indicator of the position for all schemes, or of the current behaviour of trustees in choosing assumptions about longevity now. It is not for the Government to tell trustees what assumptions to make on longevity.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase> the pensions regulator published a consultation document inviting views on proposed new guidance for trustees on choosing the assumptions about longevity to be used in actuarial valuations of their scheme. The document reflects emerging evidence which suggests to the regulator that past allowances for future improvements in life expectancy have not always been adequately taken into account, and the consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-12">12 May</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.835W.3/2">As no single measure captures all aspects of poverty, the new public service agreement &quot;Tackle poverty and promote greater independence and wellbeing in later life&quot; includes a range of indicators related to low income for pensioners.

	<p pid="b.835W.3/4">The proportion of pensioners in low income in the UK and the south east has fallen substantially over the last 10 years. Any current projection of the number of pensioners in poverty in 2010, 2012 and 2014 would be subject to uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.

	<p pid="b.842W.3/1">The UK Government are supportive of efforts to achieve gender equality and continue to work very closely with both the Women's National Commission and the Women's Budget Group on promoting gender equality within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.3/2">In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within Government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.842W.3/3">In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender. Following these lines Departments can then highlight any specific initiatives they have been operating or funding which support the empowerment of women and promote gender equality.</p>

	<p pid="b.861W.5/2">Prison Service Order 0550 requires that every prisoner's literacy, numeracy and skills needs are assessed as part of the induction programme put in place soon after entering custody. The results of this assessment inform the offender management process and contribute to the fuller assessment of learning needs to inform an individual learning plan. In public prisons, that fuller assessment is carried out by the provider appointed by the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.861W.5/3">The offender learning and skills delivery arrangements aim to develop a learning plan that is personalised to the needs of the individual learner, subject to the constraints imposed by the secure environment. The focus of the arrangements is on the individual and there has been no general audit of the skills needs of prisoners since my Department took responsibility for the policy in 2001, although the Social Exclusion Unit's 2002 report 'Reducing Re-offending by Ex-Prisoners' drew together a number of data sources to produce an overview of the skills needs of offenders.</p>

This would run counter to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and Article 39 of the Interim National Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the media and unrestricted right to freedom of expression, reception and dissemination of information. It is particularly important that citizens have freedom of access to information in the run-up to democratic elections in 2009. The UK, and our international partners, will continue to monitor press freedoms and promotion of a reformed press law in Sudan.

	<p pid="b.867W.2/2">The Government of Southern Sudan has repeatedly re-affirmed its commitment to finding a lasting resolution to Abyei. We understand the National Congress Party and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement are in negotiations on Abyei; that a sub-committee in the presidency has been established to broker a deal; and they may be close to a final agreement. We stand ready to assist as necessary once an agreement is reached.</p>

	<p pid="b.868W.2/2">Contracts for this programme were issued by Government offices with a clear end date of March 2008. There was no expectation that they would be extended beyond that date. The decision to confirm that this programme would not continue beyond March was taken as part of the much larger prioritisation process in the 2007 comprehensive spending review. It was not the subject of specific consultation. The decision was informed by DfES priorities expressed through the published five-year strategy, as well as by the approach to working with local areas and funding local activity signalled in the Local Government White Paper 'Strong and Prosperous Communities' in October 2006. There has been substantial consultation with the community and voluntary sector over the White Paper reforms.</p>

	<p pid="b.868W.11/7">In addition local evaluators have been appointed by each pilot to test the success of the projects in local terms. Their evidence will contribute to the national evaluation. A series of thematic reports will be produced during the life of the projects with a final summary report scheduled for publication by March 2009. The first thematic report&mdash;Towards a Business Case for LinkAge Plus&mdash;was published in November 2007 on the DWP website.</p>
	<p pid="b.868W.11/8">The current LinkAge Plus pilots will end their funded activity by October 2008. There are no plans to fund any further pilot activity beyond this date. We are already sharing lessons learned from the pilot activity in order to encourage continuing sustainable joined-up services for older people (for example through the new Social Care Reform Grant).</p>

There are boxes for the dates of security and medical warnings but not for codes or any further details. When a prisoner arrives at prison for the first time, parts of the prisoner core record F2050, which accompanies the prisoner, should have been completed by the escort contractor's staff. Prison reception staff also receive a Prisoner Escort Record form on which some information is recorded in the form of codes. These codes are not transferred to the F2050, but the relevant information is transferred as appropriate to either the F2050, the ACCT (self-harm) form, the cell sharing risk assessment, the prisoner's security file or inmate medical records.</p>

It is standard scientific practice for the validation of an evaluation to be undertaken by submitting the report to independent academic peer review. This was done and some amendments made to the material in line with the reviewer's comments.</p>

	<p pid="b.884W.8/1">The Ministry of Justice has made no assessment of this. However, current knowledge suggests that a number of factors may be important in incentivising people not to commit crime:</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.8/2" class="indent">1. The perceived likelihood of detection and apprehension;</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.8/3" class="indent">2. The severity of sanction; and</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.8/4" class="indent">3. An awareness on the part of offenders and potential offenders of 1 and 2 and their ability to act on these.</p>
	<p pid="b.884W.8/5">The most consistently reliable evidence suggests that the CJS most effectively deters crime by increasing the likelihood, or certainty, of punishment. It is therefore possible that reporting of the outcome of trials in the local press could in principle act as a deterrent but there is no rigorous research to demonstrate this one way or the other.</p>

	<p pid="b.888W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-17">17 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on what the most recent estimate is of the number of migrant workers in (a) Tamworth constituency, (b) Staffordshire and (c) the West Midlands in each of the last five years. (193599)</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics on migrant workers for local areas from the Annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) . The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women), and in employment. This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/5" class="indent">The table attached shows the numbers of working age in employment who were not born in the UK and were resident in Tamworth Parliamentary constituency, Staffordshire and the West Midlands. The figures cover, the twelve month periods ending in February for 2003 and, 2004 from the annual LFS, and ending in March for 2005, 2006, and 2007 as well as June 2007 from the APS. The July to June 2007 APS dataset is the most recent for which figures are available, whereas a consistent time series is best provided using March and February data.</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/6" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS is not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.888W.5/8" class="indent">APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February 2008</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>

	<p pid="b.898W.8/1">HRMC has approximately 35,000 full-time equivalent staff allocated to compliance activities which include, for example, policy development, inquiries and investigations. These staff often operate in multifunctional teams, tackling non-compliant behaviour ranging from simple errors through to complex fraud and organised attacks. As a result, HMRC is not able to separately quantify the number of staff working on evasion matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.906W.2/1">Our current data&mdash;which are taken from Ofsted inspection reports&mdash;do not enable us to count or estimate how many lessons in England are set by ability.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/2">Ofsted collects data on the use of streaming and setting in lessons observed during inspection. Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with head teachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the head teacher or teacher or by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework; therefore, lessons seen may not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/3">Prior to 2003-04 lessons were recorded as being setted, streamed, mixed ability or otherwise organised. For clarity, setting is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term banding, which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included or not in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/4">From 2003-04 the distinction between streaming and setting was removed and instead data recorded on whether the class was mixed ability or setted/streamed.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.5/1">The following 65 local authorities in England have been invited to bid to become play pathfinders. They are listed by region. Almost all authorities invited to submit a bid will be doing so. DCSF will be considering bids shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/2" class="italic"> Statement</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/3">15 local authorities will be selected as play pathfinders from April 2008. Successful bids will demonstrate proposals for safe, inclusive play areas that offer exciting and stimulating opportunities and sit within a wider strategic approach to deliver a sustainable and far-reaching play agenda. The bids will also clearly demonstrate how local authorities will work with children, their local communities and local MPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/4">Play pathfinders will each receive around &pound;2 million capital funding plus significant revenue funding. These play pathfinders will work with children, young people and their communities to develop innovative play sites with challenging equipment and natural landscapes, which will give all children the opportunity to play actively outdoors. The play sites will also be accessible for disabled children. The bids should include plans for building a new staffed adventure playground, with indoor and outdoor facilities, specifically aimed at improving play opportunities for eight to 13-year-olds where they currently lack places to go and things to do, and often in disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/5">Any of the 65 local authorities who are unsuccessful in becoming a pathfinder, but who submit satisfactory bids, will be offered capital funding of approximately &pound;1 million to become 'playbuilders', to develop public play areas, with the first allocations starting April 2008. This will support our aim of developing up to 3,500 public play areas by 2011. By 2010 all local authorities will have been offered capital funding and a chance to be a part of this agenda in partnership with their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/6">A second round of pathfinder bidding will take place autumn 2008 and this will be open for all local authorities to apply. A further 15 play pathfinders will be selected so that by 2011, 30 pathfinders in total will deliver 30 new adventure playgrounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.0/1">The National Framework for Sustainable Schools provides an overarching structure for schools to consider the impact of their curriculum, their campus and their place in the community on the environment and on sustainable development more widely. It supports schools to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviours that young people will need to ensure their futures in a sustainable world.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.0/2">The Department has funded the production of the following resources to support head teachers and other school stakeholders in reducing the carbon footprint of their schools and to promote environmentally friendly behaviour within schools and communities:</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.0/3" class="indent">A Sustainable Schools website which is hosted on <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk">www.teachernet.gov.uk</a> and provides links to sources of information and support from a range of public and third sector bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.0/11">In addition to the advice and materials already available to support the National Framework for Sustainable Schools, we will shortly publish new guidance called &quot;Planning a Sustainable School&quot; which will enable schools to develop strategic plans to drive school improvement through Sustainable development. The guidance will be available in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.0/12">The Department has no plans to list the sources of public funding available to head teachers for investment in energy efficiency, deployment of renewable energy or the reduction of a school's carbon footprint. This service is already available from government agencies and other organisations, which provide information on funding available for these measures nationally and regionally, and which list both public and private sources of funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.0/13">Under the New Relationship with Schools we are committed to high levels of delegated budget and fewer specific funding streams&mdash;so we are not inventing another pot of funding that schools would have to account for separately. A Sustainable school works smarter with its existing budget. &quot;A Bursar's guide to Sustainable school operation&quot; outlines measures that can be taken to reduce a school's environmental impact and make real cash savings while enhancing the teaching and learning element of Sustainable working practices within the school.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.2/1">The revised curriculum for Citizenship in secondary schools provides opportunities to explore the issue of crime, antisocial behaviour and carrying weapons through an examination of the concepts of democracy and justice, weighing up what is fair and unfair in different situations, understanding that justice is fundamental to a democratic society and exploring the role of law in maintaining order and resolving conflict. Through the concept of rights and responsibilities pupils can explore legal and moral rights and the responsibilities that go with these.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.2/2">In addition, the framework for Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE) provides opportunities for pupils to be taught to recognise and manage risk to help them make safer choices and to recognise when pressure from others threatens their personal safety. Pupils learn about developing relationships, recognising their rights and responsibilities and that their actions have consequences. As PSHE is non-statutory, the implementation of the subject is decided by schools on an individual basis.</p>
