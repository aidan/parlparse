	<p pid="e.523W.3/1">STFC is aiming to retain important skills at the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus to resource the range of scientific research investments being planned for its future. I have most recently announced a &pound;25 million investment by St. Modwen, a private sector developer that will be investing in a new (Vanguard House) business incubator facility at Daresbury to accommodate the rapidly growing (over 65) science and technology-based companies at the site, and new start-up science and technology businesses emerging in part from Daresbury's own leading scientific research programme. STFC has also tabled proposals for a new computer science centre at Daresbury (Hartree) and, in conjunction with its sister campus at Harwell, a new detector systems centre. These proposed centres would add to the existing Cockcroft Institute for accelerator research and the contribution that Daresbury is making to the preparatory phase of the New Light Source project. Taken together, I believe that the portfolio of facilities and projects at Daresbury will continue to sustain and develop its leading edge skills&mdash;which are highly valued by me and my Department. We are fully committed to the development of the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus as announced in Budget 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.523W.6/1">The Government are committed to reducing bureaucracy at all levels within further education to release providers' energy to focus on the needs of individuals and employers Through its deregulation agenda the Department and its intermediaries have already for example:</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/2" class="indent">reduced the number of intermediary bodies&mdash;Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate have been brought together in one inspector body, QIA and CEL are being brought together into a single body which will provide support to FE colleges and providers;</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/3" class="indent">reduced the administrative burden on colleges and independent providers&mdash;there is now light touch inspection for the best performers, a reduction in audit requirements is saving about &pound;12 million in administrative time per year and recognition as an awarding body has recently been reduced from an average of 10 months to two-three months;</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/4" class="indent">introduced Impact Assessments of policies on front line delivery.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/5">The LSC is committed to reducing bureaucracy. As a result of the restructuring begun in 2005-06 the LSC expect to realise annual administration savings of &pound;40 million by the end of 2008-09. The LSC are also committed to making administration efficiency savings during the current spending review period of 5 per cent. year on year.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/6">The LSC have made significant administration efficiency savings since it started operations in April 2001. Administration costs as a proportion of total expenditure has fallen from 4.6 per cent. in 2001-02 to an anticipated 1.6 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/7">I have asked Mark Haysom, the LSC Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Member with further information on action being taken. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/8" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/9" class="indent">I am writing to you at the request of Bill Rammell in response to your recent question about the LSC pledge to reduce bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/10" class="indent">In our Statement of Priorities published in November 2007 we highlighted eight areas where we are committed to simplifying the education and training system for the benefit of learners and employers.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/11" class="italic"> Funding methodology.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/12" class="indent">The LSC has implemented a reduction in the number of funding streams from six to three which will reduce administrative complexities for FE colleges and training providers and provide a clearer link between policy objectives and funding arrangements. It is expected that this will result in increased access and participation for 16-18 year-old learners and increased awareness of learning opportunities for adult learners.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/13" class="italic"> Custome r interaction with FE system</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/14" class="indent">We are continuously looking for ways to improve this, for example we have just introduced a single Helpline, Assessment and Payment Body to improve the customer (learner) experience, by having a single point of reference, single portal, and single phone number for all interactions in relation to nationally administered financial support programmes for learners.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/15" class="italic"> Single brokerage service</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/16" class="indent">A common brokerage framework has been introduced to ensure consistency across LSC regions, and to improve the service to employers we plan to go further by transferring the skills brokerage service to regional development agencies (RDAs) to enable its integration with the Business Link service.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/17" class="italic"> New Standard</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/18" class="indent">This has now been launched as the Training Quality Standard. It recognises provider responsiveness to employer needs and provider excellence in a particular vocational area; two areas that employers have told us are critical for success. It will give employers a simple and straightforward way to compare training providers.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/19" class="italic"> Framework for Excellence</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/20" class="indent">This is a balanced scoreboard of performance indicators that will enable learners and employers to make more informed choices and decisions, thus contributing to improved levels of satisfaction, increased retention rates, greater investment by individuals and employers, a sharper focus on economically valuable skills, and better and more relevant outcomes. A large scale pilot has just been completed and version 1 of the Framework is scheduled for roll-out to all FE colleges and work-based learning providers from August 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/21" class="italic"> Regional skills strategies</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/22" class="indent">The LSC no longer produces 47 local plans with a range of priorities and initiatives but rather brings these together into nine regional plans. These regional plans set out how the LSC's funding will be used to support national priorities as identified in our Grant Letter and Statement of Priorities, and regional priorities identified by regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/23" class="italic"> Qualifications and Credit Framework</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/24" class="indent">With the QCA we are developing a simple and flexible structure that allows achievement to be built incrementally through the accumulation and transfer of credit. This will encourage and enable more learning that is appropriate to individuals' and employers' needs, For 2008-09 the LSC will be encouraging providers to adopt QCF provision where it is available.</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/25" class="italic"> Simplification of business processes</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/26" class="indent">The LSC continues to support the operation of the Bureaucracy Reduction Group (BRG) as the FE sector-led gatekeeper group for bureaucracy. The BRG has scrutinised the operation of a number of the LSC's major programmes and has helpfully identified areas where improvements could be made. For example, its recent scrutiny of Train to Gain resulted in a 10 point action plan to reduce bureaucracy in this programme. The report and recommendations of this scrutiny can be found on the BRG website</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/27" class="indent">(<a href="http://www.fe-brg.org.uk">www.fe-brg.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="e.523W.6/28" class="indent">In order to continue to tackle perceived bureaucracy and improve efficiency the LSC is developing a Simplification Plan. This will set out the actions the LSC is taking across a range of activities in addition to those highlighted above. It is expected that this will be published in July 2008 and I will send you a copy at that time.</p>

	<p pid="e.526W.8/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="e.526W.8/2"><i> (a)</i> The Government are keen to see an increase in the numbers of British students who take the opportunity to include a period of study abroad as part of their course. Within Europe, we have seen a welcome increase this year in the number of UK students taking part in the EU's Erasmus programme. Interim figures for 2007-08 show that well over 10,000 UK students have taken part (including some 2,800 work placement students). And the UK continues to be one of the top destinations for students from other European countries taking part in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.526W.8/3"><i> (b)</i> The Government believe there is scope for further adaptation of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) to ensure that it effectively reflects greater importance of the assessment of learning outcomes. In response to these and other member states' concerns, the European Commission is reviewing the ECTS users' guide, which is expected to be completed later this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.526W.8/4">Items <i> (c)</i> to <i> (g)</i> refer to the five documents that make up the Europass portfolio, a method introduced by the EU to record formal, informal and non-formal education. The operating agency for Europass in the UK, the National Europass Centre, has been promoting the portfolio in its entirety through organisations such as universities, FE colleges, vocational training organisations and UK accreditation bodies. There is increased interest in the use of Europass and it is expected that the introduction of the European Qualifications Framework will lead to greater take up of Europass documents in the future. The Government believe that Europass will assist in the recognition across Europe of formally or informally acquired skills and encourage mobility within the work force.</p>

	<p pid="e.527W.2/1">We expect students who entered higher education in the 2006-07 and 2007-8 academic years to graduate with an average level of debt of around &pound;15,000.</p>
	<p pid="e.527W.2/2">Student loans have very different features to most commercial loans, Graduates only repay once they are in work and only when their annual income reaches &pound;15,000. Interest is charged at the rate of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed.</p>
	<p pid="e.527W.2/3">In July we announced plans to introduce greater flexibility in the repayment of student loans by allowing borrowers to take repayment breaks of up to five years.</p>
	<p pid="e.527W.2/4">A generous package of support is available to students, particularly those from low income households. In 2006-07 over half of eligible full-time students received a full or partial maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,700, From 2008-09 onwards, the minimum threshold (of household income) for a full maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,835 per year will be extended from &pound;17,500 a year to &pound;25,000 a year; with a partial grant available up to an income threshold of &pound;60,005. This will mean that two thirds of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008-09 are expected to be entitled to a full or partial non-repayable grant&mdash;compared to just over half now.</p>

	<p pid="e.558W.8/1">Schools are generally safe places. To help head teachers keep them safe, we gave schools in May 2007 a new power to search, without consent, any pupil whom they suspect, after random screening or otherwise, to be carrying a weapon. When issuing guidance on this new power, my Department also brought to schools' attention their existing power to screen pupils at random for weapons; using screening wands or arches. The guidance set out not only the benefits but also the acknowledged risks of using either power.</p>
	<p pid="e.558W.8/2">It is for head teachers to determine if and when they use these powers, based on their knowledge of their own school. The Department does not collect data on the use of these powers, nor are schools obliged to tell us when they conduct searches or if they find weapons. When a pupil is suspected of carrying a weapon, some schools may rely on the direct and immediate intervention of the local police, and we would not wish to discourage them from taking that approach.</p>

The information shown in Tables 1 and 2 is for the United Kingdom from 1998-99 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98. Data for Northern Ireland has been imputed for 1998-99 to 2001-02. The information shown in Tables 3 and 4 is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02, as data for Northern Ireland has only been imputed for the headline statistics.<br/>  4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br/>  5. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.<br/>  6. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are. This means that after housing cost incomes will generally be lower than before housing cost.<br/>  7. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. Ages have been split into four bands because of sample sizes. Total numbers of children are in line with National Statistics mid-year estimates.<br/>  8. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Households Below Average Income, 1997-98 to 2005-06</td> </tr>

A child is defined as anyone aged under 16 or an unmarried 16 to 18-year-old in full-time non-advanced education.  3. A family is defined as a single adult or a couple living as married and any dependant children.  4. The information shown in Tables 1 and 2 is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2005-06, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.  5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.  6. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.  7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are. This means that After Housing Cost incomes will generally be lower than Before Housing Cost.  8. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.  9. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  <i> Source:</i>  Households Below Average Income, 1997-98 to 2005-06.</td> </tr>

Friend the Minister of State for Justice (Mr. Wills) at Justice oral questions on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April</phrase> that a wide range of offences are covered by the term terrorism. The most serious terrorists are generally sentenced to indeterminate sentences.</p>
	<p pid="e.653W.2/4">The Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Attorney-General's Office are currently working with the National Coordinator for Terrorist Investigations to improve the quality of data on conviction under terrorist legislation and those under other legislation but following a terrorist investigation.

In addition, certain posts are restricted to UK citizens. For the majority of posts in the MOD and the armed forces, national security vetting is required. This includes a full criminal record check of both spent and unspent convictions on the police national computer in accordance with the then Prime Minister's statement on vetting on <phrase class="date" code="1994-12-15">15 December 1994</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1994-12-15.764"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 764-66W</phrase>.</p>

ATMs are incorporated within multi-activity contracts, through independent agreement made locally by individual Commanding Officers, or provided as part of retail and leisure run facilities. Subject to the terms of any associated lease or licence, Commanding Officers are free to enter discussions with ATM providers and seek the removal of fee paying ATMs at any time. Where ATMs are provided under contract, removal would, of course, have to be in line with the terms of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="e.718W.5/1">Since 1997 the Government have introduced a series of reforms to make work pay and to guarantee minimum weekly incomes for families with and without children. By October 2008, in real terms, families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be, on average, &pound;4,100 a year better off.</p>
	<p pid="e.718W.5/2">The working tax credit and the national minimum wage work together to provide a guaranteed income in work. The minimum income guarantee for single people aged 25 or over, and in full-time work, has increased by 30 per cent. in real terms since 1999.</p>
	<p pid="e.718W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase>, the Chancellor announced further support for low and middle-income families for 2008-09. For the current tax year, income tax personal allowances will be increased by 600 for all tax payers under 65. Around 22 million basic-rate taxpayers will benefit from this change.</p>

	<p pid="e.724W.12/1">In terms of recorded crime and court proceedings, statistics are not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/2">The use of another person's identification details (or the use of false identification details), often referred to as identity theft, is not in itself an offence in law. It is the action that is undertaken, using those identification details, that needs to be considered in respect of whether an offence has occurred. As such no specific information is available.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/3">Most instances of 'Identity Theft' come to light when victim's details are used to obtain goods, services or money using credit arrangements or loans. Instances of this should be recorded under the new Home Office offence classifications 'Fraud by False Representation Other Fraud' or 'Obtaining Services Dishonestly'. These new offences were created following the introduction of the Fraud Act 2006 and were introduced into the recorded crime series with effect from April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/4">Where bank, credit card, or store card accounts are opened using identities to which the individuals are not entitled, and then used to commit fraud, then an offence of 'Fraud by False Representation Cheque, Plastic Card and Online Bank Accounts (NOT eBay or Pay Pal)' should be recorded.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/5">If there is no intent to commit fraud and there is evidence that an account has been created using a false, stolen or improperly obtained identity document contained within the Identity Cards Act 2006 then an offence under the new classification 'Possession of False Documents' should be recorded.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/6">Statistics for all the new recorded crime offence classifications referred to above will be available for 2007-08 and will be published in July 2008. Information on fraud and forgery offences recorded by the police using the old classifications is available in table 2.04 of 'Crime in England and Wales 2006/07'. The table can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="e.724W.12/8">Equivalent data for court proceedings and cautions for fraud offences (under the old classifications) can be found in the Criminal Statistics England and Wales publication which can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="e.724W.12/10">Tables 2.8 and 2.13 show prosecutions and crown court trials for fraud and forgery and table 3.16 shows convictions and cautions for fraud and forgery broken down by offence class.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/11">Court proceedings data for 2007 for the offences referred to above will not be available until the autumn of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/12">With regard to information collated by the British Crime Survey on victims of such crimes, according to the 2006-07 BCS, 2 per cent. of adults had experienced their personal details being used in the last year without their permission in one or more of the ways asked about. This proportion includes those who came to know about the identity fraud, but the true figure could be higher because some respondents may not have known about the deception.</p>
	<p pid="e.724W.12/13">Detailed information from the 2005-06 BCS on ID fraud is contained in section 3.5 of Home Office Statistical Bulletin 10/07 entitled 'Mobile phone theft, plastic card and identity fraud: Findings from the 2005/06 British Crime Survey'.

	<p pid="e.726W.2/1">The potential requirements for the sharing of information between the National Ballistics Intelligence Service Database (NABIS) and the National Firearms Licensing Management System was examined, and discussed, in detail by key stakeholders (including forensic and investigatory professionals) throughout the lifetime of the project management process.</p>
	<p pid="e.726W.2/2">It was found that the potential crossover between the data held by the systems was very small, due to the very low instances of legally held firearms being used in gun crime and the small overlap in information shared between the two applications. Furthermore, the data descriptors of 'firearms recovered at Scenes of Crime' and 'firearms being licensed' may be somewhat different and, as a result, inquiries would be passed from NABIS to expert firearms officers in the Licensing Departments. As a consequence, it was agreed that any risk of legally held firearms being used for criminal purposes was so low and the difficulty of automating a matching process between systems that the cost of building such an interface would outweigh any perceived benefits.</p>
	<p pid="e.726W.2/3">The NABIS system has been designed to accredited police corporate data model standards, which means that information sharing may be possible in the future providing that there is a business case to do so.</p>

	<p pid="e.744W.2/1">Police and local authorities have available a range of measures to deal with antisocial behaviour, including the nuisance caused by unsolicited car windscreen washers. The measures are usually employed incrementally and it is important that they should be proportionate to the behaviour concerned. Among the available measures normally used for low-level antisocial behaviour are warnings, acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs), and injunctions. For more serious cases, antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) may be used. In addition, the police have powers to disperse groups of two or more where their presence or behaviour has resulted, or is likely to result, in a member of the public being harassed, intimidated, alarmed or distressed. These could be used where more than person is engaged in unsolicited windscreen washing in a particular location.</p>

	<p pid="e.760W.5/3">A key principle of Gateway reviews is that they are cost neutral. However, where there is a shortfall in civil service Gateway reviewers, suitably accredited external resource may be provided by the Office of Government Commerce at a charge. While the Department is unable to identify the individual costs for each review undertaken, as this information is not specifically recorded, DEFRA is currently in credit with OGC for its review days by a factor of &pound;8,600 for the 2007-08 period.</p>

	<p pid="e.767W.8/1">The Government's policy on Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) is set out in a document entitled 'Use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way&mdash;the Government's framework for action', which was published in January 2005. In this document we made clear our intention to legislate to curtail claims for vehicular rights of way, where those claims derive from historic use and dedication for use by non-mechanically propelled vehicles. These proposals now form the basis of Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.767W.8/2">The case of 'R on the Application of the Warden and Fellows of Winchester College and Humphrey Feeds Ltd <i> v.</i> Hampshire county council and the Secretary of State' was essentially about what is meant by an: &quot;application made in accordance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 14 to Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981&quot;, within the meaning of section 67(6) of the 2006 Act and whether such an application, made for a byway open to all traffic, would have engaged the exceptions in section 67(3) of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 and thereby have preserved public rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles that were the subject of such an application.</p>
	<p pid="e.767W.8/3">The Court of Appeal ruled that, for the purposes of section 67(6) of the 2006 Act, an application must be accompanied by copies of all the documentary evidence that the applicant wished to adduce or rely upon and a copy of a map drawn to the prescribed scale.</p>
	<p pid="e.767W.8/4">It seems likely that there are many cases pending where, in light of this judgment, the conclusion will be that, even where there was an application for a BOAT made before the relevant date (as set out in section 67(4) of the 2006 Act), the requirements of paragraph 1 of schedule 14 will have not been complied with, within the strict terms emphasised by the judgment, and therefore the public rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles will have been extinguished.</p>
	<p pid="e.767W.8/5">Version 5 of DEFRA's online guidance on Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which will be published shortly, will include revised guidance on this aspect of the legislation. We have also issued revised guidance to rights of way inspectors to enable them to deal accordingly with any cases before them.</p>

	<p pid="e.782W.2/2">The Estate Agents (Provision of Information) Regulations 1991 include statutory definitions for specified contract terms that deal with who can sell a property and in what circumstances commission is payable to an estate agent. The recent estate agents consultation sought views on alternative versions of the statutory definitions. The bulk of the respondents to the consultation restricted their comments to amending the statutory definitions, but two of them expressed views against retaining the terms 'sole selling rights' and 'ready, willing and able purchaser'. One respondent called for 'sole selling rights' to be removed, whereas the other called for both terms to be prohibited. We are currently reviewing the responses.</p>

	<p pid="e.783W.2/2">The UK remains concerned, about allegations of the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan. The UK has raised its concerns through the EU and has discussed the issue with the Uzbek government. The EU welcomed Uzbekistan's signing of the International Labour Organisation Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour earlier this year and has urged Uzbekistan to implement effectively its international obligations in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="e.783W.2/3">The UK Government continue to call on businesses to look at their supply chains and take appropriate action if they find evidence that goods has been produced using child labour.</p>
	<p pid="e.783W.2/4">There is no legal requirement for goods to bear marks indicating its origin. As such, it would be difficult for the Government to establish a blanket ban on imports of Uzbek cotton and clothing. Similarly, products manufactured using Uzbek cotton in a third country would legitimately bear the country of manufacture as the country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="e.787W.8/1">The Government have no plans to introduce specific protections in this area. However, recent reforms have strengthened protections for vulnerable consumers.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.8/2">From April 2008, reforms to the consumer credit licensing regime introduced by the Consumer Credit Act 2007 have given the OFT stronger powers to investigate and take action against rogue traders who lend irresponsibly. OFT will take a risk-based approach to enforcement, focusing its activities on those sectors where the risk of consumer detriment is highest. It has indicated that the home credit sector will be among those most carefully monitored. OFT will bring forward guidance this year for lenders about activities which may constitute irresponsible lending.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.8/3">Furthermore, the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>, provide additional protection for vulnerable consumers. Under these regulations, a commercial practice, such as aggressive or misleading sales techniques, may be found unlawful where it is likely to only adversely affect a clearly identifiable group of vulnerable consumers in a way which a trader can reasonably foresee, by virtue of mental or physical infirmity, age or credulity.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.8/4">The consumer credit directive, which will be transposed into UK law by 2010, will provide further consumer protections through the introduction of a general right of withdrawal from credit agreements within scope, giving consumers a 14 day cooling-off period after signing their agreement. The Government will also bring forward regulations extending cancellation rights to contracts for goods and services purchased on the doorstep following a solicited visit by a trader. Consultation on draft regulations closed last month.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.8/5">The Government would expect all lenders to observe the Money Advice Liaison Group's best practice guidelines on debt management in relation to people with mental health problems.</p>

	<p pid="e.801W.5/1">The Government recently responded to the report on UK economic regulators by the House of Lords Committee on Regulators (November 2007, HL 189-II) which among other issues covered the accountability of regulators to Parliament as well as their accountability through the Competition Commission, impact assessments and consumer representation. In its response (February 2008, URN 08/648), the Government stated that:</p>
	<p pid="e.801W.5/2" class="indent">Regulators should be encouraged to think about whether they can be more proactive in using competition law, including market investigation references to the Competition Commission;</p>
	<p pid="e.801W.5/3" class="indent">Impact assessments provide transparency and as such should be an integral part of the policy-making process;</p>
	<p pid="e.801W.5/4" class="indent">The new National Consumer Council, to be established from <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>, will enhance consumer representation by being a more powerful consumer advocate.</p>
	<p pid="e.801W.5/5">With regard to effectiveness, Government maintain an active interest in looking at the regulatory regime as a whole, and has tasked the Better Regulation Executive with this role. However, as bodies independent from government, regulators assess their effectiveness through their own corporate governance structures. Further assessment beyond this is primarily a matter for Parliament.</p>
