We have already announced &#163;7 billion of rail infrastructure improvements that will reduce journey times to Cardiff by 15 minutes and we will now work with the Welsh Assembly Government on the business case for further electrification.</p>

	<p pid="b.261W.13/1">The Department for Transport does not maintain figures concerning the number of older people eligible to receive a free bus pass.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.13/2">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes details on the number of people aged over 60 and living in England. At the mid-point of 2009 there were 11.5 million people aged 60 and over living in England. This figure can be broken down to local authority level and this breakdown has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.13/3">Until <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase>, the eligible age for concessionary travel was 60 and therefore all 11.5 million people included within the ONS figures were eligible to receive a free bus pass.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.13/4">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase>, the eligible age for concessionary travel for both men and women has been linked to the state pension age for women.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.13/5">As the pensionable age for women increases from 60 to 65 so too will the age of eligibility for concessionary travel. The age of eligibility will increase in line with any future changes to the state pension age for women. It will therefore not be possible to derive straightforward estimates of the number of older people eligible for concessionary travel from future ONS figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.13/6">Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area so the arrangements in England differ from those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland-the number of people of eligible age in those areas is a matter for the relevant authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.263W.0/1">Publications are produced through various channels depending on value for money and official publishing requirements. Separating out the costs for each publication from the wider communication costs would require manual analysis of the Department's electronic financial system, which would require extensive resources and could be done only at disproportionate cost. The position is further complicated, in that over this 10-year period, some publications were managed and procured by the departmental publishing team and others were managed and procured by TSO (The Stationery Office) directly.</p>

	<p pid="b.264W.6/2">The scope and costs of the Network Rail Control Period 4 delivery plan are determined by Network Rail and, when approved by the independent Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), are published by Network Rail. Changes to this plan are subject to rail industry consultation and to approval by the ORR, which publishes all such approvals. Despite a tough spending review, the great majority of Government investment in rail infrastructure in England and Wales has been confirmed. The Government expects to announce its position on the remaining projects shortly. The specification and funding of infrastructure outputs in Scotland is a devolved matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.266W.2/1">The Highways Agency is responsible for maintaining the strategic motorway and trunk road network in England. The maintenance works, including the provision of a robust winter service, are delivered by Highways Agency contractors who are paid through fixed price contracts covering a range of routine maintenance activities. The cost for winter maintenance activity is included within the Highways Agency's annual budget, with a typical cost of &#163;20 million. In addition to the preparations it has made for the winter ahead and following the recommendations in the Independent Winter Resilience Review led by David Quarmby, the Highways Agency is also facilitating the import of 250,000 tonnes of salt as a strategic reserve to support local highway authorities. The costs for this salt acquisition, storage and management will be reimbursed by authorities who receive salt from the strategic stocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.2/2">With respect to physical resources, the Highways Agency fleet of 437 new winter service vehicles (gritters), all with snow ploughs ready to be mounted during snow conditions, together with an additional 23 snow blowers, are ready for deployment. Prior to the current period of severe winter weather, the Highways Agency contractors held over 250,000 tonnes in their depots ready for use.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.2/3">Following the comprehensive spending review, Departments are assessing and confirming detailed allocations to their individual business areas. The Highways Agency is undertaking a review of all of its maintenance activities including winter service to maximise value for money and to ensure that priority areas receive the level of future funding required to maintain the appropriate level of service.</p>

	<p pid="b.270W.4/2">The cost of the training programme will depend on the final number of participants, but were all of the 80 guides currently registered on the in-house guide list to undertake the training, it would cost a maximum of &#163;34,186 gross. The costs are shared between the Commons and the Lords on a 70:30 basis, so the cost to the House of Commons would be &#163;23,930.</p>
	<p pid="b.270W.4/3">The programme includes information about Parliament and the Palace, updates on developments in both Houses, and training in the mechanics of guiding and managing groups. Guides attend seven 90 minute training sessions, one longer communications seminar, and some practical tour sessions. In line with standard practice for House staff attending training, guides are not expected to undertake this training in their own time without recompense. Therefore, guides who also work at Parliament in another capacity either undertake training in work time with their line manager's agreement, or they undertake training outside of their other working hours, in which case they are paid for every 90 minutes of training at the rate of one tour (&#163;34.29). It is not possible to give total costs as the training is still under way. The training sessions are being run more than once, to allow flexibility. Tours continue to run while the training programme is under way. Guides who are leading tours are taken from the existing pool while others are being trained.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.0/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is fully engaged with Government initiatives to promote the use of small and medium sized enterprises (SME) and third sector organisations (TSO) and increase the level of business they get from Government. This business can be either direct, by winning departmental contracts, or indirect working as partners with or sub-contractors to the Department's prime contractors.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.0/2">The Department is achieving the new Government commitment that 25% of contracts will be let to SMEs and in 2009-10 achieved 29%. The Department is also fully committed to using the new cross-Government pre-qualification questionnaire which is designed to simplify the tendering process for small and medium enterprises and will be launched in December 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.0/3">The Department's plans to encourage and support SMEs and TSOs form part of a wider approach set out in the DWP commercial strategy. This has objectives to make it easier for suppliers to compete for contracts and encourage a diverse supply base.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.0/4">SMEs and TSOs are encouraged to contract with the Department, either as first tier suppliers, where capable, or as sub-contractors for more complex contracts. Part of the approach is to use the DWP supplier charter, signed by the department's top suppliers, which refers to extending its principles to SMEs as sub-contractors. Under the charter, larger suppliers are expected to use SMEs and voluntary organisations as sub-contractors, where it is appropriate, and brings definite added value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.0/5">A significant proportion of the Department's business with SME and TSOs is in welfare to work provision, where their specialist and local expertise can add great value. In preparing the market for the Work programme the Department has engaged with these organisations to gain their views and encourage them to become involved. It has taken steps to encourage potential prime contractors to come together with a range of partners and sub-contractors, particularly to use SMEs and TSOs where they could add value to bids. The Department will run local events to help prime contractors understand the needs and issues within each locality so they can put together appropriate supply chains for that area. The assessment of Work programme bidders will include a requirement to name all of their key sub-contractors and partners in their tenders and provide a letter of intent from each, this will allow assessment of SME and TSO involvement and the nature of their arrangements with the prime contractor. The department will expect its prime providers to gain accreditation of the Merlin Standard, to ensure provider supply chains are effective, high performing and that smaller organisations are treated appropriately and fairly. The Department recently won the Compact award for National Partnership Working, for development of the Merlin Standard, which demonstrates its commitment to stewardship of the welfare to work market, and equally the involvement and health of TSOs in prime provider led supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.0/6">Each year the Department measures the number of SMEs and TSOs it has business with and the value of this business. In 2009-10 the Department had business with 5,039 SMEs, spending a total of &#163;509 million with them, an increase of 18% over 2008-09. In 2009-10 the Department had business with 1,421 TSOs, spending a total of &#163;305 million with them, an increase of 15% over 2008-09. Currently, some 30% of welfare to work provider sub-contracts are with voluntary sector organisations. The Department therefore has a strong record of encouraging, supporting and using SME and TSOs to support its business, either as direct contractors or as sub-contractors in supply chains. Current plans are expected to improve on this record.</p>

Additionally, in the White Paper 'Universal Credit: Welfare That Works', estimates have been provided under the universal credit system.

However, EU legislation on biocides required industry to indicate which active substances they wished to support through the review.

Removal in these circumstances is most likely to reflect commercial decisions and not health and safety concerns. Where HSE has been made aware that specific products may be unlawfully on the market it has taken action, usually by alerting trading standards officers.</p>

	<p pid="b.284W.6/1">Course and non-migratory trout fisheries are protected under various legislative measures. Under the Environment Act 1995, the Environment Agency (EA) has a statutory duty to &quot;maintain, improve and develop fisheries for salmon, trout, eels, lampreys, smelt and freshwater fish&quot;. In addition there are UK obligations under the European habitats directive that covers several freshwater species and habitats. Continued and effective management of fisheries is essential to defining and achieving &quot;good ecological status&quot; as required in the water framework directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.6/2">In general the status of non-migratory freshwater fish stocks is encouraging. Coarse fish numbers are increasing and are a big improvement on two decades ago, when many rivers were heavily polluted, with fish communities restricted in distribution and numbers. Many non-migratory trout are caught in put-and-take fisheries on still waters, and improvements to these depend largely upon local stocking policies. Wild non-migratory brown trout are the same species as migratory brown trout and the juveniles cannot be distinguished, and so it is not possible to assess their status independently.</p>
	<p pid="b.284W.6/3">Regular monitoring is undertaken to help identify where improvements to fish populations are required and where additional protection is needed to prevent them from deteriorating.</p>

However, Animal Health will conduct a welfare inspection if they receive a complaint or allegation about poor welfare and when a targeted, or follow up visit is required. In 2009 Animal Health recorded three incidences where the level of compliance with animal welfare legislation resulted in a failure.</p>

	<p pid="b.289W.2/1">The Government's approach to waste management is underpinned by the waste hierarchy, which ranks waste management methods in order of environmental preference. For waste that cannot be prevented, re-used or recycled, recovery of energy is a preferable alternative, and recovering energy from waste is almost always preferable to landfill (unless analysis of the overall environmental impact for specific types of waste shows otherwise).</p>
	<p pid="b.289W.2/2">The waste hierarchy will shortly become law through the revised Waste Framework Directive, which seeks to promote waste prevention, increase recycling, and ensure better use of resources, while protecting human health and the environment. Recovery of energy from waste, including but not limited to incineration, has a role to play in managing waste according to the hierarchy.</p>
	<p pid="b.289W.2/3">A full review of waste policy is currently being carried out, with initial findings due in spring 2011. The role of recovering energy from waste, including incineration, will be considered as part of the review.</p>

Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br/> 2. It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br/> 3. Some percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.302W.3/1">Young people who are subject to bail or non-secure remand and who are in need of accommodation can be housed in a variety of lodgings. These can be provided by either the local authority or private providers including: foster homes; children's homes; hostels; bed and breakfast accommodation; or accommodation provided by voluntary organisations. Such placements are arranged by a youth offending team worker and social worker, and put before a placement panel. While there is no specific definition of &quot;specialist&quot; accommodation, the underlying principle will be to identify suitable accommodation that would most appropriately meet the needs of the young person, taking into account the nature of the offence and protection of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.302W.3/2">Young males aged 15 to 17 who are remanded to custody in the North West would normally be placed at HMPYOI Hindley. In a small number of cases where there are specific concerns about an individual's ability to manage in mainstream YOI accommodation, they may be remanded to HMPYOI Wetherby in West Yorkshire, which has additional dedicated accommodation for 15 to 17-year-old males. Females aged 17 who are remanded to custody would be placed at the Rivendell Unit which is a dedicated young women's unit at HMPYOI New Hall in Wakefield.</p>
	<p pid="b.302W.3/3">All young people aged 12 to 14 and females aged 15 and 16 who are remanded, are subject to a court ordered secure remand. Where a court decides to remand them to secure accommodation they would be placed in either a secure training centre (the nearest to the North West region being Hassockfield in County Durham) or a secure children's home (the two in the North West being Barton Moss in Manchester and Red Bank in Merseyside). Additionally, males aged 15 to 16-who are deemed by a court to meet certain vulnerability criteria-may also be given a court ordered secure remand and may be placed at a secure training centre or secure children's home. Males aged 15 to 17 who are not deemed to be vulnerable, would be remanded to a young offender institution. Children aged between 10 and 12 can be remanded to the local authority and if they meet certain criteria may be placed by the local authority into a secure children's home.</p>

	<p pid="b.311W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary routinely discusses a range of policing matters with the commissioner of the Metropolitan police. However, police tactics, including the use of horses and containment, are operational matters for the police. The Home Secretary has not made an assessment of video recordings of police tactics used on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November</phrase>. The Home Secretary has not requested specific information related to the use of containment or police horses but has been provided with an overview of the police operation. The police have to maintain a difficult balance between supporting rights to peaceful protest and ensuring local communities are properly protected, and the Home Secretary has written to the commissioner conveying her support for the police operation on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.313W.2/2">The spending review settlement for the UK Border Agency will mean that it needs to reduce staff numbers by about 5,200 by the end of the spending review period. This will reduce the work force to around 18,000 by 2015. It is not possible to say what the likely effects of the reductions in staff number in Liverpool are at this stage. The UK Border Agency is still working through detailed planning but will let staff and the public know as soon as the plans are clear. However, the UK Border Agency is committed to discussing work force planning in detail with the unions and our staff before confirming any changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.313W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-04">4 November</phrase>, the Home Office implemented a new restructuring, redeployment and redundancy policy, based on ACAS best practise, which provides a framework within which to manage down headcount. Compulsory redundancy continues to be a last resort and the UK Border Agency have committed to using a range of redundancy avoidance measures including voluntary early release, a recruitment freeze on external appointments and redeployment to ensure that this is the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.315W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's overseas missions receive information on human rights, including allegations of abuse, from a wide variety of sources. These include local non-governmental organisations, human rights defenders and local media. Our missions use this information in their assessment of the local human rights situation, and raise allegations of human rights abuses with host Governments on a case-by-case basis. We do not centrally hold information on reports of individual cases of human rights abuses, so to answer your question, an FCO-wide search would be required which would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.315W.0/2">Human rights reporting is key to our work to promote and protect human rights around the world. The FCO will publish a command paper in spring 2011 which will detail our human rights work around the world and our assessment of the human rights situation in a number of countries.</p>

The review is estimated to cost &#163;125,000 which is predominantly the salary costs of one part-time and three full-time civil servants. The cost will be met from within existing provision and will not therefore increase public spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.3/5">The Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-16">16 June 2010</phrase> to recommend structural and non-structural measures to reform the banking system. The Commission has been asked to produce a final report by September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.3/6">Sir John Vickers will be paid &#163;60,000 per annum and work an average of two days per week. Other Commission members will not be paid and work an average of one day a week on Commission business. All Commissioners will be reimbursed for such travel and subsistence expenses as they incur in pursuit of Commission business, in accordance with HM Treasury's expenses policy. The Commissioner's letters of appointment detail this information, and are available on the Commission's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.3/7">The Commission is supported by a full-time secretariat of 14 officials drawn from HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Financial Services Authority, the Bank of England and the Office of Fair Trading. The pay costs of staff seconded to the secretariat are being met by their parent organisations and are not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.3/8">The Commission will be provided with such other resources as are necessary to perform its task. All Commission costs are being met by reprioritisation from within existing budgets and there will be no consequent increase public spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.3/9">As announced at the launch of the Office of Tax Simplification on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July 2010</phrase>, the office will carry out two initial reviews on tax reliefs (final report by Budget 2011) and small business taxation (interim report by Budget 2011). The office will be led by right hon. Michael Jack as chairman and John Whiting as tax director and neither will receive any remuneration but will be eligible for reasonable expenses in line with Treasury expenses policy. The cost of the individual reviews has not been estimated but the running costs of the office as a whole are estimated to be in the region of &#163;500,000 per annum. The office is staffed by three full time civil servants with backgrounds in HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs. There are four staff seconded at no cost to the office from PwC, BDO, Deloittes and private business, see:</p>

	<p pid="b.331W.0/3">There are simple and proportionate steps that institutions such as colleges can adopt to prevent the use of their networks for the online infringement of copyright. Many already do so and, in many cases, their activities to prevent infringement already go far beyond what the Digital Economy Act requires. We expect that colleges will continue to put in place such measures to prevent infringement on their networks, when the Act is implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.356W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/2">The Department has no plans to commission an assessment of the risks from asbestos in schools. The Government Scientific Advisory Committee Working Group on Action to Control Chemicals (WATCH), which considers all aspects of risk from toxic chemicals including asbestos, is currently examining the risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from low level exposure to asbestos fibres. Their findings will be made known to the recently formed Asbestos in Schools Steering Group chaired by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/3">On the numbers of maintained schools containing Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs), I refer you to the answer given to me on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-06-04.657"><i> Official Report</i>, column 657W</phrase>, by the former Minister of State for Schools. This stated that:</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Our best estimate in September 2008 was that around 70% of school buildings contain some ACMs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/5">These schools are likely to contain a range of ACMs, e.g. moulded or preformed asbestos in the lagging used as thermal insulation on pipes and boilers; asbestos insulating board used for fire protection, thermal insulation, partitioning and ducts; and asbestos-containing floor tiles and textured coatings. The responsibility to assess the condition of ACMs falls to the duty holder under the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/6">Under the Control of Asbestos Regulations, statutory duties are placed on those who are responsible for repair and maintenance of non-domestic premises. In a maintained school, the duty holder is normally the maintaining local authority-where there is delegated funding this duty is often shared with the head teacher. For academies, voluntary aided and foundation schools, the duty holder is the school's governing body. For independent schools, it is the proprietor, governors or trustees. The Department is working with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and asbestos training providers to produce training for head teachers to make sure they are fully aware of their roles and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/7">A recent questionnaire survey and follow-up work of HSE shows that the majority of local authorities were managing asbestos in their schools. Formal enforcement action in the form of 18 improvement notices and one prohibition notice was taken against 10 local authorities requiring improvements to their asbestos management arrangements. The reports of this work and the letter to local authorities reminding them of their responsibilities under the Control of Asbestos Regulations can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/services/education/information.htm">www.hse.gov.uk/services/education/information.htm</a>#asbestos</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/9">It is for the duty holder to assess, with expert advice, the action which needs to be taken when buildings are refurbished, depending on the location of the asbestos materials in relation to the location, nature and extent of the works to be carried out. Removal, encapsulation, repair or management in situ may all be appropriate actions. Responsibility for prioritisation of specific projects rests with individual schools and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.356W.3/10">Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is in good condition and managed in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. HSE does not recommend the routine removal of asbestos. Its advice remains that, providing that ACMs are maintained in good condition, they can be left in situ and managed until a building reaches the end of its life, at which time ACMs can be removed without risks to building users who would otherwise be exposed to fibres arising from significant disturbance.</p>

	<p pid="b.357W.2/1">The Government have no plans to review the levels of meat consumption in schools. School food must meet the nutritional standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.2/2">Pupils need the right balance of food and nutrients to develop and grow. The nutrient-based standards have been designed to make the food offered healthier by increasing the vitamin and mineral content and by decreasing the fat, saturated fat and salt content. Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, such as iron and zinc.</p>
	<p pid="b.357W.2/3">The regulations which set the standards do not specify that schools must provide meat options or vegetarian options. Schools should make every effort to cater for all pupils' needs in order to provide a popular, viable service that is also compliant with the standards. In doing so, many will want to take account of environmental and health considerations.</p>
