Their realisation would give Iran the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran's development of these technologies is not necessary for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. If Iran suspends its proliferation activities, the E3+3 will negotiate a long-term agreement that would transform the international community's relationship with Iran.</p>

	<p pid="c.478W.14/1">The human rights situation in Indonesia has improved over the last 10 years and we judge that the government remains committed to further progress, as indicated by its 2006 accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We recognise that challenges remain and our embassy in Jakarta closely follows the situation in Papua, particularly concerning civil society work on human rights and freedom of expression. We will continue to encourage the Indonesian government to respect their international obligations in this regard. We remain firm in our commitment to freedom of expression, but do not believe that making representations to the Indonesian government on incidents such as the banning of Sendius Wonda's book would be as effective as the wide-ranging engagement we have with Indonesia on human rights.</p>

Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS) is developing a new payment system that should mean local authorities will be able to set up accounts with magistrates courts allowing them to pay all court fees incurred by single monthly or quarterly payments.

The report can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.ecm.aov.uk/stayingsafe">www.ecm.aov.uk/stayingsafe</a> and a copy is available in the House Library. In the Staying Safe Action Plan, we set out new commitments to help children, young people and their parents understand better the risks to their safety, including from accidental injury. These include the establishment of a Child Safety Education Coalition to deliver and evaluate child safety education across the country and ensure that more children, including disabled children, are taught about how to manage risk. We also announced new guidance for professionals on common risks in the home as well as a Priority Review of local accidental prevention.

	<p pid="c.492W.2/2">Security measures are a fundamental component of the national eCaf system design and all proposed security requirements have been reviewed by the Department's IT Security Officer.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/3">When a common assessment is undertaken and fogged on the national eCaf system, it will automatically notify ContactPoint that an assessment has been carried out along with contact details of the practitioner that can provide information about the assessment (usually the practitioner who performed the assessment). This will help to prevent duplication of effort, allow practitioners to make more informed decisions and respond in a coordinated way. There will be no access to the common assessment, nor any details within it, from ContactPoint. ContactPoint will be provided with limited information (which does not include any case information) extracted from the national eCaf and other systems using a one-way process. ContactPoint will not update the case record systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.2/4">As with ContactPoint, the development of the national eCaf system had significant input from a range of practitioners and managers across a wide range of children's services. Some of these individuals have been involved in the development of both systems.</p>

	<p pid="c.492W.5/3">This data source is a nationally representative survey of registered Childcare and Early Years Providers, commissioned by the Department. The survey began in 1998 and was repeated in 2001, 2002-03, 2005 and 2006. The survey is also commissioned to take place in 2007 and 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.492W.5/4">The 2006 Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey shows that the workforce is becoming better qualified across all provider types. There has been a rise in supervisory staff in settings coinciding with a rise in staff qualifications. Over 70 per cent. of all paid staff in full day care, and early years settings in maintained schools hold at least a Level 3 qualification, while in children's centres this rises to over 80 per cent. of staff. The proportion of staff with a Level 3 qualification or above in full day care is 10 percentage points higher than in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.495W.5/1">The Government recognise the importance of closing the gap between the number of people with access to information technology and those without, commonly known as the 'digital divide'.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.5/2">Since 1997 we have run a range of education-related programmes to widen accessibility to computers and the internet for low-income families, and these have provided hardware, connectivity and training both into homes and into the local community. In 2001, for example, we opened the first UK Online centres to provide community level access to computers, the internet as well as advice and training in how to use them. There is now a network of over 6,000 centres across the country in libraries, community centres and other accessible buildings.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.5/3">We also supported cross government initiatives such as the seven point action plan to close the digital divide identified in &quot;Connecting the UK: The Strategy for a Digitally Rich Nation&quot; and were one of the main contributors to the plan's national digital challenge for a region to give universal online access to local public services by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.5/4">We have concentrated our efforts on young learners and in school the level of access has increased significantly. In a primary school for example, 19 children had to share one computer in 1997 whereas now there is one computer for every 6.2 children and through our extended schools' programme and our support for the e-learning foundation we have helped schools to provide children with access beyond the school day.</p>
	<p pid="c.495W.5/5">In 2005 we started a &pound;60 million Computers for Pupils programme to put ICT into the homes of the most disadvantaged secondary school pupils in the most deprived areas of the country and last year I established the Home Access Taskforce with representation from industry, education and the third sector. The Taskforce is due to report in April this year on how we might ensure that every family with 5 to 19-year-old learners in England has access to affordable ICT resources and support at home&mdash;and I recently announced an additional &pound;30 million to provide further support under the Computers for Pupils programme until the task force proposals can be assessed and if appropriate, implemented.</p>

The sample of the public is designed to be broadly representative of the general public, and as such, includes parents, whose views are analysed in comparison with non-parents where relevant.

	<p pid="c.499W.8/1">There has been no withdrawal of funding. Overall capital support for Isle of Wight and its schools during the period covered by the comprehensive spending review (2008-11) is &pound;36 million. Capital support for the period covered by the current spending review (2005-08) is &pound;37.4 million (excluding funding earmarked specifically for a Building Schools for the Future One School Pathfinder project). Although, in comparison to 2006-07 and 2007-08, there has been a reduction in capital support for the provision of new pupil places in areas of population growth (or Basic Need) this is in line with forecast data provided by the local authority. However, from 2009-10, Isle of Wight will benefit from the introduction of the new Primary Capital Programme which aims to support local authorities in implementing a strategic approach to renewing at least half of all primary schools by 2022-23.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.9/3">The Department launched the 5 A DAY programme to promote the health benefits of eating a variety of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day as we believe this gives a positive message to the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/4">The 5 A DAY logo was launched by the Department; over 640 organisations are licensed to use the 5 A DAY logo. The Food Standards Agency's (FSA) Consumer Attitudes Survey, 2006 showed that 72 per cent. of people are now aware that they should eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, up from 43 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/5">'Top Tips for Top Mums' is a new 5 A DAY campaign. The campaign aims to help families by sharing real tips from real mums on how they got their kids to eat more fruit and vegetables. Mums or dads can e-mail mums@5adaytoptips.co.uk to send in their tip which may then be shared with other families via the 5 A DAY website, the media and other 5 A DAY partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/6">In November 2006, the new Healthy Start scheme was implemented across the United Kingdom to provide vouchers for milk, fruit, vegetables and infant formula and free vitamin supplements to qualifying families and to back this up with information and advice through their health care professional on breastfeeding/healthy eating. They also receive an information booklet and a magazine with links to the healthy start website.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/7">The Government will invest &pound;75 million in an integrated marketing programme to inform, support and empower parents to make changes to their children's diets and levels of physical activity. It will include simple universal messages for all families as well as tailored messages for at-risk families. There will be an emphasis on highlighting opportunities to take part in activities in the local area&mdash;everything from fruit-tasting sessions to 'walking buses' and safe play areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/8">The Government will also seek to further develop the NHS Choices website so that it provides highly personalised advice on diet, activity and how to maintain a healthy weight. The Government will work with the FSA and other relevant bodies to ensure that this advice is based on the best available evidence, so that individuals can make sense of often conflicting advice from other sources. We will also explore the potential to include information on which companies meet which aspects of the codes of good practice in food and entertainment technology.</p>

	<p pid="c.511W.2/1">The Department issued its &quot;Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) Guidance (DfES 0116/2000)&quot; to all maintained schools in July 2000. This outlines the responsibility of schools in this area and provides information on the issues to be covered at each of the four key stages, taking account of the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the young people receiving this education.</p>
	<p pid="c.511W.2/2">The Department has not commissioned research on the impact of SRE on the attitudes and lifestyle choices of young people. However, as part of the Children's Plan we have given a commitment to review best practice in effective SRE and how it is delivered in schools. We have listened to young people and recognise that many feel that they do not currently have the knowledge they need to make safe and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health. We will involve young people fully in the review to make sure that future SRE better meets their needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.512W.3/3">We are taking a number of steps to build up the capacity of the primary school system to deliver this, including a teacher training programme in a primary languages specialism. This has so far trained nearly 3,000 teachers, with thousands more to be trained over the next few years. A report by Ofsted, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-29">29 January</phrase>, showed that trainees on the course are being well prepared as future teachers of languages. Increased funding for local authorities to support the delivery of primary languages&mdash;&pound;32.5 million in 2008-09, up from &pound;27.5 million in 2007-08 will help schools to buy in specialist advice or resources. Teachers can also make use of sources of support in the classroom, such as schemes of work in French, German and Spanish and materials on the Primary Languages Training Zone, the online training resource for teaching and learning languages at Key Stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.512W.3/4">My answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-13">13 December</phrase> set out what we are doing to raise standards of teaching and learning at Key Stage 3. In addition, to ensure that gains made at primary level are not lost, CILT, the National Centre for Languages, is working with groups of primary and secondary schools in a variety of contexts to develop solutions to transition, and will be publishing draft guidelines later this term. There is already guidance for schools in the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages and as part of the National Strategies and CILT Key Stage 3 programme to ensure that teaching of languages in secondary school builds on progress made earlier.</p>

	<p pid="c.513W.3/1">Improving standards of literacy and numeracy at all stages of education has been one of the Government's top priorities. There is no nationally expected level of achievement for 16-year-olds (pupils at the end of key stage 4). The Government's current public service agreement target is for 60 per cent. of 16-year-olds to achieve 5 good GCSE grades (A*-C) or equivalent by 2008. Figures for 2007 published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-09">9 January</phrase> show that this target has been met. But we are raising the bar and in future the target for the end of key stage 4 will be measured against the proportion of pupils achieving 5 grades A*-C or equivalent, including GCSE English and mathematics. The 2007 figure for England achieving this standard was 46.7 per cent. compared with 37.0 per cent. in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="c.516W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.2/2">The adult numeracy qualifications referred to are properly called the &quot;Certificate in Adult Numeracy' and were developed as part of the Government's national Skills for Life strategy for improving adult literacy, language and numeracy skills. The Skills for Life numeracy curriculum covers a tightly defined set of topics as laid out in the National Adult Numeracy Standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.2/3">The Key Skills qualifications are properly called &quot;Key Skills in Application of Number' and were designed for 16 to 19-year-olds as part of the Curriculum 2000 reforms of Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5, The &quot;Key Skills in Application of Number&quot; is a broader qualification than Skills for Life Numeracy and covers a wider range of topics. As well as following a curriculum and completing a test, Key Skills qualifications require the student to present a portfolio of work.</p>
	<p pid="c.516W.2/4">The names of the respective qualifications were chosen to reflect the content of the qualifications and, in the case of Key Skills, to reflect the name of the policy. We do not believe there is potential for confusion between these two qualifications since they are named, marketed and described differently. We see these two qualifications as a lateral progression pathway for adult numeracy: adults can take the smaller Certificate in Adult Numeracy and, if they wish, then achieve the broader Key Skills in Application of Number qualification with the addition of a portfolio of work.</p>

	<p pid="c.520W.2/1">We believe it is right that we should challenge local authorities to make best use of resources by taking action to balance the demand and supply of school places. Our guidance Primary Capital Programme: Guidance for local authorities on developing their primary strategy for change makes clear that strategies that fail to commit to doing so will not be approved. However, the guidance also acknowledges that it will not always be practicable, or desirable, to remove all surplus places and that authorities should allow for parental choice, accessibility of schools and possible future increase in pupil numbers due to demographic changes. It also recognises that in order to preserve access for young children, there may be more empty places in schools in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.520W.5/1">Over the next three years, we are providing a record &pound;21.9 billion of capital support for investment in school buildings. Much of this funding is devolved to local authorities and schools for their local priorities, which can include installing or improving school kitchens and dining areas. As part of this funding, we are making available &pound;150 million of targeted capital grant to those authorities with high need who aim to install kitchens in over 20 per cent. of their schools where currently there are none, and where to do so without targeted support would put unacceptable pressure on other funding priorities. We issued an invitation and guidance to all authorities on how to apply for this funding in December 2007, and they have until the end of this month to make an application.</p>
	<p pid="c.520W.5/2">The Department does not hold detailed information on which schools do not have kitchens. Working with the School Food Trust in late 2006, we identified the following authorities as having relatively high numbers of primary and secondary schools without kitchens, but this may not be a full list: Bournemouth, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Harrow, Hillingdon, Kingston upon Thames, Lincolnshire, Milton Keynes, North East Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Poole, Somerset, Swindon, West Sussex, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire.</p>

	<p pid="c.522W.3/2"><i> </i>The CVA model is calculated using an established statistical technique referred to as multi-level modelling. This method uses a formula which estimates the contribution each school makes to its pupils' attainment, taking account of each pupil's starting point and a broad range of contextual factors which are shown to affect progress and for which consistent national data are available. The impact of these factors that are accounted for, including gender, are calculated simultaneously. The formula is calculated each year based on the actual attainment of the entire national cohort of over half a million pupils. The CVA calculations, therefore, make an allowance for the different gender mix within each school, when calculating the school CVA measure.</p>
	<p pid="c.522W.3/3">The 2007 Key Stage (KS) 1-2 contextualised value added model shows that boys, on average, achieved 0.44 KS2 points higher than girls with the same pattern of prior attainment at KS1 and contextual factors. This means that boys made just under half a term's more progress than girls over this period.</p>

	<p pid="c.523W.2/1">The Charities Act 2006 provides a clear definition of charity with the emphasis on public benefit. At the heart of the Act is a new statutory definition of charity, based on a list of charitable purposes, and the principle of charities being for public benefit. The Act removes a long-standing presumption of public benefit for charities for the advancement of education, advancement of religion and the relief of poverty. This means that all charities will have to be able to demonstrate public benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.523W.2/2">The Charity Commission, as independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, will interpret the public benefit requirement in the light of case law, modern conditions and the removal of the presumption of public benefit. The Charity Commission issued draft guidance on the principles of public benefit for consultation in May 2007, and received over 900 responses. The Commission will publish its final public benefit guidance in January 2008. It will follow this with the development of specific guidance for groups of charities likely to be most affected&mdash;including the independent school sector. The relevant provisions of the Act are expected to come into force in spring 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.526W.5/1">The Government's policy is to encourage rapid English language acquisition as the key to successful integration into the UK education system and the wider community. Newly arrived pupils are given additional help in learning English by specialist advisers and teachers of English as an additional language (EAL) and bilingual classroom assistants, who work in collaboration with classroom teachers to plan lessons and teaching materials. The evidence indicates that EAL pupils typically catch up with their peers in attainment terms within two years of first admission to a school in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/2">The number of pupils for whom English is an additional language (EAL) rose from 500,000 to 790,000 between 1997 and 2007. Putting this in perspective, such children now comprise 12 per cent. of all pupils as against 7.5 per cent. in 1997 and 9 per cent. in 2001. Funding for EAL children has fully kept pace with these increasing numbers through:</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/3" class="indent">an element within the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for primary schools which was some &pound;256 million in 2004-05, rising to &pound;299 million in 2007-08, with a further rise to over &pound;330 million in 2010-11&mdash;an 11 per cent. real terms increase on the 2004-05 level;</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/4" class="indent">a substantial provision for EAL through the ring fenced Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG), which has risen from &pound;162 million in 2004-05 to &pound;179 million in 2007-08 and will rise to &pound;206 million by 2010-11&mdash;a 9 per cent. increase on the 2004-05 level;</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/5" class="indent">in addition an Exceptional Circumstances Grant (ECG) has been introduced to reflect changes in local authorities' pupil numbers which occur after the three year indicative allocations of DSG have been announced.</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/6">These increases form part of the substantial overall increase in school funding: over the past 10 years since 1997, overall per pupil revenue funding for schools has increased by 67 per cent. in real terms. We expect local authorities to be able to manage new pressures from within these increases, and to ensure that the resources reach the individual schools affected by new arrivals and EAL speakers.</p>
	<p pid="c.526W.5/7">The Government have recently launched a New Arrivals Excellence Programme intended to provide practical support for local authorities, schools and individual teachers. This programme is backed by other practical support including measures to improve the supply, training and qualifications of EAL specialist staff, and to deliver new web-based teaching and learning materials.</p>

	<p pid="c.529W.5/1">The hon. Member refers to our guidance to local authorities on developing a primary strategy for change. There are no plans for reviewing the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.5/2">We need to ensure that local authorities are able to provide good value for money for their communities, allowing them to invest in higher standards and better facilities for pupils. One aspect of securing good value for money is taking early and decisive action to balance the demand and supply of school places, but we recognise that the extent and nature of local authority plans will depend on local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.5/3">The guidance on preparing primary capital strategies must be read in its entirety. It explains that authorities should allow scope for parental choice, support schools with high standards, ensure schools are accessible to pupils, and take account of possible future increases in pupil numbers due to demographic changes. It also recognises that in order to preserve access for young children, there may be more empty places in schools in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.5/4">The guidance asks authorities to put in place decisive plans for early action to ensure that no school has more than 25 per cent. surplus places, and I anticipate that local authorities will make these plans sensitively taking account of my recent letter which has been placed in the House Library. The 10 per cent. benchmark relates to surplus capacity across the whole primary school estate of a local authority, and not to individual schools. We want local authority strategies to set out how surplus places across the authority as a whole will be managed down over time although there is no fixed timescale.</p>

	<p pid="c.531W.5/1">The Government have increased the capital available for investment in school buildings sevenfold in real terms between 1997 and 2010. In 1996-97, it was under &pound;700 million: by 2010-11 it will be more than &pound;8.2 billion a year. Most of this funding can be used for school kitchens where this is the local priority. Authorities and schools in the West Midlands will get over &pound;1 billion over the next three years. For each of the next three years, a typical secondary school will get over &pound;113,000 of its own money and a typical primary over &pound;34,000 which can be used to improve kitchens and dining areas if they wish. Additionally, we are providing &pound;150 million of targeted funding by 2010 to support authorities install new kitchens in schools which have none and where there is exceptional need.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.5/2">In 2007 the Department published &quot;Inspirational Design for Kitchen and Dining Spaces&quot; to give good guidance to authorities and schools on how to build kitchens that are efficient and suitable to cook good healthy food, and dining areas that are attractive to children and encourage healthy eating. This was prepared in consultation with the School Food Trust and industry professionals.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.5/3">Investment decisions are made locally and the Department does not collect information on how much authorities and schools have invested in kitchen facilities. In 2007, authorities provided information on school building projects, including that in the previous 10 years there had been improvement to kitchens and serveries in over 2,300 schools nationally. The School Building Investment Data are available in the parliamentary libraries, showing the information from each local authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.533W.8/1">The distribution method for Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) starts from each authority's budgeted spend for schools in 2005-06, which largely reflects the historical allocation of resources through the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) formula, which gave additional funding for additional educational needs, sparsity, and area costs. The DSG per pupil for Plymouth is below the national average because it attracts no additional funding for area costs or sparsity, and its proportion of funding for additional educational needs at 11.6 per cent. is only slightly above the national average of 11.3 per cent. for 2006-07.

	<p pid="c.535W.9/1">The Government have been and continue to be committed to improving science facilities in schools as part of their aim to transform all school buildings. More than &pound;31 billion has been invested in school buildings since 1997 including through Schools for the Future and Academies during which time 6,644 new or refurbished laboratories have been provided.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.9/2">This year &pound;6.7 billion of funding is available for investment in schools, and this will rise to &pound;8.2 billion a year by 2010-11. Most of this can be invested in science facilities where this is the local priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.9/3">This unprecedented level of investment is a marvellous opportunity to create science facilities that inspire learners and teachers alike. With this in mind my Department set up Project Faraday in 2006, developing exciting design ideas at 12 demonstration schools that can act as 'exemplars' for science provision, to inspire and inform local authorities and schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.535W.9/4">A book showing the exemplar designs will be published later this month. The first built project will be completed at the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.536W.2/2">Local authorities have existing legal powers to apply to the Secretary of State for permission to replace the governing body of a school with an IEB when, after an Ofsted judgment, a school is in special measures, or requires significant improvement. The power may also be used when a school has received a valid Warning Notice under section 60 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006,</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.2/3">The Secretary of State also has reserve powers to replace the governing body of a school with an IEB when a school is in special measures or requires significant improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.2/4">The IEB is the governing body of the school for the time it is in office. It has all the powers and responsibilities of a governing body. The IEB's main functions are to secure a sound basis for future improvement in the school and promote high standards of educational achievement.</p>
	<p pid="c.536W.2/5">Members of an IEB are chosen on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate authority, that is, the local authority or the Secretary of State, depending on the origin of the intervention.</p>

	<p pid="c.537W.2/1">We are taking a range of measures to improve the quality of the careers advice received by young people in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.2/2">We are seeking to place a statutory duty on schools to deliver careers education impartially. This will be backed up by guidance to which schools will be required to have regard.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.2/3">The Children's Plan announced several measures designed to improve the quality of careers provision in schools; for example, by promoting experiential learning and by providing materials to support more effective peer mentoring. It also announced pathfinder projects in primary schools designed to explore the benefits of early careers interventions in extending young people's horizons and raising aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.2/4">And we are looking at ways of ensuring the delivery of high quality careers education within the new PSHE: Economic Well Being curriculum. This is expected to include the development of new curriculum guidance and the provision of high quality teaching materials for use in the classroom. We are also looking into new arrangements for the continuing professional development of the careers workforce.</p>
	<p pid="c.537W.2/5">Schools' careers support for young people is backed up by external, independent advice from the Connexions service. From April 2008 responsibility for Connexions will pass to local authorities which will enable them to make improved links with other services for young people. Local authorities will also be expected to have regard to recently published &quot;Quality Standards&quot; which set out my Department's expectations of the information, advice and guidance services that they will provide.</p>

Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) have assessed their own progress against a range of outcomes for children and families as part of their local level monitoring and evaluation. Local evaluation reports can be obtained directly from the programme or from the National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS) website <a href="http://www.ness.bbk.ac.uk">www.ness.bbk.ac.uk</a> The report for Sure Start Hetton and Houghton in 2005 shows that, based on 95 responses out of a survey sample of 240, 93 per cent. were satisfied or very satisfied with their antenatal services, 96 per cent. (of 58 responses) were happy with the baby clinic, and 90 per cent. with the health visiting services. The 2005 report for Sure Start Monument shows that, based on 92 responses out of a survey sample of 260, 98 per cent. were satisfied or very satisfied with their antenatal services, 92 per cent. with the baby clinic, 91 per cent. with the health visiting service and 90 per cent. with their GP surgery. The information in these reports is locally collected and is not validated by the NESS team or the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

The proposals can be found in paragraphs 3.11-3.12. of the consultation document on the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006: Independent Safeguarding Authority scheme which is available on the Department for Children Schools and Families consultation website. The consultation will run until the <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.542W.3/4">The Department for Children Schools and Families, Department of Health and Home Office will continue to consulting widely with stakeholders including sports bodies and organisations and will continue working with the Department for Culture Media and Sport and sports bodies to help inform Regulations and prepare for implementation of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.</p>

It is important to note that the LFS will not produce estimates that directly match those from the Department's Participation SFR, and that they will be subject to sampling error and respondent error. The LFS estimates of population size by cohort also differ from the Participation SFR.

	<p pid="c.546W.0/1">Staff in catering, craft, cleaning and Vote Office porter roles are politically unrestricted. These members of staff represent 20.1 per cent. (395) of the House of Commons service. The other 79.9 per cent. (1,573) of staff are not necessarily politically restricted, but must obtain permission from their Departmental Establishment Officer (DEO) to take part in any political activity. Of these, 0.1 per cent. have requested and been granted permission for specific political activities. Staff in the Senior Commons Structure (SCS), staff in regular direct contact with Members in support of the business of the House and its committees, and those who provide information, briefing or advice to Members will not normally be given permission to take part in political activity. There are 86 SCS staff (4.4 per cent.), but it is not readily possible to identify the numbers of staff in the other categories.</p>

The incidence of HIV and hepatitis infection in Northern Ireland is low and a survey published by the Northern Ireland Prison Service in 2005 showed that the incidence of blood borne infections in its establishments was very low indeed. Therefore, although the issue will be kept under review, there are no current plans to make condoms freely available to prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="c.552W.2/2">We continue to encourage train operators to carry bikes on trains where possible. The Department's Cycling Policy document and the White Paper published last year set out our policy: train operators should facilitate the carriage of cycles on off-peak services and accept the folding cycles at all times. However, during the peak hours, where capacity is under pressure, it can be in the interests of the majority of passengers not to permit non-folding cycles on board. It is for individual train operators to determine which services cannot accommodate non-folding bicycles and of course to determine the number of bikes which can be carried at other times.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.2/3">We want all Train Operating Companies to take into account the wider benefits of cycling when considering both investments in cycle facilities and their own rules for carrying cycles. This is particularly important when procuring new rolling stock where Space for bicycles must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.2/4">The White Paper also announced the setting up of a task force to look into how bike and rail journeys can be better integrated. The task force includes the Association of Train Operating Companies, Network Rail, Passenger Focus and Cycling England. I look forward to hearing about their progress.</p>

	<p pid="c.557W.5/1">My Department is funding the following work to provide incentives to companies proposing to encourage investment in plastics reprocessing.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/2">The Waste and Resources Action Programme's (WRAP) current manufacturing programme is developing major projects that switch significant manufacturing processes from virgin material to recycled material input. This includes projects to incorporate up to 30 per cent. of recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE) in the manufacture of one-quarter of the UK's plastic milk bottle production. This work involves capital support for new equipment and work with local authorities to increase collection of plastic bottles. The new demand created by the project is encouraging the development of plastics reprocessing facilities. Furthermore, WRAP is providing direct support through its business growth programme to develop the recycling sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/3">WRAP is also undertaking trials with a number of technologies with the aim of understanding the best ways to handle mixed plastics from an environmental, economical and technological perspective. The programme is investigating three main areas: collection, reprocessing, and end markets. Different recycling and recovery options are being considered as part of this work, including reprocessing mixed plastics into new plastics, incineration, chemical treatment and even turning them into diesel. WRAP's focus on mixed plastics follows on from the successful uptake of plastic bottle recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/4">WRAP is also currently finalising its business plan for the three-year period April 2008 to March 2011. This is likely to build on its present work on plastics collection, reprocessing and end markets, with the intention of incentivising further investment in each of these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/5">We also support industrial symbiosis via the UK wide National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). With over 10,000 members, NISP employs industrial symbiosis to bring together companies from all business sectors with the aim of improving cross industry resource efficiency through the commercial trading of materials, energy and water and sharing of assets, logistics and expertise.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/6">Over the last three years, NISP has helped industry release over &pound;16.2 million in private investment in plastics reprocessing facilities across the UK. Working with over 70 companies nationwide specifically on plastic reprocessing, NISP has helped recover almost 60,000 tonnes of plastics through landfill diversion, whilst actively helping to safeguard over 90 jobs and generating a further 39 new jobs in the plastics reprocessing industry through increased sales and cost savings of over &pound;32 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.557W.5/7">For example, NISP has been working with Chem Polymer Ltd. to secure private investment of over &pound;1 million which has led to the generation of over &pound;10 million in increased sales. Working on landfill diversion of plastic wastes, NISP has helped Petlon Polymers Ltd. generate sales in excess of &pound;10 million as a result of increased plant throughput.</p>

	<p pid="c.558W.5/2">The UK Plan for Shipments of Waste, which sets out Government policy on shipments of waste, prohibits the export of waste from the UK for disposal with very few exceptions. Waste may be exported for recovery, including recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.558W.5/3">DEFRA does not have available data on the amount of recyclable waste that is sent abroad for recycling. However, based on HM Revenue and Customs export data, it is estimated that in 2006, the UK exported some 8 million tonnes of metal scrap, 4 million tonnes of paper, 441,000 tonnes of plastic and 136,000 tonnes of glass cullet for recycling. These figures will include recyclable materials collected from all sources including households, commerce and industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.558W.5/4">Statistics for waste arisings and disposal are available only for 1998-99 and 2002-03. In 1998-99, 51 per cent. of household, business and construction/demolition waste in the UK was sent to landfill and 32 per cent. was recycled, with the rest being sent to other recovery or disposal routes, including incineration. In 2002-03, the amount landfilled decreased to 43 per cent., with the amount recycled increasing to 43 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.560W.3/1">Mastiff availability has never dropped below the critical 85 per cent. availability rate. We work hard to ensure that sufficient spares are delivered to our forces; in the vast majority of cases adequate re-supply to theatre takes place in a timely fashion. A number of measures are being introduced to improve the operational availability of the Mastiff fleet on operations in both theatres. In particular we have put in place an agreement with the US manufacturer to allow the UK Integrator to manufacture, and also to be able to procure spares direct from source. In addition we have established a spares handling warehouse within the US, exclusively to meet UK requirements.</p>

	<p pid="c.567W.2/1">Since 2006 approximately 24,550 sets of Osprey body armour and 3,766 sets of Kestrel body armour have been procured. Like Osprey and Kestrel, enhanced combat body armour (ECBA) is composed of a number of components, but because it is available in a range of sizes, comes from various suppliers, and its individual component usage rates vary, it is not possible to say exactly how many complete sets have been procured. Records are not kept of the number of components lost or destroyed, and hence it is also not possible to say exactly how many sets are currently owned by UK forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.2/2">However every person is issued with a complete set of ECBA prior to deployment on operations. To ensure that sufficient operational stock is always available we monitor our requirement closely. At present between 14,000 and 16,000 sets of ECBA are being issued to personnel entering operational theatres, every six months. Further stocks are also held in theatre for maintenance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.2/3">In addition, there is a pool of approximately 8,000 sets of ECBA which is used for training purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.2/4">The MOD does not procure or support AK47 assault rifles or underslung grenade launchers for AK47s. However, UK forces own a number of AK47 assault rifles as specimens, museum pieces and such like. Information on the numbers owned are not held centrally.</p>

MOD catering services are usually provided as part of a site multi-activity contract and may include a pay-as-you-dine requirement for catering services in military establishments. The MOD is committed to supporting ethical trading, wherever possible, subject to the need to obtain best value for money. Each catering contractor may choose to offer fair trade products in their tender for a contract but a bid cannot be rejected or considered non-compliant because it does not include any desired fair trade options. After contract award, contract documents can be used to make it clear that, where the winning tenderer is able to provide fair trade options, such products should be made available.</p>

The MOD used the influenza scenario to test the pan-Defence Flu Framework in March 2007. MOD top level budgets and trading funds and agencies (down to business unit level) have also been encouraged to test their own business continuity plans using the influenza scenario.</p>

	<p pid="c.571W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will commission research to establish how frequently Child Support Agency clients are advised by the Agency to contact their hon. Member to make progress on their case.</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.3/5" class="indent">The Agency does not gather data on the number of clients referred directly to Members of Parliament for resolution of their cases, as this does not form part of the Agency's complaints process. Under the Agency's Operational Improvement Plan, the Agency reviewed the complaints handling process, and designed a new streamlined approach which focuses on earlier resolution through the introduction of specialist caseworkers responsible for resolving all aspects of our clients' complaints.</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.3/6" class="indent">Complaints Resolution Teams based in each of our main centres take responsibility for resolving all complaints. If having been through this process the client still remains dissatisfied, the Agency's Complaints Review Team based at Durham House, Washington will review their case. This two stage process aims to promote earlier and complete resolution and reduce the number of complaints escalated to the Chief Executive, Ministers and the Independent Case Examiner (ICE).</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.3/7" class="indent">The Agency therefore will advise clients of the options open to them should they be dissatisfied about how their case has been handled and this will include advising a client to contact their MP, should the client wish to take issue with current child support policy. It is however clearly inappropriate for the Agency to direct clients to their Member of Parliament if the Agency has mishandled their case.</p>

	<p pid="c.572W.2/8" class="indent">This debt is owed by non-resident parents as a result of their failure to meet their responsibilities to their children.

	<p pid="c.572W.2/9" class="indent">At the end of November 2007, the latest period for which these figures are available, the Child Support Agency had 1,056,500 cases with outstanding debt. Of the total debt outstanding, we estimate that 53 per cent is owed to the Secretary of State and 47 per cent to parents with care. Of this debt, we estimate that 56 per cent related to cases on the old child support computer system, and 44 per cent to cases on the new child support computer system.</p>
	<p pid="c.572W.2/10" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill proposes to strengthen and streamline the range of enforcement and debt management powers that will be at the disposal of the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission.

	<p pid="c.573W.5/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what estimate has been made of the cost of bus transport as a proportion of incomes of less than (a) 30 percent, (b) 40 percent, (c) 50 percent, and (d) 60 percent of the median average in each year since 1997 (185862).</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.5/5" class="indent">Estimates of household income are provided in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2005/06 was published on the National Statistics website on 17th May 2007 at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.5/6" class="indent">The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. The EFS has been used for this response because it collects both income and expenditure data.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.5/7" class="indent">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent of median. The sample size for the number of households with an income below 30 per cent of median is too small to yield reliable results. In addition presenting information for households with an income of 40 or 50 per cent of median income can be misleading. One reason for this is that households stating the lowest incomes may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many households who report very low incomes appear to have high spending equivalent to households higher in the income distribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.573W.5/8" class="indent">The table provided shows bus and coach expenditure as a percentage of household unequivalised disposable income for households that have income of 40, 50 and 60 percent below median income. Due to the issue of small sample size, an average for the period 2000/01 to 2002/03 and 2003/04 to 2005/06 has been provided. Data for 1997/1998 to 1999/00 is not available. In addition figures showing only bus fares could not be provided as expenditure on bus and coach fares are collected as one item.</p>

We will therefore ask the LSC, as a matter of urgency, to write to all employers and providers contracted to the LSC to deliver apprenticeships to reiterate their contractual responsibility to ensure all their apprentices are paid at least the minimum weekly amount, and to check on compliance through the existing audit arrangements. We will also ask the new National Apprenticeships Service to work with employers and the TUC to publicise the national helpline for apprentices who believe they are being paid less than the minimum apprenticeship wage, and also look at how the current minimum could be more effectively enforced.</p>

	<p pid="c.581W.5/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) and police recorded crime statistics are complementary series, and together these two sources provide a more comprehensive picture of household and personal crime than could be obtained from either series alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.5/2">The main purpose of the BCS is to give a count of crime that includes those incidents that are not reported to the police, or not recorded by them. As such, the BCS asks victims whether an incident had been reported to the police, or whether the police came to know about it another way, and is therefore able to estimate reporting rates. Overall, the 2006-07 BCS estimated that more than half of crimes are never reported to the police. Reporting rates are reported at a national level and published annually in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin Crime in England and Wales. See</p>

	<p pid="c.586W.2/1">Until <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, when the newly vested police-led National Policing Improvement Agency took on policy oversight for reducing unnecessary police bureaucracy, overall policy oversight for reducing unnecessary bureaucracy was held by the Police Reform Unit in the Home Office. However, a much wider number of departmental officials in many different business areas have been involved in contributing to this important area of work over the last 10 years. This work has included:</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/2" class="indent">improvements to custody and case management information technology systems;</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/3" class="indent">the implementation of new time and labour saving technology such as electronic fingerprinting;</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/4" class="indent">the development of improved business processes and work force management as part of wider efficiency and value for money work; and</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/5" class="indent">the development of a new performance management framework which recognising the significant improvements made to date, will provide greater local flexibility and reduce the number of targets that necessitate measurement by the police going forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/6">It is not possible therefore to specify a 'headcount' number which would properly reflect the contribution of such a wide number of departmental officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.586W.2/7">Reducing unnecessary bureaucracy is the duty of all those involved in policing. It is the responsibility of local managers and chief officers in particular, to keep processes as streamlined as possible and to empower and equip officers to provide the most visible and accessible police presence in the community possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.599W.6/1">Information on the total number of foreign nationals convicted for firearms and drug offences are not held centrally. The central databases of criminal court cases collect information on defendants' ethnicities, but do not presently contain information on their nationalities. This is because, as a general rule, nationality is not germane to the outcome of criminal court proceedings. Defendants will not be asked their nationality by the court for this reason. Information on nationality may be recorded where it is specifically relevant to the case (e.g. immigration-related offences) but this would be held on local files and would not be systematically recorded on central databases.</p>
	<p pid="c.599W.6/2">However, in preparation of the implementation of the UK Borders Act 2007, the Crown court IT systems are being changed to allow for the collection of nationality data. This Act introduces automatic&mdash;rather than discretionary&mdash;triggers for the deportation of foreign nationals who meet certain sentencing criteria, and it will require more detailed recording of data on foreign national criminal defendants. Upgraded systems to meet this requirement are expected to be in place in late 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.599W.6/3">Data held on the prison IT system do record the nationality of offenders. The following table gives the number of foreign national and EU national prisoners received into all prison establishments in England and Wales under immediate custodial sentences between 2004 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.602W.5/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/2" class="indent">(a) Offender Assessment System (OASys)&mdash;OASys uses the 'PNC Number' as a unique personal identifier but this system has no physical interface to the PNC.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/3" class="indent">(b) C-NOMIS&mdash;C-NOMIS uses the 'NOMS Number' as a unique personal identifier. The NOMS Number is currently passed to, and stored within OASys, from C-NOMIS. The PNC number and arrest summons number (ASN) are manually entered into the C-NOMIS system if and when available.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/4" class="indent">(c) Libra&mdash;Libra has no specific unique personal identifier for a defendant, although each case related to one or more defendants is assigned a unique 'Libra Case Number'. This case number is not exchanged with any other system. Police forces supply Libra with their own 'Unique Reference Number' (URN) and the ASN from their case and custody systems that are case specific. Libra then uses the ASN as a unique reference to the PNC. A defendant will have many URNs or ASNs if they are involved in multiple cases. Libra can also store, via manual entry, the 'National Insurance Number' for the defendant if it is supplied by the police or the defendant.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/5" class="indent">(d) Police National Computer (PNC)&mdash;The Police National Computer uses the 'PNC Number' as a unique personal identifier. The Police National Computer also utilises the 'Criminal Records Office Number' if the defendant has previously provided fingerprints which can be positively identified and 'Arrest Summons Numbers' (ASNs) which links the defendant to one or more offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.602W.5/6">OASys, C-NOMIS, Libra and Police National Computer (PNC) systems do not share a 'unique personal identifier' that is common to all these systems. This has been a continuing challenge for joining-up the Criminal Justice System. The connection of individual data records, where specifically required to date, has largely been accomplished by other indirect identification methods which are further detailed by system.</p>

Building on several years of learning from the experiences of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, it incorporates developments such as the introduction of ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork) a new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners, improved cross-agency information flows, and integrated local safer custody teams pursuing a continuous improvement plan in each prison. Also reflected in the PSO are long-standing areas of safer custody work such as listener and insider peer supporters, suicide prevention co-ordinators in each prison, and working with outside organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.603W.8/5">A focus on personal safety, supporting victims, and repairing the physical and emotional harm caused by violence or abuse, links closely with the suicide prevention strategy. The recently revised PSO 2750 requires all prisons to have local violence reduction strategies appropriate to needs, encouraging a whole prison approach to reducing violence and the fear of violence. The PSO takes account of the recommendations of the report into the death of Zahid Mubarek (murdered by his cell-mate in 2000), and brings together policy on violence reduction, anti-bullying and cell sharing risk assessments.</p>

	<p pid="c.607W.3/1">The Kajaki Dam is currently not working at full capacity and contingency plans are already in place. These include the installation of diesel generator farms in Lashkar Gah, Gereshk, Sangin, Kajaki and Musa Qala for nine months while repairs to the turbines are taking place. Generator farms have already been installed in Lashkar Gah, Sangin and Musa Qala, and are currently being built in Kajaki and Gereshk. A new sub-station for Lashkar Gah will also be installed shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.607W.6/1">Records show that violent attacks on reconstruction projects implemented by UK Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan are rare. We are not aware of any such attacks during the UK's engagement in Mazar-e-Sharif during 2005. Since taking over responsibility for the PRT in Lashkar Gah, Helmand, in May 2006, information from the PRT indicates that none of over 200 Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) implemented has been directly targeted in violent attacks.</p>
	<p pid="c.607W.6/2">However, a number of QIPs have supported the development of Afghan security infrastructure, and we are aware that a small number of projects have been affected by attacks. In October 2007 an explosion in Gereshk resulted in four police casualties and five locals being killed. This damaged the walls of a day care centre being constructed as a PRT project, but it is most likely that the target of the attack was the police. In February 2007, another incident involving the Afghan National Police and Taleban resulted in damage to a school in Lashkar Gah.</p>

	<p pid="c.608W.2/1">At 8 per cent. of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Afghanistan currently has one of the lowest rates of domestic revenue mobilisation in the world and the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) cannot cover its operating costs. It is essential that domestic revenue collection is prioritised in order to keep the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other international aid programmes on track. Along with our American colleagues, we have stressed the importance of this issue to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we have all discussed with the Afghan government the need to fully and transparently collect existing taxes as well as continue reforms of the tax system to increase the number of tax payers.</p>

	<p pid="c.611W.3/1">Generally, if consumers believe that they have been wrongly or unfairly charged by their bank, they should raise the issue with their bank in the first instance. If they are not satisfied with the response they obtain, then it is open to them to take a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service or to pursue a claim in the Courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/2">On the issue of bank charges for unauthorised overdrafts and returned item fees, there is currently a test case before the High Court.

	<p pid="c.611W.3/3">Until the outcome of this legal action is known, the normal complaint channels have been affected as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.611W.3/4" class="indent">the Financial Services Authority has granted firms a waiver from dealing with complaints within the usual time-table, except where consumers are in hardship.

	<p pid="c.611W.3/5" class="indent">the Financial Ombudsman Service will also not progress complaints or deal with new ones, other than in hardship cases; and</p>

	<p pid="c.612W.0/1">None. The issue of fairness of such charges is a matter for the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which is independent of Government. In April 2006, the OFT stated that credit card default charges have been generally set at a significantly higher level than was considered legally fair. A &pound;12 threshold for intervention was set: where credit card default charges are set above this threshold, the OFT will consider whether an investigation needs to be launched. The OFT also believes that the unfairness test in the 'Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999' covers bank charges and is investigating whether these charges are unfair. In order to provide certainty on whether the unfairness test applies, OFT is currently taking a test case against the major UK banks in the High Court.</p>

We have therefore included a commitment to look at options for reducing the burden for travelling entertainment and mobile forms of licensable activity as part of the DCMS Simplification Plan which was published in December 2007. We will consider how to address some of the specific issues identified in our survey of circuses when progressing simplification projects such as minor variations and adjustments to the application process.</p>

	<p pid="c.625W.2/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) does not have a standard definition of a sport. However, a commonly used definition appears in the Council of Europe European Sports Charter 1993:</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Sport means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.625W.2/4">The Government are confident that each event planned for the 2012 Games will meet this definition.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/5">The Council of Europe definition does not limit the scope for Ministers to determine, in the context of sports policy development, which sports or activities DCMS should or should not fund.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.2/6">A list of sports and recreational activities for the local and national government measurement framework from April 2008 will be largely based on the broad definition of sport currently used for the Comprehensive Performance Assessment framework. The definition of sport will be based principally on the notion of moderate intensity, where some degree of physical demand is placed on the participant.</p>

	<p pid="c.625W.5/1">I have no plans to regulate the sponsorship of sport in the UK. However the Government have taken a number of steps to encourage sponsorship of sport that is socially responsible, particularly when aimed at children and young people. For example, the Government have supported moves by the Portman Group to place a voluntary ban on alcohol advertising on children's replica football shirts.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/2">Furthermore, we have supported similar voluntary arrangements between the gambling industry and sport to remove gambling sponsorship from children's replica kit.</p>
	<p pid="c.625W.5/3">Finally as my hon. Friend will be aware, the EU ban on tobacco advertising for Formula One motor racing remains in place.</p>

The forecasts are derived from a number of variables, including commercially available forecasts of construction activity. These include an element for house-building, which is currently around 180,000 units a year. The increase in net additions may not equate to a proportionate addition in requirements for primary aggregates. This is because:</p>

	<p pid="c.632W.2/3" class="indent">the possibility that alternative aggregate could be used for some new houses;</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.2/4" class="indent">the possibility that the increase in new house building would substitute construction activity away from other projects which use aggregates.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.2/5">The Department is committed to monitoring annually the aggregates guidelines. The guidelines will be revised downwards or upwards in the light of any changes in forecasts of construction activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.632W.2/6">Although the Department has not estimated the average amount of aggregate required for the construction of a new house, the European Commission has estimated that to build a new home requires around 400 tonnes of aggregates (Commission Staff Working Document, 'Analysis of the competitiveness of the non-energy extractive industry in the EU'.

	<p pid="c.636W.9/1">It is a matter for local authorities to decide, in the light of the priorities identified in their housing strategy, whether some of their capital resources should be used to provide new social housing. A key issue in deciding how this should be provided and what schemes to fund will be consideration of value for money (VFM). There is no bar on the provision of new housing by local councils and there is no requirement for approval to be sought. The local councils would have to demonstrate to tenants and their auditors that the provision of new housing provides good VFM compared to that provided by registered social landlords (RSLs).</p>

	<p pid="c.638W.0/1">The Code for Sustainable Homes was launched in April 2007 and is the national standard for the design and construction of Sustainable new homes. To date there are 500 fully qualified and licensed Code for Sustainable Homes assessors. This is already sufficient to meet the existing and anticipated demand for Code assessments over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="c.638W.0/2">By May 2008 the Government anticipates that the two organisations currently offering Code accreditation services&mdash;the Building Research Establishment and Stroma&mdash;will have trained and licensed over 900 assessors. Other firms are currently considering providing Code accreditation services, and should they go ahead, this will further increase the capacity and competition within the market.</p>
	<p pid="c.638W.0/3">The number of Code for Sustainable Homes assessors by region, and the number of candidates currently booked onto training courses are as follows:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="c.638W.0/16">Not all assessors in training will necessarily pass the exams so the total number of assessors by May 2008 will be slightly lower than the totals above. The regional split above is the one used by BRE rather than by that generally used by Government.</p>

In line with a recommendation in the final report of the Biomass Task Force (2005), the Forestry Commission through their Woodfuel Strategy for England (2007) examined the steps which would need to be taken in order to increase the contribution wood and wood processing make to the Government's renewable energy targets. The strategy sets a target to release an additional two million tonnes of woody biomass into the supply chain, annually, by 2020. In achieving the target, the focus will be on the 60 per cent. of English woodlands that are currently under-managed as bringing these woodlands back into management will deliver a number of additional benefits including boosting currently threatened woodland flora and fauna. Wood processing products will also form part of the mix, as will waste wood and arboricultural arisings.</p>

	<p pid="c.646W.8/1">Significant private sector investment is already going into the Thames Gateway such as DP World's &pound;1.5 billion investment into the new London Gateway Port in Essex, the new high speed rail link, and development on key sites for example at Barking Riverside. In the future Crossrail will also see significant investment coming into the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.8/2">In November 2007 the Prime Minister launched the Thames Gateway Delivery Plan setting out the Government proposals for investing in the area to help deliver the key infrastructure to create the conditions that will enable investor confidence. The plan sets out how some &pound;9.6 billion of Government funding will be invested to support housing and economic growth along with the necessary transport improvements, schools, health care facilities and other community facilities. The Government will continue to work with private sector partners at all levels to ensure the programme benefits from their expertise and experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.8/3">Together with this Department, the three regional development agencies are establishing a new &pound;200 million strategic economic investment fund to support their economic development and investment plan which will identify major projects that will result in an economic step-change.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.8/4">In addition, a new Pan-Gateway approach to attracting inward investment into the region is being adopted together with close co-operation with the region's three regional development agencies and their partners to maximise the value proposition of the Gateway to potential investors.</p>
	<p pid="c.646W.8/5">Some &pound;43 billion is expected to be invested by the private sector over the next 20 years on the back of the proposed investment by Government in the Thames Gateway as set out in the delivery plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.649W.3/1">In the Energy White Paper, the Government set out a series of measures, which can significantly reduce energy use in homes and business by 2020 (7.0-11.7 MtC by 2020).</p>
	<p pid="c.649W.3/2">Measures being introduced in the domestic sector include a continued obligation on energy suppliers to reduce home energy use, new building regulations, the energy performance certificates to make energy use more important when buying and selling homes and working with the EU to improve product standards, for example by phasing out inefficient light bulbs by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.649W.3/3">In the business sector, the new carbon reduction commitment will mean that for major business and the public sector energy use receives greater attention to encourage companies to take more action on energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.649W.3/4">The EU Emissions Trading Scheme will continue to provide an incentive for the largest energy users to use energy efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="c.649W.3/5">In addition, the energy industry regulator, Ofgem, has an objective to promote efficiency in electrical distribution and transmission. They do this by providing incentives to system operators in the relevant price controls.</p>

	<p pid="c.650W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government acknowledge the valuable and important contribution which lay members make to the tribunal system. This was reaffirmed through responses to the Government consultation 'Resolving disputes in the workplace' which was issued in March 2007 and closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-20">20 June 2007</phrase>. Most respondents commented that the tripartite structure of the tribunal was a real strength which aided decision-making in cases where considerations of context and reasonableness were important.</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/3">There was also support in the consultation for employment judges to sit alone in determining cases involving issues of a purely legal nature and in straightforward monetary cases, where the practical experience of the workplace that lay members bring to the tribunal's deliberations is of less relevance. Additionally, over 70 per cent. of respondents to the consultation supported the introduction of a new, swift approach to dealing with straightforward claims, where cases could be determined by an employment judge, with the consent of the parties, on the basis of the papers.</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/4">Responding to these findings in the consultation process, the Government propose to develop further the good practice which already exists within the tribunals by establishing a fast-track system for dealing with simple monetary claims. The fast-track system will involve five jurisdictions where claims potentially raise straightforward issues and therefore potentially could be determined without the need for a tribunal hearing. The jurisdictions considered suitable for the fast track are:</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/5" class="indent">unlawful deductions from wages</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/6" class="indent">breach of contract</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/7" class="indent">redundancy pay</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/8" class="indent">holiday pay</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/9" class="indent">the national minimum wage</p>
	<p pid="c.650W.2/10">Claims falling within these jurisdictions that are combined with other jurisdictions outside the list, will not be eligible for a fast-track determination.</p>

	<p pid="c.654W.5/2">In the last five years gas has been imported into the UK via pipeline from Norway, Belgium and, since 2006, the Netherlands. It is not possible to identify the countries of origin of the gas physically received from the Netherlands and Belgium. However, it is believed that the majority of the gas received from the Netherlands is sourced from the Dutch sector of the North Sea and the majority of the gas from Belgium is sourced from Norway via Zeepipe which terminates at Zeebrugge. In addition, since 2005 relatively small amounts of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has also been imported by tanker&mdash;from Algeria, Egypt, Qatar and Trinidad and Tobago. In the 11 months to November 2007 LNG accounted for 5 per cent. of total gas imports. Data on the proximate sources of gas (i.e. separating out Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and LNG) are available on BERR's website in Energy Trends Table 4.3&mdash;</p>

More serious breaches are dealt with by the issue of legal enforcement notices and if non-compliance is still evident, prosecution and possible eventual cancellation of the provider's registration.

	<p pid="c.667W.2/1">The safety of paroxetine (brand name Seroxat) has been under review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) since first marketing and remains under close review. Paroxetine is licensed in the dose range 10 to 60mg, depending on the indication. The recommended daily dose is 20 mg, with the exception of obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder for which the recommended daily dose is 40mg. Clinical experience is that some patients not responding to the recommended dose may benefit from having their dose increased. Prescribers have been advised that in the absence of evidence of a benefit from increasing the dose, good practice would be to maintain patients on the lowest efficacious dose.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.2/2">Guidance on how to use paroxetine safely and effectively along with information on potential adverse effects is provided in the product information for prescribers, the &quot;Summary of Product Characteristics&quot;, and in the patient information leaflet which accompanies the medicine. These documents are authorised by the MHRA at the time of licensing and updated through the life of the product as new information on potential adverse effects and benefits emerges.</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.2/3">Paroxetine belongs to a class of antidepressants known as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The safety profile of the SSRIs is a topic which has been the subject of considerable public interest and scientific debate over recent years. In May 2003, in response to continued public concern, the Government established an expert working group to further investigate the safety of SSRIs, with a particular focus on suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The conclusions and key findings of the expert group were communicated to health professionals on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase> and the supporting evidence base was detailed in the Group's comprehensive report entitled &quot;Report of the CSM Expert Working Group on the safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants&quot; published on the MHRA website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.667W.2/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON1004259">www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON1004259</a></p>
	<p pid="c.667W.2/5">The publication of the Report was timed to coincide with the publication of guidelines on the treatment of depression by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. Overall it was concluded that SSRIs are effective medicines in the treatment of depression and anxiety conditions, and that the balance of risks and benefits of all SSRIs in adults remains positive in their licensed indications.</p>

	<p pid="c.668W.6/1">Prevention of the emergence and spread of any type of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is being addressed as part of the DOH's overall strategy to improve TB prevention and control through 'Stopping Tuberculosis in England: An Action plan from the Chief Medical Officer' (published in October 2004). As well as improvements to public health surveillance systems, this critically requires fast and comprehensive detection of cases, rapid identification of drug resistance if it exists and good clinical management including measures to ensure treatment is both appropriate and completed by the patient. Patients with drug-resistant strains of TB are treated by appropriate multiple drug therapy for a minimum of six months which also helps public health control by breaking the cycle of TB transmission from infectious patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.668W.6/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on the treatment and diagnosis of TB published in March 2006 includes specific guidance on treatment and rapid contact tracing of people in contact with any type of drug resistant TB. The Department's TB toolkit (published in June 2007) aims to help commissioners and TB service providers implement the action plan in line with the NICE guideline.</p>
	<p pid="c.668W.6/3">NICE recommends that if a risk assessment suggests a patient has multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, rapid diagnostic tests should be conducted for rifampicin resistance. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) reference laboratory service identifies TB cultures from national health service patients in England and determines if they are drug resistant. The selection of appropriate second line drugs for the clinical treatment of MDR TB and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB is determined by the HPA National Mycobacterium Reference Unit (MRU), which has recently developed newer and faster methods for drug susceptibility testing. The HPA MRU also carries out DNA fingerprinting on drug resistant TB strains in England to help determine patterns of transmission and is working with the World Health Organization on the surveillance of XDR TB.</p>

	<p pid="c.670W.5/3">Low dose methadone is not recommended in national guidance and should not be a feature of local drug treatment systems. Rather than low-dose, clinicians should ensure that the dose prescribed for each individual is appropriate to their needs and in line with the available evidence base. The recently revised &quot;National Clinical technological appraisals on substitute prescribing&quot;, published January 2007, clearly states that methadone treatment must be optimised to ensure that each patient receives maximum benefit.</p>

	<p pid="c.672W.5/2"><i> </i>Food allergens are safe food ingredients for the vast majority of people, although approximately 2 per cent. of the United Kingdom's adult population need to avoid certain foods because they may trigger an allergic reaction. All ingredients deliberately added to a pre-packed food already have to be declared on the label. Furthermore, existing food allergen labelling rules ensure that, despite any other food labelling exemptions, the 14 allergenic food ingredients of greatest public health concern across the European Community must always be declared on the label of pre-packed foods.</p>
	<p pid="c.672W.5/3">The Food Standards Agency has recently issued two best practice guidance documents for food businesses. The &quot;Guidance on Allergen Management and Consumer Information&quot; is aimed at producers of pre-packed foods to help them eliminate the possible cross-contamination of allergenic ingredients and to decide on appropriate warning labels if this should be unavoidable. &quot;The Provision of Allergen Information for Non Pre-packed Foods&quot; is intended to help those businesses providing food in restaurants, sandwich bars, delicatessens etc where the food is not pre-packed and it is essential to communicate the presence of any allergenic ingredients in the food, where the customer needs this information. These guidance documents were produced with the help of relevant interested parties (food manufacturers, food retailers, enforcement bodies and consumer organisations).</p>

	<p pid="c.675W.5/3">The Department understands from the HPA that a large number of diagnoses were incorrectly allocated to the under one-year age group category and were therefore omitted from the published data.

Projected growth in demand for renal replacement therapy is set out in the National Service Framework (NSF) for Renal Services. It is predicted that the number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy will rise to around 45,000 over the 10 years ending in 2014. The NSF modelling was undertaken at a national level and the Department does not have dialysis demand projections broken down by SHA area.</p>

The Department highlighted the need for SCGs to pay particular attention to areas where significant increases in demand are likely to lead to pressure on services in the NHS Operating Framework for 2008-09 and renal replacement therapies were cited as such an example.</p>

	<p pid="c.678W.8/1">Ministers made a minded referral of dasatinib and nilotinib for the treatment of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukaemia to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in October 2007. NICE'S consultation on the remit and scope of this appraisal closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-28">28 January 2008</phrase>. It is currently proposed that these two products be appraised together so that the national health service has a single source of advice, but feedback on the results of this consultation is awaited. Ministers will make a final decision on the referral of these topics following receipts of a report back from NICE'S consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.8/2">Good practice guidance published by the Department in December 2006 highlights Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) guidance as one source on which local NHS organisations can draw in making decisions on the use of specific drugs where NICE guidance is not available. We have no plans to mandate the adoption of SMC guidance by the NHS in England.</p>
