Airlines are required to use slots allocated 80 per cent. of the time in order to maintain rights to use them in future. A system of monitoring and legally enforceable sanctions is also in place to help ensure airlines do not abuse allocated slots. Further, a number of airlines at Heathrow exchange slots with each other, including with financial consideration, which should lead to a more efficient use of slots.</p>

	<p pid="d.1122W.5/2" class="indent">i. allow vaccination to be rolled out as quickly as possible, as the doses are delivered;</p>
	<p pid="d.1122W.5/3" class="indent">ii. reduce the cost of vaccination to a minimum by using existing delivery chains and reducing regulatory burdens; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1122W.5/4" class="indent">iii. encourage farmers to take advantage of the freedom to make business decisions based on knowledge of the potential costs of the disease and the significant benefits that vaccination offers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1122W.5/5">Therefore, there will be no specified minimum time within which farmers must vaccinate once a decision to vaccinate against bluetongue has been made.</p>

	<p pid="d.1123W.11/1">DEFRA was one of the Government Departments that was criticised by the Disability Rights Commission in 2007 for failing to produce an effective Disability Equality Scheme. Rather than trying to improve and strengthen the disability aspects of our Joint Equality Scheme, DEFRA took the opportunity to produce a more focused and effective single equality scheme for disability.</p>
	<p pid="d.1123W.11/2">Our new scheme was developed with the involvement of disabled people and was approved by the new Equalities and Human Rights Commission at the end of 2007. This new Disability Equality Scheme has been published in full and summary form on the DEFRA internet site.</p>
	<p pid="d.1123W.11/3">Over the past year, and during the course of developing our new scheme we have seen some very tangible improvements for disabled and deaf staff and service users. We have, for example, created a central disability fund to meet the cost of reasonable adjustments for disabled and deaf staff in the Core DEFRA Department. Our bullying and harassment policy has been revised and we have recruited and trained a cohort of harassment advisors. We have also launched a mediation service for staff. In addition, we have strengthened our relationship with DisNet, our staff network for disabled staff. A very significant advancement has been in the governance arrangements for our Disability Equality Scheme. We have set up a Disability Equality Scrutiny and Advisory Group made up of independent disabled experts to monitor and advise on our progress against our action plans.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="d.1128W.6/10">A possible reason for the rise in fly-tipping offences recorded by Flycapture in its second and third years may simply be due to better reporting and a rise in the number of local authorities in England submitting regular returns. In the first year only 174 of the 354 authorities provided a full year of data returns. In 2006-07, this number rose to 323.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.6/11">Over time, the database will help us build up a more accurate picture of illegally dumped waste, as well as providing a useful management tool for local authorities in tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128W.6/12">Since April 2005, the Environment Agency has refocused its resources at tackling the more serious and organised illegal waste dumping crimes while local authorities tackle the high numbers of small scale fly-tipping. This is reflected in a decrease in the number of incidents the Environment Agency has tackled in the last three years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1129W.2/1">There are six species of jellyfish that occur in UK coastal waters. They are:</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/2" class="indent">(a) Mauve stinger Pelagia noctiluca</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/3" class="indent">(b) Compass jellyfish Chrysaora hysoscella</p>

	<p pid="d.1129W.2/7" class="indent">(f) Barrel jellyfish Rhizostoma octopus</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/8">Mauve stingers are oceanic and occur in coastal waters only occasionally. Little is known about the temporal and spatial patterns of occurrence for mauve stingers. The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) have awarded a short-term (6-month) urgency award to Swansea university to assess the overall extent of mauve stinger occurrence in the Irish sea and adjacent waters during the winter of 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/9">The last two decades have seen increasing water temperatures around the UK and as mauve stingers have a predominantly southern distribution (e.g. being highly abundant in the Mediterranean) we might thus expect increasing bloom formation around the UK coast.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/10">The problems with fish damage and mortalities due to influx of jellyfish swarms are well known to the finfish aquaculture industry, and to their insurers. In the UK and Ireland, Mauve stingers and other oceanic jellyfish such as Solmaris corona, along with some common coastal species such as the moon jellyfish Aurelia, are known to have caused significant mortalities of farmed fish. The problem is a global one for marine fish farmers. Although the industry has developed some ways to manage and mitigate the risks and effects of toxic plankton, these are not always effective with large swarms of jellyfish that can appear suddenly on one tide and disappear on the next, or may persist for days or weeks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1129W.2/11">There is no systematic reporting of jelly fish events and the reports that Fisheries Research Services (FRS) has are of an ad-hoc nature. As follows is a table summarising jellyfish incidents.</p>

	<p pid="d.1135W.2/1">No such estimate has been made. Based on HM Revenue and Customs figures, it is estimated that in 2006 (the last year for which figures are available) the UK exported 441,000 tonnes of plastic. This figure will include recyclable materials collected from all sources including households, commerce and industry. However, records are not held of the destination country of exports of UK non-hazardous plastic waste for recycling.</p>
	<p pid="d.1135W.2/2">The Environment Agency has published a range of guidance on the international shipment of waste. This is available on its website.</p>
	<p pid="d.1135W.2/3">The UK currently recycles or recovers approximately 19 per cent. of all plastic consumed and this is set to increase to over 25 per cent. by 2010. In terms of processing capacity within the UK, according to studies carried out by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the indication is that the UK has, in fact, excess capacity to process plastic waste. Many plants are investing in new capacity or updating and consolidating existing plants, some with support from WRAP. WRAP also has a number of projects designed to maximise the amount and quality of recyclate, including plastics, used in UK manufacturing operations.</p>

	<p pid="d.1137W.5/3">Most waste treatment facilities are already required to operate in accordance with a permit, issued by the Environment Agency, designed to ensure high levels of environmental protection. In addition, only people who are 'fit and proper persons' are authorised to operate waste facilities and managers must be able to demonstrate that they are technically competent. Facilities are inspected by the Environment Agency in a manner that takes account of the risk the site presents and the performance of the operator. Inspection also takes account of accreditation under environmental management systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.1137W.5/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year, waste treatment facilities will be permitted under the Environmental Permitting Regulations.

	<p pid="d.1143W.8/1">The Department funds national health service research and development through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). The Institute's research programmes support high quality research of relevance and in areas of high priority to patients and the NHS. That research currently includes a pragmatic, randomised trial into the use of acupuncture for migraine and headache in primary care; and a randomised placebo controlled trial of propranolol and Pizotifen in preventing migraine in children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1143W.8/2">The NIHR funded University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre is also undertaking research on headache and pain. A five-year budget of &pound;3.7 million has been allocated to this work.</p>

The MRC, an independent body, receives its grant-in-aid from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The MRC is currently funding a research fellowship relating to familial hemiplegic migraine and has previously funded a prospective study of patients with headache in primary care which aimed to provide evidence about the accuracy of diagnosis, the prognosis, reasons for referral, and the economic costs for patients and society.</p>
	<p pid="d.1143W.8/4">A range of pharmacological interventions are available to prevent the occurrence of headaches, and to relieve the pain of attacks. It is the responsibility of health professionals to consider what treatment is the most appropriate for their patients, in consultation with the patient and informed by their medical history.</p>
	<p pid="d.1143W.8/5">The provision of services to meet the needs of those living with migraine and headaches is specifically covered by the &quot;National Service Framework (NSF) for Long-term Conditions&quot;. The NSF has a 10-year implementation programme from its publication in March 2005, with flexibility for organisations to set the pace of change locally to take account of local priorities and needs. A copy of the NSF is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="d.1149W.5/1">Charging for car parking is a matter for individual national health service bodies. If they did not charge for car parking then funds for the maintenance and operation of the car park would have to be diverted from patient services. The Department has issued guidance advising NHS bodies to consider the needs of disabled users when planning their car parks and to offer concessions or free parking to those who have to use their car parks regularly, which may include some blue disability badge holders. We have no plans to change these arrangements.</p>

			<tr pid="d.1152W.5/10"> <td colspan="2"><i> Notes:</i><br/> 1. First attendance<br/> This indicates whether a patient is making a first attendance or a follow up attendance and whether the consultation was face-to-face or via telephone/telemedicine consultation. Out-patient data would only count a patient's first attendance regardless of the number of subsequent attendances in relation to the same subject. In many out-patient attendances, a patient may be receiving advice, rather than any medical treatment as such. Additionally, the number of out-patient first attendances does not represent the number of patients receiving out-patient care, as a patient may attend more than one first out-patient appointment in the year.<br/> 2. Finished admission episodes (FAE)<br/> A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 3. Accident and Emergency (A and E)<br/> People may also have received medical treatment in A and E, however HES does not have this data.<br/>  4. HES data quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Out-patient data quality<br/> Out-patient HES data were collected for the first time in 2003-04. It is not mandatory to code procedures on outpatient records and therefore only around 2 per cent. of records have completed clinical codes. We have no reliable existing data source to validate this data against, as the Department's aggregate returns data has never collected clinical codes, and therefore it is not clear how representative it is.<br/> 6. Appointment count<br/> This provides a count of the number of planned/booked appointments for out-patients.<br/> 7. Ungrossed data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Sources:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); Out-patients, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

We recognise that older pensioners on the whole need help more than others and, since 1997 we have introduced a whole range of measures which have targeted significant extra help on older pensioners. These includes: winter fuel payment of &pound;300 and an additional payment for this year, alongside the winter fuel payment, of &pound;100 to households with someone aged 80 or over, free TV licences; age related personal income tax allowance for the over 75s; and pension credit is of particular benefit to this age-group.

However, in recent years the Royal Navy and the Army have sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries at the specific request of the government concerned, and only then when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest amongst the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards, to save them the cost of an abortive trip to the UK to undergo the recruitment selection process.

	<p pid="d.1172W.2/1">We take our responsibilities for those who are invalided out of the armed forces seriously. For those requiring assistance, MOD provides health care and welfare support in service but, at service termination, the primary responsibility passes to the normal civilian agencies, including the ex-service charities. Since October 2007 we have put in place a new care pathway for the most seriously injured to ensure they receive the appropriate support as they need. The Department's Veterans Welfare Service is there to provide advice on issues such as entitlement to pensions and compensation under the Department's no-fault schemes. In the case of the severely injured, the welfare service monitors those discharged for a period of at least two years to provide advice should difficulties arise.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.2/2">Working together with civilian and third sector agencies, our aim is to achieve smooth and seamless transition. Those invalided from service are eligible for the MOD's full resettlement package (including support into work where this is appropriate and, automatic configuration of pension). Where the invaliding disorder is due to service, no fault compensation benefits will be assessed and paid and, for the relevant condition, the individual will be eligible for NHS priority treatment with additional benefits such as free prescriptions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172W.2/3">As Veterans Minister, I meet regularly with veterans and the ex-service organisations. Topics raised since 2006 have included priority treatment, civilian benefits, housing compensation, civilian mental health services for veterans and the issues of cultural understanding that can arise for those who have served when they seek help from civilian health professionals. Officials from MOD, other Government Departments, the devolved administrations and the charities are working together to address all key concerns, communicating existing entitlements to all those involved, and areas where improvements might be made to arrangements for ensuring seamless transition. I recently met colleague ministers from Department of Health, Work and Pensions and Communities and Local Government and also my counterpart in the Scottish Executive, when we confirmed our determination to provide excellent support to veterans especially those injured or made ill by service.</p>

The shelf life of the stockpile is due to expire in 2009 and, as is normal practice where there is a continuing requirement, arrangements were made to extend its life. As part of the life extension programme, rigorous in-service surveillance testing is required to ensure that the munitions remain safe and suitable for continued service. The final element of this process involved live proof firings at Kirkcudbright.</p>

	<p pid="d.1182W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) assists the Afghan Government in tackling malnutrition amongst under-fives and provides support to the health sector by funding the Afghan Government's recurrent budget which pays the salaries of public servants, including doctors and health workers. Since 2002 we have contributed &pound;240 million to the ARTF, including &pound;55 million this financial year. We plan to contribute &pound;60 million in 2008-09. This contribution has led to 82 per cent. of the population living in districts that have access to a Basic Package of Health Services. In addition DFID has just provided &pound;3 million of emergency funding to a joint appeal from the Government of Afghanistan and the World Food Programme to address the current food shortages facing the most vulnerable families in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="d.1183W.5/1">The UK is pushing G8 colleagues to ensure that fulfilling and implementing previous summit commitments is a priority both for the forthcoming meeting of G8 Development Ministers and at this year's Leaders' summit. The G8 in 2007 committed to scale up their efforts to achieve universal access, including to provide a projected $60 billion. The UK will be pressing G8 and other colleagues to contribute their share towards the goal of universal access.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.5/2">A record $10 billion is estimated to have been spent globally tackling HIV and AIDS in 2007, which is a 10-fold increase on 2000 spending. UNAIDS have estimated that, to achieve universal access by 2010, global spending must accelerate to between $30 and $50 billion in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.5/3">The UK is the second largest Government funder of AIDS-related assistance in the world, behind the US, and has pledged to spend &pound;1.5 billion in tackling HIV and AIDS in developing countries between 2005 and 2008. The UK is committed to the goal of universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention services (including to prevent mother-to-child infection), treatment (including paediatric AIDS treatment), care and support. We are equally committed to paying our fair share and we expect partners to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.5/4">In September 2007, the UK made an unprecedented commitment of up to &pound;1 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) up to 2015. The Board of the Global Fund expects that demand to the Global Fund could reach $6 billion per year by 2010, and could rise as high as $8 billion if demand from countries is greatly strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183W.5/5">At the GFATM replenishment conference in September 2007, international donors pledged a total of around $6.3 billion for the three-year period to 2010. The Global Fund Secretariat estimates that a further $3.4 billion has been pledged since then, making a total of $9.7 billion. This is a significant increase in resources which will allow the Fund to support a substantial expansion of all ongoing programmes, and to launch new programmes. At the last funding round of the GFATM, all the programmes recommended for approval were fully funded.</p>

	<p pid="d.1185W.3/1">Department for International Development (DFID) programme documents set out the objectives that we aim to achieve with our resources and a monitoring framework to enable us to track progress. We carry out reviews, normally with other donors, at least annually. As our aid money is mixed with the government's own revenue, we monitor the impact of our aid and the government's own spending on growth and poverty reduction. Providing aid direct to governments enables us to engage with the government on the value for money of their overall budget. We also use our aid to strengthen governments' ability to monitor the value for money achieved through their own programmes. The newly established Investment Committee will increase focus on value for money across DFID.</p>

We have made progress towards this.

	<p pid="d.1190W.8/3">We do not underestimate the challenges ahead. Political reconciliation is needed if the recent improvements in security are to be sustainable and it is vital that Iraq fully realises its economic potential for the benefit all Iraqis.

These are based on population projections published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) at a sub-national level that include estimates of migration. The ONS is undertaking a programme of work to improve population and migration statistics, including projections. In formulating strategies and plans, all places, including coastal towns, will need to assess demographic trends in their area. A cross-departmental working group on coastal towns has been established to consider the wider evidence base and policy issues affecting these towns.</p>

	<p pid="d.1204W.6/2">If a local authority is against a particular kind of development within its area this should be clear from the local development framework. Such an omission would afford the local planning authority the opportunity to dismiss any planning application that was brought forward that proposed such a development on the grounds that it did not meet with the agreed and adopted plans for the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204W.6/3">Where an application for development is not in accordance with the development plan a local planning authority will consider whether there are any material considerations which justify approving the application in any event, for example it could include where the proposed development would bring wider benefits to the local area.</p>

The equivalent assumption for net migration into England is 171,500 per year.

	<p pid="d.1207W.6/1">The Government have made significant changes to the planning system since May 1997. Of particular relevance to premises licensed to sell alcohol are the changes which the Government have made to the Use Classes Order and the Government's planning policy for town centre development.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.6/2">Changes to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April 2005</phrase>, as set out in Circular 03/2005. This amended Order disaggregated the former A3: Food and Drink use Class into three separate use classes to give local planning authorities more influence over the number, size, range and distribution of premises licensed to sell alcohol in their areas. The new A4: &quot;Drinking Establishments&quot; class caters specifically for pubs and bars i.e. places where the primary purpose is the sale and consumption of alcoholic drink on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.6/3">The Government's key planning policy, which applies to premises licensed to sell alcohol, is Planning Policy Statement 6: &quot;Planning for Town Centres&quot; (PPS6), published in 2005, which replaces Planning Policy Guidance Note 6 (DoE, 1996). PPS6 applies to a broad range of uses, including bars, pubs, night-clubs and other leisure uses. It contains specific policy on how to manage evening and night-time economy uses. It should be taken into account by planning authorities in the preparation of local planning policies and in the consideration of planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207W.6/4">PPS6 should be read alongside other relevant statements of national planning policy which have been published since 1997, in particular &quot;Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development&quot;, which is the Government's overarching planning policy and which includes policy on design and crime prevention, and &quot;Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport&quot; which includes guidance on how local planning authorities should manage travel demand.</p>

	<p pid="d.1221W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question regarding what are the (a) timetable, (b) purpose and (c) budget of the Integrated Household Survey. 194762</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.2/4" class="indent">The Integrated Household Survey (IHS) is a new modular survey being introduced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to replace four of its existing household surveys. Implementation of the new survey began in January 2008 when new questionnaires replaced the Expenditure and Food Survey, the General Household Longitudinal Survey and the Omnibus Survey. From April 2008, a new housing module of the IHS commissioned by the Communities and Local Government department will be introduced. Full implementation of the survey is expected to be completed in 2009 by when a new survey module will have replaced the Labour Force Survey and a new sample design will be in place for all modules of the IHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.2/5" class="indent">Each IHS module has a common set of core questions along with topic-specific questions. Once the survey has been implemented in full, operational efficiencies will result from improved sample design and the ability to manage field interviewers' workload more flexibly. The survey will also allow a greater range of statistical analyses across the survey modules and improve the precision of some estimates. The IHS will also provide a high quality, adaptable and efficient survey mechanism for meeting the Government's future information needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1221W.2/6" class="indent">It is estimated that expenditure on developing and implementing this survey will total &pound;3.5 million, in addition to the on-going annual costs of running each of the component surveys.</p>

	<p pid="d.1223W.6/2">Pensions are subject to income tax and, for private pensions, tax should be deducted at source under PAYE, where appropriate. The vast majority of private pensions are being taxed correctly but, some pension providers have not deducted tax under PAYE from all pensions in payment. For the minority of pensions where tax has not previously been collected as it should have been, HMRC are advised that they are required to ensure the position is rectified from the current year (2007-08). HMRC have discussed with the Department for Work and Pensions the implications of correcting the tax position from 2007-08 for entitlement to Pension Credits and other income-related benefits. HMRC's legal advice from Treasury Counsel is considered to have legal professional privilege and therefore will not be disclosed.</p>

	<p pid="d.1224W.5/2">A small minority of private pensions have for some years not been correctly taxed. HMRC has written to all pension providers to explain the necessity of producing full details of all pension payments for 2007-08 together with the tax deducted, if any, through the normal PAYE end-of-year procedures. This will enable those pensions which have previously been taxed incorrectly to be identified. Information is available to people on HMRC's website, but HMRC has not been able to contact people individually because they cannot yet be identified. Communications between pension providers and their pensioners are a matter for the companies.</p>

	<p pid="d.1224W.8/4" class="indent">In general charges for using roads or car parks, whether for driving on or parking, are classified as payments for the use of an asset. This is in accordance with international standards used to produce the National Accounts. A tax is defined in these standards as a 'compulsory and unrequited payment', the latter part of the phrase meaning where the payer does not directly receive anything in return.</p>
	<p pid="d.1224W.8/5" class="indent">One exception to this generality, which falls into your category 'municipal parking charges for on-street parking', is where an emissions-based charging policy is used. In this case the charges are classified as a tax.</p>

	<p pid="d.1252W.3/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) gives a count of crime that includes those that are not reported to the police or recorded by them. Victims who did not report the incident to the police are asked for the reasons why, and these are reported annually in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 'Crime in England and Wales', copies of which can be found in the House of Common's library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1252W.3/2">As in previous years, the latest figures from the 2006-07 BCS showed that the most common reason for not reporting incidents was that victims perceived them to be too trivial, there was no loss or they believed that the police would or could not do much about them. (71 per cent. of all comparable incidents&mdash;those crimes covered by both the BCS and police recorded crime). The second most common reason given was that the victim considered the issue to be a private matter and dealt with it themselves (17 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid="d.1254W.2/2">Following a change made in response to suggestions in the two reviews of crime statistics, the Home Office no longer use the term violent crime in connection with the recorded crime statistics and we now concentrate on figures for violence against the person. Between 2002-03 and 2006-07, violence against the person fell by 35 per cent. (from 4,280 offences to 2,795).</p>
	<p pid="d.1254W.2/3">Overall, vehicle crime accounted for 11 per cent. of all recorded crime in the Division in 2006-07. Violence against the person and domestic burglary accounted for 21 and 3 per cent. of all recorded crime respectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.1254W.2/4">With regard to assessing antisocial behaviour, this is measured through a measure of perceptions using the British Crime Survey (BCS), a nationally representative survey of adults aged 16 and over living in private households in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.1254W.2/5">The size of the sample in the BCS means that we cannot provide reliable data for geographical areas smaller than police force areas and we are therefore not able to make a reliable assessment about trends in antisocial behaviour in the Telford and the Wrekin division.</p>

	<p pid="d.1264W.5/1">The recent changes to licensing law appear to have only increased opening hours by around 20 minutes on average across on-licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003 brought in a new system for licensing the sale of alcohol, regulated entertainment and late night refreshment. While no complete data exists for the total number of premises that were licensed under the old regimes, the 2003 Act has probably increased the number of licensed premises only by requiring late night take-aways outside London to be licensed for the first time. This measure has been welcomed by the police as a key benefit in helping them control potential flashpoints for alcohol related crime and disorder. The number of premises licensed for the sale of alcohol has decreased since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.1264W.5/2">The evaluation of the Licensing Act 2003, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-04">4 March 2007</phrase>, concluded that the overall volume of crime and disorder has remained stable and not risen.</p>
