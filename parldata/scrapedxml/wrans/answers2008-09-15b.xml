	<p pid="b.2020W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has so far identified 17,692 people in the Selkirk transmitter area who are eligible for assistance under the Digital Switchover Help Scheme, 11,747 of whom are aged 75 or over. The remainder are eligible because they are in receipt of disability living allowance, attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance or mobility supplement, but a breakdown of numbers in receipt of each allowance is not available as this information is not needed for the purposes of the scheme. A further 233 people in the Scottish Borders local authority area (which broadly covers the Selkirk transmitter area) are eligible by virtue of being registered blind or partially sighted.</p>
	<p pid="b.2020W.3/2">The Digital Switchover Help Scheme advise that the overall take-up of eligible people to date is 8.6 per cent. By the beginning of September, the scheme had received responses from about a quarter of those people who have received an application pack. About half of those eligible had opted to receive help and about half responded to opt out. Of those who have opted in (i.e. said they want help) 1,150 have made a choice and 375 have yet to choose. Of those who have made a choice:</p>
	<p pid="b.2020W.3/3">About 60 per cent. have chosen the standard offer of a Sky satellite system, about 33 per cent. have chosen to have a simple Freeview digital box, and the remainder have chosen from a Freeview digital television recorder, integrated television, Top Up enabled digital recorder or Freesat from BBC and ITV.</p>
	<p pid="b.2020W.3/4">It should be noted that this is early in the Help Scheme campaign, with two months still to go to switchover in Selkirk and some consumers yet to make up their minds, so the final picture will change.</p>

	<p pid="b.2033W.6/1">The Shadow Price of Carbon (SPC) set out on page 20 of the Climate Change Bill: Final Impact Assessment is taken from DEFRA's cross-departmental guidance (published December 2007) on how to value the impact of Government policies on greenhouse gas emissions. The SPC captures the costs of climate change that are associated with each additional tonne of emissions, and is consistent with the carbon price referred to on page 7&mdash;at the highest stabilisation level within the Stern Review's recommended range.</p>
	<p pid="b.2033W.6/2">The guidance adopting the SPC as the basis for valuing these impacts was fully informed by the Stern Review's estimates of the cost of climate change. Under this approach, the SPC depends upon the expected costs of climate change, and consequently upon the emissions trajectory that the world is expected to move onto and the eventual stabilisation level that is expected. The value of the SPC used reflects the highest potential costs of climate change under the Stern Review's recommended stabilisation range of 450-550 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent, in order to ensure that the UK is taking sufficient action to help us to achieve this stabilisation range.</p>
	<p pid="b.2033W.6/3">DEFRA is currently reviewing the SPC, as committed to in the December 2007 publication. The scope of this review is to consider the case for moving to an SPC that is consistent with the marginal abatement cost that would be required to reach the UK's targets, rather than the current damage cost based approach. This review is ongoing.</p>

Hospitality may therefore be provided only if it is in the public interest and necessary for the conduct of departmental business to do so. As a general rule, expenditure on alcohol for hospitality purposes is not allowed. The core-Department's catering services provider does not hold a licence to serve alcohol. Were alcohol to be purchased for hospitality purposes it should be acquired through formal purchase order, or through the Government Procurement Card, both of which methods are subject to formal authorisation procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.2034W.5/1">Where the acquisition of new premises involves new build or substantial refurbishment the Department will insist on the building attaining the BREEAM Excellent construction standard or above. Design at this level seeks to optimise the energy efficiency performance the building can deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.2034W.5/2">The Department is also keen to support sustainability around the re-use of existing premises either forming part of its own estate or the wider Government estate. The Department will always seek to identify the property with the best overall sustainability score to minimise our environmental impact. In seeking re-use of existing premises, especially older premises on the civil estate, it is not always possible to secure the highest environmental or energy performance standards. As a consequence, where appropriate, planned investment will be employed to improve environmental and energy efficiency of older buildings acquired.</p>
	<p pid="b.2034W.5/3">While the Department looks for sustainability and energy efficiency, the identification and acquisition of premises is often market dependent. The supply of greener buildings can be limited outside the major towns and cities, especially for specialist buildings and locations. In such circumstances, the Department seeks the best sustainability performance available and encourages potential landlords to invest in sustainability and sustainable technologies.</p>

	<p pid="b.2047W.5/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills was established under machinery of government changes in June 2007; it comprises higher and further education (from the former Department for Education and Skills, now the Department for Children Schools and Families-DCSF) and science and innovation (from the former Department for Trade and Industry, now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&mdash;BERR).</p>
	<p pid="b.2047W.5/2">To date, DIUS has been split between BERR and DCSF. DIUS therefore currently rely on the Euro changeover plan of BERR and DCSF. The DCSF Euro changeover plan is currently being reviewed and updated to take account of the machinery of government change in June 2007 and changes in the delivery of corporate systems over the next nine to 12 months. A copy of the completed document will be placed in the Library when this work is completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.2047W.5/3">DIUS agency, NWML provided information to the former DTI in October 2004 and this formed part of their Euro preparations, A more detailed plan was performed in March 2000 which formed part of HM Treasury Euro changeover plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.2047W.5/4">DIUS agency, UK-IPO last updated its Euro conversion plan in September 2004 and it formed part of the DTI overall plan. The plan has not been published, given the time that has lapsed, while the principles are still relevant the legislation, IT systems and costs referred to are significantly out of date and publication would be of trifle value.</p>

In addition to this some FE colleges and providers can use their discretion to waive fees. They may choose to do so where a learner is undertaking a lip-reading course and has declared themselves as having a learning difficulty and/or disabilities for example where a learner is hearing impaired.</p>

	<p pid="b.2048W.9/1">&quot;Safe.Sensible.Social.&mdash;The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy&quot; committed the Government to developing a range of new kinds of information and advice targeting people whose drinking places them at harmful levels, and their families/friends, from August 2008 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/2">Since September 2006 a social marketing programme has been under way to meet this commitment and research has been undertaken to understand what motivates those drinking at increasing or higher risk levels and how their behaviour can be influenced. Key outputs of this programme formed part of the Units campaign launch in May 2008, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/3" class="indent">Reframing public-facing language on levels of drinking from &quot;sensible&quot;, &quot;hazardous&quot; and &quot;harmful&quot; to the risk-based &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;increasing&quot; and &quot;higher&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/4" class="indent">Promoting delivery of &quot;Identification and Brief Advice&quot; (IBA) through front-line services including the provision of materials and support to general practitioners (GPs), such as a surgery wall-chart, fact sheets and fact cards to hand out to patients. From September 2008 an E-leaming module on delivering IBA will be available for GPs and other primary care staff;</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/5" class="indent">Launching DrinkCheck at nhs.uk/units where users are able to calculate what level of risk their drinking places them in and if necessary signpost them to information either on-line, by post or through the telephone helpline;</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/6" class="indent">Publishing a printed self-help manual &quot;Your drinking and you&quot;, available by post or download, which has been designed by alcohol health specialists to help people reduce their drinking. Approximately 2,000 copies have been ordered to date via DrinkCheck and the telephone helpline, even though the Units campaign did not include any call to action. We are expecting this to be boosted further by the national launch of print advertising focusing on health consequences between mid-July-August; and</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/7" class="indent">Expanding the Drinkline telephone helpline to provide advice to drinkers and signpost them to the self-help material.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/8">We are now ready to move on to the next, direct marketing phase, which will help us to begin &quot;acquiring&quot; drinkers to receive the &quot;Your drinking and you&quot; booklet and agree to participate in follow up research and testing.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/9">This next &quot;acquisition phase&quot; is designed to drive responses to the website, helpline or to order the self-help booklet directly and is similar in structure to the smoking campaign which has a direct response campaign running alongside a more general awareness campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.2048W.9/10">The first phase of the campaign will be tested in the North West of England, which has the greatest concentration of our target group of higher risk drinkers, and will be rolled out from the beginning of September.</p>

This year, the KWKW campaign has piloted and developed materials that specifically target high-risk groups, and includes a booklet designed for elderly people. This includes information on how to ensure elderly people are claiming all the benefits they are entitled to, how to access grants to help keep their homes warmer and advice about how to keep warm and reduce the risk to health during a cold period.

	<p pid="b.2061W.0/1">The Department understands that Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership has recently used an unmarked vehicle to deploy mobile speed camera enforcement to target speeding motorcyclists. The county has suffered from a high number of motorcyclists being killed and seriously injured, currently accounting for 30 per cent. of all people killed and seriously injured on the roads. The unmarked vehicle is used on some of Derbyshire's most dangerous roads and is one of the many tools the partnership use to try to reduce motorcycle casualties. Initial feedback suggests that there has been a considerable reduction in speeding as a result of this covert enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.0/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, the deployment of safety cameras has been the responsibility of individual local partnerships. The Department's guidance provides best practice advice on the deployment of speed cameras and recommends highly visible enforcement. However, the guidance explicitly states that it does not restrict or fetter the police's discretion to enforce the speed limit covertly anywhere, at any time. A similar statement was previously included in the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.2062W.6/1">The Department does not currently measure or offset the carbon dioxide emissions caused by producing departmental documents across the Department, although it does offset carbon dioxide emissions from air travel. Some contracts have their own arrangements for carbon offsetting, e.g. documents produced in relation to the sustainable schools strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.2062W.6/2">The Department has always encouraged adoption of sustainable practices through its print and publications supply chains, for example using recycled paper and, where possible, environmentally friendly alternative products. However, the Department's new, broader, Publication, Production, Management and Delivery tender includes requirements to be measured against the Department's Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) in its specification. This will rate suppliers' impacts against the SDAP, and provide measurements against it, specifically by encouraging greater use of e channels; encouraging supply chains to implement low carbon emission printing equipment; and minimising unnecessary transportation of materials through the supply chain. The tender will be completed next year and operational around early summer 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.2063W.2/2">The existing guidance on promoting the health of looked- after children published in 2002 sets out what health assessments should cover and the nature of the services which should be provided to meet the child's physical, emotional and mental health needs. The guidance is statutory for local authorities but not on health bodies. Revised guidance will be on a statutory footing for primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, NHS trusts, and NHS foundation trusts as well as local authorities. This will ensure the importance of the active co-operation of health services in the health assessments of looked-after children under the general duty in section 10 of the Children Act 2004, which requires primary care trusts and strategic health authorities to co-operate with local authorities and other agencies to improve the well-being of children in their area.</p>

A revised version of the statutory guidance under Section 11 on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, originally issued in 2005, was published in April 2007. The Government have no plans to issue further revised guidance at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.2/3">The Government have no plans to provide specific additional funding for implementing these guidance documents, which are intended to clarify the statutory responsibilities of local authorities and other bodies, including health agencies, for which they receive mainstream funding. The Government have however commissioned an audit of the extent to which public organisations have been complying with their duties under Section 11. The results of the survey will be made public in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.2/4">From April 2009, the performance of local authorities and their partners will be assessed under the new, multi-inspectorate Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA). This will focus on the delivery of key outcomes in an area, and the contribution of statutory and non-statutory partners, including health agencies, will be in scope. Inspectorates are currently consulting on CAA, and intend to publish their framework in February 2009.</p>

This is because a child's age is closely related to his or her levels of development and need, something which is not generally true of an adult's age. Children need to be treated in ways that are appropriate to their different ages, and age-related treatment of children in schools and in the delivery of children's services is not the same as age discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="b.2070W.0/1">Before 2001, the police could take DNA samples from anyone charged but had to destroy them (and the profiles on the DNA database derived from them) if charges were dropped or the person was found not guilty. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changed this so that DNA could be kept from those who had been charged even if they were acquitted. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which came into force in 2004) extended the power further so that DNA could be kept from anyone arrested for a recordable offence and held in a police station.</p>
	<p pid="b.2070W.0/2">This question therefore relates to the number of people with a record on the national DNA database now, who would not have had a record retained permanently on it under pre-2001 legislation, because they had not been convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.2070W.0/3">It is not possible to say how many people on the NDNAD have not been convicted. This is because the NDNAD itself does not contain any information about criminal records, as this is not necessary for its function of matching DNA from crime scenes with DNA from individuals. To determine whether someone on the NDNAD has been convicted, it is necessary to refer to their record on the police national computer (PNC) which holds criminal record information.</p>

Information is not therefore available on the number of residents of Bexley who have had a DNA profile loaded. Information is however available on the number of profiles loaded by the Metropolitan police in the last five years as shown in Table 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.2070W.6/2">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles from the SGM to the SGM Plus profiling system. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.2074W.2/2">As part of the periodic Spending Reviews, the Department agrees with HM Treasury annual targets for receipts from the disposal of surplus assets. Net expenditure budgets are agreed accordingly with receipts contributing to capital investment in infrastructure and the estate. While there is usually no direct link between the receipts from asset sales and expenditure on accommodation, HM Treasury agreed with the Department as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, that the proceeds from the disposal of Chelsea should be ring-fenced to be invested in service accommodation.</p>

As a firm believer in the need for a fresh look at our international institutions, I offered to host the meeting which will be held at Lancaster House on 18 and 19 of September 2008. The Secretary-General has not issued any formal agenda, but has broadly outlined the issues facing the alliance&mdash;planning and delivering key capabilities; efficient use of human, financial and technical resources; and joint and proportionate burden-sharing. It is likely we will discuss also recent events in Georgia.</p>

Existing claimants will remain on incapacity benefits and will be migrated to employment and support allowance over the three years from 2010 to 2013. After migration, those who are entitled to a higher rate under employment and support allowance than their previous rate under incapacity benefits will receive more money. All other claimants will have their cash level of benefit protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.2093W.2/4">Employment and support allowance is an entirely new benefit with a new structure and new benefit rates. Under employment and support allowance, people will generally receive more money earlier in a claim.

	<p pid="b.2103W.5/2">EU leaders have recognised the potential of CCS and at the Spring Council 2007 agreed to bring about the necessary technical, economic and regulatory framework to bring environmentally safe CCS to markets, by 2020 if possible. This included an ambition for up to 12 demonstration projects by 2015. The UK Government are strongly committed to working with the EU partners to support these aspirations.</p>

In order to provide a more complete picture of the results of CIB investigations I have included the number of winding-up orders obtained and the number of directors disqualified.</p>
	<p pid="b.2107W.0/2">Figures are not separately available in respect of prosecutions and convictions following a CIB investigation. Information from a CIB investigation which may lead to a criminal prosecution may be passed to BERR Legal Services for action; if successful the resulting prosecutions and convictions are included with the figures for the Insolvency Service. However, BERR is only one of a number of investigatory and enforcement bodies and the reports of CIB investigators may also lead to prosecutions by other prosecuting authorities for example the Serious Fraud Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.2107W.0/3">I would add that the information that the hon. Member requests has been published on an annual basis in a report to Parliament entitled &quot;Companies in (year)&quot; until 2006-07 since when it has been published in the Annual Report and Accounts of the Insolvency Service.</p>

The estimated budget for trade promotion/exporting across the sectors, from aerospace to water as bespoke support for individual companies and for groups of companies within particular sectors for 2008-09 is &pound;242 million reducing to approximately &pound;236 million by the end of the 2010-11 financial year, subject to UKTI's annual corporate planning and annual parliamentary approval.</p>

	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.2126W.11/4"> <td><i> Industry division</i></td> <td><i> Standard Industry Classification (SIC)</i></td> <td><i> Percentage of total GVA in 2004</i></td> </tr>

	</table>
	<p pid="b.2126W.11/13">It should be noted that the economic output of the 'real estate activities' division is largely accounted for by 'imputed rent of owner occupiers', which covers housing services produced by owner-occupiers for which they are deemed to pay for themselves. If this was excluded, then real estate activities would not feature in the top six. The industry division which produced the next highest percentage of total GVA in 2004 was retail distribution (SIC 52), at 5.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.2126W.11/14">The industries shown in the aforementioned table form a subset of industry divisions in the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. The SIC is used to group businesses into industries for official statistical purposes, on the basis of the type of economic activity they undertake. It provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data and its use promotes uniformity of definition. However, it is worth noting that while the SIC enables statistical comparison of industries, the details in this table, and comparisons of this nature in general, essentially reflect the degree of detail in which industries are defined for statistical purposes within the SIC system. Typically, there is less detail defined within the service sector than within manufacturing, for example, so service industries tend to look bigger for this somewhat artificial reason alone.</p>

	<p pid="b.2127W.8/1">BERR, as part of a consortium with other organisations, commissioned some research on the growth potential for microgeneration in England, Wales and Scotland. The study modelled the expected uptake of microgeneration technologies based on a variety of policy options. It found there were approximately 1,130 micro-wind turbines and 92,900 solar (PV and thermal) installations at the end of 2007. It suggested that with no additional policy support, there could be 3,500 micro-wind and 148,600 solar installations by 2015; and 8,700 micro-wind and 272,700 solar installations by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.2127W.8/4">Additional policy support, which we are consulting on as part of our Renewable Energy Strategy Consultation, could substantially raise these figures.</p>

	<p pid="b.2131W.8/1">There are no specific mechanisms in place to retain staff, although individual employers and employees might negotiate their own arrangements. A blanket mechanism to restrict the movement of workers, once qualified, would be difficult to set up and open to legal challenge. The labour supply across energy will be tight and employers will have to be competitive to recruit and retain skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.2131W.8/2">Nuclear-trained workers have a core set of technical skills that are transferable to other industries. The Academy and Cogent expect some leakage and have factored this into their planning. This is most likely to benefit related activities, such as new nuclear build, renewable energy and manufacturing. Thus there are positive benefits to the wider economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.2136W.8/2">No. This is a contractual matter between Post Office Ltd. (POL) and sub-postmasters. POL believes that retaining restrictions in the sub-postmaster contract are essential to the survival of the network. The National Federation of SubPostmasters supports the company's position. These restrictions cover only the key products and services that generate income for the network and preserve POL's ability to negotiate new business on behalf of the full network. Allowing potential suppliers to cherry-pick branches in which to sell their products, would make it impossible for POL to negotiate agreements for all branches across the network.</p>

	<p pid="b.2144W.2/1">Since 2002 the Government have spent &pound;26 million on the Solar PV programme and &pound;10 million on PV Field Trials. The Low Carbon Buildings Programme has allocated over &pound;20 million to 6,398 projects of which almost &pound;6,376,863 million has been allocated to 4,662 households for installations using solar photovoltaic and solar thermal technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.2144W.2/2">The Renewables Obligation is the Government's main mechanism for encouraging new renewable electricity generation with all eligible renewable electricity generation installations able to receive Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs). We have proposed that all electricity generated by solar photovoltaic panels will be eligible to claim two ROCs for every 1 MWh of renewable electricity generated from April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.2144W.2/3">In addition there are wider measures such as the 2016 Zero Carbon homes policy and we have also made it easier for homeowners to install microgeneration technologies through relaxed planning requirements which benefits solar technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.2144W.2/4">The Renewable Energy Strategy consultation that was published by the Department in June 2008 includes a set of potential measures to allow the UK to meet its share of the EU 2020 target. We believe that distributed energy technologies including microgeneration, have a role to play and we are looking at a range of options to increase financial support to the small-scale generation of electricity and heat&mdash;including consideration of upfront payment, and whether a move to a feed-in tariff system might have advantages. We will publish our full Renewable Energy Strategy in spring 2009, setting out our action plan for meeting our targets in the most effective way.</p>

	<p pid="b.2146W.5/2">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/3" class="italic"> Staff</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/4">At April 2008 just under 2,400 people (expressed as full time equivalents) were working for UK Trade and Investment (UKTI). Of the 2,400 just under 1,300, mainly Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), staff were working in diplomatic posts in 99 markets overseas that are the highest priority in terms of the UK's economic interests. Just under 700 people, mostly Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) staff, were based mainly in London and Glasgow. These include operational, customer-facing staff as well as those in corporate support functions. Just under 400 people were based in International Trade Teams (ITTs) in the English regions. These are mainly International Trade Advisors (ITAs), either Government Office (GO) staff or people with business experience who are under contract to deliver UKTI services.</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/5" class="italic"> Budgets</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/6">UKTI's budgets consist of three different elements&mdash;a directly controllable and voted programme budget, and budgets delegated from BERR and FCO, both direct and indirect. For 2008-09, UKTI's budgets are:</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/7" class="indent">A directly voted net UKTI programme budget of &pound;91.5 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/8" class="indent">A net estimated FCO budget of some &pound;170 million: the budget directly in UKTI's control is &pound;19.1 million, and an additional estimated budget managed by the FCO of c&pound;1 50.9 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/9" class="indent">A net BERR administration budget of some &pound;55 million: the budget directly in UKTI's control is &pound;45.6 million, and an additional budget managed by BERR of c&pound;9.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/10">Latest figures show that against an annual target to achieve at least 525 involved inward investment project successes, of which at least 125 should be high value; UKTI exceeded its target with 549 projects, of which 182 were high value.</p>
	<p pid="b.2146W.5/11">In FY 2007-08 UKTI helped 15,900 companies to exploit opportunities in overseas markets. 57 per cent. of these customers reported an improvement in their business performance as a result of UKTI services. And we helped 2,799 companies to increase their R and D in the UK. Total additional bottom line profit reported by trade customers as a result of our help amounted to &pound;3 billion over an annual period.</p>

	<p pid="b.2149W.3/7" class="indent">Companies House has not made recent assessments of the need for these services because we already have a good idea of the demand. This is because we provide a service which allows officers of all companies that are registered in Wales to receive all communications in bilingual form. At present some 400 companies have taken up this option. The Companies legislation under which we operate allows certain filings to be bilingual and details of these are attached as an annex. Under the provisions of the new Companies Act 2006, we plan to increase the number of documents that Welsh companies can file in the Welsh language, without them having to provide certified translations into English.</p>
	<p pid="b.2149W.3/8" class="indent">We provide electronic services to all our customers, including our Welsh speaking customers. Our latest development is a bilingual web-filing service for the annual return that provides online filing capabilities equivalent to services offered to companies filing in English. Bilingual webfiling also allows customers to file other document types. This delivered significant benefits to Welsh speaking customers in terms of cheaper, quicker, simpler and more secure filing. In addition all guidance material is provided bilingually and we operate a Welsh language version of the Companies House website. We have an established network of Welsh speakers across the organisation and provide dedicated telephone numbers for customers to communicate directly them.</p>

	<p pid="b.2153W.5/1">In Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012, Government will auction 7 per cent. of allowances. This equates to approximately 85 million allowances, plus those allowances from installations that close during Phase II and any unused surplus from the New Entrant Reserve (NER). The total amount cannot exceed 10 per cent. of the number allocated during Phase II according to the terms of the EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC. The amount of revenue will be influenced by the market price of carbon at the time of the auctions. The Government do not comment on carbon price, as it would be improper for Government to speculate on how the market will function in the future. Therefore, an estimate on the amount of revenue the auctions will raise cannot be given.</p>

	<p pid="b.2158W.3/1">During negotiations on the eleventh replenishment of the African Development Fund (AfDF 11), donors agreed to establish a Fragile States Facility and set aside 7.5 per cent., of AfDF 11 resources (about &pound;330 million) for this. The new facility will provide countries emerging from conflict and crisis with additional resources to rebuild infrastructure and re-establish services for example, as well as helping them qualify for debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.2158W.3/2">Department for International Development (DFID) country teams collaborate with the AfDB in the field. In Sierra Leone, Zambia, Ghana, Malawi and Mozambique AfDB and DFID provide budget support under a common framework with a number of other donors to enable the governments to implement their poverty reduction strategies.

	<p pid="b.2158W.3/3">There is also strong collaboration between AfDB and DFID in Malawi and Mozambique on water and sanitation. In Malawi, AfDB plans to provide about &pound;24 million towards the water sector over the next five years (and &pound;6.5 million in 2008-09) and DFID is planning to match this with &pound;25 million for the next three years through the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund. In Mozambique, DFID will provide about &pound;500,000 in 2008 and 2009 for water, and the AfDB will contribute about &pound;8 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2158W.3/4">Finally, DFID and the AfDB work closely on improving road infrastructure in Mozambique. In 2008 and 2009, DFID will contribute &pound;4 million and AfDB will contribute just under &pound;15 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.2159W.2/1">The African Development Fund (AfDF) of the African Development Bank (AfDB) provides grants and concessional loans to around 40 African countries. The AfDF is replenished by donor countries every three years, and during the negotiations, AfDB management and donors agree how the resources will be spent. New approaches and policy changes are also agreed as part of the replenishment discussions. All donor contributions to the AfDF replenishment are governed by the agreements and resources are pooled; no donor can earmark their contribution to the AfDF for particular countries, sectors or projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.2159W.2/2">The latest AfDF negotiations concluded in December 2007. It was agreed that the AfDF could make the best contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by concentrating on supporting countries' efforts to accelerate economic growth. Building infrastructure is an important part of this, and around 60 per cent. of resources are likely to be used in this way. New approaches were agreed on how the AfDF would promote regional integration, which is important for growth in Africa, and assist fragile states, particularly those emerging from conflict. The agreed policy changes included how the Bank would adjust its approach to assist countries to tackle climate change and how it would ensure its assistance made a more effective contribution to improving the lives of African women and girls. The UK was instrumental in securing these agreements, and committed &pound;417 million to the AfDF over the next three years. A copy of the replenishment agreement, known as the AfDF 11 Deputies Report, has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.2159W.2/3">The UK is also providing funding to assist the AfDB to build its capacity and improve the effectiveness of its assistance. These funds are focused in six areas: infrastructure, climate change, governance, water and sanitation, knowledge and statistics, and institutional strengthening.</p>

	<p pid="b.2163W.2/1">At least 76 per cent. of the population of Gaza are now partly dependent upon food aid. The main issue affecting the supply of humanitarian aid, including food, is the partial closure of Gaza's crossings. This has significantly increased the time and costs involved in importing humanitarian supplies into Gaza. Although food aid is getting into Gaza, the size and frequency of these deliveries are insufficient to meet the broader needs of the population, who are dependent on such food items as are commercially available to make up the shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="b.2163W.2/2">Rising food prices have exacerbated an already difficult situation. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, food prices in Gaza increased by 24 per cent. from March 2007 to March 2008 (compared to a general inflation level of 17 per cent. in the same period).</p>
	<p pid="b.2163W.2/3">The World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organisation and the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) have recently conducted a survey of food security in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and will release the results soon. The Department for International Development (DFID) has not made a separate assessment of the impact of rising food prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.2164W.8/2">The IHP currently operates in a small set of countries&mdash;Burundi; Cambodia; Ethiopia; Kenya; Madagascar; Mali; Mozambique; Nepal; Nigeria; and Zambia&mdash;to build stronger and lasting health systems and to strengthen coordination of aid. At a global level, the Department for International Development (DFID) supports the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Bank in taking forward the IHP. At a country level, where DFID has a programme, we are working with partners to implement the IHP.</p>

	<p pid="b.2165W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is providing support to the people of Sadr City through contributions to UNICEF and to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
	<p pid="b.2165W.2/2">UNICEF has provided medical supplies both to the Directorate of Health and to medical facilities in Sadr City. They have provided safe water, hygiene materials and emergency health supplies to over 12,000 families and 3,000 individuals in Sadr City. Water tankering operations serve these families daily, as well as the three major hospitals and other health facilities in the city. UNICEF has also pre-positioned various supplies in medical facilities in the city&mdash;including basic health kits for up to 100,000 people&mdash;and distributed water purification tablets door-to-door.</p>

	<p pid="b.2166W.0/1">I visited Namibia on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-09">9 July</phrase>, immediately after Namibia hosted a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Ministerial Conference on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) from 2 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-04">4 July</phrase>. This conference was funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) with strong support from DEFRA and the FCO. The conference generated a Statement of Commitment to be passed to SADC Heads of State later this year, calling for regional action to improve fisheries governance and trade, and in particular to combat illegal fishing. The lack of capacity within the region to deal effectively with illegal fishing was highlighted during a meeting I had with the Chief Executive Officer of Hangana Seafoods, the first Namibian seafood producer to receive British Retail Consortium certification.</p>
	<p pid="b.2166W.0/2">DFID's programme with Namibia through SADC has been instrumental in influencing southern African regional policy development for sustainable fisheries. DFID has now approved further funds to help build on this commitment and extend it to other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Namibia represents a relatively positive model for African fisheries and effort will continue to support Namibian interests in promoting best practice. Nambia has operated effective monitoring, control and surveillance of its fishing activities since Independence. Recent and relatively modest infractions during late 2007, involving Nambian flagged, foreign operated vessels in the horse mackerel fishery, have been effectively dealt with by the authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.2166W.6/1">Improving the effectiveness of aid from international institutions to conflict-affected countries is a UK Government priority. The Department for International Development (DFID) has taken a leading role in supporting reform of the international response to humanitarian crises led by the United Nations. This has led to an increase in the timeliness and effectiveness of humanitarian aid through the UN Central Emergency Response Fund and the country-level Emergency Response and Common Humanitarian Funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.2166W.6/2">DFID is also supporting improvements to the effectiveness of international institutions' development assistance to conflict-affected countries. UK funding through the joint DFID-FCO-MOD Conflict Prevention Pool and DFID funding to the United Nations funds, agencies and programmes, including UNDP's Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery and the UN Peace building Fund, is subject to improved timeliness and effectiveness. For the World Bank, DFID secured commitments on financing for fragile states during the fifteenth replenishment negotiations of the International Development Association (IDA 15) in 2007, including extending the period of extra assistance for post-conflict states.</p>
	<p pid="b.2166W.6/3">Recently, the UK has launched a new initiative on improving the international community's support for post-conflict stabilisation and early recovery. We are working with the UN, the World Bank, regional organisations such as the European Union and the African Union, and other countries to address the lack of timely and effective development aid during the immediate post-conflict period.</p>

	<p pid="b.2169W.5/1">The third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra reached a groundbreaking agreement&mdash;the Accra Agenda for Action&mdash;to improve the quality of global aid and help ensure that every pound or dollar of global aid delivers the maximum benefit for poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/2">In adopting the Accra Agenda for Action donors and developing countries agreed a number of concrete, monitorable actions, including the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/3" class="indent">Donors committed to make greater use of country's own financial systems to deliver aid, helping to strengthen those systems and improve accountability to Parliaments and citizens;</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/4" class="indent">Donors and developing countries agreed to develop stronger mechanisms to hold each other accountable for meeting their commitments, at both country and global level;</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/5" class="indent">Donors committed to respect and support partner country-led efforts to agree a better division of labour between donors in-country and to start a dialogue on international division of labour between countries. This will help to reduce the burden on governments of dealing with multiple donors and address the issue of countries that receive insufficient aid;</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/6" class="indent">Donors will better communicate with partner governments about the aid they can expect over the next three-five years, helping governments to plan more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/7" class="indent">Donors will improve the way they deliver aid in 'fragile states', including those suffering from conflict. They agreed ways to use aid better to support state-building and peace building.</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/8">The full text of the Accra Agenda for Action is available through:</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.accrahlf.net/">http://www.accrahlf.net/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2169W.5/10">Also at Accra, 14 donors endorsed the new UK-led International Aid Transparency Initiative to help ensure that information on aid flows is available to everyone. It will enable partner Governments and their citizens&mdash;those who ultimately benefit from aid&mdash;to plan for and make the best use of aid. It will also help citizens hold donors and governments to account for their promises.</p>

In 2007, 12,500 digital aerial photographs and 43 satellite images were taken. In 2008, 135 satellite images were taken. These photographs and images were used to measure poppy cultivation and to target and measure eradication. This data was used by the UK, in concert with the Government of Afghanistan and key international partners, to formulate policy and monitor progress on counter narcotics in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.2172W.10/3">Afghan authorities in the Ministry of Counter Narcotics have used map products produced from the photographs. In addition, some photos and images have been used in training programmes for Afghan nationals.</p>

The Mission is developing important working relationships with the US police teaming programme. Personnel from EUPOL are also working with the International Policing Co-ordination Board to develop a shared vision for the role of the Afghan police and with the US to strengthen the capability of the Afghan Ministry of Interior, both of which will be key to the success of police reform. In recognition of the importance of EUPOL and the role it plays in police reform in Afghanistan, the Government supported the ambition to significantly increase the size of the mission as agreed in May 2008.

Member on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-16">16 June 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-16.665"><i> Official Report, </i>columns 665-66W</phrase>, applies to all Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff. There are approximately 12,000 personal computers in use in FCO offices around the world. Allowing for exceptions and shared use by shift workers, an estimate of 10,000 machines left on overnight is reasonable, but untested.</p>
	<p pid="b.2178W.8/2">In 2007 power consumption tests based on the range of personal computers then in use suggested an average of 80 watts for each personal computer&mdash;(assuming 14 idle hours per day for each of the 10,000 personal computers gives an overall estimate of approximately four million kilowatts per hour per annum). This cannot readily be converted to a cash equivalent, as different tariffs apply in the countries around the world in which the FCO is represented. This level of consumption would have been broadly constant during the past five years. It has been our assessment that the risk of lost productivity and the risk to national security that this policy avoids outweighed its cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.2178W.8/3">As explained in my earlier answer, the consumption is expected to fall substantially as old equipment is replaced. To date, approximately 3,500 new machines have been installed in offices in the UK. Under current plans all 12,000 machines worldwide should have been replaced by 2009. In addition to this, we will be applying global policies to ensure a reduction in power consumption.</p>

	<p pid="b.2182W.0/1">Our diplomatic missions regularly provide specific advice to charitable organisations wishing to work in their host countries. We are most commonly consulted for general travel and security advice but also regularly advise on the general political conditions, including the most efficient and effective means of delivering aid to the country. Beyond this, we would also encourage non-governmental organisations to carry out their own independent checks in line with industry best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.2182W.0/2">This advice would normally be delivered by the Department for International Development, but where they are not represented, this role is played by our embassy or high commission. More general information is also accessible through our website on a range of issues that may affect them, including travel advice, political structure, security environment and economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2182W.0/3">Non-governmental organisations are, of course, not obliged to seek this advice or to stay in close contact with our embassy or high commission and some choose not to do so. Although we maintain a good relationship with non-governmental organisations overseas, we are careful to respect their independence and are not in a position to dictate the way in which they deliver their aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.2182W.0/4">Where projects are funded or part funded by the Government, however, we have considerable say in how aid is directed. In some cases the Government use non-governmental organisations as conduits for essential UK aid, particularly in countries where we lack confidence in the host Government's ability or willingness to distribute aid to the most needy. It is, in general, difficult for host Governments to divert aid administered through non-governmental organisations for political or military purposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.2185W.0/1">There is much anecdotal evidence from sources inside Iran that the financial measures, including asset freezes imposed by UN Security Council resolutions and reinforced by the EU, have affected the Iranian business community's ability to function effectively in some areas. They have disrupted the international operations of a number of Iranian companies and those Iranian banks named in the sanctions. According to our sources, restrictions on dual use goods have led to difficulties in sourcing spare parts in the Iranian power sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.2185W.0/2">Sanctions have also partly contributed to a slowdown in inward foreign investment in the Iranian oil and gas sector. There is now a growing debate inside Iran about the Iranian Government's policies, including on economic management. Internal discontent about the Iranian economy is increasing in the light of accelerating inflation rates (approximately 26 per cent. as at August 2008), unemployment and frequent power cuts. We believe further measures on Iran must remain part of the current twin track diplomatic approach to persuade the Iranian regime that its continued defiance of UN Security Council resolutions will not be cost free.</p>

	<p pid="b.2190W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) budget for expenditure is &pound;1.1 million on embassy staff and other operational costs and around &pound;200,000 on support for the British Council in the 2008-09 financial year. Technical assistance to the Kosovo Government is provided through a combination of FCO bilateral funding, project activities under the joint FCO/Department for International Development/Ministry of Defence Conflict Prevention Pool and the FCO's Strategic Programme Fund. The total budgets for expenditure for these three funds in the 2008-09 financial year are: &pound;76,000; up to &pound;3.8 million; and &pound;110,000 respectively. Our work with non-governmental organisations in Kosovo is also funded from the Conflict Prevention Pool and the Strategic Programme Fund. The FCO does not provide budgetary support for the government of Kosovo and non-governmental bodies working in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="b.2190W.0/2">The UN Mission in Kosovo's approved budget for the 2008-09 financial year is US$198 million, of which the UK's contribution is 7.9 per cent. or US$14.8 million (around &pound;7.4 million). The EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo's (EULEX) approved commitment appropriation for calendar year 2008 is &euro;140 million, of which the UK's contribution is 17 per cent. or &euro;23.8 million (around &pound;18.9 million). The actual amount spent on EULEX in 2008-09 will not be known until the end of the financial year. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe Mission in Kosovo's (OMIK) approved budget for calendar year 2008 is just over &euro;30 million, of which the UK's contribution is 11.09 per cent. or &euro;3.3 million (around &pound;2.6 million). The budget for calendar year 2009 is yet to be approved but in UK financial year 2007-08, the UK contribution to OMIK was &euro;3.7 million. We would not expect this level to be exceeded in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.2190W.0/3">We have provisionally budgeted for a total of 76 UK secondees to EULEX in 2008-09 at an estimated cost of &pound;5.3 million and for a total of five UK secondees to the International Civilian Organisation at an estimated cost of &pound;377,000. We have one UK secondee to OMIK at a cost of around &pound;70,000 per annum.</p>

	<p pid="b.2199W.2/2">We will continue to work with our partners through the 'Know Before You Go' campaign. This is a joint venture with the travel industry aimed at ensuring British travellers are better prepared when they go overseas, to ensure that the public are fully aware of the need to take out comprehensive travel insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.2199W.2/3">For further information on Exceptional Assistance Measures, I refer the right hon. Member to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State's written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-06-02.41"><i> Official Report</i>, column 41WS</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2199W.2/4">The level of support that might be required if the Exceptional Assistance Measures are activated will be determined by the particular circumstances of the incident, and for this reason the measures remain flexible. Under the measures, the FCO can provide immediate support to British nationals in the country where the incident occurred and to assist their return to the UK, but often victims of major incidents overseas, or their families, need ongoing help after they return to the UK. To address this we have a working agreement with the Humanitarian Assistance Unit in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, who will work with the relevant agencies and services to help victims and their families access the ongoing support they need.</p>

This assesses the state of the public finances, including the ability of the government to service its debt. The most recent review expressed concerns about the public finances, which I have communicated to the government, saying that improvements need to be made. In addition, the Turks and Caicos Islands also has an independent chief auditor, appointed by the Governor. Accounts are audited in accordance with local ordinance and laid before the House of Assembly. Audit reports, some of which have been critical of the Government, are discussed by the Turks and Caicos Islands public accounts committee.</p>

The 2008-09 budget was presented to the House of Assembly in April this year and was debated over a number of days before it was passed. The UK does not interfere in the budgetary process but has agreed borrowing guidelines with the Turks and Caicos Islands Government, which limit the level of debt that it can incur.</p>
