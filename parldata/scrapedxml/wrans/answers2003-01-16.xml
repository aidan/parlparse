	<p pid=".696W.12/1">Approximately 7 per cent. of staff in DfT Central Units work part time. Information specifically on job sharers is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. Job sharing forms just one strand of a range of possible alternative and flexible working arrangements. Under DfT central posting arrangements, all posts are open to part-time workers or job sharers. In very exceptional cases where line managers consider that a post cannot be filled on a part- time/job share basis, they must make a case to HR setting out compelling reasons for this.

	<p pid=".699W.12/1">United Kingdom maritime forces normally operate as part of a Task Group, which protects itself against air attack through a series of 'layered' defences. Task Groups typically include carrier and/or land based fixed wing aircraft as an outer layer. Inside and complementary to this, the Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers (and also Type 22 and 23 Frigates) are equipped to provide an air defence capability for both Force and self protection. The Type 42 Destroyers systems are being enhanced to ensure they remain effective in the air defence role.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.12/2">The Type 42 Destroyers will be replaced by the Type 45 Destroyers, fitted with the highly capable Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS). PAAMS will represent a significant improvement in Air Defence capability compared with that provided by the current Type 42 Destroyer fitted with Seadart. Key improvements will include better surveillance, increased channels of fire, a larger magazine capacity and a faster, more manoeuvrable missiles.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.12/3">The comparative effectiveness of these complementing layers has been successfully demonstrated in many recent National, NATO and Allied exercises and proven in the Gulf and Adriatic conflicts to adequately protect a Task Group.</p>

Dstl also recognises, however, that at Portsdown Main there will be local issues concerning the increased level of commuter traffic entering and leaving the area. Dstl are consulting with the local planning authorities and are commissioning consultants to identify any significant environmental constraints and to prepare a Preliminary Environmental Report. As part of this commission a detailed transport assessment will be completed, which will highlight areas where improvement and mitigation might be beneficial. Dstl are committed to establishing a travel plan for Portsdown Main with the aim of reducing dependency on the private car and promoting the use of other modes of transport. The prime contractor appointed to complete the refurbishment and re-population of Portsdown Main will be required to take full account of these findings during design, construction and subsequent operation of the site.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.5/1">The move of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) staff from Farnborough to a new site at Portsdown is planned for 2006. At this comparatively early stage it is difficult to predict whether or not Dstl will lose staff and if so in what numbers. We hope that all staff currently employed by Dstl at the Farnborough site will choose to stay with the Laboratory and move to the new site.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.5/2">In October 2002, after the relocation decision had been announced to staff, Dstl commissioned MORI to carry out an independent Staff Opinion Survey. The response of staff, particularly at Farnborough, was very positive and had improved in key areas over the previous survey in 2001. There are no indications at this time that Dstl will lose significant numbers of staff because of its relocation plans.</p>

	<p pid=".702W.6/1">There is no standing European Rapid Reaction Force. Under the European Security and Defence Policy, national forces will come together for specific, EU-led crisis management operations (the 'Petersberg tasks') where NATO as a whole is not engaged. These incorporate humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.6/2">We are not committing British forces to a standing structure&mdash;we and other member states are, on a voluntary basis, offering to make forces available to meet requirements identified in the Helsinki Headline Catalogue as necessary to enable the EU to undertake the full spectrum of Petersberg tasks. The potential British contribution could be up to 12,500 troops, 72 combat aircraft and 18 warships, with a full range of supporting capabilities. At the Capabilities Improvement Conference in November 2001, along with other member states, the United Kingdom increased its potential contribution in areas where capability shortfalls were identified. There has been no change since then.</p>
	<p pid=".702W.6/3">Headline Goal shortfalls are identified by comparing the combined total of forces offered by member states with the Headline Goal requirements and are therefore collective; it is not the case that the United Kingdom contribution is intended to meet the shortfalls of others. Implementing solutions to shortfalls is a matter for nations or groups of nations to undertake voluntarily.</p>

That Order was made under section 54(1) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996. The vast majority of those being called out will come from the volunteer reserve forces, ie. the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the Territorial Army and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. However, some reservists, particularly those who have skills not readily available in the volunteer reserve forces, will be called out from the ex-regular reserve forces, ie. the Royal Fleet Reserve, the Army Reserve and the Royal Air Force Reserve.</p>

The liability of certain officers and former servicemen who are not members of any reserve force to be recalled for service is set out in Part VII of the Act and the power to authorise their recall is laid down in section 68. The call-out Order made on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-07">7 January</phrase> does not authorise the mobilisation of such individuals and there are no plans to make a recall Order. Such an Order could only be made in time of national danger or if a great emergency had arisen.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.5/1">The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) requires Reservists who are served with a call-out notice to report for service at a specified time and place. Failure to comply may result in the Reservist being charged with desertion or absence without leave and may be tried by court-martial or summarily by a civil court. However, RFA 96 also contains safeguards for individuals, including the right to apply for exemption from or deferral of call-out. The detailed regulations are contained in the Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) (Exemptions Etc) Regulations, Statutory Instrument 1997/307. Schedule 1 of those regulations sets out the grounds on which a Reservist may make an application. Reservists are made aware of their right to apply for deferral or exemption at the time of their call-out. There are separate arrangements for conscientious objectors.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.5/2">For the future, with the full introduction of our new strategic sealift service by the summer, we will have six RoRo vessels available at various degrees of readiness. Four of these vessels will be employed by MOD to meet day-to-day requirements with the remaining two vessels at lower states of readiness being available to MOD when operational situations warrant. This capability will also be augmented by four Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) (LSD(A)) which again, will be available when not required for amphibious operations. These vessels, which have a significantly enhanced lift capability, will replace current LSLs and are scheduled to come into service from 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".715W.0/17">The main reason for these in-year variances from plans stems from the nature of the Department's budgets and the difficulties this causes in forecasting spending accurately. For example: new and innovative programmes such as Sure Start rely on the pace of build up of local partnerships; capital projects can also take longer than anticipated to get off the ground; and the Department has a significant number of demand led budgets. The availability of End-Year Flexibility is designed to allow us to manage such fluctuations sensibly over a number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".715W.0/18">This year my Department intends to utilise approximately #600 million accumulated End-Year Flexibility, across a range of priorities, this will be drawn down at the spring Supplementary Estimate in February. The planned use of over #880 million accumulated End-Year Flexibility for years beyond 2002&ndash;03 was tabled in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-19">19 December 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2002-12-19.67"><i>Official Report</i>, column 67WS</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".715W.3/1">Pupils study international development issues as part of both the citizenship curriculum&mdash;now statutory in secondary schools&mdash;and within geography. Primary pupils learn about living in a diverse world through citizenship, and about less economically developed countries through geography as part of studying water, settlements and environmental issues. As they progress to secondary level, they are taught about the world as a global community, including the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, both through geography and citizenship. We have worked with educational bodies in this field, such as the Development Education Association, to produce a teaching resource: XCitizenship, the Global Dimension&quot;. QCA has also sent detailed guidance to all schools to help teachers to develop pupils international understanding at various stages of their learning.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.2/1">The Department does not allocate funding for the teaching of specific individual languages. The National Curriculum requirement is that all maintained secondary schools should offer one of the working languages of European Union. Over and above that, it is for schools to decide which and how many additional languages they choose to offer. There are no specific resources allocated by the Department to train teachers in Mandarin. It is up to Initial Teacher Training providers to choose which languages to include in the courses they offer. However, the Government does allocate #300,000 per year to the British Council run UK-China Educational Co-operation programme, which includes language immersion courses in Mandarin Chinese for teachers and pupils and the exchange of language assistants.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.2/2">Although there is a strong language learning element to the programme, the UK-China Educational Co-operation programme, which has been running since 2000, also provides grants for school linking visits, joint curriculum projects, electronic curriculum links and head teacher study visits.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.2/3">There are no figures available on how many language colleges offer Mandarin but 50 of the 157 language colleges offer Chinese. Aspiring language colleges are not required to give advance notice to the Department of the languages they intend to include in their applications so it is not possible to indicate how many intend to teach Mandarin. However language colleges are encouraged to diversify their language provision and Chinese continues to be a popular choice for applicant schools. Specialist applications are assessed by independent assessors and are not approved by the Department on the basis of a specified range of modern foreign languages.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.2/4">From an analysis of OFSTED inspection reports for 1997&ndash;98, no mention is made of Mandarin. From the reports of secondary schools inspected by OFSTED for 2001&ndash;02, it is noted that four schools taught Mandarin as part of the curriculum, four taught Mandarin as an extra-curriculum subject and three other schools taught Chinese as part of the curriculum.</p>

The number of ring-fenced grants, and the level of support provided through ring-fenced grants, will fall over the next three years from 13 per cent. of the total school spending to 11 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".721W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/2" class="italic">(a) Selection</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/3">All new maintained schools are prohibited from selecting pupils by high academic ability by the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998. The SSFA permits fair banding whereby schools select a proportion of pupils from each part of the full range of abilities. Academies and City Technology Colleges (CTCs) are prohibited from selecting by high academic ability by virtue of their funding agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/4">Schools with a specialism in a prescribed subject are allowed to select up to 10 per cent. of pupils by aptitude in that subject.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/5">Schools with a religious character are allowed in their admission criteria to give preference to adherents of their faith or denomination.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/6" class="italic">(b) National curriculum</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/7">All maintained schools, including those set up by faith organisations, are required to teach the National Curriculum. Academies are required through their funding agreements broadly to follow the National Curriculum and the national system of assessing it. CTCs are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum with an emphasis on science and technology, and to teach the core and other foundation subjects of the National Curriculum. They are not required to follow the National Curriculum programmes of study, although most do so.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/8" class="italic">(c) Science curriculum</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/9">The National Curriculum requires all pupils to study the Science Curriculum at key stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (ages 5&ndash;16). At key stage 4 pupils study the fossil record as evidence for evolution and how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction. Schools do teach how scientific controversies can arise from the interpretation of empirical evidence and this is likely to include Darwin's theory of evolution. Pupils are encouraged to explore different views, theories and beliefs. The origins of the universe are also addressed in the teaching of religious education at key stage 3 (ages 11&ndash;14).</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/10" class="italic">(d) Human rights</p>
	<p pid=".721W.5/11">The human rights of female students are protected by legislation. All maintained schools, including those set up by faith organisations, must comply with the Race Relations and Sex Discrimination Acts, and with the Human Rights Act. The Human Rights Act provides a right to education without discrimination on any grounds, including sex and religion. Its application extends to female pupils in Academies and CTCs.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.5/1">The Government does not have a specific budget for the promotion of Union Learning Representatives in either the public or the private sector. We recognise, however, that trade unions and their learning representatives have a key role to play in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this, my Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1988. This year (2002&ndash;03) #9 million is available and a further #33.6 million has been allocated for the next three years up to 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.5/2">When it was launched, the Union Learning Fund was a new and innovative experiment, but it has now become an established part of the lifelong learning agenda. It is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their capacity as learning organisations. It has so far benefited over 28,000 people in the workplace through a wide variety of projects ranging from tackling basic skills needs to advanced professional development. It has also led to the development of a new breed of activist, the Union Learning Representative, and has helped to establish and train a growing network which now stands at more than 4,000 learning representatives nationwide.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.5/3">Union Learning Representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly amongst the very lowest skilled workers and those with literacy and numeracy problems. That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to Union Learning Representatives. It will reinforce the invaluable role that Union Learning Representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote workforce development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.5/4">Any trade union based in England can submit an application to the Union Learning Fund. A prospectus inviting bids for Union Learning Fund projects for the coming year was sent to trade unions at the end of November. This information is also available electronically via the DfES or TUC Learning Services websites. The closing date for applications is <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-24">24 January</phrase>.</p>

Each partner will make their own contribution to the four priority areas, one of which is forest restoration and protection, through a range of actions.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.2/2">As set out in the biodiversity strategy for England we will be refining our approach to the conservation and restoration of ancient woodland, including research to increase our knowledge of the condition of woodland and practical action on the Forestry Commission's own estate to enhance biodiversity. We will also be revising our package of incentives to ensure they help protect and enhance ancient woodland, developing ways of providing more direct advice to owners, and ways of promoting the high value of ancient woodlands.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.2/3">One of the main threats to ancient woodland is the impact of adjacent agricultural activity and that is why the new entry-level agri-environment scheme pilots include woodlands. The scheme provides support for the maintenance of woodland fencing and the creation of buffer strips adjacent to woodlands. Both these measures will reduce or avoid any adverse impacts on woodland from adjacent agricultural activities.</p>

	<p pid=".729W.6/1">Any area considered for nomination as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve will need to fulfil the specific criteria for that designation. AONBs can be a useful supporting mechanism for a Biosphere Reserve as is the case with the recently extended Biosphere Reserve at Braunton Burrows in Devon. An area designated as AONB will not automatically meet the criteria for Biosphere Reserves. It is for the UK Man and Biosphere (UK MAB) Committee to consider applications for Biosphere Reserve status. The Committee will shortly be considering the next steps following the review of UK Biosphere Reserves. The Government will consider any proposal put forward by the UK MAB Committee on its individual merits for submission to UNESCO.</p>
	<p pid=".729W.6/2">There is no funding programme specifically for Biosphere Reserves, but Biosphere Reserve status has the potential to provide an area with a framework for attracting relevant funding streams such as LEADER+ and stimulating investment. The Government support AONBs generally in England through the AONB programme, which in 2003&ndash;04, will receive grants worth more than #6 million. The Countryside Agency, who administers this funding on behalf of Government, pays up to 75 per cent. of an AONBs core costs and 50 per cent. of its project costs.</p>

	<p pid=".730W.2/2">It is likely that this question refers specifically to movement notifications made by cattle keepers to the British Cattle Movement Service. BCMS has received around 22,000 representations about movement notification failures since May this year from around England, Scotland and Wales. Some cattle keepers have claimed to have told the BCMS about cattle movements, when their computerised records have been cross checked and deficiencies found, as part of the subsidy claims checking process. The Rural Payments Agency and the BCMS check these cases very carefully, and it is not right to assume that the BCMS has lost keepers' movement notification when there is no evidence of the document ever arriving at the BCMS site.</p>
	<p pid=".730W.2/3">If keepers want to guarantee that their notifications are received by BCMS, they can send them electronically to BCMS using the online system at: <a href="http://www.bcms.gov.uk">www.bcms.gov.uk</a> The BCMS are encouraging all cattle keepers to register their records via the cattle tracing system online.</p>

In accordance with EU rules on freedom of movement and rights of establishment, EU nationals and corporate bodies incorporated in a member state may own and license vessels on the UK fishing vessel register provided that they are resident in the UK or have a place of business in the UK respectively or alternatively that they appoint a representative person in the UK. All vessels so owned must be managed, and their operations directed and controlled, from within the UK. They must also maintain an economic link with the UK. Reports on economic link compliance are published annually by Fisheries Departments and copies are available from the Library. Details of the number of licences acquired annually by foreign owners operating from within the EU are not recorded centrally by Fisheries Departments. However the reports on compliance include estimates since 1996 of the numbers of vessels which are understood to be beneficially owned in whole or in part by foreign interests. At <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-31">31 December 2001</phrase> there were 118 such vessels out of a registered over 10 metre fleet of 1,942 vessels, compared with 161 vessels out of a fleet of 2,467 vessels at <phrase class="date" code="1996-12-31">31 December 1996</phrase>.

	<p pid=".736W.3/1">I am advised that 645 houses were flooded during the floods over the New Year holiday. As for previous events, it depends on what the hon. Member defines as a major flood. Floods occur most winters although property flooding is generally avoided. Obviously we are all aware of the autumn 2000 event in which more than 10,000 homes were affected. In addition the 1998 flood remains in most people's memory and in that event more than 4,200 homes were flooded. Prior to that, probably the most notable was the flood event which occurred in September 1968 when large areas of the south west and southern England including south and south east London were flooded. We do not have detailed information on the number of properties that were flooded.</p>

	<p pid=".738W.3/1">The Canadian and US authorities do not require separation distances to be applied for commercial GM oilseed rape crops, but do require them for field trials. They distinguish between Brassica napus (which they call Argentine rape canola or swede rape) and Brassica rapa (which they call Polish rape canola or turnip rape). They do not differentiate separation distances based on whether the neighbouring crop is non-GM (conventional) or organic. In the UK the vast majority of the oilseed rape grown is Brassica napus, although some Brassica rapa is also grown. Cross-pollination frequency between B. napus and B. rapa is less than between plants of the same species. The separation distances in North America are as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".743W.5/2">Unlike an ISA mortgage savings scheme, an endowment mortgage also provides life insurance cover. It is a long-standing principle that the surrender value of any life insurance policy should be disregarded when determining entitlement to the income- related benefits, including Council Tax Benefit. This is because the intended beneficiaries of life insurance policies, are not the policy-holders themselves, but any dependants they may have at the time of their death. Because a life insurance policy is an integral part of an endowment mortgage, the overall surrender value is disregarded in the same way. However, if a life insurance policy is surrendered early or linked endowment mortgage savings are redeemed, any resulting capital is taken into account in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.5/3">Because ISA mortgage savings schemes do not provide life insurance cover any savings held are taken into account as capital from the outset when determining entitlement to the income-related benefits, including Council Tax Benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".743W.5/4">We keep all our policies under review. However, we have no plans to change the present rules in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.2/3">There are no powers to extend the three-month time limit for claims for the full 52 weeks benefit. However, there are special rules for cases in which a death is not confirmed until some time after it has occurred, for example, following a disappearance.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.2/4">Bereavement Payment, a one-off lump sum, must currently be claimed within three months of the death of a spouse.

	<p pid=".746W.2/1">The weekly value of the state second pension in the particular case illustrated is #67. The weekly value of SERPS as amended prior to April 2002 is #33. If the 20 best years provision had not been repealed, the weekly value of SERPS would have been #87.</p>
	<p pid=".746W.2/2">It is assumed that the woman in question earns the average female full-time weekly wage when working full time (#383) and the average female part-time weekly wage when working part time (#144). She is assumed to work for 30 years, 17 of which are full-time.</p>
	<p pid=".746W.2/3">The reason that the 20 best years provision in SERPS generates a higher pension than state second pension is that an example of someone with substantial full-time work at average earnings is used. State second pension has been designed to benefit lower earners and part-time workers who would generally receive far less from the 20 best years rule than from state second pension.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.0/1">The allowance made in the pre-Budget report public finance forecast is based on assumptions about changes to cross-border shopping behaviour following the October launch of the next stage of the Government's long-term strategy to tackle tobacco smuggling.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.0/2">The assumptions focus on effects that can be quantified with a degree of certainty. EU shoppers have always been allowed to bring back as much tobacco as they like, as long it is for their own use, and the revisions to the tobacco indicative levels as part of the October package do not affect that entitlement. Data from Customs and Excise's survey of cross-Channel travellers show that the majority of travellers made no purchases of cigarettes, and that, of those who did make purchases, two thirds purchased below the previous indicative level of 800 cigarettes, and that a further 15 per cent. purchased above. The recent change to the levels can be expected to have little effect on the shopping patterns of these travellers.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.0/3">The assumptions for the public finance forecasts relate to the impact on behaviour of those remaining travellers purchasing at the previous indicative levels for tobacco. Those assumptions include:</p>
	<p pid=".747W.0/4" class="indent">that a small proportion of travellers may be expected to increase their purchases to the new level; and</p>
	<p pid=".747W.0/5" class="indent">that the average level of other purchases would increase to 1,600 cigarettes, a three-month supply for an average smoker, taking into account the affordability and profitability of trips.</p>

	<p pid=".747W.6/1">Details of Customs' drug seizures are published in their annual reports, copies of which are available in the House of Commons Library. Drugs seized by Customs are destined for all parts of the UK, and there is little direct importation of class A drugs into Scotland. For this reason it is not policy to break down seizure information to the constituent parts of the UK.</p>

Licence fees include receipts from fees for onshore and offshore petroleum exploration and production licenses, including initial and periodic payments and tender receipts from offshore licensing of #37 million from the 4th round in 1971&ndash;72, #33 million the 8th round in 1982&ndash;83 and #121 million from the 9th round in 1984&ndash;85.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/42">2. Supplementary Petroleum Duty (SPD) was introduced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="1981-01-01">1 January 1981</phrase> by the 1981 Finance Act and lapsed after <phrase class="date" code="1982-12-31">31 December 1982</phrase>; it was payable at the rate of 20 per cent. on the gross value of oil and gas produced under UK licences less an allowance per field of one million tonnes per year; it did not apply to PRT-exempt sales of gas to the British Gas Corporation.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/43">3. Advance Petroleum Tax (APRT) is included with PRT. The net PRT repayment in 1991&ndash;92 and low net receipts in 1992&ndash;93 resulted from high tax-relievable expenditure claimed on some fields.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/44">4. The level of Corporation Tax receipts in 1993&ndash;94 reflected low liabilities in 1992 (paid in the following financial year) and repayment resulting from lower settlements for earlier years.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/45">5. The ACT (Advance Corporation Tax) Set-off is estimated because the dividends attributable to UK oil and gas cannot be separately identified from other dividends.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/46">6. Mainstream Corporation Tax (CT) equals CT before the ACT Set-off less the estimated ACT Set-of.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.0/47">There have been no significant grants or other payments to the oil industry and hence the net revenues are the same as the gross revenues.</p>

	<p pid=".760W.2/1">The Immigration Service uses a wide range of technology to detect clandestine entrants, including heartbeat detectors, passive millimetric wave imagers and CO2 detectors. However, responsibility for protecting vehicles in order to prevent the carriage of unauthorised people properly lies with the vehicle operator and not with the Immigration Service. Carriers who comply fully with the Code of Practice for the prevention of clandestine entry, and who have no knowledge or suspicion of the presence of unauthorised people, will not be liable to a penalty. If liability is incurred, the level of penalty set will take into account mitigating factors which will include the extent of any checks, including those using CO2 or other detection equipment, carried out by third parties immediately prior to embarkation for the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.2/1">We have taken advice from experts and consider that Airwave is safe. The Stewart report recommended that a precautionary approach should be taken on mobile phones and health. The Home Office is, therefore, setting up a health-monitoring programme for Airwave users in the police service, inconsultation with police organisations, epidemiologists and occupational health experts. Tenders are currently under consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/2">When a force moves to Airwave, the roll out is phased, starting from the point at which forces achieve a ready for service (RFS) date. Once that date has been achieved, the move from the existing system to Airwave begins within the force. Generally, that move takes place over a period of time with the forces migrating, typically, one division at a time.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/3">Currently, there are seven forces in various stages of migration to Airwave: Lancashire, Greater Manchester Police, West Mercia, Suffolk, Leicestershire, North Yorkshire and Northumbria. West Mercia has just become the first force to become fully live with Airwave.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.2/4">Representations have been received from a range of groups, including the Police Federation, Mast Sanity, Association of National Park Authorities, residents associations and individuals. Topics have included health and safety, mast placement and potential interference with other equipment.</p>

This adds to the existing evidence to show that truancy and exclusion can increase the risk of offending. The 2002 Youth Justice Board Youth Survey showed that 44 per cent. of young people who admitted to offending in the last year had also played truant.</p>

Specific measures include the Behaviour Improvement Programme, covering over 700 schools, to improve pupil behaviour and reduce truancy and exclusions; the police and schools working together to conduct truancy sweeps; the deployment of an additional 100 police officers to work in schools; and increased powers to deal with the parents of persistent truants, including the piloting of new fast-track prosecution procedures.</p>

	<p pid=".766W.7/1">The disruption of drug production in Afghanistan was not among the aims of the military campaign. However, the fall of the Taliban and consequent appointment of the Afghan Transitional Authority through a Loya Jirga meeting (Grand Council) has created a new opportunity to end Afghan opium production. The UK is co-ordinating international support for Afghanistan's drug control efforts and has produced, in consultation with the Afghan Government, other donors and international agencies, a long-term strategy for building up Afghan drug law enforcement capacity and providing alternative livelihoods to opium poppy farmers. The brutality of the Taliban regime had helped to restrict production of poppies in the final year of their rule. Their replacement by a Government committed to international human rights norms will inevitably see some increase in production. But alternative livelihoods could encourage growers to cease cultivation particularly if the Afghan Government undertake enforced eradication of crops. The strategy we have negotiated with the Afghan Government aims to achieve the Government's target of contributing to the elimination of drugs from Afghanistan within 10 years.</p>

Therefore, no fines were payable, but the Commission asked the Court to order that costs of the case be borne by France. The UK Government regrets the decision by the European Commission not to pursue the case for penalties against France. The UK has supported the Commission throughout and believes that pressing this case would have sent a firm message to member states that no one country can avoid its obligations and responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid=".769W.2/1">Russia is a committed member of the G8 'Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction'. In December 2002 the Russian Government decided to set up a new interagency committee, which will be chaired by the Russian Prime Minister. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-10">10 January</phrase> this year Russia pledged $2 billion over the next 10 years to the Partnership. This includes $204 million on high-priority projects in 2003, focusing on the destruction of chemical weapons and work on decommissioned nuclear submarines.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.2/2">However, for most of the work to begin Russia has to agree to a legal framework that is satisfactory to donor countries. At present there are problems with liability and taxation provisions and these must be solved before many large projects can go ahead. This delay also affects the UK, which has made strenuous efforts to overcome these final obstacles. Conclusion of an agreement is a prerequisite to the start of much of the project-work. We hope that an agreement can be reached very shortly, as the UK is at an advanced stage of readiness and once the legal framework is in place, projects can quickly begin.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.2/3">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced to Parliament last July the UK's commitment to the Global Partnership of up to $750 million over 10 years (<phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-07-01.21"><i>Official Report</i>, column 21</phrase>). The UK Government believe the importance of the Partnership is clear, and puts a high priority on its contribution, as part of the UK's wider non-proliferation, security and foreign policy strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".776W.3/2">The grant can be used on new retail facilities, shop alterations or improved security. The aim is to reduce the risk of closure of those branches in deprived urban areas, which are not closing as part of the Post Office Urban Network Reinvention scheme.

A number of local authorities have requested either the power to charge householders for refuse collection, or the power to charge for un-segregated waste at Civic Amenity sites. Defra have not been able to grant such powers due to legislative constraints.</p>

The tackling violence against women strategy will focus on improving prevention, protection and provision of service to women. The strategy is due for publication in spring 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.5/3">Although it is generally accepted that domestic violence is predominately directed towards women we must remember that men can also be sufferers. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety's Regional Forum on Domestic Violence has commissioned research into the experiences of 50 male sufferers of domestic violence. Discussion is ongoing with Queen's University about publication of the findings. The Forum will then consider whether additional steps need to be taken to help male sufferers specifically.</p>

Clearly the new system will need to be in place for a period of time before consideration can be made of the effects of the new more flexible system.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.0/3">In order to qualify for childcare tax credit, parents have to satisfy two requirements. Firstly they must qualify for WFTC working more than 16 hours per week with a family income below the eligible maximum. Secondly they have to be using registered child care and if you have a partner he or she must also be working more than 16 hours. Because of the difficulties in identifying the people meeting these criteria and the constantly changing profile of recipients, it is difficult to estimate the number of parents eligible but not claiming the childcare tax credit.</p>

Latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures also show that FDI stock in the UK in the third quarter of 2002 was at a record level of #390.6 billion, an increase of #25.1 billion or 7 per cent. over the same quarter in 2001.

	<p pid=".801W.2/1">Information is not available in the form requested. In the case of residential rehabilitation, places are often purchased at a residential centre that may be outside the drug misusers area of residence. In practice some local authority social services departments agree to fund long distance placements with the agreement of the drug misusers so he/she can be removed from the area where they are involved in drug using. This means that in theory all of the approximately 3,100 residential rehabilitation places for drug and alcohol misusers in England are available to drug misusers resident in Twickenham and other parts of London. However, purchasing decisions are a matter for agreement between the drug misusers and the local agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.2/2">A one off exercise was carried out to estimate the number of drug users in England in contact with drug treatment agencies in 2000&ndash;01. Around of 27,400 individuals were reported to be in contact with drug treatment agencies in London; of these, 142 were reported as being in treatment at community specialist services in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. A statistical bulletin XStatistics from the Regional Drug Misuse Databases on drug misusers in treatment in England, 2000/01&quot; was published in December 2001, and is available on the Department of Health website at, <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/public/sb0133.htm">http://www.doh.gov.uk/public/sb0133.htm</a></p>
