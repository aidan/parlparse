	<p pid="a.2002W.0/1">I am aware of the public concern over the trade in live calf exports; it is generating a high volume of letters to the Department. However, this is a lawful trade and European Union (EU) law must be observed. The United Kingdom (UK) cannot place a unilateral ban on the export of calves. All exports must meet the necessary animal health and welfare rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/2">This Government are committed to the welfare of animals and have played a key role in improving EU rules on transport since 1996 when the export trade in live calves from the UK ceased. New EU-wide welfare in transport rules will come into force in January 2007 providing further improvements. We are seeking to encourage the industry to develop alternative uses for calves other than live export, and welcome the joint initiative from Compassion in World Farming and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to bring together welfare groups, the dairy and beef industry and the retail sector to discuss this issue. They hosted an event in July which I attended.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.0/3">The industry has developed domestic veal rearing systems that satisfy robust welfare requirements, but the opportunities to sell the product in the UK are very limited. Conversely, dairy farmers are now driven by the strong commercial demand for veal calves on the continent. The Department commissioned a study to look at the economic drivers and potential for developing alternative markets to the export of veal calves. The report confirmed that the domestic market for home produced veal is resistant to growth. It did, however, conclude that there are commercially attractive opportunities for rearing dairy calves for the growing domestic market for manufacturing beef. This is promising and Defra will continue to play its part in encouraging such alternative uses.</p>

	<p pid="a.2002W.3/1">The UK will continue to protest at the highest diplomatic level against Iceland's activities. I have called the Icelandic ambassador to my office to explain this decision and to voice our strong opposition to Iceland's commercial whaling. We will continue our efforts, along with other countries, to urge Iceland to reconsider their position and reverse this unjustified and unnecessary decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.3/2">However, there are no provisions within the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) that provide for the exclusion of parties who are considered to have broken the rules. It is debatable whether Iceland's action could reasonably be considered a breach of its treaty obligations, since it was taken under a formal Reservation made by Iceland on rejoining the International Whaling Commission in 2002. However, the UK's formal objection to Iceland's reservation to article 10(e) of the ICRW (the part enforcing the moratorium) remains.</p>

	<p pid="a.2006W.2/1">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is procuring the Olympic stadium. As the explanatory document published in July by the ODA made clear, in legacy mode we intend that it will be a 25,000-seater stadium with athletics at its core, consistent with the commitment set out in the London 2012 Candidate File. The ODA has appointed consultants who, in consultation with Olympic stakeholders, sporting bodies and the local community, are scoping the different possible community uses for the stadium with a view to drawing up a business plan for future use of the stadium. A wide range of options consistent with our Candidate File commitment is currently under consideration. Any decision on legacy use of the stadium will be made by the Olympic board on which I am the Government's representative.</p>

	<p pid="a.2008W.0/21">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register may not have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million businesses (42 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.2008W.6/1">Digital switchover is expected to have implications for both transmitter power usage and consumer power usage. The Government's assessment is that the replacement of the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a net reduction in energy usage by the transmission networks of 186 GWh per year. Completion of switchover is expected to result in an increase in consumer energy use of between 966GWh and 2816GWh per annum, primarily due to the expected increase in the take up of set-top boxes. This is equivalent to a 0.37 per cent. increase in domestic electricity consumption. The Government's overall estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of 1705GWh per year.</p>

This study suggests that if ground source heat pumps were installed in all off-gas grid residential properties, carbon savings of around 3.9MtC/year could be achieved. No such assessment has been made of the potential of air source or water source heat pumps.</p>

The number of troops needed for these operational tasks will naturally depend on Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) requirements, but I very much welcome the PSNFs increasing ability to carry out their tasks without military support and look forward to this continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.2018W.15/2">The term &quot;psychological operations&quot; replaced &quot;psychological warfare&quot; in MOD doctrine prior to 1962, as explained in the preface to then War Office Pamphlet Guide 9729. Consequently no employees of the BBC have attended courses or seminars at MOD establishments relating to psychological warfare in the period concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018W.15/3">Psychological operations training relocated to Chicksands in April 1997. Central records indicate that no employees of the BBC have undergone training there. Guest speakers are invited periodically to present on psychological operations courses. No employees of the BBC have done so at Chicksands and we have no records of any BBC employee ever being invited in such a capacity. We are, however, aware of one BBC employee who attended a presentation by 15 (UK) Psychological Operations Group at HQ Land Command in 1999.</p>

	<p pid="a.2029W.11/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about unemployment. (96929)</p>
	<p pid="a.2029W.11/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of employment for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2029W.11/5" class="indent">About 5,000 people resident in the Hendon parliamentary constituency were unemployed in the 12 months ending in February 1997 from the annual local area LFS. Latest APS data indicates that around 4,000 people resident in the Hendon constituency were unemployed in the 12 months ending in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2029W.11/6" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Changes in the estimates from year to year should be treated with particular caution</p>
	<p pid="a.2029W.11/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). In May 1997, 3,141 people resident in the Hendon constituency were claiming JSA. In September 2006, the equivalent figure was 2,182. These counts are not seasonally adjusted and changes will be affected by seasonal factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.2032W.3/2">The table shows the average length of custodial sentence (excluding life) imposed by the courts for the various offences involving the unlawful possession of firearms in England and Wales for the years 2000 to 2004, the latest year for which figures are currently available. It is compiled on the principal offence basis. Although care is taken in collating and analysing the returns used to compile such figures, the data are of necessity subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system. Consequently, although some figures may be shown to the last digit in order to provide a comprehensive record of the information collected, they are not necessarily accurate to the last digit shown. Data on average time served, which are obtained from the prison IT system, are not available separately for specific offences as accuracy at this level of detail cannot be guaranteed .We have started a programme of work in the Home Office looking at the quality of existing court sentencing and prison data and how this might be improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.2054W.8/2">'Hard to reach' and 'hard to place' are similar terms used in the Department's guidance to schools and wider children's services. 'Hard to reach' is not precisely defined, but refers to children and families who are generally disengaged from mainstream public services, and are at risk of experiencing poor life chances and outcomes. 'Hard to place' refers to children who experience difficulties gaining admission to a school, perhaps because they have moved due to family circumstances, or have been excluded from another school. This issue is addressed in the new School Admissions code, for which the current consultation ends <phrase class="date" code="">1 December 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.2067W.5/1">The mortgage-style student loan system started in 1990 and new borrowing in that scheme ceased in 1998. Deferment is the feature of that now-closed mortgage-style loans system that protects borrowers during periods in which their earnings are below the repayment threshold. Loans in the income-contingent repayment scheme that was introduced from 1998 are not deferred: deductions stop automatically if a borrower's income falls below the threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.2067W.5/2">Similarly, arrears in the student loans system almost exclusively apply to the closed mortgage-style system. Arrears denote that a borrower is behind with payments that they are due to have made: this does not arise in repayment of income-contingent loans through the tax system. The number of borrowers in arrears on mortgage-style loans, on which new borrowing ceased in 1998, represents 10 percent. of the total number of people who have borrowed under that scheme. 20 percent. of those in arrears were making repayments, but had not cleared their arrears. Included among the total in arrears at any given time, there are a number of borrowers who will be on the way to deferment status, but who have not yet completed the application process for deferment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2068W.3/1">The UK is the Afghan government's partner nation on counter narcotics. We work closely and have a continuing dialogue with the US, and with the international community as a whole, on how we can best support Afghan efforts to combat the drugs trade. This year's substantial increase in planting in Afghanistan is very disappointing and reflects the difficult security situation and limited law enforcement capability in some provinces particularly in the south. But drug control strategies take time and both the UK and the US agree that the Afghan government's National Drug Control Strategy is the right approach to bring about a sustained reduction in the production and trafficking of opium. Last year the US spent US$788 million in support of Afghanistan's counter narcotics effort. This assistance is not channelled through the UK. US programmes are primarily directed at law enforcement and justice reform, alternative livelihoods, elimination/eradication, interdiction and public information.</p>

	<p pid="a.2068W.6/1">The UK supports and agrees with the Afghan Government's position that licensing opium cultivation for medical use is not a realistic solution to the problems of the opium economy in Afghanistan. There are currently no central government and law enforcement mechanisms in place in Afghanistan to set up and administer a system of licit cultivation and traffickers would therefore be free to continue to exploit the illicit market. Legitimising opium cultivation would also send out a mixed message to farmers, undermining the effectiveness of the Government of Afghanistan's message that drugs are illegal and 'haram' or forbidden under Afghan culture. Licit cultivation of Afghan opium is also unlikely to be viable on an economic basis. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, there is currently a global oversupply in the availability of medicinal opiates.</p>

	<p pid="a.2069W.2/1">In July 2000, the Taliban imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery, however, and drove up the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government. Following the fall of the Taliban, President Karzai, with support from the international community, is working hard to extend the central Government's authority across Afghanistan and to rebuild the country's war-damaged infrastructure. He has also made it clear that eliminating opium is vital for Afghanistan's future and key to its stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/2">However, sustainable drug control strategies take time to deliver, especially when the challenges are as severe as they are in Afghanistan. Although this year's 59 per cent. increase (165,000 ha) in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is disappointing, it reflects the difficult security situation and limited law enforcement capability in the south. Elsewhere, in areas where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions in cultivation achieved last year have been sustained. This is encouraging and shows that the Afghan National Drug Control strategy is the right approach. Progress has also been made in other areas including the passage of vital Counter Narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 200 traffickers and an increase in drugs related seizures.</p>

The UN Development Programme (<a href="http://www.undp.org">www.undp.org</a>) and World Health Organisation (<a href="http://www.who.int">www.who.int</a>) also provide data on crude death rates. There is very little data available on child mortality, though UNICEF (<a href="http://www.unicef.org">www.unicef.org</a>) has compiled data on under-five mortality in Iraq in the 1990's. Since 2003 there has been no comprehensive record of mortality rates in Iraq, though there are a number of estimations of the number of deaths caused by violence, eg Iraqi Ministry of Health, the Iraq Body Count, and surveys published by the Lancet Medical Journal. The Government of Iraq are currently making preparations to undertake a national population census, which would provide data on mortality, fertility, and migration.</p>

	<p pid="a.2075W.5/1">The UK has always recognised Israel's legitimate right to self-defence. At the same time we made clear during the conflict our deep concern at the deaths of civilians and at the destruction of civilian infrastructure and consistently urged Israel to exercise utmost restraint and act in compliance with international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="a.2075W.5/2">The UK has not conducted an investigation into Israel's conduct in Lebanon between <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-14">14 August</phrase>. We note that various human rights non-governmental organisations and the visit report of the four UN special procedure mandate holders have accused both Israel and Hezbollah of serious violations of international humanitarian law. We believe that any credible allegations of improper conduct should be properly investigated and appropriate action taken by the Governments of Israel and Lebanon. We have held discussions about unexploded ordnance with both the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel. We have called on the Government of Israel to make a public statement about its use of cluster munitions in the recent conflict with Lebanon and would expect them to investigate any well-founded allegations of misuse of munitions by its armed forces, just as the UK would do.</p>

	<p pid="a.2077W.6/1">DFID has spent over &pound;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. The UK is Afghanistan's second largest donor DFID's budget for Afghanistan is &pound;102 million for this year, rising to &pound;113 million in 2007-08; and &pound;115 million in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.2077W.6/2">Afghanistan remains one of the UK's top priorities and we have provided valuable support to the Government who have made great progress over the last five years: presidential and parliamentary elections were held. Six million children have returned to school, over a third of them girls. 13,000 girls' and boys' primary and secondary schools have been built and 15 teacher training centres have been established. 35,000 lives have been saved from routine immunisations. In 2005-06 the legal economy is estimated to have grown by 14 per cent. 3.5 million refugees have returned home. Major road rehabilitation is connecting major urban centres and Afghanistan with its neighbours. Reliable electricity supply is being restored. The telecommunications sector is growing fast, connecting businesses and people in Afghanistan,</p>
	<p pid="a.2077W.6/3">Over 70 per cent. of our aid goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan and UK is the largest donor to the Government's recurrent budget&mdash;covering annual costs such as salaries for teachers and health workers. This is exactly what the Afghan Government want&mdash;and is the best chance for building effective state institutions that will last.</p>
	<p pid="a.2077W.6/4">DFlD's programme in Afghanistan is trying to encourage sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Building state institutions, improving economic management and providing legal economic alternative to those involved in poppy cultivation are all critical to that objective DFID provides significant funding to support the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government, such as the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) and the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA), which bring direct benefits to poor people. The NSP is active in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan and is responding to priority needs identified by some of the most remote and poorest communities. MISFA is currently working in 18 provinces and plans to be active in all 34 by end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.2077W.6/5">The reconstruction effort in Afghanistan is a long-term initiative. Achieving our objective of a peaceful, prosperous and secure Afghanistan, will be reliant upon the support and commitment of UK and other partners for many years to come</p>

	<p pid="a.2078W.5/2">Concerns about human rights and governance in Ethiopia, during the unrest which followed the elections last year, led the UK and other donors to stop providing the Government of Ethiopia with assistance in the form of direct budget support. In order to ensure that the poor do not suffer as a result of this decision we developed the protection of basic services grant which is accompanied by stringent measures to ensure transparency and accountability. The grant aims to protect the delivery of basic services, such as education, health, agriculture and water and sanitation, by local government in Ethiopia.</p>

	<p pid="a.2079W.2/1">Every DFID project or programme including, poverty reduction budget support, with an approved commitment of &pound;1 million or over is reviewed annually to ensure that it is meeting its aims, In addition a project completion report is prepared during the last three months of the project or when actual expenditure reaches the 95 per cent. threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/2">If a DFID funded programme was designed to integrate HIV and AIDS services into sexual and reproductive health clinics it would be 'tracked' with both AIDS and reproductive health markers through DFlD's Policy Information Marker System (PIMS). DFID has begun to review the elements of sexual and reproductive health, including HIV prevention, that are included in current/recent programmes that have a reproductive health PIMS marker.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/3">DFID encourages all donors to respect the international agreement reached around three core principles to improve co-ordination of the national response to AIDS. This is known as the 'Three Ones': one agreed HIV/AIDS action framework, one national AIDS co-ordinating authority and one agreed country-level evaluation system. The 'Three Ones' helps donors, multilateral the private sector and civil society to work together with national government in a more effective and harmonised way.</p>

	<p pid="a.2079W.5/3">DFID has had dealings with the MCB on occasions, including co-chairing a seminar for Islamic NGOs in 2005, and in 2001 publishing its fourth Target 2015 booklet, in association with the Muslim Council of Britain, Muslim Aid and Islamic Relief. These activities did not involve direct funding of MCB.</p>

Where mental health services are being asked to put up money this year to assist the health community overall, then they should get it back in the following financial year, as set out in the Operating Framework 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.2/1">Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is authorised in children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment should be under the supervision of a specialist. Clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing have examined the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate in children with ADHD who received treatment for up to 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.2/2">Since methylphenidate was first authorised in the United Kingdom, a range of representations regarding its safety profile have been received from Members of Parliament, patients and health care professionals. Some of these have specifically questioned the need for further research into its long-term safety profile but none have specifically provided information about the findings of new research.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.2/3">It is recognised that there is limited information about the long term efficacy and safety profile of methylphenidate. This is reflected in the product information, which advises that treatment should be discontinued periodically to assess the child's condition and that treatment should usually be discontinued during or after puberty.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.2/4">Stimulants such as methylphenidate are known potentially to affect weight gain and growth in children following long-term use. The product information, for prescribers and patients/carers and the British National Formulary contain warnings about this risk and advise that the child's weight and height should be regularly checked throughout treatment. A number of studies have been conducted to examine this issue and these inform current clinical guidance which recommends regular monitoring and treatment breaks in children who are not gaining weight or growing as expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.2/5">The longer term safety of the use of methylphenidate in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with other European regulatory authorities. There are currently ongoing discussions at European level on whether further formal studies are required to extend the knowledge about the safety profile of methylphenidate, including the long term safety profile. As new data emerge it is carefully evaluated by the MHRA and where necessary current prescribing advice is updated to reflect the new evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.2106W.0/1">The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is strictly regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.2106W.0/2">Animals listed on schedule 2 to the 1986 Act may only be used if obtained from designated breeders and or suppliers. Schedule 2 lists: mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, dog, cat, primate, quail, ferrets, gerbils, pigs if genetically modified and sheep if genetically modified.</p>
	<p pid="a.2106W.0/3">Such animals must, unless an exemption is granted, be obtained from designated breeders and suppliers in the United Kingdom. All of these designated breeders and suppliers are required to comply with the conditions of issue of a Certificate of Designation issued under the 1986 Act, to comply with Home Office codes of practice and are subject to regular inspection by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. All users must keep records of the source and disposal of protected animals. These records are available to the Home Office on request. Additional administrative controls require that, unless otherwise authorised by the Secretary of State, breeding and supplying designated establishments may only obtain animals of the types listed in schedule 2 from other designated sources. Applicants seeking permission to obtain such animals from non-designated sources are generally required to demonstrate that no suitable animal can be obtained from a designated source. Suitability may be determined by particular factors including strain, age, weight and health status.</p>
	<p pid="a.2106W.0/4">There are additional controls for the acquisition and use of non-human primates. Approval for the acquisition of non-human primates from overseas, or from other non-designated sources, will only be given if the conditions at the breeding or supplying centre are acceptable to the Home Office. The Home Office has detailed knowledge of the standards and practices of the overseas breeders that supply captive bred non-human primates to UK laboratories, in advance of their being used, and they are subject to periodic visits by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. Approval is also conditional upon life-time health records being supplied with the animals and made available to the Home Office upon request. Project licence holders must maintain and make available to the Home Office, on request, records relating to the non-designated centres from which the animals are obtained. Each batch of animals acquired from overseas must be separately authorised, and the transport arrangements must be acceptable to the Home Office. The Home Office must also be supplied with details of the health status of the animals on, and after, arrival at the designated establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2106W.0/5">Requests to use animals of the types specified in schedule 2 to the 1986 Act from non-designated sources are generally treated on a case-by-case basis, the Secretary of State being able to grant exemptions to the requirement that they be obtained from approved breeders in the United Kingdom when he believes this is justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.2107W.0/1">Comprehensive statistics of scientific procedures on living animals in Great Britain of animals carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 are published annually. Copies of the publication for 2005 (Cm 6877) can be found in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.0/2">The data is not collected, stored or presented in a way enabling it to be easily broken down between England, Wales and Scotland as the 1986 Act is administered by the Home Office for the whole of Great Britain (it is administered separately in Northern Ireland).

	<p pid="a.2107W.0/3">During 2005, 408,794 regulated procedures under the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were carried out in Scotland.</p>

Public health laboratories, NHS hospitals and non-profit making organisations did not carry out any regulated procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.0/5">During 2005, in Scotland, there were four regulated procedures involving cats conducted under the 1986 Act, 1,723 involving dogs, 6,938 involving rabbits, 69 involving horses and other equids, 79 involving new world primates, 1,306 involving old world primates, 128,561 involving genetically modified animals and 11,048 involving animals with a harmful genetic defect.</p>

	<p pid="a.2111W.8/1">The Community Call for Action will enable local communities to trigger action by the police or other local agencies where they have failed to tackle persistent local crime or antisocial behaviour problems. Under clause 18(3) of the Police and Justice Bill ward councillors will be under a duty to respond to a call for action. We expect most problems referred to a councillor to be resolved informally through discussion with the relevant local agency with only the most difficult problems being referred to the local authority overview and scrutiny committee. Where a councillor decides not to refer a matter to the overview and scrutiny committee, clause 18(4) provides that the person raising the problem may refer it to the local authority executive for consideration. The council executive will have the same rights as the councillor to liaise with the relevant agencies and to refer difficult issues to the overview and scrutiny committee for resolution.</p>

Under provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984, police officers may take a DNA sample from any person arrested or charged in connection with a recordable offence. Section 141 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (as amended) provides a power for authorised persons to take fingerprints from any person in respect of whom a relevant immigration decision has been made. This includes the decision to remove an illegal entrant and the decision to deport. When serving a decision notice on an illegal entrant, the immigration officer will check against existing Immigration fingerprint records and if there is no trace he or she will fingerprint the individual. In the case of foreign national prisoners, fingerprints will have been taken at an earlier stage under police powers at the point of charging for the criminal offence.</p>

The assessment is contained in the published UK Threat Assessment of Serious Organised Crime 2006-07. The assessment states that for many illegal workers in the UK a job is part of their facilitation package and criminal gangmasters are involved in finding work for illegal immigrants. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority began licensing the agricultural, horticultural, shellfish gathering, and associated processing industries in March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.2124W.6/1">Proximity chips are being introduced into travel documents worldwide to fulfil international requirements established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a division of the United Nations. As both biometric passports and the proposed identity card are, or are intended to be, travel documents, they are required to comply with such requirements. It should be noted that the UK's new e-passport, over 2.5 million of which have now been issued, includes a proximity chip in order to meet ICAO requirements and to meet the conditions of the US Visa Waiver Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.6/2">The chips being used in passports communicate with the passport reader using radio frequencies. However, use of the term &quot;RFID chips&quot; for these causes confusion as, for many people, &quot;RFID&quot; implies functionality found in &quot;RFID Tags&quot; which are low-security, passive devices, capable of being read by standard equipment at a distance of several metres. The chips used in passports are designed to capable of being read at distances of only a few centimetres and implement Basic Access Control in accordance with international standards. This requires the reader to scan optically information on the data page of the passport and pass this to the chip before the chip will communicate with the reader. Thus, it would not be possible for a reader to extract any data from the chip at a distance or if the reader had not been able to scan the passport's data page. RFID tags will not be utilised in either the biometric passport or the national identity card.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.6/3">In addition to Basic Access Control, proximity chips in the identity card and passport will use other cryptographic measures in order to prevent the information on the chip from being modified. It is also planned that further advanced encryption will be utilised to secure biometric information on the chip of the passport and card in the future. This will comply with Extended Access Control standards that are currently under development at an international level.</p>

	<p pid="a.2128W.0/1">The Government are committed to introducing neighbourhood policing to every part of England and Wales by April 2007. By April 2008, every community will have its own neighbourhood policing team.</p>
	<p pid="a.2128W.0/2">Neighbourhood policing is about local policing teams being genuinely visible and responsive to people, and dealing effectively with the crime and antisocial behaviour that concerns them. A key part of neighbourhood policing is that everyone will know their local policing team, and be able to contact them easily by telephone or by email. The Government are supporting the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, not only through general police grant, but also through specific funding around police community support officers (PCSOs). This will total around &pound;222 million this year and includes an additional &pound;91 million announced in the Budget to accelerate numbers of PCSOs to 16,000 by April 2007 (around 11,500 outside London). This will increase the pace of the roll-out of neighbourhood policing overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.2132W.2/1">The average estimated cost of employing a police officer (sergeant and constable) in 2005 was approximately &pound;45,500. This estimate includes all pay related costs including overtime payments and employer national insurance contributions. It also makes an allowance for notional employer pension contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2132W.2/2">Salary and other terms and conditions for police community support officers (PCSOs), as with all police (civilian) staff are determined by the respective police authority. We do not routinely maintain data on PCSO salaries. The most recent data we have on PCSO salary costs and allowances is contained in a report by Accenture on terms and conditions for PCSOs, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-03">3 February</phrase>. The report provides a range of data on basic pay rates and allowances from 2004-05 paid to PCSOs and an analysis of the variations between forces. The report found that the typical (unweighted) average salary for PCSOs was &pound;17,200 and the average total cash reward (basic salary plus allowances and overtime) was &pound;20,500. The report is available on the Home Office website:</p>

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's report &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; made plain deficiencies in the capability and capacity across the country for providing protective services which need to be addressed. The status quo is not an option and it is for this reason that we are now working with police forces, police authorities and HMIC to explore new ways for them to work together to improve those services.</p>

	<p pid="a.2141W.0/1">The programme is restricted to the six prisoners in the Close Supervision Centre. The CSC system holds the most dangerous, difficult and disruptive prisoners in prison custody. Payments made are not solely for leisure purposes but cover a range of constructive activities including education, contact with the mental health nurse, gardening, the workshop, cleaning and cooking with a tutor. The programme commenced with the opening of the Whitemoor CSC unit in October 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.0/2">The aim of the programme is to encourage prisoners to engage in purposeful and rewarding activity and to reintegrate prisoners back into the main prison system as a step towards encouraging them to address their offending behaviour. The maximum sum a prisoner may earn is &pound;2 per day or &pound;14 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.0/3">Whitemoor is one of three prisons in England and Wales containing CSC units. The other two are Wakefield and Woodhill prisons. Each unit is designed to deal with a specific type of CSC prisoner and provides a range of activities designed to meet their needs accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.2142W.12/1">Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides a power for the Home Secretary to proscribe an organisation which he believes is concerned in terrorism. This is done by adding the organisation to Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 which lists proscribed organisations. An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism. This power was extended by section 21 of the Terrorism Act 2006 to include those organisations which glorify the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism. Glorification includes any form of praise or celebration of acts of terrorism. When deciding on whether to make an Order proscribing a group a number of additional factors are taken into account and these were published in 2001. They are the nature and scale of an organisation's activities, the specific threat that it poses to the United Kingdom, the specific threat that it poses to British national overseas, the organisations presence in the United Kingdom and the need to support other members of the international community in their fight against terrorism.</p>

During this time the Home Office's five year race and diversity programme introduced a series of activities aimed at tackling inappropriate behaviours in the workplace. This has included a re-launch of mandatory diversity training (which incorporates modules on challenging bullying, harassment and discrimination within the workplace) and the introduction of tests for prejudicial attitudes and behaviours in assessment centres. The Home Office's five year race and diversity programme was launched in July 2004. The programme is led by a board of senior civil servants drawn from across the Home Office group.</p>

This is broken down as requested. Data for 2005 will be available in the autumn. In addition to this, the penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme, brought into effect in all police forces in England and Wales in 2004, gives the police powers to issue fixed penalty notices to persons aged 16-17 believed to be committing offences of drunkenness. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. Data on the number of PNDs issued to 16-17 year olds for under-age drinking in 2004, as well as provisional data for 2005, are also provided broken down by region.
