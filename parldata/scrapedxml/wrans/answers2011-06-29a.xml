	<p pid="a.783W.6/2">The Renewable Fuels Agency's second annual report to Parliament on the impacts of the renewable transport fuels obligation (RTFO) is available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/3"><a href="http://www.renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk/sites/rfa/files/Year_Two_RTFO_v2.pdf">http://www.renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk/sites/rfa/files/Year_Two_RTFO_v2.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/4">This report covers the period April 2009 to April 2010 and includes verified data of biofuel supplied in the UK by country of origin and land use, where known, and reports the performance of biofuels supplied in the UK in respect of annual greenhouse gas emissions savings. No estimate is made of the amount of land expected to be used for biofuel production in the UK in the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/5">The RTFO unit in the Department for Transport now administers the RTFO. The RTFO unit produce statistics on biofuels containing unverified data related biofuel performance which are available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/6"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/biofuels/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/biofuels/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/7">The renewable energy directive (RED) requires the UK to ensure that 10% of energy consumed in transport comes from renewable sources by 2020 and that biofuels used towards this target meet a number of mandatory sustainability criteria. These include that biofuels must deliver a greenhouse gas saving of at least 35%, rising to 50% in 2017 and to 60%, for biofuels from new plants, in 2018.</p>
	<p pid="a.783W.6/8">In January this year, as required by the RED, my Department provided a report on the regional level estimates of greenhouse gas emissions arising from cultivation of biofuels feedstocks in the UK. The report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.783W.6/10">In January this year a report prepared by a cross-Whitehall group of officials (the Global Food Markets Group) titled &#8220;Agricultural price spikes 2007/2008: Causes and policy implications&#8221; was published. The report considered the causes of the 2008 food price spike and concluded that biofuels were not a particularly significant driver, with other factors such as the price of oil and adverse weather conditions being greater contributors. It is archived at:</p>

	<p pid="a.783W.6/12">Under the RED, the European Commission must monitor and report every two years on the impact of biofuel policy and increased demand for biofuel on social sustainability. This will include reporting on the availability of foodstuffs at affordable prices.</p>

While the RED does allow for the use of renewable hydrogen to meet this target, there is not currently a methodology in place for calculating the contribution of hydrogen from renewable sources. However, the directive does require the European Commission to come forward with a proposal for such a method by <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-31">31 December 2011</phrase>.</p>

In that consultation paper we did not propose any amendment to the RTFO to allow renewable hydrogen to be eligible for renewable transport fuel certificates but proposed to keep this issue under review as the European Commission develops a methodology to account for renewable hydrogen.</p>

	<p pid="a.795W.2/1">The Work Capability Assessment (WCA) was developed in consultation with medical and other experts alongside specialist disability groups. A department led review of the Work Capability Assessment recommended a number of changes to the WCA. These came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-28">28 March 2011</phrase> and are expected to more accurately assess mental, intellectual and cognitive function with a corresponding small increase in support group numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/2">Recognising that particular concerns have been raised in relation to how the WCA works for people with mental health conditions, Professor Harrington has asked leading charities, including Mind, Mencap and the National Autistic Society, to make recommendations to refine the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors used in the WCA as part of his second independent review.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/3">Additionally, in response to one of Professor Harrington's recommendations in his first review, we have introduced mental, cognitive and intellectual 'champions' into Atos assessment centres to spread best practise in these areas. We are also empowering and improving training for Jobcentre Plus decision makers to put them back at the heart of this system.</p>
	<p pid="a.795W.2/4">We will continue to review and refine the assessment in the light of experience of its use in practice, as part of a process of continuous improvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.800W.5/1">The welfare of farmed rabbits is already provided for by way of the general provisions of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which make it an offence to cause suffering to an animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals. This means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to ensure the animal's welfare needs are met. In addition, the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 lays down requirements in respect of general welfare, inspection, housing and feeding for all farm animals and includes a section specifically to protect the welfare of rabbits.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.5/2">One of the key welfare concerns associated with rabbit farming is space allowance and existing legislation covers this. It is a requirement that all rabbits must be kept in hutches or cages of sufficient size to allow the rabbits to move around and to feed and drink without difficulty and to allow them all to lie on their sides at the same time; and of sufficient height to allow the rabbits to sit upright on all four feet without their ears touching the top of the hutch or cage.</p>
	<p pid="a.800W.5/3">DEFRA has a welfare code for rabbits which provides good husbandry advice, which producers have by law to be familiar with and have access to.</p>

	<p pid="a.812W.2/1">Recategorisation of prisoners and allocating them to appropriate prisons is vital to sentence management. The correct category ensures that prisoners are held in appropriately secure conditions, and subsequent allocation helps prisoners to use their sentences constructively, to tackle their offending behaviour and reduce the risks of re-offending on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.2/2">Prisoners must be held in the lowest security category consistent with managing risk. The decision to recategorise a prisoner is taken only after a full and thorough risk assessment which includes consideration of the likelihood of escape and the subsequent risk of harm to the public should they do so. When a prisoner is being considered for allocation to open conditions, where the victim lives should form part of the consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.2/3">Under the statutory victim contact scheme operated by Probation Trusts, by virtue of section 35 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, victims of certain serious sexual or violent crimes where the offender has been sentenced to 12 months imprisonment or more may elect to receive information about key developments in the offender's sentence. This includes notification that a prisoner is being considered for a move to a lower security prison, and the outcome.</p>

These figures represent the numbers of claims leading to orders being made rather than the numbers of orders as they are more accurate, removing the double-counting of instances where a single claim leads to more than one order. They also provide a more meaningful measure of the number of homeowners who are subject to court repossession actions.

	<p pid="a.818W.6/1">Following the merger of the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-18">18 April 2005</phrase>, HMRC no longer use the specific title of 'tax inspector'. Instead, since the formation of HMRC all staff are known as &#8216;officers of Revenue and Customs&#8217;. The Department does not therefore keep or forecast information on numbers of tax inspectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.818W.6/2">Compliance functions previously carried out by tax inspectors are spread across the staff profile of various parts of the Department. The compliance effort throughout the SR period will be bolstered by redeployment and recruitment, including graduate recruitment, and supported by targeted training on a modular basis according to the needs of the individual and their job role.</p>

	<p pid="a.819W.2/1">HMRC no longer uses the term &#8216;Tax Inspector&#8217; but training for its staff consists of various modules from the Tax Professional Qualifications Catalogue which equip them with the skills and knowledge to tackle evasion and avoidance. The salary and miscellaneous budgets allocated to the team responsible for the design, development and delivery of the tax learning packages in question total &#163;7.36 million for 2011-12. This represents 0.2% of the total HMRC budget and does not include the salary costs of trainees. There is a rolling programme to identify and address staff learning needs using this modular approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.823W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.6/2">The Government strongly supports the Dublin Regulation (&#8220;Dublin II&#8221;). The Regulation ensures that just one member state&#8212;generally the first one in which the individual claimed asylum or entered unlawfully&#8212;is responsible for considering an asylum claim made in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.6/3">This makes it more difficult to abuse asylum processes in the EU by making multiple claims in different member states, or by delaying an asylum claim until the individual has reached his or her preferred destination. It also provides certainty for the asylum seeker by ensuring that a specific member state is obliged to consider his or her claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.6/4">Between 2006 and 2010, the UK removed 6,034 people to other member states under the Dublin Regulation and accepted 1,849 transfers from other member states. These figures are based on management information that is not quality assured under National Statistics protocols. The figures do not constitute part of the National Statistics and should be treated as provisional.</p>

	<p pid="a.824W.0/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office takes information security very seriously and has measures in place to meet the risks posed from visual display units (VDUs) being overlooked, both in the office environment and when working remotely. Specific measures include a requirement for all staff to adhere to the relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the ICT equipment they have been authorised to use, including mobility devices. The department's VDUs are programmed to go into &#8216;hibernation&#8217; if not activated within a short period of time; staff are instructed not to leave their units switched on when away from their desks; screens may be &#8216;anonomised&#8217; where considered necessary for those working inside and away from the office. If staff need to work remotely and view information that is sensitive, they must ensure that they cannot be overlooked. &#8216;Privacy screen panels&#8217; are available to mitigate the risk of &#8220;shoulder surfing&#8221;. The need to ensure visual data security is considered as part of any office accommodation moves.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.0/2">Staff are trained in all aspects of data handling and security in a variety of ways including: annual completion of mandatory &#8216;protecting information&#8217; training, induction courses; regular briefing and other training events; articles on departmental intranet sites and; ad hoc reminders as and when considered necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.825W.2/2">The UK supports the changes made in the amending regulation on Frontex, on which political agreement has been reached. It will be formally adopted in plenary by the European Parliament in early autumn 2011 and by the Council shortly after. We believe that the amending Regulation will help improve joint patrolling arrangements in the Mediterranean sea by giving Frontex more control over where member states' technical equipment and human resources are deployed. The amending Frontex Regulation also gives Frontex a mandate to process personal data in the course of its operational activities of persons suspected of people trafficking and smuggling, under condition that it is lawful, necessary and proportionate in relation to the tasks of the Agency; and to pass this data to Europol for their action. We expect this to be a significant improvement in the fight against human trafficking and other forms of cross-border criminality.</p>

Work is also progressing on the four pilot projects in Cumbria, North Yorkshire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, and Highlands and Islands. My Department is working with the local authorities in the remaining areas in England and with the three devolved Administrations to progress their broadband plans. There will shortly be an announcement of the indicative allocations for county areas in England and the devolved Administrations, to help them focus their broadband plans. In the case of the devolved Administrations they have, by agreement with my Department, adopted responsibility for co-ordinating broadband plans within their areas of administrative responsibility. My Department will, however, continue to work closely with all authorities and has already made available an online resource centre, and is developing a framework procurement contract which will be open to all authorities to use and will help minimise the number of procurements, and has also assembled an experienced team to assist the delivery of our broadband objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.0/2">The recent Defence Academy visit to the US was part of the annual advanced command and staff course (ACSC) delivered by the Academy. ACSC attendees have been visiting the US for the last 10 years to examine the provenance and current status of security challenges in the USA, consider how the USA pursues its own security and provide a context for UK and international students' future work with the US military in coalition operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/3">A total of 320 students and staff from the ACSC took part in the visit which was a week long and included US Defence establishments in Washington and Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.0/4">Although the final cost of the visit has not been calculated at this stage because some bills are still outstanding, the cost to the Ministry of Defence is not expected to exceed &#163;465,000. This figure covers food, accommodation, air and road transport. These costs are offset in part by income received from those overseas students, who pay to attend the course.</p>

	<p pid="a.836W.3/1">Traditionally, we mark the anniversary of the conclusion of a conflict rather than its beginning. However, given the importance of the centenary of the great war, it is likely that a number of anniversaries of key events from 2014 to 2018, including the beginning of the war, will be marked in an appropriate way. Government consideration of how such events will be remembered is in its early stages and we in the Ministry of Defence are in discussion with colleagues in other Government Departments on this. In time, these discussions will extend to the Belgian and French Governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.849W.6/1">Biomass generators reported to Ofgem that some 2.14 million tonnes of wood were combusted for energy in 2009-10. This total consists of those feedstocks identified by generators as being sourced from forestry wood, recycled wood, wood and miscanthus blend, or unspecified wood. Figures for 2010-11 are expected to be published by Ofgem during the summer. Comparable information is not available before April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.6/2">Regarding the total subsidies provided for biomass (both wood and non wood sources) under the renewables obligation (RO) I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-03-10.1294"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1294W</phrase>, regarding incentives for biomass projects between 2002-03 to 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.6/3">The number of ROCs issued in 2010-11 is not yet confirmed by Ofgem but preliminary reports suggest just under 10 million renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) were issued for all biomass technologies under the RO last year (ie dedicated, CHP, co-firing, landfill gas, sewage gas and advanced conversion technologies). The value of the 2010-11 RO buyout price is &#163;36.99 giving a total value of some &#163;370 million for 2010-11 biomass generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.6/4">In terms of future subsidies, we anticipate that new dedicated biomass capacity in 2011-12 could result in an additional 0.8 million ROCs of support, increasing to around 3.2 million ROCs in 2012-13. Assuming the same ROC value as 2010-11, this would represent additional support of &#163;29.6 million in 2011-12 and &#163;118.4 million in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.6/5">It is not possible to estimate the total support that will be provided to biomass under the RO beyond April 2013. RO support rates for biomass electricity from April 2013-March 2017 will be decided later this year, following consultation this summer. Biomass electricity generators can also benefit from support under forthcoming electricity market reform arrangements.</p>

For this project I understand that Cuadrilla anticipate using approximately 1,600 cubic metres of water for each hydraulic fracture operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.857W.12/1">Preliminary findings from the 2009-10 British Crime Survey (BCS) &#8216;Drug Misuse Declared&#8217; report (based on six months data) showed that 1.2% of young people aged 16 to 24-years-old used &#8216;Spice&#8217; in the last year (or another synthetic cannabinoid), 1.4% used BZP (Benzylpiperazine) and 0.5% used GBL/GHB (Gammabutyrolactone/Gammahydroxybutrate).</p>
	<p pid="a.857W.12/2">It is important to note that these substances were brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in December 2009, part way through the reporting period. The results were published in July 2010 and are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.857W.12/5">The Home Office has not commissioned or evaluated any research on the effects on users of any new psychoactive substances (termed &#8216;legal highs&#8217;). The Home Office has requested that the Advisory Council Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) consider a number of individual new psychoactive substances (and where appropriate, the family of related substances). The ACMD reports have made an assessment of the harms of these substances to users based on available evidence as well as recommendation for their control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and can be found at:</p>

The transitional arrangements to which that reply referred are concerned specifically with access to the labour market. The labour market restrictions currently applied to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals may be extended to the end of 2013 if to do otherwise would result in serious labour market disturbance. The Government have asked the Migration Advisory Committee to review the labour market case for maintaining the restrictions and it will be appropriate for the Committee to consider any representations which are relevant to its terms of reference.</p>

The Home Office is working closely with the police (through the ACPO Metal Theft Working Group) to tackle this criminality and to reduce the stolen goods market that drives it. We are currently exploring what other action can be taken to reduce metal theft.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.3/1">The national health service has a proud history when it comes to innovation and is recognised as a leader in the development of innovative techniques and technologies&#8212;stretching back across its 63-year history. However, whilst the NHS is recognised as a world leader at invention, the spread of those innovations within the NHS has often been too slow, and sometimes even the best of them fail to achieve widespread use.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/2">As United Kingdom public services face a tougher financial climate, innovation has a vital role to play to continue improving the quality of care for patients, and support the NHS as a major investor and wealth creator in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/3">This is why in the plan for growth we announced that the NHS chief executive would review how the adoption and diffusion of innovations could be accelerated across the NHS. Working in consultation with industry, academia and other interested parties the NHS chief executive will produce a report in November 2011 that will inform the strategic approach to innovation in the modernised NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/4">However, there is already a substantial amount of work underway to create conditions for innovation to flourish including; Regional Innovation Funds to innovation in front line staff, Innovative Technology Adoption Procurement programme to encourage NHS-wide adoption of high impact innovative medical technologies NHS innovation challenge prizes to reward ideas that tackle big health and challenges now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/5">We also know that adoption is dependent on a culture that embraces innovation, the coalitions modernisation agenda will encourage an NHS that is more agile, more dynamic, more open to ideas and better at adopting new technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/6">Subject to legislation, the NHS Commissioning Board will have new legal duties to promote research and innovation in the NHS. This will enable the NHS to fulfil its role in delivering better healthcare outcomes and to act as an engine for economic growth. It will achieve this by supporting development and adoption of new healthcare or health service related technologies, techniques and processes, whilst providing a market for the new products and services and supporting business, especially small to medium enterprises, to deliver this.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/7">The Government have also committed an additional &#163;10 million over the next two years to small business research initiative to address healthcare challenges, make it easier for firms, and small firms in particular, to access the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.3/8">However, we need to go further and faster if we are to effectively address significant challenges facing health and social care&#8212;now and in the future. Innovation is an essential tool in helping address the challenges of an ageing population, chronic disease, health inequalities and rising public expectations&#8212;especially when resources are constrained.</p>

	<p pid="a.876W.5/1">Audited 2010-11 data on primary care trust (PCT) redundancy payments is not yet available. Figures will be available once the NHS (England) Summarised Accounts are audited, signed and laid before Parliament in late July.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.5/2">The Impact Assessments (IA) published alongside the Health and Social Care Bill in January 2011, copies of which have already been placed in the Library, estimated the costs of modernising the NHS and reducing administration costs. This included the redundancy costs associated with reducing the size of the workforce. The redundancy cost estimates include redundancy payments, pay in lieu of notice and payments to pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.5/3">The cost estimate associated with these redundancies was in the range of &#163;772 million to &#163;1,288 million in PCTs and strategic health authorities (SHAs).</p>
	<p pid="a.876W.5/4">There is no central money set aside for redundancy costs in PCTs and SHAs. The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12 requires PCTs to hold 2% of their revenue allocation to support the costs of change, including the redundancy costs associated with modernising the NHS. This equates to &#163;1,600 million in 2011-12 and, potentially, a similar sum in 2012-13. Not all of this resource will be required for redundancy costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.877W.6/1">Expert opinion has suggested that 30%, of breast cancer patients would benefit from a simple form of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). A trial is underway to establish the evidence base for the use of IMRT to treat breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.6/2">&#8220;The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12&#8221; sets out that, to improve outcomes from radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients, commissioners should develop local plans to ensure that access rates to radiotherapy and the use of advanced radiotherapy techniques, such as IMRT, are appropriate for their populations. The National Cancer Action Team has been working with providers to support the development of IMRT services and, at this time, 20 of the 28 cancer networks have at least one provider offering IMRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.6/3">It is anticipated that national currencies for radiotherapy and IMRT will be introduced for contracting in April 2012, with prices agreed locally. Feedback from the service on the use of these currencies will inform decisions on when it would be appropriate to introduce a mandatory national tariff, which is likely to be no earlier than 2013-14.</p>
	<p pid="a.877W.6/4">The Radiotherapy Clinical Information Group will publish a report on the first full year of radiotherapy data collection shortly. This will show the progress made on the collection of IMRT data as part of the National Radiotherapy Dataset.</p>

	<p pid="a.880W.3/1">UK support over the next four years will stop 10 million more children going hungry in countries with a high burden of malnutrition in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. A growing portfolio of nutrition-related programmes will focus on reaching pregnant women and children under the age of five. Programmes include treatment for severe acutely malnourished children and prevention for example by providing support for breastfeeding and nutrition supplements. Other programmes address the underlying causes of undernutrition, such as lack of access to food, via cash transfer and agriculture programmes. A research programme will address evidence gaps on the most cost-effective solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.880W.3/2">The UK wants an effective international response to tackle undernutrition and is active in the Scaling Up Nutrition initiative (SUN). SUN supports countries to develop their own comprehensive nutrition programmes aimed at tackling undernutrition in the first &quot;1000 days&quot; from conception to child's second birthday.</p>

	<p pid="a.886W.8/2">The Government have already taken steps to enable more 16 to 18-year-olds to access further education and training. In Barnsley, the majority of 16 and 17-year-olds are already participating in education and work based education or training: 79% at the end of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.8/3">The process of offering 16 and 17-year-olds a suitable place in education or training by the end of September, which has been known as the 'September Guarantee', will continue. In Barnsley 97.8% of 16 and 17-year-olds received such an offer in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.8/4">We are funding more education and training places than ever before, which is a very high priority as we prepare for raising the participation age to 17 in 2013 and 18 by 2015. In total we will be funding over 1.3 million places in schools, colleges and other providers and a further 230,000 apprenticeship places during the 2011/12 academic year. This is sufficient to provide a place in education or training for every young person who wants one. In Barnsley, 16-18 school and further education providers have been allocated funding to support a further 267 student places in 2011/12 than this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.8/5">From September 2011, those young people who are facing genuine financial barriers to participation in education or training post 16 will be able to apply for financial support from the new &#163;180 million 16-19 Bursary Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.886W.8/6">Local authorities will retain their statutory duty to encourage, enable or assist young people's participation in education or training. Using funding from the new Early Intervention Grant, they will be able to intervene early with those who are at risk of disengagement and provide the tailored support that young people in their area need to engage.</p>

	<p pid="a.888W.2/1">We have had a number of discussions at official level, which highlighted the very mixed view on the effectiveness of admissions forum. Some have said they are very useful and always quorate, other local authorities have found the forums to be costly and unproductive. As was made clear during the Commons stages of the Education Bill, we are not proposing the abolition of admission forums. Instead, clause 34 of the Education Bill would remove the mandate on every local authority to set up an admissions forum, leaving the local authority and their communities to decide what groups are most appropriate for their circumstances. This does not reduce parental voice in the admission system. Parents will still have the right to be consulted on admission arrangements, to object to any they consider are not compliant with the code, and they retain the right to appeal against a decision not to offer them a place at one of their preferred schools.</p>
