	<p pid=".2W.2/1">Pollution is tightly regulated under a range of legislation. For example, industrial activities with a significant polluting potential must prevent or minimise emissions by applying the ''Best Available Techniques'', in accordance with the new Pollution Prevention and Control regime (The Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000). Where polluters are prosecuted in the Courts, any fines that might be imposed are paid to the Exchequer. These payments are not ring-fenced for environmental improvement purposes but imposed by the Courts as a penalty. The Courts can also order payment of regulators' costs.</p>
	<p pid=".2W.2/2">As regards the Pollution Prevention and Control regime, in line with the ''polluter pays'' principle, polluting companies are required to meet the cost of any necessary improvements and fees in relation to the cost of regulation. There is also a provision under the Pollution Prevention and Control legislation enabling regulators, in certain circumstances, to require operators to prevent or remedy the effects of pollution at their own expense and to recover the costs where the regulator itself arranges for the work to be done.</p>

It would be premature for the Commission to make any long-term decision about the appropriate cost of catering services until the extent of these changes has become apparent and the Finance and Services Committee has considered these matters. No doubt my hon. Friend, as a member of the Committee, will contribute fully to that consideration.</p>

However, since June 2001, the total amount spent on focus group research in respect of road safety campaigns is #112k. The companies which have carried out this research for the Department are Abbot Mead Vickers BBDO, Andrew Irving Associates, Carne Martin, Cragg Ross Dawson, Ruth Foulds Qualitative Research, and Campbell Keegan.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.0/1">As part of the development work for Transport Direct Sustrans undertook a piece of research to look at how cycling could be incorporated into a journey planner. The research highlighted difficulties in doing this on a national scale. The biggest issue is the lack of cycling information being held electronically, cycle routes need to be geo-coded, and these codes need to be held in frequently updated databases to be used successfully in journey planners. Transport Direct does aim to include cycling, but due to the problems outlined above this may have to wait until later versions.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.0/2">The Executive Summary and a link to the full paper (which is on the Sustrans website) has been placed on the Department's website <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/itwp/transdirect/cyclene/index.htm">www.dft.gov.uk/itwp/transdirect/cyclene/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".15W.0/3">The recommendations outlined in the report highlighted work needed to progress this issue. The Department will be working with other bodies, including local authorities, Sustrans and other cycling bodies to progress the issues discussed above.</p>

	<p pid=".15W.3/1">Local authorities with decriminalised parking enforcement (DPE) powers may issue penalty charge notices in the case of vehicles parked in contravention of bus lanes. Use of surplus income from parking penalty charge notices is governed by the provisions of section 55 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

The main consultation document indicates in paragraphs 7.10 to 7.15 the type and scale of rail infrastructure that would be needed to connect the Heathrow airport option to the wider rail network. The analysis has not attempted to identify the precise location and design of these connections. However, our intention is for the aviation White Paper to contain proposals for improved surface access to Heathrow whether or not a further runway is provided. The level of financial support the Government might make available depends on: the likely net benefit to non-airport rail users; negotiations to maximise funding from aviation; and, the extent to which any public sector contribution would divert funding from other SRA priorities.</p>

The impact of Ten Year Plan measures is generally expected to be greater in the second half of the period, because of the time needed for major capital projects to come on-stream.</p>

	<p pid=".20W.2/1">The Highways Agency led the development of concrete vehicle containment barriers in the UK. The bulk of this work was completed by the early 1990s. This supported the use of concrete barriers in road widening schemes, where space was at a premium. The Agency has subsequently undertaken further research and development to refine the systems. Concrete barriers have been promoted as one of the options acceptable to the Highways Agency in tender documents for new work.</p>
	<p pid=".20W.2/2">The Agency has also recently contributed with industry towards the costs of investigating the procurement practices in mainland Europe where concrete barriers appear to be used more extensively. Further research is also examining whole life benefits and costs of all vehicle safety barriers to gain a better understanding of the whole life performance of the different types of barrier. There is some evidence that concrete barriers have higher performance characteristics that could be of benefit in particular locations.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.3/1">The Strategic Rail Authority's fares regime for London commuter operators&mdash;the Fares Incentive Adjustment Payment regime (FIAP)&mdash;links permitted fares increases to operators' performance over the previous 12 months. FIAP allows for a variation on the national cap (RPI&ndash;1 per cent.) of up to 2 per cent. to reflect improved performance and minus 2 per cent. to reflect deterioration in performance.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.3/2">In the year to <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-31">31 July 2002</phrase> the number of trains arriving on time for most London operators, including South West Trains, improved significantly when compared with the preceding 12 months. This improvement means that the cap on these operators' regulated fares from January 2003 has been set at RPI-1 per cent. The SRA is currently reviewing the fares regime for London operators as part of its policy review of fares regulation. It will make recommendations to Ministers in due course. Any changes in policy will be introduced in 2004.</p>

The International Air Transport Association publishes recommendations on conditions of carriage, applying to international flights provided by member airlines (Recommended Practice 1724). Following the intervention of the UK Office of Fair Trading, changes were made to RP 1724 in September 2000, principally extending the rights of passengers who, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to use a purchased ticket. This recommendation is not, however, binding on carriers and does not apply to domestic flights.</p>

In June 2002 the Commission published a consultation paper on airline conditions of carriage. This includes a proposal to require all EU airlines to apply conditions of carriage similar to those in the amended RP 1724.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.6/3">Many European airlines, including all significant full service UK airlines, have signed up to a set of voluntary commitments on passenger service. These include a commitment to allow telephone reservations to be held or cancelled without commitment or penalty within 24 hours, and a commitment to provide prompt refunds where a passenger claims and is entitled to a refund.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.8/1">The Government takes the problem of the use of unlicensed and untaxed vehicles on the United Kingdom's road seriously and is pursuing a wide range of initiatives to deal with the problem. We are currently developing proposals for the reform and modernisation of vehicle registration and licensing, to reduce evasion and to bear down on vehicle crime. In response to the recommendations of a report commissioned by my Department from the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science&mdash;a copy of which was placed in the Library in June 2002&mdash;we have established a Modernising Vehicle Registration Implementation Board (MVRIB), including representatives of motorists' organisations, the motor trade, the police and the insurance industry to advise on and develop those proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.8/2">The 2002 Finance Act contained provisions under which the responsibility for licensing and taxing vehicles will be placed on the registered keeper, who will remain liable for doing so until such time that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has properly been notified of a change of keeper. These proposals will mean that it is not necessary for a vehicle to be detected on the road for effective enforcement action to take place. The implementation of these new powers is at the heart of MVRIB's agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.8/3">Detection of unlicensed vehicles on the public road is currently carried out by police and traffic wardens, who pass offence reports to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for enforcement action. Last year 800,000 offenders were brought to book, bringing in #110m in fines, penalties and relicensing revenue. Since 1997 a nationwide scheme has been operating to wheelclamp and impound untaxed vehicles seen on the public road. Over 100,000 vehicles have been clamped since the scheme started. The scheme has been a success and we are looking to increase the level of wheelclamping across the country. A pilot scheme has proved the feasibility of local authorities using DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and impound untaxed vehicles. Following a succesful pilot in the London Borough of Newham, this is being rolled out to local authorities that wish to join the scheme. In addition, mobile digital camera technology has been introduced to detect untaxed moving vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.8/4">DVLA is also working closely with other enforcement agencies in schemes to target both unlicensed and abandoned vehicles, in particular through Operation Cubit, a joint operation between DVLA, the police, fire service and local authorities which removes offending vehicles from the road immediately, and has been run in a number of locations including Kent, Hastings, Brighton, Liverpool, Belfast and Cleveland.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.6/1">Largely as a result of the global economic slowdown and falls in commodity prices, the prospect of most HIPC countries exiting the process with sustainable debt are poor, unless they are provided with further relief. The UK has successfully pressed for the provision of additional relief at Completion Point, but the present arrangement still does not provide a generous enough level of debt relief to those countries with unsustainable debts. We are continuing to press for a more systematic approach to topping up to bring all countries back to a sustainable debt level at Completion Point, so that no country will exit the HIPC process with unsustainable debts.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.6/2">Additional financing will be required to meet the costs of topping up. At their Summit in Kananaskis, last July, G8 leaders agreed to provide their share of up to an additional US$1 billion for the HIPC Trust Fund. This will not only help meet the current shortfall in the financing of the Initiative, but will also ensure that there are sufficient funds available to finance the additional debt relief required at Completion Point. At the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF last month, the international community reconfirmed their commitment to the implementation of the HIPC Initiative, and its full financing. Some donors, including the UK took the opportunity to pledge their firm support for the HIPC Trust Fund. The UK announced a bilateral contribution of US$95 million plus its share of any EDF contribution to the Trust Fund. This is in addition to the US$306 million that we have already committed. We hope that other donors will be able to announce their contributions this week.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.3/1">After the fall of the Taliban the Afghan Interim Administration adopted a tough line on drugs: in January they introduced a ban on drugs production, trafficking and processing, and in April implemented a compensated eradication programme. The Afghan authorities estimate that approximately 16,500 hectares of poppy fields were destroyed. This equates to 76 tonnes of heroin, which is approximately three times the UK's annual consumption and worth around #5 billion at UK street level prices. But poppies continue to be cultivated.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.3/2">Eradication alone will not solve Afghanistan's drug problem. The sustained elimination of opium poppy cultivation will require long-term international support for the building up of Afghan drug law enforcement and the provision of licit livelihoods for poppy farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.6/1">In his speech of <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-10">10 June</phrase> to Parliament, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary referred to the link between ISID and certain terrorist organisations. We are encouraged by the banning of five such terrorist organisations in Pakistan. Our concerns about cross-border infiltration have been raised regularly with the Pakistanis, including during the Foreign Secretary's 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2002-07-20">20 July</phrase> visit to Islamabad and when he met Pakistani Foreign Minister Inam ul-Haq on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-16">16 September</phrase> in the margins of the UN General Assembly. The Pakistanis have reassured us that President Musharraf's pledge that there will be no movement across the Line of Control still stands and the Pakistani Army are doing all they can to stop infiltration. A permanent end to cross-border infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir are critical to a sustained and substantive dialogue leading towards a lasting settlement of the Kashmir issue.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/2">We welcome the recent announcements by both India and Pakistan of the phased withdrawal of a significant number of troops from the International Border. We hope that his will be followed by further de-escalatory steps and a resumption of dialogue.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.6/3">We are aware of regular allegations of ISI involvement in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.7/3">We are determined to encourage more people from under-represented groups to enter higher education. Through the Excellence Challenge we are spending #190 million over 3 years to raise the attainment and aspirations of young people in some of the most deprived areas of the country. Our AimHigher campaign, which includes a roadshow for schools and colleges in Excellence Challenge areas is promoting the benefits of higher education. We have also introduced significant extra financial help for students who need it, including increasing Access and Hardship Funds fourfold, a child care grant and a travel books and equipment grant for student parents, and, as part of the Excellence Challenge, we have introduced Opportunity Bursaries for young people from low income backgrounds. We have also significantly increased support for part-time students through fee waivers and loans. Additionally the Higher Education Funding Council for England also provides significant funding for widening participation including the postcode premium for institutions which they increased to #41 million this year. Their funding for widening participation totals about #180 million in 2002&ndash;03, including student support.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.2/2">Capital funding for FE colleges is not paid on a cost per student basis, so unit cost figures are not available. Where capital investment is needed for expansion of places, colleges can apply to the Learning and Skills Council for separate capital grants for specific projects. They may also fund capital from revenue funding for students, through borrowing, and through Private Finance Initiative projects. Funding for the Further Education sector included no ear-marked capital in 1997&ndash;98; we plan to provide over #250 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".39W.2/3">The Higher Education Funding Council for England provides capital funding for a variety of purposes, for example for improving poor estates, and providing access for students with disabilities. Higher education institutions are invited to bid for this funding. If capital investment is needed for the expansion of student places, higher education institutions are expected to fund this from recurrent grant, reserves, from charities, endowments or other gifts, through PPP/PFI projects or through borrowing. Our planned funding for the Higher Education sector included ear-marked capital of #256 million in 2001&ndash;02, rising to #364 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.5/1">Use of animals for research is regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. This specifies that non-human primates can only be used where there are no alternatives. In addition to regulatory testing to help ensure the safety of medicines, non-human primates are also used for other important areas of fundamental research. For example they contribute to programmes of work relating to Parkinson's disease, visual impairment, stroke, diabetes, disorders of reproduction and vaccine development. Non-human primates were used in only 0.15 per cent. of regulated scientific procedures in 2001.

	<p pid=".41W.0/1">In introducing the new funding system we want it to reflect better authorities' differing circumstances and needs. All the options are based on evidence that suggests that authorities with significant deprivation, and in particular poverty, need to spend significantly more to achieve the same results for their children. There are two options in which the main indicator for deprivation&mdash;the number of children of parents on income support&mdash;is supplemented by the numbers of children of parents in receipt of Working Families' Tax Credit. This picks up those children whose parents are in low paid work, and its aim is to reflect a wider definition of poverty. The distributional impact of the options is set out in the consultation document issued on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-08">8 July</phrase> by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.9/1">The reasons for the Ministerial Direction on the Roll-On Roll-Off ferry (RORO) Strategic Sealift are as follows. In October 2000, AWSR Shipping Ltd were selected as the preferred bidder in the PFI competition to provide the Ministry of Defence with a strategic sealift service of six ships. Their bid involved subcontracts with the German company Flensburger for four ships and Harland &amp; Wolff for two. The bid had the particular advantage of early delivery. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, (Mr. Hoon) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-09">9 March 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-03-09.359"><i>Official Report</i>, column 359W</phrase>, to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> difficulties arose in the detailed commercial arrangements which could have threatened the timely completion of the PFI negotiations and early delivery of the service to the MOD. My right hon. Friend, Mr. Hoon, therefore decided that the MOD would take over the commercial shipbuilding contract with H&amp;W, as part of the overall PFI arrangements. The contract would be managed by AWSR and on delivery of the ships to them, AWSR would provide the full six ship service on PFI terms.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.9/2">This approach was not foreseen as part of the original PFI deal and officials were concerned about the potential risks to the MOD arising from the decision. Ministers judged that, on balance, these risks were outweighed by the risk of losing the benefits of the original AWSR bid involving H&amp;W, including timely delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.9/3">The procedures surrounding Ministerial Directions and the responsibilities of Accounting Officers in this area are set out in the Accounting Officer Memorandum. The Memorandum requires an Accounting Officer in receipt of a Direction from a Minister to comply with his instructions. The Accounting Officer is then required to inform the Treasury of what has occurred and should communicate the papers to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) without delay. On receipt of such material it is for the C&amp;AG to determine what action to take. These procedures exist to protect the relationship between Ministers and officials while at the same time enabling the C&amp;AG to consider, on behalf of Parliament, whether further investigation is required.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.9/4">The circumstances surrounding the RORO Direction were duly communicated to the Comptroller and Auditor General and we understand that the C&amp;AG subsequently conveyed them to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. As the established procedures have been correctly followed, I am withholding the advice tendered by my Accounting Officer on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-08">8 March 2001</phrase> in accordance with Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, relating to internal discussion and advice.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.6/1">The Armed Forces role during any strike by firemen would be to provide emergency cover, thus seeking to save lives and ensure that essential services were maintained. They would not be capable of replicating the current fire fighting capability. Assistance would be provided to and at the request of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and not the civil power.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.6/2">Obviously, Op FRESCO would place an added burden on Service personnel who have been particularly busy over the last few years performing their primary duties. Any deployment to provide emergency fire and rescue cover would impact on their ability to continue those duties, but emergency cover would, as far as possible, be maintained for as long as the strike continued and balanced with other demands on military resources.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.2/2">The DTI has a research and development programme to assess various aspects of PV product development, installation and operation on domestic buildings. In particular, the Domestic PV Systems Field Trial is supporting several projects on clusters of houses. This should result in around 500 PV roofs with a total capacity of around 800 KWp and a budget of over #5 million. This trial will use the design, construction and monitoring of the installation as a learning opportunity for utilities, building developers and other key players in the process of PV installation. Information will be gathered on the buildability, operating performance, reliability and maintainability of building-integrated PV (BIPV) systems, thus paving the way for improvements in know how in the home PV industry.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/3">In addition, the recently introduced First Phase of the Major Photovoltaic Demonstration Programme aims to distribute grants to households and businesses wishing to install PV arrays onto their buildings. The programme seeks to increase public awareness and drive down the market cost of installation by offering 50 per cent. grants on the installation of PV systems. A third of the #20 million budget has been allocated to small PV installation on individual dwellings, which should result in 1500 roof systems being installed. A further third of the budget has been allocated to private and social housing developers, resulting in a further 1500 roof systems. Up to the end of September the programme has had 70 successful small scale applications and has approved 8 larger scale applications.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.2/4">With regard to building regulations, these were changed on April 2002 to enable the benefits of low carbon and zero carbon technologies, such as PV, to be more readily taken into account and to encourage industry and consumer take-up. The economics of making the installation of PV solar panels a compulsory element of new building regulations are not yet favourable, as the price of PV remains high.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.2/2">This information is required under the OCPA code as part of the application process for all public appointments. It is not part of the information used when deciding whom to appoint. The exception to this is the four local authority posts on each RDA board. Information on political affiliation is taken into account by Ministers making these appointments, as the aim is for RDA boards to reflect generally the political make up of their region. However, even for local authority appointments, political balance is a secondary consideration to the overriding principle of appointment on merit.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.6/2">In addition to the guidance provided on the collection of business rates generally, local authorities were given specific information in respect of rates and telecommunication masts in December 2000. This followed the coming into force of the Non-Domestic Rating (Telecommunication Apparatus) England Regulations 2000, which simplified for the future the payment and collection of rates on masts. The Regulations provided that where there were a number of separate entries in a rating list for a single mast&mdash;because the mast had equipment belonging to more than one telecommunication operator&mdash;then these entries would be replaced by a single entry. Where this happened, one of the operators would assume responsibility for the rates on behalf of all of the operators, and the local authority would need to bill accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".82W.8/1">As I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase> (WA 890&ndash;891W) the Government proposes to give the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating general insurance and reinsurance mediation. I have today published a consultation document that sets out the intended approach to regulating the sale of general insurance products following adoption on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase> by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers under the co-decision procedure of the Insurance Mediation Directive (the Directive).</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/2">The consultation document explains that the FSA will regulate the following activities:</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/3" class="indent">introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance or reinsurance;</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/4" class="indent">assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/5" class="indent">concluding contracts of insurance or reinsurance.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/6">The Directive requires the regulation of mediation activities in relation to all contracts of insurance. However, it provides certain exemptions for insurance sold as part of a package, including travel insurance sold with a holiday and extended warranties that are contracts of insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/7">It is for the UK Government to decide whether to regulate those insurances that are exempted from the Directive and I have decided to defer a decision on whether the FSA should regulate extended warranties pending the outcome of the Competition Commission enquiry into extended warranties for electrical goods.</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/8">As to travel insurances that are sold with a holiday, we need carefully to weigh the consumer protection issues against regulatory costs. The Government also needs to weigh fairly the competition issues between those intermediaries that sell travel insurance direct and travel agents that sell insurance alongside a holiday. I have decided, therefore, to consult on whether to give the FSA responsibility for regulating these products. There are three options:</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/9" class="indent">No statutory regulation of sales of travel insurance sold as part of a package;</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/10" class="indent">FSA regulation to cover these sales in the same way as stand alone sales of travel insurance; or</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/11" class="indent">Industry specific regulation, requiring sellers of these products to be authorised by the FSA unless they are subject to an ABTA code which would be certified by the FSA. Sellers who were subject to the ABTA code but who also carried on other FSMA regulated activity, including selling any insurance other than packaged travel insurance, would be subject to FSA authorisation in relation to all of their regulated activities (including the activities to which the ABTA code applied).</p>
	<p pid=".82W.8/12">Responses to the consultation on general insurance and reinsurance regulation, and on the options for travel insurance sold as part of a holiday, should be sent to HM Treasury by <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.8/1">It is important to take account of those children whose individual needs cannot be met in the centres and that is why the Government has made provision for flexibility in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. Having said that, those who are gifted but lack good English are likely to benefit from the intensive language support they will get in the centre, and those with good English should also be catered for in that the centre will be providing a wide curriculum at all levels.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/2">Parents, and the Centres themselves, will be able to ask Local Education Authorities (LEA) to carry out a Special Educational Needs (SEN) assessment, which will help determine whether a centre can make suitable provision for particular pupils with SEN or whether additional support from LEA services is required on a continuing (rather than occasional) basis by way of a statement. If a statement is made, the child may continue to be taught in the Centre with additional support from the LEA. Alternatively, if this is not possible, placement in a special school may be arranged. LEAs will also be able to conclude that a mainstream school placement is necessary, for example in circumstances where local specialist provision is made wholly in units in such schools.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.3/1">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 allows for the retention of all fingerprints and DNA samples taken on suspicion of involvement in a criminal offence. These may be used only for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.3/2">The legislation has been challenged in the courts under the European Convention of Human Rights. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-12">12 September 2002</phrase> the legislation was ruled in the Court of Appeal to have not contravened the Convention. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Home Office have been looking at how the police can best use the opportunities provided by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. A revision of the rules governing the weeding of records from the Police National Computer is being examined in parallel with consideration of the best way to retain data on fingerprints and DNA from individuals who have been acquitted. The Information Commissioner's Office is being fully consulted on this exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.3/3">The DNA profiles of individuals who have had samples taken lawfully under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, but against whom the prosecution was not proceeded with or who were subsequently acquitted by the courts, can be identified on the National DNA Database. DNA samples are retained and used solely for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution and such use does not contravene data protection legislation. Currently the fingerprints of persons who are acquitted or against whom charges have not been proceeded with are weeded from the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) system. Once the acquittal/not proceeded with information is put on the Police National Computer a message is sent to NAFIS and the fingerprint record deleted. In light of the changes in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, further proposals are under consideration in relation to the system to allow for the retention of fingerprints on NAFIS in such cases.</p>

Its membership is drawn from a wide range of organisations involved in different ways with older adults and other vulnerable groups, including the police, utility companies, local authorities and voluntary bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.8/4">Amongst other things, the Taskforce has produced a Good Practice Toolkit, which is available on the Crime Reduction Website (<a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/burglary48.htm">www.crimereduction.gov.uk/burglary48.htm</a>), and is being distributed to key practitioners. It has also produced two videos and a leaflet on distraction burglary, together with posters and door stickers. The Taskforce held a series of regional seminars on distraction burglary between October 2001 and March 2002. These were attended by representatives of a wide range of organisations with an interest in the needs of older adults.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.8/5">We have also funded a two-year programme to provide home security upgrades such as better door locks, window locks, door chains and spy-holes for low income pensioners in areas with burglary rates above the national average. Over 55,000 homes have received up-grades together with advice on home security. The scheme has been run in conjunction with the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA's) Warm Front scheme, which provides heating and insulation improvements.</p>

	<p pid=".99W.5/1">A major crime review of the 1984 murder enquiry into the death of Hilda Murrell was launched in April 2002. It is being conducted in line with West Mercia Police force policy and guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), issued in 1998, which states that undetected major crimes should be periodically reviewed. The review is proceeding according to plan.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/2">The objectives of the review, drawn up by West Mercia Police force's Chief Officers, are:</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/3" class="indent">1 To attempt to identify and report on what investigative opportunities exist within the current enquiry that may assist in detecting the crime.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/4" class="indent">2 To ensure the existing enquiry paper, audio, exhibits and other documents are maintained in the best possible state for subsequent investigative action and review.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/5" class="indent">3 To produce a report with recommendations for further action.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/6">I understand that in order to ensure that the potential of the review is fully explored, experts from a range of fields&mdash;including the National Crime Operations Faculty (CENTREX)&mdash;are being consulted.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/7">The original enquiry was paper-based and pre-dated the HOLMES computerised enquiry system. It ran for over two years, nearly 3,000 statements were taken, over 2,500 exhibits seized or referred to and many thousands of other documents contained within the investigation file. A significant part of the review involves capturing the case information on modern computerised systems to allow more efficient analysis. Whilst this process is ongoing other material held by the enquiry is being assessed and reviewed for forensic potential and opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".99W.5/8">Due to the size and complexity of the review, the process of data capture will not be completed before the end of 2002. The forensic review will require a staged submission of identified items, and it is therefore difficult to accurately predict when that process will be complete. However, the current estimate is the last quarter of 2003 at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.5/1">Under section 8 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 any gun may be considered to be deactivated and thus no longer a firearm if it bears a proof mark to that effect and has had a certificate of deactivation issued by one of the two Proof Houses. To assist in this process the Home Office issued a set of specifications in 1989 against which a deactivated firearm could be compared. These were subsequently revised and more stringent specifications have applied since 1995. There is no substantial evidence to suggest that guns deactivated to these later standards are being successfully restored to working order.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.5/2">The Proof Houses have the authority to reject any deactivated firearms submitted to them which do not conform with the approved specifications. However, section 8 is only an evidential provision and does not preclude the possibility that a firearm which has been deactivated in some other manner may also have ceased to be a firearm within the meaning of section 57(1) of the Firearms Act 1968. In the event of a prosecution it would be for the courts to decide whether or not this was the case.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.5/3">There are no legal requirements regarding the storage of deactivated firearms.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.5/4">We are looking in conjunction with the European Commission at the need to establish stricter controls on deactivation standards throughout Europe.</p>

Failure to comply with these conditions is an offence. A person detained under Immigration Act powers may be released on bail, subject to conditions, which may include a requirement to report.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.5/4">I outlined in my reply to the hon. Member of <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-16">16 July</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-07-16.224"><i>Official Report</i>, column 224W</phrase>, measures for contact management which are in place to track and monitor all failed asylum seekers whether illegal entrants or not. This is to ensure that they are removed from the United Kingdom if they do not appeal or as soon as possible after their appeal rights have been exhausted. Since my earlier reply the number of designated reporting centres has been increased to eight, and plans are in hand to enhance contact management further by the use of mobile reporting centres, Immigration Service teams using specified police stations for reporting and for visiting asylum seekers at their accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.5/5">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate are currently undertaking a project to amalgamate their Ports, Enforcement and Casework Information Technology Systems into a joint database. This project is in its early stages. However, once completed, it should enhance our ability to track those illegal entrants who have been detected.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.5/6">Additionally, the Government is developing strategies to detect clandestine illegal entrants before they get to the United Kingdom. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary agreed a range of measures with his French counterpart to reduce the level of illegal immigration between France and the United Kingdom. As part of this the Immigration Service is committed to deploying new detection technology (such as heart beat detectors and millimetric wave imagers) at Calais and other continental ports.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.5/7">The government has also created Reflex, a multi-agency forum to direct all activity against organised immigration crime targeting the United Kingdom. Reflex aims to reduce the profits made by the criminal gangs, raise the risks they face and reduce the opportunities for them to exploit individuals, thereby reducing the flow of illegal migrants to the United Kingdom. It achieves this through a combination of overseas and United Kingdom based activity. Since April 2002, 16 organised crime groups involved in people smuggling and trafficking have been disrupted and there are currently 60 operations targeting serious criminal involvement ongoing. Nine Immigration Liaison Officers have been posted overseas to work closely with local law enforcement to disrupt the flows of illegal migrants to the United Kingdom and a United Kingdom-led project assisting the State Border Service in Bosnia has seen a reduction of over 90 per cent. of potential illegal migrants passing through Sarajevo airport.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.0/1">Since 1997 long-term unemployment in rural areas has been cut by 78 per cent. Our policies, based on the foundation of a strong and stable economy, have played an important part in this success.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/2">The New Deals have helped nearly three quarters of a million people in all parts of the country move off benefit and into work. They have performed particularly well in rural areas. For example, nearly 60 per cent. of those leaving the New Deal for Young People in rural areas have moved into jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/3">Employment Zones and Action Teams for Jobs are helping people from the most deprived areas of the country move into work. The Action Teams and Employment Zones operating in predominantly rural areas have between them helped over 11,500 people into jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/4">With the introduction of Jobcentre Plus, we aim to make our services more accessible to a wider group of people. We are building on the services we already offer over the telephone and internet such as Jobseeker Direct and Worktrain. We are also developing new ways of bringing Jobcentre Plus services to those who need them through, for example, mobile offices covering remote areas.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/5">We have introduced a number of initiatives to help unemployed people in rural areas overcome the transport barriers they may face. The New Deal can, for example, help participants meet the costs of travelling to their work or training placement. The Adviser Discretion Fund, which we introduced in July 2001, allows New Deal Personal Advisers to spend up to #300 to help individuals overcome barriers to work, including transport difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/6">Employment Zones and Action Teams for Jobs are also helping overcome transport problems in rural areas, for example, by giving grants to clients for the purchase of scooters, bicycles or other vehicles to help them get to work. They can also help with the cost of taxing or insuring vehicles. In addition, they have helped to set up and subsidise bus routes to take jobless people to areas where work is available and run car lease schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.0/7">To build on this success, in April we launched the Transport Projects Fund, worth #5 million a year. Action Teams can bid for additional money from the Fund to support innovative transport projects that will benefit the local community.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.3/1">We recognise that the cost and availability of transport can be a barrier to work for unemployed people and have measures in place to help jobseekers overcome such difficulties and move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/2">Jobseekers can receive help with the costs of travelling to job interviews through the Travel to Interview Scheme. Last year, the scheme helped nearly 40,000 people attend interviews. In my hon. Friend's constituency, following a survey of local people, Jobcentre Plus and the Local Authority will be setting up a working group, involving the bus companies and local MPs, to improve the bus links for people who are in work or looking for work.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/3">New Deal participants can also receive help to meet the costs of travelling to their work or training placement. Through an agreement between Jobcentre Plus and the Association of Train Operating Companies, New Deal clients can receive a reduction in the cost of rail travel. Similar agreements exist with other transport providers at regional and local level. In the Jobcentre Plus District serving my hon. Friend's constituency, this has led to the availability of reduced fares with 9 public service operators, including First Cymru.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/4">The Adviser Discretion Fund, which we introduced in July 2001, allows New Deal Personal Advisers to spend up to #300 to help individuals overcome barriers to work, including transport problems. The help provided can include, for example, paying for travel passes or helping with the cost of taxing a car. Up to May 2002, well over 120,000 awards has been made from the Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/5">Employment Zones and Action Teams for Jobs are also helping overcome transport difficulties, for example, by giving grants to clients for the purchase of scooters, bicycles or other vehicles to help them get to work. They can also help with the cost of taxing or insuring vehicles. In addition, they have helped to set up and subsidise bus routes to take jobless people to areas where work is available and run car lease schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".109W.3/6">To build on this success, in April we launched the Transport Projects Fund, worth #5 million a year. Action Teams can bid for additional money from the Fund to support innovative transport projects that will benefit the local community.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.0/1">We offer ex-offenders a wide range of help to move into work, including early access to employment programmes such as New Deal and Work Based Learning for Adults. Last autumn we also introduced Freshstart, a #3 million initiative to improve the links between prisons and Jobcentres and ease the transition from custody into work.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.0/2">Earlier this year we introduced progress2work to offer individually tailored specialist support to help people find work or improve their prospects of doing so. The first stage of progress2work focused on unemployed people who are recovering from drug problems. Ex-prisoners referred by drug counselling teams are a priority target group for progress2work. Later this month we will begin piloting the extension of the progress2work approach to other groups facing particularly difficult barriers to work. This will include all ex-offenders.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.6/1">Anyone who meets the Inland Revenue requirements is eligible for a stakeholder pension. The main requirement is to be a UK resident under the age of 75 who is ordinarily resident in the UK. Those who are members of an employer's occupational pension scheme can also join a stakeholder pension scheme if they do not earn more than #30,000 a year and are not a controlling director. Stakeholder pensions mean that everyone now has access to a good value pension arrangement. Figures from the Association of British Insurers show that nationally 1,011,934 stakeholder pensions had been sold by the end of June 2002 and 330,296 employers have given their workforces access to a stakeholder pension through designating a stakeholder scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.6/2">Stakeholder pensions are helping to increase the size of the overall pensions market. They have driven down charges on other types of personal pension. Some employers have widened access to their occupational pension schemes and other employers have set up group personal pensions with an employer contribution.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.0/1">In April we launched the Rapid Response Service. The Rapid Response Service works in co-operation with representatives of employees, employers and the local community to co-ordinate a response to redundancies that helps everyone affected and is tailored to their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/2">The Rapid Response Service offers a range of information, advice, training and other help so that those people made redundant can move quickly back into work. Since its launch the Rapid Response Service has provided support to 158 companies and made its services available to over 50,000 people.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.9/1">It is estimated that there will be around 12 million people of pensionable age in 10 years time and around 12.5 million in 20 years time. The impact of an ageing population on the UK's public finances is expected to be manageable. The UK's public finances are sound and sustainable over the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.9/2">The Government's long-term reforms will ensure that everyone has the chance to save for a decent income in retirement. Stakeholder pensions now provide a new option of safe, flexible, value for money pensions for people on moderate and higher earnings who do not have access to a good occupational scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.9/3">The Government also wants private pensions to remain attractive to members and to scheme providers. That is why steps are being taken to simplify the private pensions system while at the same time safe-guarding the security of scheme members.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.9/4">The State Second Pension, introduced in April 2002, means that low earners will get at least double what they would have got from SERPS, while carers and disabled people with broken work records will be entitled to a second pension for the first time.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.9/5">The next stage in the Government's strategy is the Pension Credit. From 2003, this will tackle both poverty amongst today's pensioners and complement stakeholder pensions by boosting the incentive for future pensioners to save for their own retirement.</p>

	<p pid=".114W.5/1">It is a basic principle of the Social Security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for income maintenance. This is known as the overlapping benefit rule and has been a feature of the welfare state since its inception. State Pension is an income replacement benefit for those who have reached pensionable age. Invalid Care Allowance (ICA), which will be re-named ''Carer's Allowance'' in April 2003, provides a measure of financial support to those who give up the opportunity of full time paid employment to care for a severely disabled person. It too is an income replacement benefit. Even if it is not payable, underlying entitlement to ICA continues and if the carer is entitled to any of the income related benefits, carer premium can be paid. This is worth #24.80 per week.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.5/1">Our policies have created a strong economy geared to delivering stability, low inflation and sound public finances. Alongside this, our labour market policies promote attachment to the job market. As a result of our policies we have around the lowest number of unemployed people in a quarter century, and more people in work than ever before, with an increase in overall employment of almost 200,000 in the last year.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.5/2">There are consistently high numbers of vacancies being created, with approximately 10,000 jobs being notified to Jobcentres every day. Our welfare to work policies, such as the New Deal, are aimed at helping those who lose their job, whether in manufacturing or any other sector, access these vacancies and return to work as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.5/3">In the United Kingdom, manufacturing employment has been on a downward trend since the mid-1960s. The trend towards a larger proportion of total employment being accounted for by services is common amongst industrialised countries. However, manufacturing matters. It creates a fifth of our national output, employs four million people and produces the majority of our exports. The success of United Kingdom manufacturing is therefore crucial to our country's prosperity, now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.5/4">One of the pillars of the Government's manufacturing strategy is raising skills and education levels and the Department is playing a key role in this area. Jobcentre Plus is one of the five key partners involved in the production of Frameworks for Regional Employment and Skills Action within the context of the Regional Economic Strategies. The Frameworks offer the opportunity to bring together various agencies to work towards a common employment strategy. They include plans for dealing with skills shortages, helping to ensure that industry has access to a pool of potential employees with the right skills for the modern labour market.</p>

However, in contracting with independent sector providers of care we expect local authorities to take into account a range of provider costs such as implementing national standards. Providers will also be able to detail the facilities they offer in their prospectuses, so that those purchasing or using the services can make an informed choice.</p>

	<p pid=".123W.2/1">The government welcomes the Audit Commission's report <i>Fully Equipped 2002: Assisting Independence</i>. Since the Audit Commission's original <i>Fully Equipped</i> report in 2000, we have set up a programme to improve disability services. The programme includes NHS Plan targets for integrating community equipment services and for increasing the numbers of equipment users by 50 per cent., both by 2004. The latter target has recently been extended to cover a further 250,000 people by 2006. The follow-up report <i>Fully Equipped 2002</i> indicates that at this half way stage progress has clearly been made in areas such as community equipment services, hearing aid services and neonatal hearing screening. However, it highlights other areas where further work is needed and where we are now taking action such as wheelchairs, prosthetics and orthotics.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/2">Funding is given to the National Health Service with which to commission community equipment services, prosthetics, orthotics, hearing aid and wheelchair services. We have made available to the NHS an additional #105 million to improve community equipment services alone in the previous, current and next financial years. It is for local commissioners of services to determine how best to meet national priorities for improving health, tackling inequalities and modernising services and the extra investment in health and social care will help them do that.</p>
	<p pid=".123W.2/3">In addition to the current tranche of additional NHS funding for community equipment services, local councils have also received an additional amount in the personal social services settlement to improve their community equipment services. Furthermore, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-23">23 July 2002</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement to the House on older people and the reduction of delayed discharges from hospital. In it he indicated that community equipment has an important role to play in facilitating discharges and that there will be additional ring fenced funding for community equipment and minor adaptations for social services in the years 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. In the same statement, my right hon. Friend announced both the intention to remove the power of councils to charge for the loan of community equipment (subject to legislation) and new targets to speed up the time it takes to deliver equipment and to make minor adaptations. All these measures will directly benefit people who need such items.</p>

	<p pid=".130W.2/1">Community equipment services are funded from National Health Service and social services general allocation and the amount made available by local commissioners each year is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".130W.2/2">In addition to general funding allocations, additional funding has been made available. In 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03, #11.7 million and #15.4 million were included in baseline allocations to health authorities. The Government also took account of the need for additional investment in the personal social services settlement for 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04, to enable councils to contribute an appropriate share to the expansion of these services. These additional allocations are recurring amounts.</p>
