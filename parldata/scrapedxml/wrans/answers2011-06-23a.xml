	<p pid="a.381W.9/2">25 Flight Army Air Corps (25 Flight AAC) currently operates three Bell 212 helicopters in support of the British Army Training Support Unit, Belize (BATSUB). This is however, due to cease this summer. The helicopters are operated by the Army Air Corps under a &#8216;military registered contractor owned&#8217; basis, and are painted in the Army Air Corps military markings.</p>
	<p pid="a.381W.9/3">In 2010 the UK Ministry of Defence looked at its use of all military bases overseas and, after consultation with the Government of Belize, concluded that BATSUB would remain open but that we will, from 2011, temporarily suspend our routine training activities in Belize. As a consequence, there is currently no requirement for helicopter support and UK aviation support will, therefore, cease after the last Infantry exercise scheduled for mid-July. 25 Flight AAC will transfer to the UK, to provide helicopter support to other military collective training activities.</p>

The purpose of the Board is to incentivise better performance in the management and delivery of major projects that are delayed or experiencing serious cost growth. Projects will be placed on the list of concern if once reviewed by the Board they continue to slip or increase in cost and fail to provide sufficient confidence in their recovery plan. It is not possible, therefore, to identify any specific &#8220;projects of concern&#8221; at this early stage in the process or to predict when such a report becomes appropriate.</p>

Because of a peak of diocesan vacancies over the past three years the length of diocesan vacancies has been unusually long.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.3/2">The following table contains data in respect of eight recent vacancies for diocesan sees, 10 for suffragan sees, and two (which occurred at the same time as each other) for the suffragan sees occupied by provincial episcopal visitors. All answers are in days and are for the period between the announcement of the intention to leave office and the announcement of the appointment.</p>

	<p pid="a.396W.6/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Darra Singh</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking whether he took into consideration the ability of employees of the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) Office within Hartlepool Jobcentre Plus to travel to other Jobcentre Plus offices by public transport prior to his decision to close that office. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/4">In deciding which sites to close in rationalising our estate, Jobcentre Plus used a balance of criteria of: performance; cost; size (sites under 200 seats being less cost effective) ; staff redeployment opportunities and impact on the local economy/community (including seeking to avoid areas where other public sector staff reductions may take place). In addition a full Equality Impact Assessment was conducted and a site specific one for each site selected. Disability, gender, race, age, gender reassignment, religion or belief, sexual orientation and pregnancy and maternity were all considered. This ensured that all of the issues and potential impacts were exposed and mitigated. The results of the Hartlepool IIDB office Equality Impact Assessment were included within the equally weighted and balanced set of criteria that was used by Jobcentre Plus to inform decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/5">Therefore I can confirm that the redeployment potential of the Hartlepool staff was one of the factors considered when deciding whether to close the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/6">Every member of staff at Hartlepool IIDB centre will be offered a job elsewhere in Jobcentre Plus. There may also be additional opportunities for redeployment into other Civil Service posts outside of this Department. Help with travel to get to an alternative workplace will be given. Redeployment to Stockton and Sunderland Benefit Centres, Middlesbrough Contact Centre and the Jobcentres at Hartlepool, Billingham, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Eston, Redcar, Darlington and Middlesbrough East are being given due consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.6/7">All staff at Hartlepool are being engaged by their managers in frequent one to one discussions. This is the opportunity for staff to explore their options and access the full range of support offered by Jobcentre Plus under departmental workforce management and equality policies. All available options will be considered, including relocation, redeployment and reasonable adjustments. Trade Union representatives are being kept informed and are available for staff to consult about their particular circumstances.</p>

We have suggested that these may consist of people from local authorities, civil society organisations, land managers and people in the community, but we are not enforcing the concept or structure. It is for local areas to decide whether an LNP is the appropriate structure to protect and improve the natural environment local to them. In the course of developing the concept of LNPs and producing guidance for the next steps in establishing them, we consulted local authorities extensively, and visited several to discuss the idea.</p>

I made clear that the sanctions imposed by the US continue to be a serious block to British banks to operate in Sudan, causing problems for British NGO groups and staff, and other organisations to utilise the international banking system when dealing with or living in Sudan. US regulations contain a number of exemptions and authorisations for activities and transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under U.S. sanctions against Sudan, particularly with respect to humanitarian assistance. I have asked for greater clarity on these exemptions for the benefit of the British Banking Association, and its members. We understand that post-independence these restrictions will not apply to South Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="a.432W.6/1">The Department's policies in respect of maternity leave and adoption leave are set out in the relevant current documents on the Department's intranet, Delphi. Those documents will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/2">Eligibility for maternity pay for departmental staff is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/3">The member of staff must complete an application form making a statement that they intend to return to work in the Department after their maternity leave, and must agree to repay any contractual payment made during that period if they fail to return. The member of staff must be in paid service, at the time the maternity leave begins, and must have completed at least one year's such service within the civil service. That service need not be continuous. (Staff in receipt of sick pay at pension rate are not regarded as being in paid service).</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/4">The rates of pay allowed to eligible staff for maternity leave are 26 weeks maternity leave on full pay and a subsequent 13 weeks paid at statutory maternity pay (SMP) rates for the period of continuous absence before and after childbirth. Even if ineligible for paid maternity leave, a member of staff still has a statutory right to 52 weeks' unpaid leave, and may qualify for SMP or maternity allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/5">Similarly, eligibility for adoption leave in the Department is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/6">The member of staff should be newly matched with a child for adoption by an approved adoption agency and have a 'matching certificate' from that agency. The member of staff should complete an application form stating that they intend to return to work in the Department after the adoption leave period, and agree to repay any payment made during that period if they fail to return. The member of staff must be in paid service at the time that the adoption leave begins and have completed at least one year's such service within the civil service. The latter time need not be continuous.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/7">If the staff member has not completed one year's service but has completed at least 26 weeks service, they will still be entitled to a reduced period of paid adoption leave. In these circumstances, up to 25 days' paid leave will be allowed when the child first comes under the staff member's full time care. A portion of this leave may be allocated for situations in advance of the start of full-time care. Again, staff in receipt of sick pay at pension rate are not regarded as being in paid service.</p>
	<p pid="a.432W.6/8">Rates of pay, allowed to fully eligible staff, for adoption leave are 26 weeks' paid adoption leave on full contractual pay , a subsequent 13 weeks paid at statutory adoption pay (SAP) and 13 weeks' unpaid leave for the period of continuous leave before and after adoption.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.0/2">The paper looked at outcomes for people after six months in treatment. The paper concluded that; for a group of people who had failed to benefit from previous treatment; supervised injectable heroin leads to significantly lower use of street heroin than do supervised injectable methadone or optimised oral methadone. Treatment retention was improved and severe adverse events were reduced. Further reports on the findings of the Randomised Injectable Opioid Treatment Trial pilots, including their cost-effectiveness and impact on crime, are being prepared by the National Addiction Centre.</p>

The NTA will tender new injectable treatment contracts, subject to finances being agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.8/1">Policy responsibility for meat hygiene controls lies with the Food Standards Agency (FSA). We are advised by the FSA that full cost recovery for meat official controls complies with FSA policy, Government guidelines, and current European Union legislation. The European Commission's review of EU charging rules is expected to reach a conclusion in the first quarter of 2012. This is expected to lead to a legislative proposal, which would then be subject to negotiation and to European Parliament and Council approval. The EU Review process is likely to take at least two more years before any agreed changes are incorporated within EU legislation. Any implications for United Kingdom charging policy that may arise from the EU review will be considered at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.5/2">The Government have decided to discontinue the Faith Communities Consultative Council. We believe that it did not add value to the effective arrangements that Departments already have in place for consulting faith communities on policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/3">Our preference is to work with faith communities in a manner that is strategic and appropriate for particular situations. My Department will continue to liaise individually with national faith communities that provided members of the Council, and to convene ad hoc groupings to discuss policy as necessary. Officials from various Departments will continue to attend meetings of the Faith Communities Forum of the Inter Faith Network for the United Kingdom, in order to engage with faith communities collectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.5/4">The Government recognises the vital contribution that faith communities make to civil society, and we are committed to facilitating linkages and tackling barriers that faith groups face. For instance my Department has invested &#163;5 million in the Church Urban Fund's Near Neighbours programme, using the local infrastructure of the Church of England to build productive relationships between people from different faith backgrounds in four key geographical areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.453W.11/1">In November 2010 the coalition Government published &#8220;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221; which set out the planned changes to the entitlements to full funding further education and skills for adults in England. Learners aged 19 up to 24 will be entitled to full fee remission for their first qualification at Level 3. Outside of this entitlement, there is an expectation that learners undertaking Level 3 qualifications will share the costs with the Government; with co-funding in the 2011/12 and 2012/13 academic years, and the introduction of Government-backed loans from 2013/14.</p>
	<p pid="a.453W.11/2">The Statistical First Release<sup>(1)</sup> provides the latest data on the proportion of starts and completions for learners at Level 3. Based on historical data we estimate that 3,000 learner places at Level 3 could become co-funded rather than fully-funded in 2011/12. However, as the further education funding system is demand-led it is not possible to predict the number or proportion of adults that will be required to pay a fee for a first Level 3 qualification beyond 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.455W.2/3"><i>(a)</i> The Secretary of State has the power to investigate any company or limited liability partnership where there appears good reason, usually the suspicion that it is trading fraudulently or against the public interest. However, there is nothing in law to prevent a director of a company in liquidation from forming a new company, from acting as a partner or as a sole trader to carry on a business similar to, or even identical to, that of the former company providing, in respect of any limited company, he has not been disqualified from acting in the management of a limited company and is not personally bankrupt.</p>
	<p pid="a.455W.2/4"><i>(b)</i> Trading Standards have powers to investigate breaches under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 which bans all persons acting in trade or business from engaging in unfair commercial (mainly marketing and selling) practices against consumers. The regulations apply across all business sectors and set out a framework for how businesses must deal with consumers so that consumers can make free and informed choices in relation to goods and services offered for sale. Enforcement of the regulations is through undertakings from infringers, enforcement orders or by prosecution with offences carrying a fine of up to &#163;5,000 or imprisonment or both.</p>

	<p pid="a.460W.2/1">As at close of business on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June 2011</phrase> the total number of applications waiting to be determined at the centralised legal aid unit at Havering magistrates court stood at 4095.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/2">The target times for determination of legal aid applications in the centralised legal aid unit at Havering magistrates court are, in accordance with the national HMCTS targets agreed with the Legal Services Commission, to process 90% of all completed applications within two days of receipt, 95% within three days and 100% within six days. HMCTS does not collect performance data on the average time taken to determine an application. The latest performance data against the 90% target (within two days) show performance at Havering as 96.6% for March 2011, 69.9% for April 2011 and 27.4% for May 2011. Performance against the 95% target (within three days) is 97.2% for March 2011, 80.8% for April 2011 and 29.9% for May 2011. Performance against the 100% target (within six days) is 99% in March 2011, 95.1% in April 2011 and 49.2% in May 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/3">HMCTS does not centrally collect data on the number of defendants that appear unrepresented in the magistrates court. Nationally, figures are published for the total number of unrepresented defendants in the Crown court, however, these figures do not provide reasons why defendants are unrepresented. Accordingly, there are no data held by HMCTS centrally to link the number of defendants who have appeared unrepresented in circumstances attributable to the time taken by the centralised legal aid unit at Havering magistrates court to grant legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/4">A detailed and rigorous recovery plan has been put in place by the London HMCTS Regional Management Board. The plan includes transferring additional trained staff into Havering from other parts of the London region. Havering is also receiving some assistance from other HMCTS regions outside of London. Saturday working and overtime has also been approved at Havering to further accelerate processing.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/5">It is expected that the backlogs will be cleared by the end of July at the latest and that Havering, along with all other London courts, will return to processing a minimum of 90% of all applications within the two day target by that date. During the period of recovery, performance is being closely monitored by local managers and regular reports will be produced for the London senior management team to ensure that the necessary progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/6">Additional resources are also being transferred on a permanent basis into the centralised legal aid unit at Havering magistrates court specifically to deal with legal aid applications to ensure that London is able to sustain performance in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.460W.2/7">HMCTS does not collect data on the number of hearings in the magistrates court or the Crown court in Greater London that have been adjourned in circumstances attributable to the non-determination of a legal aid award. Accordingly there are no data as to the number of hearings in the magistrates court or the Crown court in Greater London that have been adjourned in circumstances attributable to the non-determination of a legal aid award by the centralised legal aid unit at Havering magistrates court.</p>

	<p pid="a.464W.2/1">For adult offenders who were convicted of unlawful sex with a minor, the 12 month re-conviction rate is 10.8%. This is based on offences committed within one year of an offender being discharged from custody or commencing a court order in the first quarter of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.464W.2/4">Sexual offences against a minor include all offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 where the age of the victim can be determined from the Act (and where it is under 16) under which the offender was sentenced. This includes offences under sections 1, 5-10 and 47 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.2/2">There will be some small direct savings attributable to the abolition although the transition process itself will incur some costs which will reduce any planned savings in the initial year of transition. These savings are in respect of the costs of board members who will no longer be required post abolition. We estimate these costs to be approximately &#163;250,000 per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.468W.2/3">The key benefit from the decision to abolish the Youth Justice Board will be direct ministerial accountability for youth justice which the Government believes will help to secure better outcomes for young people.</p>

The new mandatory scheme will replace the previous voluntary agreement with energy suppliers to provide better focused help to tackle fuel poverty. Over the four years to 2015, the Warm Home Discount scheme will be worth up to &#163;1.1 billion and will help around 2 million households per year.</p>
