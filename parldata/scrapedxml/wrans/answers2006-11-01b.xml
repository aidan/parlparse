	<p pid="b.416W.3/1">This case concerned a multi party action (MPA) against the manufacturers of Femodene and other third generation oral contraceptive pills, for allegedly causing personal injury, including cardiovascular injuries to those who consumed them. Approximately 120 women were funded to bring proceedings against the manufacturers. This culminated in a 13-week trial during 2002. The total cost to the legal aid fund was &pound;9.9 million. The case did not succeed, but had it done so, then as with all civil cases against privately funded parties, significant damages would likely to have been awarded and the legal costs subsequently met by the opposing parties. The net cost to the legal aid fund would then have been very little, or even nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/2">Legal aid was reformed in 2000 to exclude personal injury cases from receiving funding. However in some exceptional cases an independent panel of experts advises the Legal Services Commission (LSC) to grant funding, especially where the panel believes the case has &quot;significant wider public interest&quot;, as they did with this litigation. Given the wide availability of Femodene and other third generation oral contraceptive pills, the panel decided that it was important for the public to know they could have confidence in the product licensing system and therefore advised the LSC to fund the litigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/3">The solicitor firms involved were Houghton and Co and Leigh Day and Co. Houghton and Co were paid &pound;7,365,969 and &pound;948,361 in disbursements. A single costs assessment certificate was issued by the court to Houghton and Co as the lead solicitor firm under the MPA contract. I understand that of this total, &pound;1.8 million was paid to Leigh Day and Co.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/4">The solicitors were paid prescribed rates under the Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings (Remuneration) Regulations 1994. There are a variety of rates reflecting the work carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/5">The rates for this action included the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/6" class="indent">Preparation&mdash;&pound;74.00 to &pound;79.50 per hour</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/7" class="indent">Routine letters out &mdash;&pound;7.40 to &pound;7.50 per item</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/8" class="indent">Routine telephone calls&mdash;&pound;4.10 to &pound;4.15 per item</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/9" class="indent">Attending hearing or conference with counsel&mdash;&pound;36.40 to &pound;37.00 per hour</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/10" class="indent">Attending hearing without counsel&mdash;&pound;32.70 to &pound;33.25 per hour.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/11">Additionally, enhancements ranging between 75 per cent. to 200 per cent. were assessed as reasonable by the court for items of work carried out under these rates depending on the complexity of the specific work carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/12">The barristers were paid under the brief fee and refresher fee structure applied to civil litigation, which did not then include hourly rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.416W.3/13">The following table lists how much was paid by way of brief fees and refresher fees to barristers that were paid a brief fee in the action.</p>

	<p pid="b.418W.9/1">The economic impact of digital switchover on the UK economy is set out in cost benefit analyses produced by DCMS and DTI economists. The most recent estimates were published in a report by DCMS and DTI in February 2005. I am arranging for copies of the report to be placed in the Library of both Houses. The report is also available from <a href="http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk">www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.418W.9/2">The February 2005 estimates indicated that a two-year delay in the completion of digital switchover would lead to a reduction of benefits of around &pound;400 million in net present value terms, based on conservative assumptions about the future use of spectrum released by switchover.</p>

The principles we are following are to seek to reduce carbon emissions wherever possible, through demand reduction measures; reducing the carbon intensity of the energy through the use of combined cooling heat and power; energy efficiency measures; and through providing new renewable energy infrastructure. In addition, we will to seek to offset unavoidable emissions associated with the games through a carbon offsetting programme.</p>

The provisions of the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR) apply to students on work experience.

In both sectors they must also be aware of, and work within the statutory frameworks relating to teachers' responsibilities, and these frameworks include those relating to safety.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.6/1">The Department believes that everyone should have an equal opportunity to meet their aspirations, realise their full potential and improve their life chances. To that end, we regularly equality monitor our HR policies and processes, and have a clear understanding of the impact of those polices/processes on different age groups within the Department, this includes access to development. We also take action if the monitoring shows any adverse impact on groups of staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.6/2">When detailed guidance was produced by ACAS on implementing the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 a project team was set up to consider and review the implications of the regulations on our existing HR policies and procedures. This found that most of our policies and procedures were age compliant. The exception was our age retirement arrangements, and we have now negotiated an agreement with our trade union side so that from the <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> here is no mandatory retirement age and people can choose when they retire provided they continue to meet the normal fitness and effectiveness standards that apply to all staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.435W.6/4">supporting a range of flexible working patterns, including part-time working, job sharing and home-working. Any member of staff can negotiate a change in working pattern in addition to standard flexitime arrangements. In addition, people at age 60 can apply to take their pension and continue in employment either by reducing their hours of work or by downgrading without any financial detriment.</p>
	<p pid="b.435W.6/5">Finally, all members of staff are encouraged to develop the blend of skills and experience that will enable them to be effective in their current post and to progress, if that is what they want to do. In April 2006 we launched an initiative under the Professional Skills for Government framework so that everyone in the Department can identify and develop the blend of skills and experience they need to be able to design and deliver customer-focused policies for the 21st century.</p>

	<p pid="b.442W.5/1">To promote the study of foreign languages for learners of all ages, the Government published its National Languages Strategy: 'Languages for All: Languages for Life&mdash;a strategy for England' in December 2002. To oversee the implementation of the strategy, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills appointed Dr. Lid King as National Director for Languages in September 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/2">In March 2005, the Secretary of State announced a &pound;115 million &quot;Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning until March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/3">For primary schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To date we have trained over 2,000 new primary teachers with a specialism in languages. Last October we published, in hard copy and online, our Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages, which sets out learning objectives for the four years of Key Stage 2. It is supported by a national training programme, guidance and a planning tool.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/4">The funding will also support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11 to 18-year-olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational options at Key Stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies. We are also funding a range of projects and materials to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support. For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to produce 'Languages Work', a suite of materials designed to promote the value of language learning, support take up of languages beyond Key Stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future employability.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/5">Our Key Stage 3 Strategy continues to impact positively on pupils' attainment in languages, especially boys. From January 2007 we will be providing additional Key Stage 3 training for teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/6">We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications. Most significantly, in September 2005 the new national, voluntary languages recognition scheme, the Languages Ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is currently available in 21 languages. It differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date over 800 centres&mdash;including local authorities and specialist language colleges&mdash;have registered to take part in the scheme, with over 10,000 learners entered for qualifications across all sectors taking over 26,000 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/7">To address the decline in take up at Key Stage 4, my predecessor wrote to all secondary schools setting out her expectations that, from September 2006, 50 to 90 per cent. of a school's Key Stage 4 cohort should study a foreign language leading to a recognised qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/8">The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has asked Lord Dearing to carry out a review of languages. Working with key partners and stakeholders, the review will examine the scope for action in the following areas: with secondary schools to support them in making available a wider range of more flexible language courses, so that more young people continue language learning even if they are not doing a full GCSE course; further strengthening the incentives for schools and young people to continue language learning post-14; with Further Education and Higher Education institutions, to examine what more can be done to widen access to and increase interest in language learning among the student population; with employer organisations, to consider what more they can do to promote the value of language skills for business and to give stronger market signals to young people about language skills and employability; and finally, what broader communication effort is needed to get across the importance of language skills to all sections of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.442W.5/9">Lord Dearing is expected to submit his interim report to the Secretary of State in December, and his final report by the end of February 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.445W.5/1">The ability to read well underpins all educational achievement and improves children's life chances. The Department is committed to improving children's reading capabilities. We provide a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure schools provide both high quality teaching and learning in reading, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading and helps them achieve their potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.445W.5/2">As part of our drive to improve attainment for all children the Primary National Strategy has renewed its literacy framework. The framework was made available earlier this month and offers enhanced support to schools and early years settings, drawing on the latest classroom good practice and research.</p>
	<p pid="b.445W.5/3">The literacy element of the framework draws in particular on the findings of the Rose Review which looked at a wide range of best practice in the teaching of early reading and found that systematic phonic work, set within a rich language curriculum, is the best route to becoming a skilled reader for the majority of children. The Primary National Strategy has worked closely with local authorities to put in place a package of materials, training and consultancy that will support schools in using the new framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.445W.5/4">More widely, our National Reading Campaign promotes the benefits and pleasures of reading to all ages. Key elements include the Reading Connects initiative which supports schools in promoting reading for pleasure to enhance achievement; and Reading Champions which finds and celebrates positive male role models and seeks to change boys' and men's attitudes to reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.445W.5/5">The Skills for Life Strategy is committed to improving levels of literacy within the adult population. Programmes are available free-of-charge to adults aged 16 and above who wish to improve their literacy and numeracy skills in workplace and community settings. The Government plan to help 2.25 million adults to achieve literacy, language and numeracy qualifications by 2010. Family Literacy Language and Numeracy programmes are a key element of Skills for Life. They enable parents and their children to improve their literacy, language and numeracy skills together. Courses are offered through schools, children's centres, colleges and adult learning services. Parents have an essential role to play in education and their involvement and support for their child's learning is critical. Our Family Reading Campaign will work to ensure all families see reading as an important part of their daily lives and part of the culture of their home. The Family Reading Campaign will be launched at the beginning of next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.5/2">Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of school playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the proceeds as it wished. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Section 77 defines playing field as</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;land in the open air which is provided for the purposes of physical education or recreation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/4">All applications to dispose of school playing fields received since <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-16">16 July 2001</phrase> have been scrutinised by the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel, which comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association. The Panel provides advice on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/5">There has never been a complete audit of existing school playing field provision, but data on school playing fields was requested from local authorities in 2001 and 2003. Unfortunately, the data was incomplete and of variable quality, and it was not possible to accurately assess the number and area of school playing fields.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/6">The following table shows the number of applications to sell school playing fields larger than a 2,000m<sup>(2)</sup> sports pitch that have been approved in each calendar year since 1998. A 'sports pitch' is an area of open grassed land which is equal to, or larger than, the Football Association's recommended area of 2,000m<sup>(2)</sup> for games played by under-10s, and which has a configuration making it suitable for sports, whether laid out as a sports pitch or not. Of the total of 174 approved applications, 78 were at closed schools. Of the approved 96 applications at operating schools, the proceeds of sale have been used to improve on-site sports facilities at 78 of these schools. In the other 18 cases the sale proceeds have been used to improve educational facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.451W.2/1">Decisions on allocating money for school science laboratories are made by local authorities, as they are best placed to decide upon priorities for capital funding. We have no plans to change this.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.2/2">The Department is encouraging authorities to think imaginatively about school science provision. Accordingly, it is initiating the 'Faraday' project which will result in a series of exemplar designs for science laboratories being developed and a range of demonstration projects being built across the country. These designs will be exciting and inspirational, and will comply with existing space, cost and environmental guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.2/3">Schools' capital funding, out of which school science laboratories can be funded, has never been higher. This year there is &pound;5.9 billion of capital support, rising to over &pound;8 billion by 2010-11. Much of this can be used to improve school laboratories. Building Schools for the Future will, in time, renew all secondary schools including their science provision. In the meantime, all schools have access to other funding including capital devolved to local authorities and to schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.2/4">Capital funding includes allocations each year to every school for its own priorities. This year, a 1,000 pupil secondary school will receive over &pound;100,000 for its needs, which can include the improvement of its laboratories. This can be rolled over to support larger projects, and be added to from other sources.</p>

	<p pid="b.454W.2/1">The main SEN factor used by Somerset local authority in their funding formula is called 'School Action', which is designed to meet the additional education needs of pupils in mainstream schools. This is based on a commercially available social deprivation index. The index looks closely at numerous wealth/poverty factors, and maps this to the post codes of the pupils for each school, so funding is weighted towards the schools with the most pupils from deprived areas within Somerset. The authority also allocates funds for 'School Action Plus', which delegates funding for named pupils with complex needs identified through an audit or statement. The authority also funds SEN co-ordinator activities in individual schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.2/2">Somerset's section 52 budget statement for the current financial year 2006-07, shows that the authority has allocated through these factors just over &pound;15.5 million. During the year an additional &pound;0.8 million (held in the school specific contingency) is earmarked to schools for changing needs of individual pupils for School Action Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.454W.2/3">In May 2004 the Department published guidance for local authorities, &quot;The Management of SEN Expenditure&quot; which provides information and suggested approaches for local authorities to manage SEN expenditure. The guidance can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/senexpenditure">www.teachernet.gov.uk/senexpenditure</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.457W.8/1">Increases in landfill tax do not necessarily mean that fly-tipping incidents will also rise. There is no data to suggest that countries with higher levels of landfill tax than the UK have a significant problem with fly-tipping. Nevertheless, the Government continue to monitor levels of fly-tipping and ways in which the effects can be mitigated. Defra has also allocated &pound;2 million of the receipts from landfill tax in 2006-07 from the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste programme to help the Environment Agency tackle illegal waste activity in the business community.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.8/2">In April 2004, the Flycapture database was set up to help local authorities and the Environment Agency improve information on the scale of fly-tipping and to help focus resources and identify trends in this growing environmental crime. Flycapture is enabling central and local government to demonstrate the true nature, extent and scale of fly-tipping. The data will be used to develop more effective, evidence based policies and strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.8/3">Defra has also funded a research report by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science into the causes and incentives of fly-tipping. The report concludes that there are a number of separate causes of fly-tipping.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.8/4">Although the research recognises that one of these causes may be the cost of legitimate waste disposal, the landfill tax is an important instrument in reducing our reliance on landfill and moving to more sustainable waste management options. Diverting biodegradable waste from landfill will also cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions and signals the Government's serious commitment to tackle climate change on all fronts. The actual increases, together with the knowledge of the future rate of tax, is sending a strong signal. This will change behaviour, while allowing business time to adjust and make the necessary investment in alternative waste treatment routes.</p>

Data on fly-tipping levels are therefore only available from April 2004 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/2">Flycapture data shows that in England, 926,534 incidents were reported in the period April 2004 to March 2005. There were 1,034,518 incidents reported from April 2005 to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/3">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 introduced new measures which will help local authorities and the Environment Agency to combat fly-tippings. The 2005 act also introduced increased penalties for the offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.2/4">Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government have also funded the Environment Agency to develop Flycapture Enforcement, a local authority capacity building training package aimed at improving skills in enforcement and helping to improve efforts in prosecuting fly-tippers.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.2/1">Currently, the welfare of dogs used for security of business premises is covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. This Act makes it an offence to ill-treat or cause unnecessary suffering to any domestic or captive animal in England and Wales. We are not aware of any specific welfare concerns regarding the use of dogs for security purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.2/2">The Animal Welfare Bill, which is currently before Parliament, will reduce animal suffering by placing on those who own or are responsible for animals a duty to take steps to ensure their welfare. The Bill will help animal welfare agencies to take action when an animal is being treated contrary to its welfare needs, even if it is not immediately suffering. This means that all domestic or captive animals, including dogs used for security of business premises, must be cared for in accordance with the best animal management practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.2/1">Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) is a development from the system of Integrated Pollution Control which was established under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution set up as the regulator. That body became part of the Environment Agency (EA) on its formation in 1996. The EA has continued to maintain and develop the high level of expertise necessary to regulate the wide variety of often complex industrial activities covered by the Act and the wider variety covered since 2000 by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations. Indeed, the level of expertise needed has increased as a result of the requirements of IPPC, which themselves have become fully apparent only in the light of implementation since 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/2">Even if a comparable breadth of expertise could be found at an attractive cost as a result of a tendering process, the EA would itself still be left inevitably with a range of inspection-related tasks, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/3" class="indent">(i) managing the tender process;</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) ensuring that private sector inspectors have and maintain the necessary</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/5" class="indent">skills and knowledge;</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/6" class="indent">(iii) reviewing inspection reports;</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/7" class="indent">(iv) monitoring compliance with emission limits; and</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/8" class="indent">(v) deciding on the need for and nature of enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/9">Furthermore, difficulties would remain arising from the need for private sector inspectors to have access to installations where national security issues are present.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/10">However, the EA is already using private companies to assist with the assessment of applications for IPPC permits. Contractors are used by the EA to undertake monitoring of industrial releases. This work is undertaken to tight standards and specifications set by the EA.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/11">The EA is continuing to develop its risk-based approach to inspection and the assessment of compliance with permit conditions. Commitment by an operator to the verification of its environmental performance by an independent third party verifier is taken into account by the EA's officers and can result in a reduced level of inspection and charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.461W.2/12">The EA is always watchful for ways of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its regulation and the achievement of environmental goals. This includes the use of a range of regulatory and other tools and could include the further use of private sector resources. One such possibility, which is now under consideration, is that of using synergies with assurance schemes for the intensive pig and poultry sectors, whose installations are expected to account for some 1,200 of the nearly 4,000 IPPC installations regulated by the EA.</p>

	<p pid="b.462W.2/1">This Department has not provided any specific guidance on the public health implications of requiring households to store waste food separately before it is collected. Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 both empowers local authorities to specify the conditions of the waste collection service they provide, and requires them to inform the recipients of those conditions by way of a section 46 notice. The local authority can, under the Act, request that householders place their waste for collection in receptacles of a specific kind and number.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.2/2">Sealable waste containers for external storage are provided free of charge by the majority of local authorities operating separate food waste collections and around half provide kitchen caddies for household kitchens.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.2/3">The Department of Health has confirmed that the storage of household waste for periods of up to two weeks is unlikely to increase levels of biological material carried in the air, either indoors or outdoors, providing that the waste is sealed in the correct container. As far as the Department is aware all food waste only collections are weekly, so storage for any longer periods of time should not be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.2/4">In addition to local authority collections, the Government also encourages home composting as a good way of diverting biodegradable waste from landfill. The Waste and Resources Action Programme is working with local authorities and other partners to improve the uptake of home composting through the distribution of one million home composting bins to households across the country.</p>

The pilot schemes used weight-based technology, including radio frequency identification chips, which enabled local authorities to measure how successful efforts were to reduce residual waste and increase recycling. As well as encouraging more sustainable resource use, increase recycling rates help divert waste from landfill and therefore contributes to our efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

If at the licensing stage it is assessed that there is a risk that the equipment will be diverted from its stated end use, and hence not meet the requirements of the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria, a licence will not be issued. Our diplomatic posts monitor local developments closely and note any information that comes to light that equipment supplied by the UK has been used in a manner inconsistent with the Consolidated Criteria. This will be taken into consideration when assessing any future export licence applications. The relevant licence may also be revoked, and the authorities in the country concerned asked to investigate.</p>

	<p pid="b.469W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) produced 3,000 copies of the 2006 Annual Report on Human Rights. 3,000 CD-ROM versions are also being produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/2">The overall budget for the Report was &pound;135,000. Final invoices have yet to be received, but the final cost will be very close to this figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/3">500 copies of the report have been given to The Stationery Office. 30 copies of the report have so far been distributed free of charge to hon. Members and noble Peers, including the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC). Copies have been laid in the Libraries of both Houses, and sent to foreign embassies in London (175), human rights-related non-governmental organisations (203) and educational institutions (65). Copies have also been distributed to various Departments in the FCO (approximately 200 to date) and to all FCO overseas posts (approximately 450 to date), who pass them on to host Governments. Approximately 200 copies were distributed at the report's launch.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/4">The overall cost of postage is not yet available. A contracted, temporary member of staff arranged distribution of the initial batch of copies to the recipients listed above. The portion of his fee attributed to this (included in the overall budget figure, mentioned above) was &pound;590.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/5">Requests for extra copies were still being received from posts, Departments and other contacts. Experience shows that posts and Departments request further copies for specific events throughout the year. The final number of gratis copies issued will not be known for some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/6">Officials in FCO Departments responsible for each country and subject area contributed the information in the report, in addition to the editorial team in the FCO's Human Rights, Democracy and Governance Group (HRDGG), which is responsible for publication. It would incur disproportionate cost to assess the total number of staff who contributed.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/7">There is no specific criteria for excluding information from the report, except that which falls outside the time scale it is intended to cover. The basic shape of the annual report has been in place for five years and is now well established. Contributors take on board recommendations from the FAC when compiling the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.469W.2/8">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary agreed the outline ;and general content of the report at the beginning of the process, some six months prior to the intended launch date. HRDGG co-ordinated the publication of the report and, as such, has editorial control of the process. Contributors determine the exact content. These contributors are the FCO policy leads for each country or topic, with input from posts. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary approved the final version of the report.</p>

	<p pid="b.471W.5/1">Successive reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General have made clear Iran's failure to co-operate folly with the IAEA and its failure to address the IAEA Board's concerns. As a result, the Board requested in its Resolution of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase> that the Director-General should report to the UN Security Council the steps required of Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.5/2">Since then the Security Council has taken a close interest. In a Presidential Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>, the Security Council called on Iran to comply with IAEA Board Resolutions, including by fully suspending all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities. Security Council Resolution 1696, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July</phrase>, made the suspension mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.5/3">The IAEA Director-General's <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August</phrase> report makes clear that Iran has not complied with IAEA Board and Security Council Resolutions. Nor has Iran taken the steps that would enable negotiations on a long-term solution to begin on the basis of the generous proposals Javier Solana presented on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase> on behalf of the 'E3+3'(France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US).</p>
	<p pid="b.471W.5/4">E3+3 Foreign Ministers met in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-06">6 October</phrase> and agreed that Iran's approach leaves us no choice but to seek another Security Council Resolution imposing sanctions. We are now consulting members of the Security Council on a draft. We continue to urge Iran to respond positively to our proposals. If Iran takes the steps required by the IAEA Board and the Security Council we remain ready to suspend further action by the Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.472W.2/1">As a result of Coalition military action in 2003, the Iraqi people were freed from decades of brutal dictatorship. Iraq now has a democratically elected government, under a permanent new constitution. Over 12 million people, or 76 per cent. of the electorate, voted in the December 2005 election.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/2">With UK and international help, Iraq is making progress on improving essential services and infrastructure. 4 million more Iraqis have access to potable water than before the conflict, and 9.6 million more have access to a sewerage system. 240 hospitals and 1,200 primary health care centres are functioning, 20 hospitals are being rehabilitated and one major hospital is under construction. Over 5 million children have received life saving vaccinations and there has been a resulting decline in malaria, measles, mumps, and polio. Around 5,000 schools have been refurbished and more than 70 million new textbooks have been distributed throughout schools. Electricity generation is currently struggling to meet demand, partly because so many Iraqis have bought new electrical appliances since 2003. However, major repair projects are underway to maintain a sustainable power grid and deliver increased output. The Department for International Department is managing a &pound;40 million programme to improve power and water supplies in southern Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.472W.2/3">There are plainly major challenges ahead&mdash;in particular the need to bring down the appalling levels of violence which some parts of Iraq are suffering. This is the Iraqi government's highest priority&mdash;and ours.</p>

The ceasefire that was established on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-14">14 August</phrase> by UNSCR 1701 is continuing to hold and, with UNIFIL support, the Lebanese armed forces have deployed in the south of the country for the first time in many years.

	<p pid="b.473W.5/1">The dumping of toxic waste in and around Abidjan at the end of August was a very serious and regrettable health risk, causing the deaths of seven local residents. Figures received by the EU in mid-September suggest that as many as 37,483 local residents sought some form of medical attention, although this figure does not necessarily reflect the total number of those affected. The UK, through the European Union Civil Protection Co-operation Mechanism, offered to provide an assessment of the impact of the toxic waste on the environment and population. In the event, however, this assistance was not required as the Ivorian authorities had sought the assistance of a private waste-management company.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister informed the House in a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 71-72WS, at the <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October</phrase> informal meeting in Lahti of heads of state or Government and President Putin, there was a constructive discussion of the EU's external energy relations, in particular our relationship with Russia. There was unity among EU partners on the need to build a close and legally binding partnership based on mutual, long-term benefits based on the principles of the energy charter treaty and the declaration agreed at the G8 summit in St. Petersburg in July this year. These principles include market-based rules, market opening, and transparency and reliability across the whole of the energy relationship. The EU will shortly start negotiations with Russia on a new comprehensive agreement to replace the 10-year-old partnership and co-operation agreement. The EU agreed that these principles should form the core of any new agreement. The Government stand by and will apply these principles firmly, and are counting on Russia, as a key energy supplier to downstream markets, to do the same. The Government see the energy relationship with Russia, and the way in which this relationship is likely to develop, including its EU dimension, firmly within the context of this principle-based relationship. For his part, President Putin stated his conviction at Lahti that energy co-operation should be based on principles of predictability of the energy markets and the mutual dependence of suppliers and consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.477W.5/3">Russia applied to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1993. The European Commission negotiates in the WTO on behalf of the EU. Although the EU and Russia have concluded the terms of a bilateral agreement on market access arrangements for goods and services, other WTO members have yet to do the same. There are also a number of issues that need to be resolved before Russia can accede to the WTO on the right terms and conditions to enable Russia to meet her obligations as a WTO member. It is unlikely that any long-term EU/Russia trade agreement will be negotiated before Russia accedes to the WTO.</p>

The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer that one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice, it is hoped to achieve this by 2008. For some uncommon cancers like acute leukaemia, children's and testicular cancer, this is what most patients already experience. For those patients that are routinely referred but subsequently diagnosed with cancer there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment by the end of 2005. There will also be a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers by 2005. There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: Maximum one month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment guaranteed for children's and testicular cancers and acute leukaemia by 2001. Maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer by 2001. Maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for breast cancer by 2002. Maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for all cancers from 2005.

The dementias and neurodegenerative disease research network is led by teams from University College London and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>
	<p pid="b.491W.2/2">A long-term neurological conditions research initiative is being funded from the Department's policy research programme. The aim is to focus on the commonalities between different conditions, in terms of use of services and life events. The work will establish a baseline picture of the quality of existing health and social care services, and of the experience and needs of those using them, against which to assess the implementation of the national service framework for long-term neurological conditions. It will also explore the transitions and dynamics of living with long-term progressive conditions, including transition to adulthood and into the final stages of life. Projects costing just over &pound;1.5 million have been funded, including:</p>

	<p pid="b.491W.2/9">The policy research programme is also putting about &pound;1.7 million into funding a number of other related research projects on telecare systems for managing long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.491W.2/10">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease in primary and secondary care in June 2006. NICE estimated that there are between four and 20 new cases each year for every 100,000 of the general population, and that between 100 and 180 people in every 100,000 are affected. According to the Parkinson's Disease Society, men are statistically slightly more likely to develop the disease than women.</p>

Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Specialty Care is needed when analysing hospital episode statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties, such as acute. Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. Ungrossed data Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, i.e. the data are ungrossed. Data quality HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i><i> </i>HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.495W.2/3">More specifically, we will aim to support improvements to the regulation of animal use which focus on key areas where regulation and harmonisation would improve animal welfare; improve scientific outputs; provide a more level playing field within the European Union; and improve the European Union's competitiveness with other economic regions without compromising science and welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.495W.2/4">We do not believe that wholesale changes to the directive are necessary to achieve the main benefits sought of harmonisation and animal welfare. In general, we believe that the directive has stood the test of time well and still provides a sound framework for regulation. It has proved flexible enough to adapt to change in many areas and to incorporate technical progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.498W.2/2">We are unable to determine if there was an increase in facilities for those seeking treatment who experience problems associated with the use of cannabis between 2002 and 2005, as drug treatment services are generally designed to meet the needs of a range of substance misusers, rather than for specialised cannabis users.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/3">However, the percentage change in the number of people entering drug treatment between 2003-04 and 2005-06 where cannabis has been identified as the primary substance of misuse is an increase of 117 per cent. The percentage increase relates to numbers accessing treatment and not increases in the numbers using the drug. These figures in fact suggest that the Government's substantial investment in drug treatment is paying dividends, with quicker access to more effective treatment for drug misusers.</p>

	<p pid="b.502W.6/2" class="indent">The unit's outreach officers are implementing their plan to establish working relationships with all LEAs by the end of 2007-08. Between January and September 2006 35 LEAs were visited. Where possible, corresponding constituency offices were also visited.</p>

	<p pid="b.502W.6/4" class="indent">A new set of parliamentary educational films, entitled 'You've Got the Power', have been produced for primary and secondary schools. These films are supported by teacher and student workbooks, which are linked to the learning outcomes for the citizenship strand of the national curriculum. Packs containing the films and workbooks are available free on request to schools, with over 10,500 copies requested by teachers between July and September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.6/5" class="indent">New activities for students, with lesson plans for teachers, have been made available on the educational website, 'Explore Parliament', covering topics such as the importance of rules/laws, how legislation is passed, and the work of MPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.6/6" class="indent">The unit is working with the Hansard Society to produce a revised version of their 'MPs in Schools' pack and a new accompanying website in 2007, along with a series of workshops for Members and their staff to explore what more can be done to engage with young constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.6/7" class="indent">The unit is organising a conference in November 2006 to share best practice for education staff from other parliaments and assemblies.</p>

This financing has been made available through DFID's Helmand Agricultural and Rural Development Programme and will finance 49 km of road construction to begin in March 2007.

	<p pid="b.507W.5/1">Government revenues in Afghanistan are among the lowest in the world. Last year revenues totalled just $500 million. This represents under $20 per head or 5.5 per cent. of GDP, less than half the average for other low income countries. The need to provide essential services, coupled with the massive cost of rebuilding Afghanistan after more than two decades of conflict, makes raising domestic revenues one of the highest priorities of the Government of Afghanistan. DFID supports the Government's revenue raising efforts through a three-year &pound;6.5 million technical assistance project in the tax department. DFID does not have a specific policy on road taxes but supports the Government's attempts to diversify revenue sources and increase collection rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.507W.5/2">The introduction of road tolls is one of a number of new initiatives that the Government have put in place in recent years to meet this challenge. The road toll scheme is only small at present (it is estimated to raise around $7 million in the current fiscal year), but it does have the potential to make a more sizable contribution over time. Other, more significant reforms that are making immediate contributions to meet this challenge include the establishment of a large taxpayers office, improvements in income tax collection and customs tariff rationalisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.508W.0/1">The average annual income in Afghanistan is approximately $300 but most people do not receive formal salaries. The income of those on salaries is and specifically those using the Kabul to Kandahar highway is likely to be much higher. The average pay for a civil servant in Kabul is around $100 a month and the average in the private sector and in aid agencies is significantly higher. For instance average pay for a junior manager in the private sector or local NGO is around $400 a month, or double that in an international NGO.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/2">The tolls for the use of the four roads in the scheme are in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.508W.0/5"> <td></td> <td><i> Monthly</i></td> <td><i> Quarterly</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.508W.0/6"> <td>Passenger vehicle</td> <td>200 Afs ($4)</td> <td>500 Afs ($10)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.508W.0/7"> <td>Light commercial vehicle</td> <td>1000 Afs ($20)</td> <td>2500 Afs ($50)</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.508W.0/8"> <td>Light commercial vehicle</td> <td>3000 Afs ($60)</td> <td>12000 Afs ($240)</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/11">From these rates the monthly fee for using the toll roads would be approximately 1 per cent. the income of a junior manager in a local firm. However, it should be pointed out that the vast majority of users of these roads are taxis, high income users or commercial vehicles. For these users the toll would be spread amongst many people or a lesser share of personal income.</p>

Where a tender is undertaken by the Government of Afghanistan, we expect the Government to follow Afghanistan's Procurement Law, 2005. DFID-Afghanistan's support to the Ministry of Finance Budget Department includes technical advice for improving compliance in Afghan government expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.6/2">Where DFID does directly procure goods and services, and contracts are expected to cost more than &pound;100,000, these must be issued by using the contract processes set out in Her Majesty's Government's public procurement regulations (derived from the European Union (EU) Procurement Directives). The purpose of the Directives is to open public procurement markets to international competition thereby increasing opportunities for all suppliers and service-providers. This reinforces HMG policy on value for money through fair, open and transparent competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.6/3">For contracts below &pound;100,000 procurement must represent value for money which is usually best achieved through competition. However, where competition for lower value contracting is likely to involve disproportionate cost, suppliers may be 'single sourced', with contracts awarded without competition.</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/2">We assess that the principal factors leading to the increases in cultivation in Uruzgan, Badakshan and Day Kundi are insecurity, poor governance and lack of development. Although cultivation has also risen in Nangarhar, it remains at negligible levels across much of the province for the second consecutive year. This is a precedent in Afghanistan. Where cultivation has increased in Nangarhar it has been largely limited to the more remote areas where the shift to legal livelihoods is constrained by insecurity and limited access to land, water and markets. In Balkh, better security, governance and an effective eradication campaign all contributed to a reduction in cultivation. In Farah we assess that drought had an impact on cultivation levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.8/1">In Helmand, DFID is funding &pound;30 million Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme. This programme aims to increase economic opportunities for the rural poor of Helmand by supporting the Government of Afghanistan in the implementation of existing successful National Programmes in Helmand. Preliminary tasks have been undertaken: i.e. sites for road and well building have been identified; engineering surveys conducted; and the Government procurement process started. This programme will construct 200 wells in and around Lashkar Gah city by end March 2007, and 49 km of road will be under construction by then. Should the security situation allow, we also expect to build a further 490 wells in four districts in central Helmand by end March 2007. In the longer term, these programmes will provide improved water and sanitation, essential small-scale rural infrastructure, greater access to small loans, improved roads and access to markets and agricultural inputs and training to the people of Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.8/2">Through the &pound;3 million DFID-funded Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF), the Restorative Agriculture and Rural Economy Research Project, implemented by Mercy Corps, in Helmand, is working on the feasibility of exporting grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms, eggplants and okra, and has made strong contacts with raisin importers (organic and fair-trade). The programme is evaluating at least 10 different small-scale agri-processing industries, and producing case studies of enterprises that prove to have value added, for example tomato paste.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.8/3">DFID has committed &pound;4 million to the UK Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) funding allocation of &pound;6.5 million for the delivery of quick impact projects (QIPS) in Helmand to get short-term development results and help build a platform for longer-term activities. From the total allocation, half has been committed and all will be spent by March 2007. To date, nearly 50 such projects have been funded and implemented. These funds have provided humanitarian assistance to victims of the drought, constructed permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security, improved security around the shrine in Gereshk, reinforced the river bank walls and provided flood defences for the Bowlan bridge. A full list of UK funded QIPs under the four broad sub-headings (Reconstruction and Development, Security, Governance and Counter Narcotics) is as follows as supporting documentation.</p>

	<p pid="b.517W.2/1">Expenditure relating to women's rights activities is not available. However table 1 includes expenditure that has a principle and a significant impact on promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.</p>
	<p pid="b.517W.2/2">Table 2 details expenditure from the bilateral development assistance programme on projects in education (including literacy) and health. Expenditure on activities relating to political reform is not easily defined and can include areas such as good governance through public financial management, anti-corruption, security sector reform and access to justice, but expenditure on these areas cannot be identified separately. However expenditure on local government reform (including Parliament and decentralisation), electoral assistance and public service reform can be identified and have been included in the figures for political reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.517W.2/3">Expenditure on infrastructure includes transport and communication, energy, construction, water supply and sanitation and waste control for this category. Infrastructure expenditure also features in private sector development, information and communication, urban management, agricultural production but the infrastructure element cannot be identified separately and are not included in the figures as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.517W.2/4">A significant proportion of aid programme funding is channelled through multilateral organisations and much of this cannot be broken down by sector. I have therefore provided details of the bilateral project funding as a proportion of the DFID bilateral programme and of total UK gross expenditure on development in each year.</p>

	<p pid="b.521W.5/1">Following the Hamas victory in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections in January this year, the Quartet (US, EU, UN and Russia) set out three principles for support to the Palestinian Government to continue. These were that the Palestinian Government should renounce violence, recognise Israel and accept previous agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.5/2">In the light of the Hamas government's failure to meet these conditions, the European Union has set up a Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) to provide direct support to the Palestinian people. This mechanism avoids channelling funds through the Palestinian Government. DFID intends to contribute up to &pound;12 million to the TIM, of which &pound;9 million has so far been committed to specific programmes. The European Community is contributing &euro;121.5 million. Other European donors are also contributing. A total of &euro;70.5 million has so far been disbursed through the TIM.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.5/3">The TIM is providing several types of direct support. Since it was established 97,000 Palestinians have received needs-based allowances. These allowances have supported health care workers, teachers and the most vulnerable citizens in Palestinian society. Over 2.4 million litres of fuel have been provided for emergency generators at water pumping stations, waste water facilities, hospitals and health centres in Gaza. This has enabled essential services to continue after damage to Gaza's only power station in an Israeli air strike. DFID funding is contributing to allowances for poor Palestinians, health supplies, and to repair, maintenance and running costs for electricity, water and sanitation services.</p>

	<p pid="b.526W.0/2">There have been no vacancies in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the last 12 months that required candidates to have at least a grade C in English and Mathematics GCSE, as all recruitment is competency based. Candidates for administrative positions will provide evidence of competency in English and Mathematics, where necessary, at interview or through testing.</p>

	<p pid="b.534W.12/1">Since 1997, direct support to promote mode shift from road to rail has been provided in the form of freight facilities grants, track access grants and company neutral revenue support. In addition, the Government have provided continued support to the rail freight industry through its policies towards the railways, specifically through the Railways Act 2005. These policies have contributed to considerable growth in rail freight moved in the period, up 46 per cent. between 1996-97 and 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.534W.12/2">In the same period, the Government have also awarded grants of &pound;54 million for water freight schemes. These will have saved over one billion road miles worth of lorry journeys on our roads. Last year we introduced a new waterborne freight grant scheme to assist both inland waterways and shipping companies with their operating costs. Since 2002, we have also implemented the recommendations of the Freight Study Group, which the Government established to consider how more freight could be carried on inland waterways. This included the setting up and funding of Sea and Water, an organisation specifically set up to represent the industry and promote water freight. We have also funded the costs of a Sea and Water database to provide all the necessary information potential water freight customers.</p>

	<p pid="b.536W.5/1">Most users of goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes need to hold an operators licence to perform haulage work on public highways. However, The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 allow for certain classes of vehicles to be exempt from this requirement. These exemptions are deliberately narrow in scope and apply mainly to specialist vehicles not often used on the public road.</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.5/2">Currently, tractors are exempted when they are used on roads for specified agricultural purposes, e.g. hauling produce within 24 km of a farm. The Department for Transport are reviewing the existing operator licence exemptions, including those for agricultural vehicles, and we aim to consult formally on proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.542W.0/1">The return envelope is designed to fit the R40 form which is not standard A4 width. The R40 form is 20 mm narrower and the envelope is 5 mm narrower than A4.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.0/2">The R40 is currently being redesigned and from the April 2007 issue, HMRC intend to change both the issue and return envelopes. The issue size will be A4 to accommodate enclosures that are sent out with the form. The return envelope will be C5. This will reduce the amount of postage required.</p>

	<p pid="b.542W.3/2">In March 2006 we published the final regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations. It estimated an increase in tax revenues of between &pound;8 million and &pound;52 million in the first year following introduction of the legislation. This rises to between &pound;40 million to &pound;240 million after 10 years. The RIA also estimated that in the first year the legislation would lead to an initial increase in labour supply of 3,000 people aged 65 and over, leading to a total increase to 14,000 after 10 years.</p>
