They include working with law enforcement agencies and others, both in the United Kingdom and in source countries, to improve investigation and evidence gathering to support prosecutions of trafficking cases. The CPS is also encouraging victims of human trafficking to support criminal proceedings.

	<p pid="a.632W.0/1">The Government have set a target for Departments to pay invoices from small and medium sized entities within five working days of the receipt of a validly rendered invoice. As it is not practical to distinguish SMEs from other suppliers, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) applies this target to all payments. From May 2010 to May 2011 DECC paid 85% of invoices with five working days. 7,729 invoices worth &#163;551 million were paid within five working days. The remaining 1,318 invoices, worth &#163;266 million, were paid after the five-day target and include a number of invoices from larger suppliers one of which was for &#163;103 million. 99.9% of invoices were paid within standard commercial terms of 30 days.</p>

	<p pid="a.636W.10/1">All pig producers must comply with relevant environmental and animal welfare legislation, which applies equally to all livestock farms, regardless of size or production system. Poor welfare may occur in both intensive and extensive systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.10/2">The Animal Welfare Act 2006 protects the welfare of animals on-farm and makes it an offence to cause suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals. This means that anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to ensure the animal's welfare needs are met. DEFRA has also published a pig welfare code on its website which encourages high standards of husbandry and which farmers are required by law to have access to, and be familiar with.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.10/3">DEFRA has not made any specific assessment of the implications for animal welfare of intensive pig farms. It is important to recognise that poor welfare may occur in both intensive and extensive systems. This is echoed in the current scientific advice from the Farm Animal Welfare Council, that the most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which it is reared.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.10/4">Large scale pig units are subject to the integrated pollution prevention and control directive (IPPC). Implemented through the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010, this is the regulatory instrument for preventing and controlling emissions from industrial installations, including sites for the intensive rearing of poultry and pigs that reach or exceed stated thresholds. Under the IPPC directive, operators of affected installations are required to control emissions by demonstrating that the site is compliant with best available techniques (BAT). What are considered to be BAT in each case will be for the Environment Agency, as regulator, to determine.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.10/5">In line with the progressive reform of the common agricultural policy, it is important for the UK pig sector to compete globally. We therefore welcome innovative and entrepreneurial efforts by farmers to improve their competitiveness while protecting the environment and meeting animal welfare standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.3/1">DEFRA does not have a definition of locally-sourced food. This is because there are wide variations in what is considered to be local.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.3/2">A consumer survey commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and published in 2007 indicated that the term local is interpreted differently by UK consumers with some considering it a small geographic area (40 miles) and some considering it as food sourced from a wider area (e.g. county, region or country). A number of organisations have sought to define 'local food'. However these differ greatly in their criteria and on the size of geographic area considered local, making them unsuitable for an over arching definition for general use. Where it is used businesses should be able to explain what it means. If consumers have concerns about the origin of their food they can ask for details at the point of purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.3/3">Finally, there are EU schemes which allow for the protection of certain food and drink products which carry the name of a geographical area and which owe their distinctive characteristics and reputation to the area in which they are produced. Scotch whisky is probably the best know of these protected names but others include Cornish clotted cream, Scotch beef and Melton Mowbray pork pies. It is our policy to actively encourage more UK applications under these schemes.</p>

Data collected from a number of existing wind farms have indicated that, for the majority of locations, there is little or no evidence of a significant impact on birds. Careful site selection is important to avoid potentially significant impacts, and within the planning process environmental impact assessments are prepared for proposed wind farms. The RSPB has noted in its own reports that</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.3/2">The Government's aspiration is for a truly national high speed network. While there are no detailed plans at this stage for any extension to Wales, subject to the outcome of the current consultation, the Government would consider options for further high speed links with other parts of the UK such as Wales as the network develops over time.</p>

HS2 classic compatible trains running a high speed to Lichfield and then at conventional speed via Crewe could help significantly reduce journey times to Chester and North Wales from London.</p>

	<p pid="a.646W.5/1">A national high speed rail network serving Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London would release considerable capacity on the existing network for additional services.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.5/2">As well as enabling the provision of up to 14 high speed services an hour into London, the first phase of High Speed 2 (HS2) alone (the London-West Midlands line) would release sufficient capacity through the transfer of long distance services to enable more than 160 new services a day on the existing West Coast Main Line. The illustrative service specification drawn up by HS2 Ltd indicates that train frequencies could almost double at some towns&#8212;providing thousands of extra seats, along with more reliable, quicker, more frequent and less crowded trains for commuters during rush hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.5/3">Some of the largest increases in service levels could be seen in towns such as Milton Keynes (potentially almost 90% increase in services), Northampton (46%) and Tamworth and Lichfield Trent Valley (80% each).</p>
	<p pid="a.646W.5/4">The second phase of HS2 (the proposed branches to Leeds and Manchester) would see these benefits spread to the East Coast and Midland Main Lines. Work on released capacity on these lines will be undertaken as part of HS2 Ltd's ongoing work on route options for Phase 2 of the network.</p>

HMCTS has significantly increased its capacity and 38% more social security and child support appeals were cleared in April 2011 compared to April 2010 (and 65% when compared to April 2009)1. It is continuing to increase its capacity through the recruitment of additional staff and judicial medical tribunal members as well as through a range of business improvements. As HMCTS continues to bring additional resources on line, the outstanding caseload is expected to continue to fall, reducing waiting times for tribunal hearings.</p>

	<p pid="a.654W.5/11">The closure of the contact centres will not affect face to face services and face to face centres are unaffected. The rationalisation of Jobcentre Plus offices can be completed without impacting on the service offered to customers. The contact centre network is virtual, meaning that calls are routed to the next available agent no matter where they are in the country. Similarly, customers do not actually have direct contact with benefit processing sites - benefit enquiry telephone calls are dealt with in the contact centre network.</p>

Most comprehensively have been two large Surveys of Employers Policies, Practices and Preferences Relating to Age. The surveys were undertaken in 2006 and 2010 and are based on a sample of approximately 2,000 employers.

	<p pid="a.656W.2/1">There has been no reduction of specialist support to help people with disabilities and health conditions move into employment. In April 2011 the Department put in place a new Jobcentre Plus based support regime for those with health conditions and disabilities, including those in receipt of incapacity benefits. This offered a much more flexible, tailored approach to support based on individual needs, not the rigid system of work focused interviews delivered through Pathways to Work. In the transition to the Work programme, the Department worked hard to ensure there were no gaps in provision. Now that the programme is live, people are receiving the more intensive, personalised support it offers.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.2/2">The introduction of a one-year time-limit for people receiving contributory employment and support allowance in the Work Related Activity Group is scheduled for implementation in April 2012. For those claimants in the work related activity group, time already spent on contributory employment and support allowance before the change is introduced will count towards the 365 day time limit. This is not affected by the level of support that was available to claimants through Pathways to Work or that is now available through the Work programme.</p>

This change will also be reflected in the qualifying criteria for personal independence payment and the consequence of those changes is that more people will be able to claim and receive personal independence payment and continue receipt of that benefit through beyond state pension age if they continue to satisfy the conditions of entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.5/3">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-17">17 March 2011</phrase> (Official Report, column 516W) about the cost details of the WE177 nuclear weapon programme. I apologise for the delay in writing to you; this has been due to the need for The National Archives (TNA) to review their file holdings.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.5/4">The WE177 free-fall bombs were in service with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy for over 30 years, and were finally retired in 1998. Due to the length of time that this weapon has been out of service, many files have been placed in TNA, although a considerable number are retained within the Ministry of Defence's own archives, as well as those of the Atomic Weapons Establishment. It would be necessary to retrieve and examine all of these files to identify whether they hold relevant information. If the information was located - which is by no means certain - we would then need to extract and collate the information and update historic costs going back over 30 years to a 2011 price base to answer your question. This would require significant effort and could therefore only be done at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.5/5">I know that this response will be disappointing to you but I do hope that you will appreciate why I feel that it would be inappropriate to ask for such a significant amount of work to be undertaken in the circumstances described.</p>

	<p pid="a.677W.5/4">ONS collects data from across the civil service on reason for leaving (for those employees who left the civil service in the 12 months up to the survey date, usually <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> each year). ONS is currently working closely with Departments to improve the quality of information that is supplied. However, this is an annual survey and there are currently no plans to change the frequency of collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/5">The Home Office is fully committed to meeting the Government's transparency agenda and is actively considering ways to make more of its key HR data more readily available. However, the Department has clear obligations to its employees to ensure that personal data are not released, and that it is not published at a level that could lead to the inappropriate identification of individual employees. In addition, and in line with the Statistics Authority code of practice, the Department has a responsibility to ensure that any data released are reliable and of a good quality, and any change in reporting frequency and content needs to be agreed with ONS and the Chief Statistician.</p>

	<p pid="a.685W.8/1">In order to answer these questions the UK Border Agency would need to cross reference individual records with the National Offender Management Service. This would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.8/2">However, I can advise that the UK Border Agency makes every effort to ensure that a foreign national prisoner's removal by deportation coincides, as far as possible, with his or her release from prison on completion of sentence. Where sentence length allows, consideration of an individual's case will be commenced 18 months prior to the earliest point of release.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.8/3">All foreign nationals subject to removal and serving a determinate sentence will be considered by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) under the Early Removal Scheme (ERS), which allows for early removal up to a maximum of 270 days prior to the halfway point of the sentence, subject to the serving of a requisite period. In 2010, the UK Border Agency removed 5,235 foreign national prisoners. Approximately a third of these removals occurred within the ERS period.</p>
	<p pid="a.685W.8/4">I can also advise that all foreign national prisoners when removed from the UK are entered on our watch list, so checks can be made to prevent those who are barred and those who have no right from re-entering the UK. Requests to revoke a Deportation Order from outside the UK can be made at any time, but applications are likely to be refused unless at least 10 years have passed, unless the refusal to revoke would breach our obligations under the Human Rights Act or the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees or other exceptional circumstances exist. The revocation must be successful to facilitate lawful return to the UK. Even where a Deportation Order has been revoked, visa nationals still require a visa to return to the UK and non-visa nationals must satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules.</p>

Customers will be asked to provide the minimum information necessary to administer their claim, with information already held being reused where possible. Administrative error will be minimised by processing the majority of claims and changes automatically, based on the application of business rules to claimant information.

They do not require permission to contact the media by written correspondence. Prior to a change in policy in July 2010, all decisions on applications for contact by telephone or face to face interview were made locally by governors and no central records were collated. This information could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost. Since July 2010 only applications for face to face interviews have had to be referred to the Ministry of Justice Press Office for approval on behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice. There have been no decisions to allow an interview in this time.</p>

Such key stages include when offenders are moved to open prison conditions, and when they are released. Personal information about the prisoner, such as their custodial behaviour, is not disclosed. There are no plans to make changes to the type of information provided to victims under the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.714W.5/1">The anomalies highlighted in these cases affected prisoners serving a combination of sentences subject to the release provisions of different Acts; that is, where the Criminal Justice Act 1991 applied to one or more of the sentences while the Criminal Justice Act 2003 governed release from the other sentence(s). The problem with such mixtures of sentences had been that there is no clear provision to combine them together into a single sentence as happens when the sentences all fall under a single Act. This produced an anomaly in eligibility for Home Detention Curfew (HDC), with those serving multiple sentences under just one Act having eligibility dates based on the total combined length of all the sentences whereas those serving 'mixed Act' sentences were eligible only on the last of the sentences handed down by the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/2">This issue was addressed by the Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Round</i> and <i>Dunn</i> but was subsequently taken forward and resolved by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Noone</i>. In its judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June 2010</phrase>, the Supreme Court concluded (contrary to the previous Court of Appeal judgments) that mixed Act sentences were not being correctly applied. The court therefore interpreted the 2003 Act Commencement Order in such a way as to make clear that consecutive mixed Act sentences of under 12 months and 12 months or over should be aggregated as if they were all subject to the 2003 Act release arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/3">As a result of this judgment, the relevant dates for all prisoners serving mixed Act sentences were required to be recalculated to ensure they were brought in line with the Supreme Court's ruling. The Ministry of Justice therefore issued a Prison Service Instruction (PSI)&#8212;number 55/2010&#8212;on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-13">13 August 2010</phrase> to inform prisons of the action they were required to take. This resulted in the anomalies highlighted by these cases being removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.714W.5/4">Further steps to address this issue and to put the statutory position beyond doubt are being taken through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-21">21 June 2011</phrase>. We intend to simplify the existing release and recall provisions and to ensure that all future sentences are subject to the same regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.724W.5/2">While we fully support the principles in the new convention, the Government have no plans to ratify it. This is because the final text would not provide sufficient flexibility to meet the UK's needs in a few areas, including health and safety law where the UK differentiates for good reason between domestic workers and other workers. For example, the Government do not consider it proportionate or practical to extend criminal health and safety law, including inspections, to private households employing domestic workers. This would place a huge regulatory and administrative burden on individuals, and could have detrimental social consequences: for example, if increased burdens were to prevent elderly or disabled individuals from employing nurses or carers in their own homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.726W.3/2">While we fully support the principles in the new convention, the final text would not provide sufficient flexibility to meet the UK's needs in a few areas, including health and safety law where the UK differentiates for good reason between domestic workers and other workers. For example, the Government do not consider it proportionate or practical to extend criminal health and safety law, including inspections, to private households employing domestic workers. This would place a huge regulatory and administrative burden on individuals, and could have detrimental social consequences: for example, if increased burdens were to prevent elderly or disabled individuals from employing nurses or carers in their own homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.730W.2/1">Figures published in May by the Bank of England show that the UK's five largest banks lent &#163;16.8 billion to UK Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the first quarter of this year, against a target of &#163;76 billion of new lending in 2011. This means they are currently not on track to meet the targets agreed to in Project Merlin&#8212;a situation which the Government will continue to monitor closely to consider whether it is necessary to take any further action.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.2/2">SME lending data collected by BIS and published by the Bank of England in &#8220;Trends in Lending&#8221; shows that demand for credit remains at historically low levels, but that credit availability had increased slightly for businesses overall. The Bank of England's Credit Conditions Survey 2011 Q1 noted that SMEs overall were experiencing tighter conditions than large corporates, though for those with strong asset positions or cashflows they had improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.2/3">The Department does not, at present, collect information by region and country, but we are not aware of any disparities. The British Bankers Association (BBA) has committed to funding an independent quarterly survey of SMEs on access to finance and also to publish a more detailed dataset on lending. The results of the first survey will be available in July 2011, and the survey should provide more qualitative information on regional lending. The first enhanced dataset on lending should be published in the autumn and will provide more quantitative information on regional lending. In both cases, regional breakdowns will be made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.2/4">We also continue to monitor the level of lending through the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, which is aimed at small businesses without collateral or a track record. In Wales, since January 2009, 635 businesses have been offered loans through the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, with a total value of &#163;56.15 million. Of these, 550 have been drawn down, totalling &#163;47.77 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.9/1">Homelessness data are not collected at constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.9/2">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.9/3"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.740W.9/4">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to ensure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.9/5">Local authority level tables giving this information for 2010-11 are published in live table 784 at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.9/7">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count&#8212;which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, the coalition Government wanted a more complete measure of rough sleeping and when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers&#8212;taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.9/8">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the DCLG website and are given by local authority in the table 2 at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.9/10">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

The constitution and legal status of each partnership will be a matter for the partners, informed by the activities that they wish to pursue. We expect partnerships to be fully open and transparent but it is for local areas to decide what reporting mechanisms are appropriate.

Although this facility draws on the services of several UK brigades, this payment is handled on behalf of those brigades by the Lincolnshire fire and rescue service, through which DFID pays &#163;241,230 for the period 2009 to 2012. DFID and the UK fire and rescue service keep this amount under review jointly. At present both DFID and the UK fire and rescue service find it sufficient and therefore have no immediate plans to increase it.</p>

	<p pid="a.748W.7/2">The academies programme is enormously popular. 1,244 schools have applied to be an academy since June 2010 and 430 have converted already and opened as academies. Research findings are clear that increasing autonomy is linked to raising standards and the latest GCSE results show that standards in academies continue to improve faster than the national average. There remain, of course, those who are opposed to the expansion of the academies programme, but the Government are clear about its benefits and I am delighted that so many schools governors and head teachers also recognise this and are applying for their schools to become academies.</p>

The Government believe that effective use of technology can help raise educational standards, but that those working in the sector are best placed to make decisions about how to use the resources available to them&#8212;including technology. There is a vibrant market for educational software and content in the UK, including mobile applications and many schools and families take advantage of them. The Department's procurement frameworks for ICT in schools allow for flexibility and innovation in the delivery of content and resources to students, including the support of mobile devices.</p>

	<p pid="a.758W.11/2">This is a matter for the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation and the chief executive, Glenys Stacey has written directly to the hon. Member. A copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Glenys Stacey, dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-20">20 June 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/4">I am writing with regard to the parliamentary question you raised on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June</phrase> asking what steps Ofqual will be taking in advance of and during the summer 2011 to ensure that students do not fail to achieve their first choice university place due to errors by awarding bodies in papers or delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/5">Ofqual sets regulatory requirements for all awarding organisations including the requirement for awarding organisations to take corrective steps where any errors have occurred. Ofqual's expectation is that awarding organisations should be able to avoid significant errors in question papers and the marking process.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/6">However, in response to six specific errors appearing in question papers being taken by candidates this summer, I wrote to all awarding organisations on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June</phrase> asking them to carry out extra quality assurance checks on all the papers which students were still to sit in the summer of 2011. Awarding organisations have confirmed that these checks have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/7">Ofqual has also received assurance from awarding organisations that any students who have sat one of the question papers that included a mistake can be confident that procedures are in place to make sure, that so far as is possible, no student is disadvantaged or advantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/8">Any actions undertaken by awarding organisations will depend on the exact circumstances of individual cases. We will be monitoring awarding organisations to make sure their proposed approach and rationale is appropriate to the errors that have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/9">In addition, we are undertaking a daily review of data from GCE and GCSE awards and have planned early August meetings with awarding organisations to-review outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/10">The regulatory requirement for awarding organisations to provide an Enquiry About Results (EAR) process, once results have been published, ensures that there is an avenue for requests for the review of marks where schools or students have concerns. This includes a priority service for students wishing to query an A Level result where a university place is dependent on the outcome. This enables awarding organisations to prioritise and deal with these enquiries quickly as they appreciate the timescales involved in the admissions process to Universities and confirmation of places.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.11/11">I hope this answers your question, if you would like further discussion on this topic or any other regulatory matter, please do not hesitate to contact my PA.</p>

The funding, which ended in March this year, has allowed the NRC to develop an approach to raising the standards of teaching, learning, management and safeguarding in those supplementary schools it works with.

Ofsted will consider outcomes such as pupils' achievement and progression rather than inputs such as the type or amount of careers guidance.

	<p pid="a.764W.2/4">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for response.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/5">Since 2005, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgements made by inspectors in section 5 inspections, including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school, Maintained schools inspected under section 5 include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/6">Table A as follows shows the number of maintained schools judged to be outstanding for overall effectiveness at their section 5 inspection during the academic years 2005/06 to 2009/10 inclusive in England, the North West government office region and Cumbria local authority. It also shows the total number of inspections in each of these areas in each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/7">In September 2009, Ofsted implemented a policy of more proportionate inspection using risk assessment and deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools each year and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. This led to a skew in the sample of schools inspected and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/8">Statistics covering the outcomes of all inspections carried out in each academic year since 2005/06 can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/9"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Documents-by-type/Statistics/Maintained-schools/Inspection-outcomes">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Documents-by-type/Statistics/Maintained-schools/Inspection-outcomes</a></p>
	<p pid="a.764W.2/10">The most recent official statistics release, covering the outcomes of maintained school inspections carried out during the autumn and spring terms 2010/11, was made public on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-15">15 June 2011</phrase> and can be accessed at the same link.</p>

	<p pid="a.766W.5/1">Under section 68 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, local authorities have a duty to assist, encourage and enable the participation in education and training of young people and relevant young adults, including through the provision of careers guidance in schools and sixth-form colleges. It is for local authorities to determine how best to fulfil this duty, taking into account local priorities and the needs and circumstances of young people in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.5/2">From September 2012 (subject to the passage of the Education Bill through Parliament) schools will be under a duty to secure access to independent and impartial careers guidance for their pupils in years 9 to 11. This summer, we will consult on extending the duty to young people up to the age of 18 studying in schools, sixth-form colleges and further education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.766W.5/3">Schools and colleges will be free to make arrangements for careers guidance for young people that fit the needs and circumstances of their students, including determining the appropriate balance between web-based, telephone and face-to-face support.</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.5/13">These figures refer to patients aged 18+ on GP practice lists who are diagnosed with depression. Figures are taken from Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) registers. Depression was introduced to the QOF in 2006-07, and depression registers have been published by the NHS Information Centre since 2007-08. QOF depression registers were presented in 2009-10 for the first time as percentages of estimated numbers of people aged 18+ on GP lists. Source QOF data do not include the number of patients aged 18+ on GP lists, only total lists sizes, hence the need for estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.5/1">No estimates have been made centrally of the cost to the national health service of missed appointments. The financial cost of &#8220;did not attends&#8221; is notoriously difficult to calculate as NHS staff can use missed appointment time productively, seeing other patients; catching up on &#8216;paperwork&#8217; or spending time on personal development and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.5/2">Across the NHS, organisations should be seeking to understand and address how best to achieve reductions in their areas. The introduction of new technologies that allow patients to book and cancel appointments on-line, combined with improved telecommunication systems with the use of SMS texts, email and appointment reminder systems/can all help to reduce missed appointments. We believe that encouraging patients to use the NHS sensibly and responsibly is the right approach; and have no plans for imposing financial penalties on patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.782W.8/1">Ministers have made no assessment of the availability of national health service treatment for varicose veins. It is for local commissioners, in consultation, with patients and the general public, to commission services that will best meet the needs of their population within the resources available to them. In doing so, they will wish to take account of available professional guidance on the clinical and cost effectiveness of particular procedures.</p>
