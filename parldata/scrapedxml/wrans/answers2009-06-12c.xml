	<p pid="c.1020W.6/1">The Northern Burns Care Network has developed proposals for the future configuration of supra-regional burns care adult and paediatric centres, for the treatment of the most serious and highly complex patients. This included an extensive process of engagement and involvement of users/carers, clinicians, and overview and scrutiny committee representatives across the North West, North East, Yorkshire and Humber and North Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.6/2">The recommendations from these proposals will be considered over the next six weeks by the strategic health authority assurance review team, a workshop of Overview and Scrutiny Committees, the National Burns Care Group and the National Specialised Commissioning Group. In the light of advice from these fora, local commissioners will then take decisions about this phase of the response to the National Burn Care Review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.6/3">For the whole of the northern network, the total number of very severe burns patients is estimated to be 11-22 children and 45-55 adults per annum. Based on the recommended configuration being considered for supra-regional centres, the potential number of such patients requiring transfer from Liverpool hospitals would be approximately three children and eight adults per annum. Any patients treated within these services will be transferred back to their local 'regional burn care' centres once they are well enough to continue their rehabilitation and long-term care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1020W.6/4">The National Burn Care Group has developed clinically-led standards for specialised burn care based on the National Burn Care Review. Currently, no hospitals in the northern network meet the new burns care standards for Supra-Regional Centres. The new proposals are an initial step towards achieving these standards. In addition, support from the Northern Burn Care Network will continue to be given to upgrade the facilities of Regional Burn Care Centres across the network and also to strengthen the Regional Centres to enable them to give improved support to patients currently treated for more minor burn injuries in primary care and district general hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1021W.8/1">The Department does not allocate funding to specific treatments in national health service facilities and so does not have this information. However, throughout the last three years, the Government have been running the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, which is helping the NHS implement National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance for the treatment of common mental health problems and over the next few years will make cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) more widely available than ever before. This is because CBT is one of the key treatments recommended by NICE.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.8/2">In 2006-07, the programme launched two pilot projects in Newham and Doncaster, to which it allocated a total of &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.8/3">In 2007-08, the programme also ran 11 smaller pilots, to which it allocated a further &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.8/4">In 2008-09, a national roll-out of NICE-compliant psychological therapies began with the creation of services in 35 primary care trusts (PCTs) costing a total of &pound;33 million. This involves a training programme for 3,600 new therapy workers over three years. Initially, the training for this workforce has focused on CBT because this is where the biggest shortage lies and it supports the NHS in delivering the NICE treatment guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="c.1021W.8/5">This investment is continuing to increase substantially, with a further 80 services coming on stream in the autumn bringing the total to &pound;103 million in 2009-10, and every PCT beginning to establish these new services in 2010 when the investment will rise to &pound;173 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1022W.2/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends the national health service to offer cognitive behavioural therapy as a treatment for: antenatal and postnatal mental health problems; anti-social personality disorder; anxiety; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; bipolar disorder; borderline personality disorder; dementia; depression in adults, children and young people; drug misuse; bulimia; obsessive compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; schizophrenia; self-harming; and violence. The actual use of this treatment is recorded in individual patient records and not held centrally. No data are held centrally on the average waiting time between diagnosis and the start of treatment. However, one of the central aims of the improving access to psychological therapies programme is to ensure that people needing to access these treatments are able to do so more rapidly by providing them in primary and community settings, such as general practitioner surgeries.</p>

The Department also trialled a scheme which is now being rolled out across Government which adjusted the voltage used to the lowest optimal level. The Department has also replaced new gas boilers with more energy efficient ones, which means that our premises are able to respond more effectively to changing weather conditions while ensuring the safety of staff is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.2/1">There has been no recent consideration of the merits of fixed-term sentences for serious violent offences. No two cases are the same and the Government believe that the courts should be able to take into account all the circumstances in each case to determine the appropriate sentence. The Government have provided the courts with more options for dealing with serious violent offences, including indeterminate sentences where appropriate: the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a new sentence of imprisonment for public protection for dangerous offenders. Under this sentence, the court sets the minimum tariff to be served by the offender and release is determined by the Parole Board on the basis of the risk presented to the community. The Government believe that this sentence offers the best protection to the public from the most dangerous violent, and sexual, offenders.</p>

	<p pid="c.1033W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how long on average a jobseeker's interview with a personal adviser (a) for initial assessment (b) to make a jobseeker's agreement (c) to sign on and (d) for other purposes lasts. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/4" class="indent">Everyone making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) has a one-to-one interview with a personal adviser to assess their circumstances, discuss and set in place a Jobseeker's Agreement and make sure they have information about and access to the help they need. The average length of this interview is 40 minutes, but the actual time taken will vary depending upon individual customer needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/5" class="indent">Following the new jobseeker interview, customers are usually required to attend face-to-face fortnightly jobsearch reviews, the purpose of which is to make sure they are actively seeking work (and therefore entitled to JSA) and to see what help, if any, they need. The average time allocation for these contacts is 7.5 minutes, but the actual time taken will vary depending upon customer needs. Following the new jobseeker interview, many people find work very quickly (about 60% by 13 weeks) and need little, if any, additional help, so jobsearch reviews will involve a limited discussion to make sure people are actively seeking work and making best use of appropriate vacancy sources. Other customers will need more support in which case jobsearch reviews will take longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/6" class="indent">For those people who do not find work quickly, a review is undertaken at or around 13 weeks. The average length of this review is 20 minutes, but the method of delivery and duration of contact will vary, depending upon individual needs. The process usually involves a one to one discussion with an adviser, particularly where the Jobseeker's Agreement needs revising and the customer needs more help to agree how best to increase their chances of finding work, but group sessions may also be used to give general information about access to jobs and services to help improve job prospects. Following the 13-week review process, people continue to receive regular jobsearch reviews, but for a period of six weeks, these are on a weekly (rather than fortnightly) basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1033W.2/7" class="indent">As part of the recently announced six-month offer, all customers reaching six months unemployment are now allocated a personal adviser who will see them regularly to help prepare and follow through an action plan, which will offer the best chance of leading to a job. The amount of adviser time allocated for the initial interview is 50 minutes, though the time actually taken will vary depending upon individual circumstances and what is decided and agreed will happen next. Following the initial interview, advisers have an average of three hours contact time for each customer, which is used flexibly by advisers to suit individual customer circumstances and needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-15">15 May 2009</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/2">The UK Government have made a commitment to develop and deliver a fully Integrated Employment and Skills (IES) system in England by 2010-11. This new integrated service will bring together and reform existing employment and skills services to better help jobseekers get the right balance of job search and training to help them into sustained employment and to progress in their career and, in particular, to help those with basic and employability skills to engage with the labour market and get, keep and progress in a job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/3">Under the auspices of this service:</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/4" class="indent">Claimants will receive personalised support from a Jobcentre Plus adviser who will work with customers to identify the steps appropriate to enable a swift return to work, including referral to careers advice or skills training where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers are able to agree early access to the job search and training support offered by the New Deal for people whose circumstances may make it particularly hard to find work. The introduction of the Flexible New Deal will establish a new, individually-tailored approach for all job seekers, whatever their age, skills or barriers to work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/6" class="indent">The Employability Skills Programme (ESP) enables people in England to train full-time from day one of a jobseeker's allowance (JSA) claim where there are both basic and employability skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/7" class="indent">Local Employment Partnerships (LEPs) ensure that disadvantaged customers get the preparation and training that enables them to meet employers' needs with the expectation that, in return, employers with vacancies give them a fair shot at getting a job.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/8">We are working jointly with the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Learning and Skills Council to ensure that when people move into work they continue learning through apprenticeships or Train to Gain. This will enable them to remain in work and continue to progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/9">In addition, in response to the current economic downturn, the Government have announced that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/10" class="indent">Funding of &pound;158 million has been made available through the European Social Fund for the Learning and Skills Council's Train to Gain programme for people who are newly unemployed or facing redundancy to undertake training linked to opportunities in the local labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/11" class="indent">From April 2009 LEPs have been made available to all claimants from day one of unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/12" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> we launched a significant package of help for jobseekers, including those with lower level skills, who find themselves out of work for six months or more. This support includes, amongst other things, access to 75,000 new work-focused training opportunities to help customers significantly increase their skills in order to enter work. The training, delivered on a part-time or full-time basis, will support people in progressing towards a full qualification.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/13" class="indent">We have removed barriers to full-time training making it easier for long-term unemployed people to get access to new skills in order to compete for the local jobs on offer. The Government have put the funding arrangements in place to enable jobseekers at the six-month point in their claim to move to a training allowance in order to benefit from full-time intensive training of up to eight weeks, designed to meet employers' needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1040W.0/14" class="indent">The Budget 2009 announced a guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training, or meaningful activity to all 18 to 24-year-olds as they approach the 12-month stage of their claim to jobseekers allowance (JSA).</p>

	<p pid="c.1041W.0/1">The Government already provide back-to-work support for those wishing to re-enter the labour market, including those aged 50 and over, through Jobcentre Plus, local employer partnerships, the new deal and pathways to work. We intend to extend this as detailed in the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/2">However, in response to the current economic downturn the Government have already committed &pound;0.5 billion of additional support to help prevent people out of work from becoming long-term unemployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/3">We have doubled the resources available to the Rapid Response Service. The service offers support across the country for those people facing redundancy with immediate help and advice, including skills assessments and retraining, to ensure that people get back to work as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/4">Since April, financial incentives of up to &pound;2,500 have been available to employers that recruit and train people who have been unemployed for six months or longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/5">We have also introduced extra funding for training places to help unemployed people learn new skills to maximise their chances of getting jobs from the 455,000 unfilled vacancies in the three months to April 2009. In addition there are opportunities to volunteer, to help people back into work habits, and help to start a business, with advice on creating a business plan plus funding for the first months of trading.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/6">A major factor in the employment of older people is employer behaviour. In addition to providing generic good practice guidance to employers, the UK's Age Positive initiative is working in partnership with business leaders to develop sector-based models of flexible retirement to support the increased employment and retention of older workers and the removal of fixed retirement ages.</p>
	<p pid="c.1041W.0/7">Our plans for the future include providing guidance to older workers on their options for working longer, encouraging employers to increase flexible work and phased retirement opportunities, a review of the Default Retirement Age in 2011&mdash;if it is found to be no longer needed it will be removed&mdash;monitoring the impact of the economic downturn to identify which groups are being most affected and targeting further help where it is most needed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1043W.9/1">Airspace planning and regulation is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. Under this process it is for airspace change sponsors, mostly NATS, other air navigation services providers and airports, to develop and consult upon proposals. Detailed guidance is given on what impacts are to be taken into account, advice on methods to assess the relative impact of changes and who should be consulted. Informed by the consultation, the airspace change sponsor submits the proposal to the CAA's directorate of airspace policy for assessment against regulatory requirements. In determining whether to accept or reject a proposal, the CAA's process reflects the Secretary of State's Directions and Guidance to the CAA on the exercise of its statutory duties and environmental objectives. Detailed information is available on the CAA's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1043W.9/3">As part of NATS' on-going development of proposed changes to the area of airspace known as terminal control north, they are considering the location of, and procedures for arrivals routes and holds for Luton, Stansted and London City airports. Further details are available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1044W.2/9">The Government have no plans to provide statutory financial protection for all flights. They carefully considered an option to this effect in 2005, but rejected it as being disproportionate to the risks faced by consumers.</p>

However, the Carriage of Dangerous Goods Regulations, in line with EC requirements, set out a range of physical and personnel security measures designed to protect vehicles carrying dangerous goods, and their loads, from potential terrorist threats. These regulations are supported by detailed guidance to industry, including advice on pre-employment checks of drivers and other categories of staff who may potentially pose a risk.

In London the projects have ranged from: events and workshops for caterers, chefs and food buyers; guidance and promotional material; one-to-one support for individual London boroughs; to a project in 2008-09 focusing on researching the opportunities to expand the reach of PSFPI in London. Progress reports on the PSFPI projects carried out by the Government offices can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.8/2">In addition, an independent evaluation completed in March found that the PSFPI has had a positive impact on public sector food procurement. Evidence of this success is presented in the report. The report also made a number of recommendations on how performance could be improved and we are considering how to take these forward. A copy of the evaluation is on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="c.1070W.2/1">The Government are committed to supporting parental engagement. That support can take many forms at a local level, such as targeted support and family learning. In the Children's Plan: Progress Report published in December 2008 we outlined further measures to support parents, schools and early years settings in engaging parents as partners in their children's learning&mdash;comprising action to support parents and to prioritise parental engagement throughout the education system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.2/2">It is important that support for parental engagement is embedded in the day to day work of professionals in schools and early years settings and is established as part of the core business of those organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.2/3">This means a variety of funding routes should be used to support parental engagement. However, the main initiatives that cover parental engagement in schools are extended services including parent support advisors and family learning interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1070W.2/4">Because parental engagement is only one element of extended services and decisions are made locally about spending and priorities, it is only possible to give overall government funding on these programmes for this area. Details of funding for these programmes since their inception are set out in the following table.</p>
