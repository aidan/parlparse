	<p pid="b.883W.8/1">As the 2006 White Paper &quot;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994) made clear, we will extend the life of the Vanguard Class beyond its original decommissioning date by five years to deliver a service life of 30 years. To achieve that five year extension will require three additional Long Overhaul Periods (LOPs). Planning is at an early stage but initial estimates suggest this will cost around &#163;1.3 billion between 2014 and 2024.</p>

	<p pid="b.887W.0/2" class="indent">A collective, global aspirational goal of carbon neutral growth from 2020 for international aviation in addition to a 2% per year fuel efficiency improvement;</p>

	<p pid="b.887W.0/6" class="indent">Provisions on assistance for developing states.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.0/7">While this agreement represents a significant step forward internationally, the UK, along with 43 other European states, placed a collective reservation on those elements of the resolution where we believed more ambition is required and where the text could potentially compromise the effective introduction of aviation into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2012. A number of other states also placed reservations on this resolution for different reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.0/8">This is the first global sectoral emissions target but the UK remains committed to pressing for more ambitious international action on tackling the climate change impacts of aviation and in the meantime we will continue with preparations to include aviation in the EU ETS.</p>

We will also continue to press the case for re-prioritisation of EU-level spending, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness and value-added of EU budget expenditure within a smaller envelope.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.15/1">We welcome the Commission's focus on the need for reform of the budget to support the EU's priorities-in particular economic growth. But the Review does not go anywhere near far enough on recognising the economic and fiscal context. We need to see a much stronger focus on prioritisation and where savings can be made. The UK will not support a new EU tax, and such proposals are a distraction from the key issues of how to reduce spending and best support the economy. The Prime Minister also made clear that we will not support any increase to the EU budget in the next Financial Perspective.</p>

Doctors should make every effort to discuss with parents what is in the best interests of the child. The welfare of infants must be paramount, whatever the reason for undertaking the procedure. Any medical procedure must be undertaken in hygienic conditions, with appropriate pain relief and aftercare.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.2/1">A public awareness campaign on organ donation was a recommendation of the Organ Donation Taskforce (ODTF) first report &quot;Organs for Transplants&quot; published in January 2008. The Department of Health provided specific funding to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) to take this recommendation forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.2/2">The amounts paid to external communication agencies for the purpose of promoting organ donation and the organ donation register for 2008-09 and 2009-10 are set out in table 1.</p>

The figures in table 2 are for total spend and therefore include the figures set out in table 1. The campaign, launched in November 2009, included television, radio, press, digital advertising, roadshows in major cities and targeted messages to black and minority ethnic (BME) communities as well as campaign evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.5/1">There are a range of measures in place to control the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and prevent epidemics.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/2">These include providing people with information about risks and safer sex and through provision of open access confidential genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics. Quick access to GUM services is important to diagnose and reduce the spread of infections. In August 2010, 99.6% of people were offered an appointment to be seen within 48 hours at a GUM clinic. This means that more people are being tested early and having infections detected, preventing onward transmission.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/3">The National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) aims to control the most prevalent STI, Chlamydia, through opportunistic screening of asymptomatic infections and early detection and treatment, therefore preventing complications and reducing onward transmission. Since the launch of the NCSP, over 3.6 million young people have been tested and over 266,000 have tested positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/4">The Health Protection Agency has in place comprehensive surveillance systems that can detect outbreaks as well as monitor trends and inform prevention programmes. The agency also has a lead role locally, regionally and nationally in coordinating investigations and respond to and control of outbreaks/epidemics of STIs such as infectious syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.5/5">We know that more needs to be done to ensure all people regardless of age get the right information and advice at the right time to make responsible choices, to increase awareness of risks, to prevent infection, and to access screening and treatment, and we are considering how we can tackle these issues. Later this year we will publish the Public Health White Paper which will set out a cross-government strategy for public health and plans for the new Public Health Service.</p>

No prisoner can be downgraded simply by an adjudication as this is not one of the punishments available to adjudicators. However, an adjudication could be part of a pattern of behaviour leading to a downgrade and punishments also include forfeiture of any of the privileges available under the incentives and earned privileges scheme.

	<p pid="b.909W.0/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has overseen a sustained programme of work to tackle racism in prisons. The most recent published assessment is contained in &quot;Race Review 2008&quot;, and is available from the House Library. The review, overseen by an independent advisory group and described as 'honest and rigorous' by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, concluded that good systems and processes are in place in prisons and that blatant forms of racism have been largely eradicated. However it also concluded that the experiences of black and minority ethnic prisoners and staff have not been transformed and that there remained evidence of differential treatment of black and minority ethnic prisoners. A further programme of work is set out in &quot;Promoting Equality in Prisons and Probation: the NOMS Single Equality Scheme 2009-2012&quot;, also available in the Library, and progress on this will be reported in the 2009-10 annual equalities report which will be published later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.909W.3/1">Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles, and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face to face contact with offenders. In December 2008, NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one-week period, based on a small sample of probation officer (PO) and probation service officer (PSO) staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24% of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41% was involved in computer activity and 35% of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/2">The reporting of the results against only three main headings means that much of the detail is open to interpretation. For example, it could reasonably be argued that time spent on computer activity involving the production of reports and assessments is work on individual cases. Even if only about three-quarters of this time were included as work on cases this gives a picture of more like 54% of time being spent on work with individual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/3">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is taking a number of actions to increase the amount of contact time between probation staff and offenders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/4" class="indent">allocating resources to the assessment and management of offenders according to the level of risk;</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/5" class="indent">as part of the Probation Trusts Programme all areas (including locally initiated mergers) have identified efficiencies through for example the reduction in management overheads, and development, of shared services, to the benefit of front-line staffing levels;</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/6" class="indent">a national programme of specifying probation work, and benchmarking performance, to support the effective deployment of front-line staff;</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/7" class="indent">identifying opportunities for reducing bureaucracy and other demands currently placed on front-line staff;</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/8" class="indent">expanding the use of video conferencing to reduce the time probation staff spend travelling to interview prisoners; and</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.3/9" class="indent">initiating the Offender Engagement Programme to evaluate and improve the quality of face to face work with offenders, its impact on re-offending, and identify and reduce any barriers to that work taking place.</p>

	<p pid="b.916W.5/1">The UK Government were represented at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Vilnius by Dr Sue Baxter, Deputy Director, Europe and International Competitiveness Unit, and one other BIS official with responsibility for internet governance policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/2">The overall theme of the Vilnius IGF was 'IGF 2010 -Developing the Future Together' with five main sessions which effectively formed the 'agenda' of the meeting:</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/3" class="indent">managing the internet's critical infrastructure;</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/4" class="indent">security, openness and privacy;</p>

	<p pid="b.916W.5/6" class="indent">development; and</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/7" class="indent">cloud computing.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/8">Preparatory discussions were undertaken in 113 workshops, best practice forums, dynamic coalition meetings and open forums. The Chairman's summary of the full range of issues discussed is accessible at:</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/9" class="indent"><a href="http://intgovforum.org/cms/2010/Chairman">http://intgovforum.org/cms/2010/Chairman</a>'s.Summary.Expanded.pdf</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/10">The IGF is not a negotiating forum so there are no formal outcomes as such. However, it is clear from the sustained level of support from stakeholders-over 1,450 attendees including representatives from over 90 governments, business experts, civil society representatives, academics, technical experts and parliamentarians, with an additional 600 participating remotely-that the IGF plays an important role in enabling stakeholders to exchange views and best practice on internet public policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/11">In particular, the UK Government showcased their policy approach on internet inclusion and an online child protection 'toolkit' developed for those Commonwealth members with little or no legal framework for criminalising access to and distribution of child abuse images.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.5/12">The UK also held confidential bilateral meetings with Brazil, China and the USA on internet public policy issues and the decision on the future of the IGF to be taken by the UN General Assembly in December.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.5/1">The Government are supporting manufacturing industries by creating a stable business environment that will give businesses the confidence they need to plan and invest for the future. We are doing this by creating a more supportive tax environment, freeing up credit through the banking system, reducing regulation, maximising the flexibility of the labour market and focusing on training and apprenticeships. For example, we have already redirected &#163;150 million to create up to 50,000 extra apprenticeships, which will be workplace-based and employer-led. The Government announced in the spending review that they will invest up to &#163;200 million to support manufacturing and business development focusing on high growth business and innovation particularly among small and medium sized businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.2/1">Fraud is an offence which the Government take very seriously. Dial-through fraud (DTF) occurs when hackers gain access to a PBX voicemail system or VoIP network and then exploit its vulnerabilities to make national and international calls at a company's expense. According to the Telecommunications United Kingdom Fraud Forum (TUFF) membership survey in 2009, communications and service providers reported that 98% of businesses that were hit by hackers also suffered from DTF.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.2/2">In February 2010, TUFF and BT Wholesale issued a 16 point plan that companies can adopt to prevent DTF and protect their assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.2/3">Fraud arising from unauthorised access to dial-through functions can be exacerbated by non-existent or ineffective access security measures to protect against unauthorised access to on-site or remote maintenance functions. The unauthorised reconfiguration of, or access to system information, can facilitate unauthorised access to dial-through functions. Should companies suspect that they have experienced DTF, they should take the appropriate steps to make their systems as secure as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.8/1">Reservation and assignment of the 116 000 number and all other reserved numbers in the 116 numbering range is a matter for the regulator Ofcom. In allocating interested service providers to numbers Ofcom is guided by an advisory committee established under the Contact Council and now co-ordinated by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.8/2">116 000 was the inaugural and only number established at the time of the original European Commission Decision (2007/116/EC). Ofcom launched a comparative selection process to identify a service provider for the &quot;Hotline for Missing Children&quot; in February 2009. As a result 116 000 was allocated to the charity Missing People and its chosen communications provider BT on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-17">17 May 2010</phrase>. 116 000 is now operational alongside Missing People's existing numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.921W.8/3">Low key promotion of the 116 000 number will commence in November 2010 at selected UK entry points. Pan-European marketing material provided by Missing Children Europe will be used. Operational readiness will then be assessed, leading to a high profile launch of 116 000 in April 2012. At that point, 116 000 will become Missing People's prime contact number, replacing the promotion of the existing three helpline numbers.</p>

Officials advised that company where to seek advice and to report the attack to the police. In the past week this Department has been working with the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) on the similar attack on its website. This is the first time in the last three years that the Intellectual Property Office website has been unresponsive as a result of denial of service attacks. The IPO has taken advice from experts within Government and its service has now been restored. The Government clearly abhor this sort of direct action and the impact it has on businesses consumers and citizens who rely on access to Government websites for the delivery of important services, and call on those taking part to behave responsibly. The question as to whether this can be regarded as a criminal act is a matter for the appropriate authorities.</p>

As the Commission has yet to establish how member states are to estimate these factors it is not possible to estimate the proportion of installed heat pumps that will fail to meet that standard.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.2/1">The potential future demand for housing can be informed by CLG's household projections. The latest projections were published on the CLG website in March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/2031households0309">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/2031households0309</a></p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/3">and are based on the 2006-based population projections produced by the Office for National Statistics. They provide a long-term view of the net growth in the number of households given a projected population and previous demographic trends. As such the household projections do not take into account changes in policy or economic circumstances that may have a material effect on future household formation and do not explicitly reflect the different tenure pattern and household formation of migrant groups. The household projections reflect a net position; the number of newly forming households net of those that dissolve. Using the zero net migration population variant it is estimated that net international migration could account, on average, for 40% of the net growth in households in England over the projection period from 2006 to 2031.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/4">However, this does not directly equate to the actual effective demand for housing. This will also be determined by factors such as the ability of individual households to meet the cost of housing which is in turn influenced by the wider economic context. These projections also do not take into account the 2008-based population projections, subsequently published by the ONS, which include lower projected levels of net international migration. CLG expect to publish 2008-based household projections in November 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/5">Equivalent assessments were made for the household projections from a 2003-base and 2004-base. Using the zero net migration population variant in the 2004-based projections it was estimated that net international migration could account, on average, for around a third of the net growth in households in England to 2026. The equivalent estimate in the 2003-based projections was that net international migration accounted for around a quarter of household growth from 2003 to 2026.</p>

	<p pid="b.929W.5/1">We appreciate the problems caused by the last Government's increases in the burden of empty property rates, especially given the fact they were imposed at a time when firms faced significant difficulties in renting out empty property. The new Government's ability to take action on this matter is restricted by the high costs-the last Government estimated that the change would increase net tax yield by &#163;950 million in 2008-09. As a result, any action will need to be balanced against the overriding need to reduce public expenditure and support the economy generally by reducing the deficit. However, we keep all taxes under review, including this specific issue. We recognise the burden of business rates on local firms, and we have already taken action to increase small business rate relief and scrap the unfair 'ports tax' on firms which threatened to inflict significant harm on Britain's manufacturing sector.</p>
