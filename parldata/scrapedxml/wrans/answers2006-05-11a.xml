	<p pid="a.385W.3/1">The Government and the Devolved Administrations published their response to the Independent Review of UK Avian Quarantine on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April</phrase>. This is available on the Defra website:</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.3/2"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/control/avianquarantine/pov-strategy/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/control/avianquarantine/pov-strategy/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.385W.3/3">The Government and the Devolved Administrations either accept, or accept in principle, 29 of the 32 recommendations. However, some of the responses are preliminary, pending further consultation with stakeholders or completion of further studies. For many of the recommendations, the European Commission would be responsible for taking forward any necessary action. Two of the recommendations require further consideration, and one recommendation regarding pet birds has been rejected. These are detailed in the Government response.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.3/4">There is currently an EU ban on imports of captive wild birds, which is due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="">31 July</phrase>. A decision on whether to extend the ban will be taken at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.3/5">The key elements of the Government response are currently being implemented and will be in place before imports resume. In addition, all approved quarantine premises will need to be reassessed against revised standards before they can accept any birds into quarantine.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.3/6">In April 2005 the European Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority to carry out a review of the animal health and welfare aspects of imports of captive wild birds, which is due to report in October 2006. This will inform EU policy and we await their opinion with interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.9/1">Final calculations about milk production are still being made, but Although it appears that wholesale milk production was lower in 2005&ndash;06 than 2004&ndash;05, it is too early to tell whether this is a long term trend or has been caused by weather, restructuring etc. The UK is more often under quota than over it and it must be remembered that quota is a limit on production and not a target.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.5/1">The Government supported the conclusion of the Environment, Rood and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2004, that there was no compelling evidence in favour of setting up a regulatory body to oversee the dairy industry. It is difficult to see how a regulator could determine a fair price other than by reference to a market price. A price regulator would almost certainly be incompatible with EU competition law and with the (common organisation of the market in milk and milk products.</p>

	<p pid="a.387W.8/1">Since the Department was established in 2001, we have put in place a considerable programme of reforms and improvements. For example, action on sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements relating to these policy areas can be found at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm</a>. I am confident that the West Lancashire constituency will have benefited from these.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/2">In particular, the West Lancashire constituency has benefited from funding through the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund as well as the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant to deliver household waste recycling levels that are currently well above the national average. Singly, or in partnership with other Lancashire authorities, West Lancashire has received more than &pound;7 million to support progress in this area in the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/3">Under the Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or fertilisers during certain times of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/4">Since 2003, local authority performance on street cleanliness has been measured through best value performance indicator BV199. This assesses the percentage of survey sites in each local authority area with unacceptable levels of litter and detritus. In 2003&ndash;04 West Lancashire scored 18.2 per cent. against a national average of 21.2 per cent., and in 2004&ndash;05 19 per cent. against a national average of 18.1 per cent. These results are for West Lancashire district, comprising the constituencies of West Lancashire and South Ribble. Data are not available at the constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/5">In March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government's Rural Strategy and reflects the Government's commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/6">Lancashire has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra's Project Based Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess. For example, Farmer Ted's Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000 visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/7">The RPA will be releasing details of payments made under the new Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in due course. It will publish an annual figure for payments to each recipient under the SPS drawn from its financial records. The information will be extracted and published on the RPA website later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.387W.8/8">Indicators of environmental quality for West Lancashire district are given as follows, they are for water quality and waste and recycling. Data for other indicators are available only either at regional and/or national level and not local level, or for individual monitoring sites not within the area local to West Lancashire. For some indicators data for 1997 are not available and the nearest year for which data are available has been given.</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.2/2">The Government have sought to establish the facts about the extent of the alleged trade in domestic cat and dog fur in the UK. We have found no evidence that such fur is being imported into this country in significant volumes. The Government have also been working to establish a scientific test to make it possible to ascertain reliably from what species of animal any given fur sample has come.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/3">We firmly believe that action on this issue should and would best be taken at EU level as a harmonised approach would have greater impact, enhance animal-welfare standards within the EU itself and avoid obstacles to the operation of the single market. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs supported calls for the European Commission to investigate these allegations when the Agriculture and Fisheries Council met in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/4">In January 2006, the Commission published its Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, which proposes action in the course of 2006 to address public concerns on the trading of cat and dog fur and derived products. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>, Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Kyprianou stated at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council that the Commission was planning to publish a proposal on the import of cat and dog fur within the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.2/2">The full impact of the timing of 2005 Single Payment Scheme on the timetable for the 2006 scheme will not become clear until the vast majority of payments have been made and any corrective action identified. However, preparation for the 2006 scheme is well under way, with the vast majority of 2005 scheme claimants having received a claim form for this year's scheme. Business processes and IT systems required to process 2006 scheme claims are being developed and deployed on an iterative basis, and data capture of 2006 scheme claims will commence shortly.</p>

However, most of the meetings relating to Sakhalin II since May 2001 have taken place in the context of the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) due diligence and have been with Sakhalin Energy Investment Company (SEIC), in which Shell Sakhalin Holdings B.V. is the major shareholder, rather than with Shell itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.2/1">The Government are proud of its record on employment regulation. This has given the UK a skilled and flexible workforce. We have given people decent rights at work without jeopardising their prospects for employment. Both employers and employees have rights and responsibilities towards each other and we strive to find the right balance and consult closely on all our regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/2">The Regulations behind the above statutory instruments are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/3" class="italic">SI 2001/2673</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/4">The Regulations behind Statutory Instrument 2001/2673 amended the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>. They increased the adult minimum wage rate from &pound;3.70 to &pound;4.10 an hour and the rate for workers aged 18&ndash;21 (inclusive) from &pound;3.20 to &pound;3.50 an hour. They also made a number of other amendments relating to the level of the accommodation offset and workers taking part in accredited training. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is responsible for enforcing compliance with the national minimum wage legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/5" class="italic">SI 2001/2660</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/6">SI 2001/2660 introduced two technical changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to implement the Burden of Proof Directive&mdash;97/80/EC&mdash;the aim of which was to ensure that victims of sex discrimination are provided with effective access to justice, and in doing so promote equal treatment. This Directive applied to the employment field only. These regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/7" class="italic">SI 2001/4010</p>
	<p pid="a.411W.2/8">SI 2001/4010 extended parental leave entitlement for parents of disabled children under 18 from 13 weeks' parental leave to 18 weeks' leave which can be taken up to their child's 18th birthday. SI 2001/4010 also extended the right to parental leave to parents of children under 5 on <phrase class="date" code="1999-12-15">15 December 1999</phrase>. These parents were able to take their parental leave until <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>. SI 1999/3312, which SI 2001/4010 amended, is enforceable through the employment tribunals system.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.2/10">SI 2002/3128 introduced measures to protect young workers and provide fair minimum standards which ensure that young people are protected from excess working time leading to fatigue, risks to health and safety and possible damage to their education. These Regulations are enforceable and I have not been made aware of any difficulties with their operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.2/12">The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 (Statutory Instruments 2003/3319) govern the private recruitment industry in the UK and seek to protect those using the job-finding services provided by employment agencies. It is enforced by the DTIs Employment Agency Standards (EAS) Inspectorate. The Inspectorate can prosecute an agency found to be in breach of the legislation and can also apply for a Prohibition Order preventing an individual from operating as an agency or employment business for up to 10 years. The EAS has a helpline; the number is 0845 955 5105.</p>

	<p pid="a.411W.2/14">SI 2003/1656 amended the Equal Pay Act 1970 in three respects to reflect requirements of European Community law, specifically Article 141 of the Treaty of Rome (equal pay), as applied in a number of recent cases before the European Court of Justice and the domestic courts. It extended the previous two-year limit on the period over which an employment tribunal could award back pay in successful equal pay cases, extended the six-month time limit within which a woman must bring an equal pay claim before an employment tribunal in specific, limited cases, and introduced a new rule that enables equal pay claims to be brought during the period of a stable employment relationship or within six months of it ending. These Regulations are enforceable through the Employment Tribunal system.</p>

Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation ofICD-9 selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23**.

	<p pid="a.417W.2/1">The Office of Fair Trading has been investigating the question of credit card default charges. In April they produced a statement of the principles they think card issuers should follow in setting default charges in their standard contracts with consumers in order to meet the test of fairness set out in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.417W.2/2">The OFT has made it clear that they expect all credit card issuers to recalculate their default charges in line with the principles set out in the statement and to take action where needed to reduce the level of credit card default fees. The OFT also noted that the principles also apply to default charges in other consumer contracts such as those for bank overdrafts, store cards and mortgages.</p>

	<p pid="a.424W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for <i>(a)</i> the Vale of Clwyd and <i>(b)</i> Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years. (68582, 64195 and 65905)</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/4" class="indent">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/5" class="indent">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/6" class="indent">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate' using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/7" class="indent">It is not possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a 'split'.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/8" class="indent">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual 'usual resident' mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as 'registration rates' on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/9" class="indent">This 'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/10" class="indent">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/11" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/12" class="indent">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/13" class="indent">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/14" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/15" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/16" class="indent">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated 'registration rates' for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/17" class="indent">A copy of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.2/18" class="indent">The tables provide as comprehensive as possible comparisons between historic local authority population and electorate numbers. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are also interested in the percentage of residents who are registered to vote on a Parliamentary constituency basis. Official Report number 82 column 1719, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, provides the best possible consistent UK comparison for Parliamentary constituencies. For England and Wales we hope to investigate the possibility of producing population estimates by Parliamentary constituency in the future using Small Area Population Estimates. For Northern Ireland, population estimates by Parliamentary constituency are already available from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA).

	<p pid="a.427W.0/1">The DFID bilateral programme in Angola has commitments of &pound;5 million for the financial year 2006&ndash;07. Expenditure is concentrated in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/2" class="indent">Relief and recovery. This includes support for bridge repairs that are necessary to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected areas of the country. Funding has also been provided for emergency operations to contain the outbreak of the Marburg virus in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/3" class="indent">Strengthening democratisation. Our work here focuses on decentralisation and supporting civil-society contributions to the elections process. We also work with the World Bank to try and improve governance in the country and support the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/4" class="indent">Urban poverty in Luanda. This programme has created space for local communities to organise and better engage with local government on a range of issues, such as local water supply. The programme will end this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/5" class="indent">HIV and AIDS. We are providing support for condom promotion, access to testing and behaviour change programmes, and are also providing anti-retrovirals.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/6">This year, Angola has also received approximately &pound;1.3 million from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACCP). ACCP funds are agreed on a yearly basis. In addition, DFID continues to support de-mining operations in Angola. &pound;1 million has been provided this year for de-mining in the country. A similar commitment is expected in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/7">Angola will also be involved in regional programmes that DFID in Southern Africa is currently developing. This regional programme is a &pound;20 million per annum commitment, addressing regional peace and security, trade and growth, and resilient livelihoods concerns. As part of this regional commitment, we have recently approved an &pound;18 million UNICEF programme to address children affected by AIDS. Around &pound;3 million of this programme will be directed to Angola.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/8">All DFID bilateral resources are managed through third party civil society and UN organisations and not by the Government of Angola.</p>
	<p pid="a.427W.0/9">Allocated bilateral expenditure from DFID is expected to be &pound;3 million for 2007&ndash;08. Angola also benefits from DFID contributions to European Union and the World Bank operations in Angola. The EU has committed &euro;146 million over the five year period from 2002&ndash;07. The World Bank's contribution this year is approximately US$30 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.2/1">DFID staff continually monitor the humanitarian situation (including food needs) in Chad, and undertake periodic assessments in the east of the country. Of immediate concern, is the food situation of the estimated 50,000 Chadians who have been displaced as a result of attacks and violence in the border area with Darfur. The World Food Programme (WFP), along with other UN agencies and non governmental organisations (NGOs), are currently assessing needs and are launching programmes to assist these displaced and vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.428W.2/2">Another critical issue at this time of year is the pre-positioning of food aid for the 205,000 Darfur refugees in Chad prior to the start of the rains. The WFP has indicated that, despite the deterioration of security in April, this process is on-track. The UK provided the WFP with &pound;2 million for its operations in Chad last financial year, and we are considering providing further support.</p>

	<p pid="a.428W.5/1">All DFID staff can access the internet while at work.

Each time staff log on to our computer network, they are required to acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Acceptable Use of IT policy. Our system also alerts staff when logging in that their activity on the system may be monitored. The policy provides clear guidance that misuse of official equipment will be a disciplinary offence, and, subject to the particular offence, could lead to dismissal. The policy applies to civil servants working in the UK and overseas, and to our locally appointed staff overseas, who work under local contacts.</p>

We have flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 in certain circumstances if it is judged to be in the public interest, and similarly, exceptionally, staff below the senior civil service beyond 65. Currently there are three senior civil servants aged beyond 60, and three staff below the senior civil service aged beyond 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.430W.3/2">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations come in to force, introducing wide ranging provisions against discrimination on age in employment and vocational training. The Regulations introduce a default retirement age of 65. DFID is presently considering what its retirement age should be from October 2006. For the senior civil service, it will be 65, in line with the default retirement age. DFID retains its delegated authority to set the retirement age for staff below the senior civil service and will decide shortly whether to adopt the default retirement age of 65 or to have no retirement age at all. The Age Regulations also introduce a &quot;duty to consider&quot; procedure to ensure retirements at whatever age are fair. This will allow employees to request to work beyond the normal retirement age, and require discussions between DFID and the employee about when the employee will retire. Both parties will have to give adequate notice in order to ensure the retirement constitutes a fair dismissal in employment law.</p>

	<p pid="a.431W.2/1">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have equal access to a good quality basic education. DFID is committed to working with the Governments of developing countries towards the education of all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.2/2">DFID's policy on social exclusion is laid out in its September 2005 policy paper entitled 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion'. The paper sets out how DFID will build on the work that is already under way and some practical actions that DFID is taking to tackle social exclusion and make a real difference to the lives of excluded people.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.2/3">Also, DFID's strategy paper of last year, 'Girls' education: towards a better future for all' recognised that certain groups of girls are more likely to be excluded from school on the basis of caste, ethnicity, religion or disability and that disabled children, and among them disabled girls in particular, constitute a significant group that is denied access to education. The challenge is to support governments to provide quality education for excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.2/4">It is not possible, without incurring a disproportionate cost, to identify a comprehensive list of projects supported by DFID which include supporting disabled children's right to education. DFID's approach is to support developing country governments' own education plans rather than directly manage discrete projects. In India, for example, DFID has supported through its country programme, the District Primary Education Programme, which promotes inclusive education, and some states have been successful in integrating disabled children into mainstream schools. In Vietnam, DFID has co-financed with the Government of Vietnam, the World Bank and other donors the Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children programme, a &pound;243 million project which was launched in October 2003 and includes a strong focus on primary education for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.2/5">DFID also provides funding through UK non-governmental organisations to support projects that benefit disabled people and advocate for disabled people's rights. DFID has partnership agreements with a number of organisations that support disability-focused activities, such as World Vision, HelpAge International, Save the Children and VSO, among others. In addition, through our partner Action on Disability and Development, with whom we have a six-year Programme Partnership Agreement, we work to promote greater participation and inclusion of disabled people and their organisations in decision-making processes, particularly on partner governments' Poverty Reduction Strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.2/1">Agriculture in India is generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called 'green revolution' has been the main driving force behind this success, promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas with access to irrigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/2">However, the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed. DFID's focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills, paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as contributing to improvements in production.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.2/3">Consistent with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups. Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture, livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID's rural livelihoods projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.435W.5/1">DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral projects over &pound;1 million at least once a year. This includes money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral agencies since according to international convention this aid is classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID's bilateral projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year's Departmental Report will be published on 9th May.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.5/2">This monitoring system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform decisions around funding for the multilateral agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.436W.2/1">There is a close relationship in action to improve reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children, and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted infection including HIV, including through condom provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.2/2">HIV Pregnant women with HIV and AIDS are four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than un-infected women. Women with HIV need care and services in pregnancy to help protect their own health and to help prevent transmission of HIV to their babies. The United Nations Secretary General's progress report on the 2001 Declaration of Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV. In countries with weak health systems this falls to less than 1 per cent..</p>
	<p pid="a.436W.2/3">DFID is working to support stronger health systems, with more adequate staff, equipment and drug supplies that are needed to improve access to HIV treatment, as well as to provide women with the care needed in pregnancy, especially when complications arise. Sustained improvements in maternal health and AIDS prevention, treatment and care will in large part depend on strengthening basic health services. Access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning services must be an essential part of this effort, and we are working to ensure that the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS in June gives a clear and strong message on the importance of sexual and reproductive health to efforts to make progress in HIV and AIDS.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.2/1">DFID provides some support to sub-Saharan African countries for the development and facilitation of their national policies on trade, and specific issues like tourism, through its bilateral programmes. Much of DFID's support on trade to Sub Saharan Africa is provided regionally through programmes such as the Capacity-Building for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Southern Africa Trade and Poverty Programme, and multilateral through institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.2/2">Governments can access funds for trade delegations to the UK and other destinations from a variety of sources, many supported by DFID funds, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trust Fund for Least Developed Country Travel managed by UNCTAD. This information is not held centrally and would involve a disproportionate cost to collect. For example, a delegation of developing country trade negotiators including from sub-Saharan Africa came to the UK at the end of last year.

	<p pid="a.442W.3/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) will put a greater emphasis on practical cooking skills in the review of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3. QCA is also revising the criteria for food related GCSEs to put a greater emphasis on diet and health, consumer awareness, food safety and hygiene and food preparation skills. The Training Development Agency is aiming to increase the number of food technology training places in initial teacher training. We have invested &pound;1.5 million in professional development for primary teachers through our Food in Schools programme. However, in each school, Headteachers and governors set priorities for professional development and it is for them to decide whether further food education provision is needed for their staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.3/2">In addition, our aim is for all schools to be working towards Healthy Schools status by 2009. The programme now includes a compulsory healthy eating strand. Schools develop whole school food policies, linking what is taught across the curriculum with the food children eat at school, to ensure that consistent messages about healthy food choices run throughout all aspects of school life. Healthy Schools co-ordinators are being trained to support schools, including on healthy eating.</p>

Comprehensive data on subsequent disposal of assets at Fresh Start schools, and therefore income, is not centrally available. However, since 1998, disposal of areas capable of forming a sports pitch has needed approval from the Secretary of State, and there is no recorded instance of such an approval at a Fresh Start school.</p>

	<p pid="a.444W.0/1">The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires all maintained schools to have a wholesome supply of water for domestic purposes, including drinking water. The local authorities together with school governors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Regulations. The Secretary of State can, under Section 497 of the Education Act 1996, take action to enforce compliance with the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.0/2">Independent Schools are subject to The Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2003, which quote The Education School Premises Regulations 1999 in respect of water supplies. The Independent School Standards are the Regulations to which independent schools are inspected under Part 10 of the Education Act 2002. The Independent Schools Registration Authority will consider the inspectors report and can take enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="a.445W.2/1">The Government are investing over &pound;1&frac12; billion in the five years up to 2008 to deliver the first comprehensive national school sport strategy, which went live in April 2003. The strategy's prime objective&mdash;a joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport PSA target&mdash;is to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition&mdash;by 2010&mdash;is to offer all children at least four hours of sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.445W.2/2">Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships. There are currently 411 live school sport partnerships incorporating 80 per cent. of schools in England. All maintained schools will be within a partnership by September 2006. Good progress is being made towards the PSA target. The 2004/05 school sport survey found that 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,4000 schools taking part were spending at least two hours in a typical week on high quality PE and school sport, an 11 per cent. increase on 2003/04. Copies of the survey reports for 2003/04 and 2004/05 have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.446W.0/1">The Department is encouraging schools to put the guidance on participation into practice in ways that are meaningful to children and young people. As a key outcome for all children, local partners including schools and local authorities have to listen to children and involve them in planning and delivery of services. We have ensured that inspection arrangements make the views of children and young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing, and of school inspections. In addition, we have changed the law so that school governing bodies can now appoint pupils as associate members allowing them to attend governing body meetings and become members of committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.446W.0/2">Printed copies of the guidance were sent to all schools and local education authorities and are available online. Since then 10,853 additional copies have been requested. Evidence from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority monitoring and the National Foundation for Educational Research longitudinal reports shows that more schools than ever before have set up school councils as a way of involving pupils in decision-making processes.</p>

In most local authorities, the funding of school meals has been delegated down to schools, and therefore the Order passes the local authority's duty in providing meals on to schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.449W.0/1">The joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Transport &quot;Travelling to School&quot; action plan aims to increase the proportion of pupils travelling to school by sustainable means.

	<p pid="a.449W.0/2">The Education and Inspections Bill includes provisions to improve home to school travel and transport arrangements in three main respects:</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/3" class="indent">By placing a general duty on local authorities to assess the travel and transport needs of all pupils, and to promote sustainable travel to school;</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/4" class="indent">By extending entitlement to free home to school transport for low income families (for secondary aged pupils to any one of the three nearest suitable schools, where the distance travelled is between two and six miles; and for primary aged pupils aged over eight, to their nearest school where this is more than two miles from their home); and</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/5" class="indent">By enabling a small number of local authorities to propose Pathfinder schemes to test innovative approaches to home to school transport to support school choice, reduce the distances pupils are expected to walk to school, and increase the proportion of pupils travelling by sustainable means.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/6">The Department will support these improvements with additional funding as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/7" class="indent">&pound;4 million per annum to support the new general duty on local authorities from financial year 2007/08;</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/8" class="indent">revenue funding building to &pound;40 million per annum to support the extension of rights for low income groups from financial year 2008/09; and</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/9" class="indent">&pound;4 million pump priming and annual revenue support building up over several years to &pound;12 million for school travel Pathfinder schemes, which we anticipate will start in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.449W.0/10">The Department will seek formal expressions of interest in Pathfinder schemes only after these proposals have been enacted.</p>

	<p pid="a.450W.9/1">The Institute of Employment Research and Cambridge Econometrics have recently published two sets of UK skill scenario projections, investigating skills profiles up to 2014 <sup>1</sup> (commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council and the Sector Skills Development Agency), and separately up to 2020 (commissioned as part of the Leitch Review of Skills <sup>2</sup> ).</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/2">These analyses suggest that between 2004 and 2014, just over 12 million jobs will need to be filled (through a combination of new employment growth and replacing workers leaving employment). We do not know exactly how many of these will need graduates, although around 6 million are expected to be in 'managerial', 'professional' or 'associate professional' occupations (high-level jobs that are most likely to employ graduates).</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/3">The 'baseline' projections <sup>3</sup> up to 2020, broadly using the same approach, suggest that around 18 million jobs will need to be filled, with around 9 million expected to be in these high-level occupations.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/4">The research needs to be viewed as showing possible trends in the skills needs of the future workforce. The work makes assumptions about how past trends in occupational change will continue; about future macro-economic performance; and how business decision-making will react to changing skill profiles.</p>
	<p pid="a.450W.9/5">More detail is available in the individual reports. No projections up to 2025 have been conducted.</p>
