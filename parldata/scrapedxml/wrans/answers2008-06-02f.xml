	<p pid="f.523W.3/1">STFC is aiming to retain important skills at the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus to resource the range of scientific research investments being planned for its future. I have most recently announced a &pound;25 million investment by St. Modwen, a private sector developer that will be investing in a new (Vanguard House) business incubator facility at Daresbury to accommodate the rapidly growing (over 65) science and technology-based companies at the site, and new start-up science and technology businesses emerging in part from Daresbury's own leading scientific research programme. STFC has also tabled proposals for a new computer science centre at Daresbury (Hartree) and, in conjunction with its sister campus at Harwell, a new detector systems centre. These proposed centres would add to the existing Cockcroft Institute for accelerator research and the contribution that Daresbury is making to the preparatory phase of the New Light Source project. Taken together, I believe that the portfolio of facilities and projects at Daresbury will continue to sustain and develop its leading edge skills&mdash;which are highly valued by me and my Department. We are fully committed to the development of the Daresbury Science and Innovation campus as announced in Budget 2006.</p>

	<p pid="f.523W.6/1">The Government are committed to reducing bureaucracy at all levels within further education to release providers' energy to focus on the needs of individuals and employers. Through its deregulation agenda the Department and its intermediaries have already for example:</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/2" class="indent">reduced the number of intermediary bodies&mdash;Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate have been brought together in one inspector body, QIA and CEL are being brought together into a single body which will provide support to FE colleges and providers;</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/3" class="indent">reduced the administrative burden on colleges and independent providers&mdash;there is now light touch inspection for the best performers, a reduction in audit requirements is saving about &pound;12 million in administrative time per year and recognition as an awarding body has recently been reduced from an average of 10 months to two-three months;</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/4" class="indent">introduced Impact Assessments of policies on front line delivery.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/5">The LSC is committed to reducing bureaucracy. As a result of the restructuring begun in 2005-06 the LSC expect to realise annual administration savings of &pound;40 million by the end of 2008-09. The LSC are also committed to making administration efficiency savings during the current spending review period of 5 per cent. year on year.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/6">The LSC have made significant administration efficiency savings since it started operations in April 2001. Administration costs as a proportion of total expenditure has fallen from 4.6 per cent. in 2001-02 to an anticipated 1.6 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/7">I have asked Mark Haysom, the LSC Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Member with further information on action being taken. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/8" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/9" class="indent">I am writing to you at the request of Bill Rammell in response to your recent question about the LSC pledge to reduce bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/10" class="indent">In our Statement of Priorities published in November 2007 we highlighted eight areas where we are committed to simplifying the education and training system for the benefit of learners and employers.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/11" class="italic"> Funding methodology.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/12" class="indent">The LSC has implemented a reduction in the number of funding streams from six to three which will reduce administrative complexities for FE colleges and training providers and provide a clearer link between policy objectives and funding arrangements. It is expected that this will result in increased access and participation for 16-18 year-old learners and increased awareness of learning opportunities for adult learners.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/13" class="italic"> Custome r interaction with FE system</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/14" class="indent">We are continuously looking for ways to improve this, for example we have just introduced a single Helpline, Assessment and Payment Body to improve the customer (learner) experience, by having a single point of reference, single portal, and single phone number for all interactions in relation to nationally administered financial support programmes for learners.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/15" class="italic"> Single brokerage service</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/16" class="indent">A common brokerage framework has been introduced to ensure consistency across LSC regions, and to improve the service to employers we plan to go further by transferring the skills brokerage service to regional development agencies (RDAs) to enable its integration with the Business Link service.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/17" class="italic"> New Standard</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/18" class="indent">This has now been launched as the Training Quality Standard. It recognises provider responsiveness to employer needs and provider excellence in a particular vocational area; two areas that employers have told us are critical for success. It will give employers a simple and straightforward way to compare training providers.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/19" class="italic"> Framework for Excellence</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/20" class="indent">This is a balanced scoreboard of performance indicators that will enable learners and employers to make more informed choices and decisions, thus contributing to improved levels of satisfaction, increased retention rates, greater investment by individuals and employers, a sharper focus on economically valuable skills, and better and more relevant outcomes. A large scale pilot has just been completed and version 1 of the Framework is scheduled for roll-out to all FE colleges and work-based learning providers from August 2008.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/21" class="italic"> Regional skills strategies</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/22" class="indent">The LSC no longer produces 47 local plans with a range of priorities and initiatives but rather brings these together into nine regional plans. These regional plans set out how the LSC's funding will be used to support national priorities as identified in our Grant Letter and Statement of Priorities, and regional priorities identified by regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/23" class="italic"> Qualifications and Credit Framework</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/24" class="indent">With the QCA we are developing a simple and flexible structure that allows achievement to be built incrementally through the accumulation and transfer of credit. This will encourage and enable more learning that is appropriate to individuals' and employers' needs, For 2008-09 the LSC will be encouraging providers to adopt QCF provision where it is available.</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/25" class="italic"> Simplification of business processes</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/26" class="indent">The LSC continues to support the operation of the Bureaucracy Reduction Group (BRG) as the FE sector-led gatekeeper group for bureaucracy. The BRG has scrutinised the operation of a number of the LSC's major programmes and has helpfully identified areas where improvements could be made. For example, its recent scrutiny of Train to Gain resulted in a 10 point action plan to reduce bureaucracy in this programme. The report and recommendations of this scrutiny can be found on the BRG website</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/27" class="indent">(<a href="http://www.fe-brg.org.uk">www.fe-brg.org.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="f.523W.6/28" class="indent">In order to continue to tackle perceived bureaucracy and improve efficiency the LSC is developing a Simplification Plan. This will set out the actions the LSC is taking across a range of activities in addition to those highlighted above. It is expected that this will be published in July 2008 and I will send you a copy at that time.</p>

	<p pid="f.525W.2/1">Under existing legislation, both 125 ml and 175 ml measures may be used for the sale of wine by the glass. We have no evidence that the use of 125 ml glasses is being phased out. Alcohol policy as it relates to health is the responsibility of the Department of Health. It has launched a public education campaign to improve knowledge of the alcohol units contained in everyday drinks, and how drinking can affect people's health.</p>

	<p pid="f.526W.2/1">The 3 per cent. Lisbon target applies to the EU as a whole, not to individual member states. Individual member states need to set targets in relation to their own circumstances. The Government felt that the UK target, set out in the 10-year Science and Innovation Investment Framework in 2004, was an appropriate and challenging target given the level of UK's research and development and the structure of the UK economy. In 2006 the UK spent 1.75 per cent. of gross domestic product on research and development, up from 1.74 per cent. in 2005. As a whole the EU27 spent 1.84 per cent. of gross domestic product on research and development in 2006, the same as in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="f.526W.8/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="f.526W.8/2"><i> (a)</i> The Government are keen to see an increase in the numbers of British students who take the opportunity to include a period of study abroad as part of their course. Within Europe, we have seen a welcome increase this year in the number of UK students taking part in the EU's Erasmus programme. Interim figures for 2007-08 show that well over 10,000 UK students have taken part (including some 2,800 work placement students). And the UK continues to be one of the top destinations for students from other European countries taking part in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.526W.8/3"><i> (b)</i> The Government believe there is scope for further adaptation of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) to ensure that it effectively reflects the greater importance of the assessment of learning outcomes. In response to these and other member states' concerns, the European Commission is reviewing the ECTS users' guide, which is expected to be completed later this year.</p>
	<p pid="f.526W.8/4">Items <i> (c)</i> to <i> (g)</i> refer to the five documents that make up the Europass portfolio, a method introduced by the EU to record formal, informal and non-formal education. The operating agency for Europass in the UK, the National Europass Centre, has been promoting the portfolio in its entirety through organisations such as universities, FE colleges, vocational training organisations and UK accreditation bodies. There is increased interest in the use of Europass and it is expected that the introduction of the European Qualifications Framework will lead to greater take up of Europass documents in the future. The Government believe that Europass will assist in the recognition across Europe of formally or informally acquired skills and encourage mobility within the work force.</p>

	<p pid="f.527W.2/1">We expect students who entered higher education in the 2006-07 and 2007-8 academic years to graduate with an average level of debt of around &pound;15,000.</p>
	<p pid="f.527W.2/2">Student loans have very different features to most commercial loans, Graduates only repay once they are in work and only when their annual income reaches &pound;15,000. Interest is charged at the rate of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed.</p>
	<p pid="f.527W.2/3">In July we announced plans to introduce greater flexibility in the repayment of student loans by allowing borrowers to take repayment breaks of up to five years.</p>
	<p pid="f.527W.2/4">A generous package of support is available to students, particularly those from low income households. In 2006-07 over half of eligible full-time students received a full or partial maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,700, From 2008-09 onwards, the minimum threshold (of household income) for a full maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,835 per year will be extended from &pound;17,500 a year to &pound;25,000 a year; with a partial grant available up to an income threshold of &pound;60,005. This will mean that two thirds of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008-09 are expected to be entitled to a full or partial non-repayable grant&mdash;compared to just over half now.</p>

	<p pid="f.540W.3/14">Prior to 2008-09 Communities and Local Government contributed 60 per cent. of the value of the DFG to local authorities up to an agreed allocation with the local authority funding the remaining 40 per cent. Many local authorities have been spending considerably more than the 40 per cent. match funding element of the DFG on providing adaptations. The mandatory nature of the DFG remains in place with the legal responsibility for delivering the scheme resting with local authorities. It is therefore expected that the removal of the 60:40 split will have no impact on the level of local authority investment.</p>
	<p pid="f.540W.3/15">Relaxing the ring fence will enable local authorities to bring together different funding streams, allowing greater flexibility and freedom in administering the programme. It will also empower local authorities to design services which fit with local delivery arrangements and the needs of individuals. Local authorities will, for example, be able to use DFG funding to cover the costs of moving home, where this is a more appropriate solution to adaptation.</p>

As part of the Action Plan for Geography, teaching resources have been developed for the new secondary curriculum to be taught in schools from September 2008, and these include modules on climate change. Environmental interaction and sustainable development are key concepts in the new Key Stage 3 geography curriculum.

	<p pid="f.549W.6/2">Issues affecting climate change are also covered in the secondary science curriculum. The Government are committed to increasing the number of young people studying for science qualifications and to help achieve this aim it has put in place a robust programme of work supported by &pound;140 million investment over the next three years. This includes introducing a statutory entitlement for all students to study science courses leading to at least two GCSEs from September 2007; introducing a non- statutory entitlement from September 2008 for all pupils achieving level 6 at key stage 3 to study triple science GCSE, supported by the triple science support programme now in place; providing additional incentives to recruit more high quality science graduates into teaching; improving the quality of teaching by making available good quality continuing professional development through the network of Science Learning Centres; and providing good quality advice to key stage 3 pupils about the wide range of careers available to those who study science. The Department has also just embarked on a national communications strategy aimed at informing pupils, parents and others of the exciting opportunities that are open to students when they study science.</p>

The code and related admissions legislation help ensure that school places are awarded openly and fairly. During the summer we will be consulting on a number of measures that will further strengthen the code and enhance the admissions process. As with all policies it is important to have a clear picture of their impact and we will be carrying out a comprehensive review of all aspects of the admissions process in the future.

Local authorities can also request extra capital, if they have exceptional pupil growth; we have just made such allocations to four local authorities to cover the next three years. As regards unexpected increases in demand, we would expect local authorities to reprioritise within their overall capital allocations from central Government.

In our recent analysis of the published admission arrangements for 2008 in three local authority areas, we found that seven out of 570 schools had included a statement or request regarding financial contributions in their admission arrangements; and six of these schools confirmed this when we wrote to them asking them to verify our findings. This is a small minority, but we are very clear that schools cannot ask for a financial contribution as part of the admission process and wherever this is found to be happening we will not tolerate it. Even if voluntary, linking a charge to the school admission process suggests that parents who will pay the voluntary charge will be given priority if the school is oversubscribed.</p>

	<p pid="f.558W.2/2">The DCSF has also provided specific advice on energy management to all schools, not just those built in the past two years. We have prepared a good practice guide on energy and water management; a bursars' guide to sustainable school operation which focuses on energy; and developed top 10 tips to improve energy and water efficiency. Each of these documents refers users to comprehensive sources of further information.</p>
	<p pid="f.558W.2/3">The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for Building Regulations which already require that new schools are provided with full details of the installed systems and their methods of operation and maintenance so that they use no more fuel and power than is reasonable. It is the responsibility of the construction team to produce this information.</p>

	<p pid="f.558W.8/1">Schools are generally safe places. To help head teachers keep them safe, we gave schools in May 2007 a new power to search, without consent, any pupil whom they suspect, after random screening or otherwise, to be carrying a weapon. When issuing guidance on this new power, my Department also brought to schools' attention their existing power to screen pupils at random for weapons using screening wands or arches. The guidance set out not only the benefits but also the acknowledged risks of using either power.</p>
	<p pid="f.558W.8/2">It is for head teachers to determine if and when they use these powers, based on their knowledge of their own school. The Department does not collect data on the use of these powers, nor are schools obliged to tell us when they conduct searches or if they find weapons. When a pupil is suspected of carrying a weapon, some schools may rely on the direct and immediate intervention of the local police, and we would not wish to discourage them from taking that approach.</p>

Amendment papers relating to committee or report stage for bills to be considered on the day of publication of the amendment paper are given priority. While it is not possible under the agreement to guarantee that any particular amendment paper in this category will be published by 8.30 am, an examination of the records of uploading times since January 2008 reveals that in fact 70 per cent. of all amendment papers published in the period, including those for future days, were made available on the parliamentary website before 8.30 am.

	<p pid="f.572W.6/2">Current legislation allows for the disclosure by HMRC of information needed for any of a number of child support purposes, including to enable the assessment/calculation of child maintenance liabilities. The Child Support Agency continues to work day to day with HMRC and has recently agreed an enhanced process for the exchange of national insurance contributions information when required by the Agency. This is in addition to HMRC's powers to disclose information relating to the earnings of self-employed non-resident parents and information held for the purposes of functions relating to tax credits or child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="f.572W.6/3">Both Departments are currently working together in preparation for the move to base maintenance assessments on HMRC data as proposed in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill.</p>

Rules allow the decision maker to take into account any resources that a person may have deprived themselves of in order to secure, retain or increase entitlement to an income-related benefit</p>
	<p pid="f.580W.5/2">If the decision maker determines that a person has deprived themselves of capital, which could include spending money on luxury items, giving money to charities, family members or others, that person will be treated as still possessing that capital when assessing entitlement to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="f.580W.5/3">Within pension credit, assessed income periods for those recipients aged 65 or over were introduced to reduce the level of intrusion sometimes associated with income related benefits. The assessed income period is currently a specific period up to five years, during which time the customer does not have to report any changes to their retirement provision, by which we mean income from capital, annuities and pensions. During an assessed income period receipt of an inheritance would not generally need to be reported. When the assessed income period comes to an end, customers need to provide evidence and information on their current income and capital, in the same way that they do at the start of a claim so that their entitlement can be re-assessed before another assessed income period can be set.</p>

	<p pid="f.585W.0/1">The Department has not commissioned research on the effect of anti-depressant selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors on immune systems.</p>
	<p pid="f.585W.0/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued a clinical guideline for the national health service on the management of depression in primary and secondary care. This guideline, along with the evidence NICE considered in developing it can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="f.585W.0/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index">www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index</a>.jsp?action=byID&amp;o=10958</p>
	<p pid="f.585W.0/4">Clinical trials submitted at the time of licensing have examined the safety and efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These data are carefully evaluated by the independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to licensing to ensure that the products work and are acceptably safe. The longer term safety of the use of SSRIs in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by MHRA including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by health professionals through the 'Yellow Card' Scheme. All new data, including data relating to the effects of SSRIs on immune system disorders, are carefully evaluated. Where appropriate, product information for prescribers and patients is updated and advice issued.</p>
	<p pid="f.585W.0/5">As with all effective medicines, SSRIs may cause side effects in some individuals and it is recognised that SSRIs can rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, angioedema (swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, mouth or tongue) and anaphylaxis (a severe hypersensivity reaction that can cause difficulty with breathing). This is reflected in the product information for both prescribers and patients and their use is contra-indicated in patients that are known to be hypersensitive to the drug substance.</p>

	<p pid="f.587W.0/1">Data on those being treated for cannabis misuse is not available in the format requested. The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) publish information from the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) on the numbers of people in structured drug treatment; however, this information is not broken down by sex or by health authority.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/2">NDTMS data shows that in 2003-04 10,096 people received structured drug treatment for cannabis misuse and in 2004-05 13,408 people received structured drug treatment for cannabis misuse. The NTA will be publishing data for 2005-06 and 2006-07 this summer. Prior to 2003-04 the numbers of clients receiving drug treatment were based on estimates.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/3">The majority of drug treatment services are not specific to any one type of drug, responding to the needs of the individual client regardless of the type of drug they are addicted to. As with current drug treatment services, the introduction of any new service or programme must be based on clinical evidence; this includes any new services or programmes to treat cannabis addiction.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/4">It is the responsibility of drug action teams (DATs) to commission drug treatment services in their areas in line with local needs. DATs are local partnerships, combining representatives from local authorities, health, probation, prison service and the voluntary sector, and are responsible for delivering the Government's drug strategy at a local level. DATs have the best understanding of the local needs and priorities of their populations and ensure that the work of local agencies is brought together effectively and that cross-agency projects are co-ordinated successfully.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/5">While figures for the proportion of clients in treatment whose primary drug of dependence is cannabis are not available the number of drug users receiving treatment have increased from 85,000 in 1998 to 195,000 in 2006-07 and the numbers of drug users remaining in treatment has also risen. Drug treatment services have had a real impact, positively benefiting both drug users and the wider community; drug related deaths have decreased and the level of crime associated with drug misuse has fallen substantially.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/6">Since 2001-02, the Department of Health and the Home Office have provided specific resources for drug treatment in the form of the pooled drug treatment budget (PTB). This is allocated to the 149 DATs across the country to use alongside local mainstream funding, to provide treatment and services according to specific local needs. The level of Government investment for substance misuse treatment within the pooled treatment budget is &pound;398 million for 2008-09, which is also the indicative figure for 2009-10 and 2010-11. The Department does not intend the funding made available through the PTB to represent the totality of funding for any area. Rather, it is designed to supplement mainstream funds and to encourage investment in improving treatment capacity and effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/7">The latest evidence-based approaches to treating problematic cannabis use, in both adults and young people, are outlined in the joint departmental and National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse publication, Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management, published in September 2007, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guideline 51&mdash;Drug Misuse: Psychosodal Interventions. Treatment for cannabis addiction is expected to be in line with these guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/8">There are no specific substitute medicines available for treatment of cannabis dependence, although medication may be used to treat various related symptoms. The Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management guideline states that</p>
	<p pid="f.587W.0/9" class="indent">&quot;clinicians should consider psychosocial interventions, especially brief motivational interventions in mild cases&quot; while &quot;more heavily dependent misusers may require structured treatment with keyworking&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="f.595W.3/1">Both Suboxone and methadone are available on the national health service. The decision to use either drug is a clinical one, taken following consultation with the patient about their clinical needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="f.595W.3/2">In January 2007 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published the Technology Appraisal, &quot;Methadone and buprenorphine for managing opioid dependence&quot;, which recommended the use of both methadone and buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. Such treatments must be funded and provided within the NHS in line with NICE recommendations. However, this appraisal did not consider Suboxone, a newer product which combines buprenorphine and naloxone.</p>
	<p pid="f.595W.3/3">However, advice on prescribing of Suboxone is included within the joint Department and National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse publication, &quot;Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management&quot;, published in September 2007, copies of which have been placed in the Library and are also available on the Department's website online at:</p>

	<p pid="f.595W.3/5">As with all new medicines, Suboxone's exact place in treatment is still being established, although the Department's clarification of August 2007 that Suboxone can be dispensed using existing instalment dispensing arrangements, may have removed a possible barrier to the availability of Suboxone.</p>

Simple equipment would be provided through retailers, owned by users, and would be subject to the same consumer protection laws that support all consumers in the purchase of goods. More complex equipment would be delivered through a purchased (contracted) commissioned service, as it is today, and therefore future safeguards and controls will be consistent with current standards.</p>

Copies of the publication are available in the Library. The concordat sets out the cross-sector commitment to personalising public services and aims to support all councils to transform their adult social care systems by moving away from intervention at the point of crisis towards early intervention and prevention, focused on promoting independence and improved wellbeing. We are extracting and disseminating early lessons learnt from the Partnerships for Older People Projects programme and related initiatives to support the transformation programme.</p>

In order to achieve this, the Department has provided guidance and tools to help the national health service commission TB services best suited to local needs, and deliver services according to best practice. The Department is funding complementary work to raise awareness of TB among healthcare professionals and groups within the population at increased risk of TB. In addition, the Department continues to fund and evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions aimed at improving TB control, and will make the evaluations available to the NHS.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-02f.207742.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-02f.624W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="624W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080602/text/80602w0022.htm#08060232001948">
	<p pid="f.624W.3/1">Table 1 gives the number of non-domestic burglary offences recorded from 2003-04 to 2007-08. Table 2 gives the number of convictions, the number sentenced to immediate custody and the average custodial sentence length (in months) for all burglary offences.</p>
	<p pid="f.624W.3/2">It is not possible to give the total number of convictions for burglary offences that related to burglary of a business as the court conviction datasets do not specify this information in relation to the type of premises/building involved. It is only possible to give the number of convictions for those offences which refer to a non-dwelling, figures for which are documented in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="f.624W.3/3">Conviction data cover the calendar years 2002 to 2006 (the latest available years) and are collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="f.624W.3/4">Recorded crime data cannot be routinely reconciled with prosecution and conviction data as the former relates to the number of offences whereas the latter relates to the number of offenders brought before the courts. In addition, recorded crime data denote each offence as it has been initially recorded and this may differ from the offence for which a suspect or suspects are subsequently proceeded against in the courts.</p>

Conviction and sentencing data for these offences are documented in Tables 1 and 2 for Policing District A, Tables 3 and 4 for Policing District B and Tables 5 and 6 for Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="f.643W.5/1">No mandatory life sentence prisoner convicted of murder can be considered for release until they have served their &quot;tariff&quot; or &quot;minimum term&quot;, i.e. the period of imprisonment considered necessary for the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The release of all tariff expired life and indeterminate sentenced prisoners, including those detained in special hospitals as well as in prisons, is now a matter for the independent Parole Board. The Parole Board can direct a lifer's release on or after tariff expiry, only if it is satisfied that the prisoner no longer poses a risk of serious harm to the public. Where a whole life tariff has been set, the Parole Board cannot determine the question of release.</p>
	<p pid="f.643W.5/2">Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the responsibility for setting minimum terms in mandatory lifer cases transferred from the Home Secretary to the courts. Transitional arrangements in the Act allow any existing mandatory life sentence lifer whose tariff has been set by Ministers or whose tariff has not yet been set, to apply to have a tariff set or re-set by the High Court. It is understood that Peter Sutcliffe has submitted representations to the High Court under those transitional processes. In fact, no tariff was set by Ministers in this case.</p>
	<p pid="f.643W.5/3">It is a matter for the High Court to determine the tariff in Mr. Sutcliffe's case. If the court fixes a whole life tariff, then his case cannot be referred to the Parole Board for consideration of release. Mr. Sutcliffe was transferred to Broadmoor hospital in 1984 and has remained there ever since. For as long as he remains lawfully detained in hospital under Mental Health Act powers, and meets the Mental Health Act criteria for detention, his release cannot be considered by the Parole Board, even in the event that he received a determinate tariff by the High Court.</p>

	<p pid="f.646W.2/2">As the presence or absence of serial self-harmers in a prison can account for a disproportionate number of self-harm incidents, rises or falls in the numbers of such incidents from one year to the next is not a good indicator of underlying trends at individual prisons.</p>

Prisoners serving sentences for sexual offences that are not subject to registration are presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="f.650W.5/46">As noted in the footnote to published tables, the reasons for recall from home detention curfew are sometimes presented as the reason for the original imprisonment. Further investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded do not relate to the offence for which they were sentenced and subsequently released on home detention curfew, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence.</p>

	<p pid="f.656W.5/1">The precise interplay between climate change, sea level rises and the effect on vulnerable people has not been fully explored, but it is clear that sea level rises will have a huge impact. The nature of that impact will vary from place to place, but might include widespread loss of life, homes and livelihoods, and mass migration in small island states such as Vanuatu or low-lying areas of countries such as Bangladesh. Furthermore, as noted by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, developing countries often lack the financial and other resources to protect or relocate people living in low-lying zones; this can make their populations far more vulnerable than people living in similar physical locations in developed countries.</p>
	<p pid="f.656W.5/2">Climate change&mdash;including climate change adaptation&mdash;is one of the central themes of the Department for International Development's (DFID) new five-year research strategy. Meanwhile, the UK Government are already funding work to help communities affected by sea-level rises. For example, in Bangladesh the &pound;50 million DFID is providing over eight years to help poor households in the Chars region had included (as of January 2008) raising 43,500 homesteads above 1998 flood levels. Also, in India DFID is part-funding a study by the US-based Institute for Social and Economic Transition, which is setting out strategies for responding to the risks associated with climate change in the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.</p>

	<p pid="f.682W.0/1">The UK commitment to the EU Battlegroup roster for July to December 2008 will be met by forces from the Small Scale Focused Intervention Battlegroup (SSFIBG) element of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF). As this is a national high readiness contingency which is already on standby during the relevant period, there is no additional cost to the UK of providing an EU Battlegroup on standby.</p>
	<p pid="f.682W.0/2">There would be additional costs to the UK were the Battlegroup to deploy. However, an EU Battlegroup is a standby commitment intended for emerging contingencies and it is impossible to predict at the current time whether or not it will be deployed during its standby period. The cost to the UK of deploying an EU Battlegroup would depend on the nature and length of any deployment.</p>
	<p pid="f.682W.0/3">The UK Battlegroup is certified nationally to standards which incorporate and exceed the Standards and Criteria for EU Battlegroups. Other enablers taken from the JRRF also meet these standards. The only cost of certification therefore are the negligible administrative costs associated with the formal notification to the EU that the UK contribution is of sufficient standard, and the administration costs associated with hosting the EU Battlegroup observers day to Exercise Druid's Dance on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-12">12 May</phrase>. Hosting the observers' day is not a requirement of EU Battlegroup certification but is encouraged in the EU Battlegroup concept to help share best practice amongst EU member states.</p>

	<p pid="f.684W.2/1">Service personnel deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq are entitled to 30 minutes of free telephone time per week. It is not possible to provide a specific figure in terms of top-up costs as this varies considerably dependent on which country and which telecommunications provider within a country is being called. In all, there are 381 different call cost rates for some 140 countries advertised in telephone cabins etc. in the Afghanistan and Iraq theatres of which 21 rates apply to the UK. These are broken down between British Telecom rates and the various mobile network providers. However, if a call to a British Telecom line is used as an example, the charge is 11p per minute to make a call from a telephone cabin satellite phone. It will therefore cost &pound;2.20 for 20 minutes of call time; &pound;3.30 for 30 minutes of call time; &pound;4.95 for 45 minutes of call time; and &pound;9.90 for 90 minutes of call time. Personnel calling from an Iridium satellite telephone will pay &pound;17.80 for 20 minutes; &pound;26.70 for 30 minutes; &pound;40.08 for 45 minutes; and &pound;80.10 for 90 minutes. Personnel calling from an INMARSAT system will pay &pound;23.40 for 20 minutes; &pound;35.10 for 30 minutes; &pound;52.65 for 45 minutes; and &pound;105.30 for 90 minutes. Iridium and INMARSAT charges are set by 3rd party satellite services providers and not by the MOD communications contractor. Steps are being taken to migrate welfare users off these tariffs and on to a rate comparable to a telephone cabin. There are no peak rate times for personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan as all calls are charged as listed regardless of the time of day.</p>

Subject to the terms of any associated lease or licence, Commanding Officers are free to enter discussions with ATM providers and seek the removal of fee paying ATMs at any time.

	<p pid="f.695W.0/1">Letters are sent out to serving South African personnel at regular intervals updating them on the latest situation with regards to the South African legislation on mercenaries and membership of other nations' armed forces. The last letters to Royal Naval personnel were sent out on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase> and letters to RAF personnel were sent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-15">15 February 2008</phrase>. Further updates will be sent in due course if and when there are further developments.</p>
	<p pid="f.695W.0/2">We are urgently investigating the potential consequences for South African personnel currently serving in the UK armed forces, so that we can support those who may be affected. Our overriding aim is to secure the continual service of South African personnel in the UK armed forces and for them to be able to deploy on operations. We hope to send a team of officials to South Africa to hold face to face discussions with the officials who will be drafting the new regulations as it is the details of these underlying regulations that will allow us to understand what real effect the new Act, when it comes into force, will have on personnel.</p>
	<p pid="f.695W.0/3">Representations have been made by the Secretary of State for Defence to the South African Defence Minister, Mr. Lekota, on the potential implications the legislation would have on recruitment and retention of personnel into the UK armed forces. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence wrote to Mr. Lekota in August 2006 and followed this up with a telephone conversation in December 2006 and he wrote again in April 2007. Our high commissioner to South Africa, Paul Boateng, has also made representations to the Government of South Africa on several occasions. His last letter was sent to Mr. Lekota on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-22">22 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="f.695W.0/4">The Mercenary Act was discussed at the UK-South Africa bilateral Defence Staff talks held in the MOD on 3-<phrase class="date" code="2008-03-04">4 March 2008</phrase> with the aim of securing a date for an officials visit at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="f.695W.0/5">Under current rules eligible SA citizens serving in the British armed forces can apply for British citizenship if they have been resident in the UK for a five year period, or three years if married or in a civil partnership to a British citizen. Service in the armed forces, at home and abroad, counts towards the residential qualifying period. We are discussing other options with the Home Office should South African personnel be barred from membership of the UK armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="f.695W.0/6">We cannot say precisely what the implications of the legislation are for our people until the details of the regulations are divulged to us.</p>

	<p pid="f.696W.0/1">Following Veterans Day 2007, the event was discussed in July and October at the Veterans Executive Steering Group which is chaired by the MOD and attended by the Confederation of Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO) and the heads of a number of its key member organisations. Their main comments were that COBSEO members should have wider and earlier visibility of events, that there should be higher level VIP support at the major events and that the London event should have a more central location. All these issues have been addressed for this year's events and COBSEO has been an integral part of our planning process since October 2007. Both the Government and the main ex-service charities have recognised that Veterans Day would need to be built up over a number of years. We are committed to working in partnership with the non-government organisations and others to achieve proper public recognition for the nation's veterans.</p>

	<p pid="f.696W.3/1">When the Government first launched Veterans day in 2006 as a key element of its initiative to improve the nation's recognition of its veterans and their achievements, it made clear that this was something that would need to be built up over a number of years. Veterans day 2008 promises to be a further step forward from last year with improved quality and size of events and growing public involvement.</p>
	<p pid="f.696W.3/2">The MOD does not organise Veterans day events itself but encourages and assists event organisers with advice and makes funding support available to those that meet the qualifying criteria; this funding increased last year and has again been increased for 2008. The aim is to encourage communities to take the initiative in the organising of events, whether in large cities or more widely, allowing them a wide degree of freedom to design events that engage young and old, while conveying our key messages about the achievements and diversity of veterans and the support available to them.</p>
	<p pid="f.696W.3/3">Recent measures to improve the quality of events have included a briefing of potential major event organisers last September, involving representatives from over 30 towns and cities across the United Kingdom; regular engagement with the key ex-service organisations; and wider work to promote the celebration of our veterans and to share best practice, including engagement with the local councils and civic offices, and presentations and coaching to other potential event organisers. I also hosted a Veterans day reception and briefing for all MPs in January, while detailed information on organising Veterans day events was sent to all MPs offices.</p>
	<p pid="f.696W.3/4">These actions have resulted in higher quality event bids and, reflecting this, MOD has allocated more funding in 2008 than in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="f.696W.3/5">As you will be aware, the National Recognition Study, authored by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2025" name="Quentin Davies">the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>, has just been released and makes a number of recommendations that could further enhance our recognition and celebration of the nation's veterans. We welcome these but will need to give them detailed consideration before deciding precisely how to take them forward.</p>

	<p pid="f.709W.3/1">The education system, like so much of the infrastructure in Zimbabwe, has suffered as a result of the Mugabe regime's economic and political mismanagement. Many professional teachers have left the country, unable to survive on the low wages in the hyper-inflationary economy. Of those who have remained, many are now the targets of state-sponsored violence and intimidation because they acted as polling agents in the recent elections. This is only serving to encourage more teachers to leave Zimbabwe and further debilitate the education system. As a result of the economic crisis, schools now charge exorbitant user fees. Whereas in 2002 over 90 per cent. of children were in school, that figure is now thought to be fewer than 70 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="f.710W.5/3">Since the Governor's speech, the annual growth rate of &pound;5 notes in circulation has risen from around 5 per cent. to around 10 per cent. I understand that the Bank of England is currently holding discussions with commercial institutions about this matter.</p>

	<p pid="f.711W.11/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="f.711W.11/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of &quot;non-routine&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="f.711W.11/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="f.711W.11/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however the proportion of resolvable requests the Department answered &quot;in time&quot; (ie meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007 was 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="f.711W.11/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied.

	<p pid="f.724W.12/1">In terms of recorded crime and court proceedings, statistics are not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/2">The use of another person's identification details (or the use of false identification details), often referred to as identity theft, is not in itself an offence in law. It is the action that is undertaken, using those identification details, that needs to be considered in respect of whether an offence has occurred. As such no specific information is available.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/3">Most instances of 'Identity Theft' come to light when victim's details are used to obtain goods, services or money using credit arrangements or loans. Instances of this should be recorded under the new Home Office offence classifications 'Fraud by False Representation Other Fraud' or 'Obtaining Services Dishonestly'. These new offences were created following the introduction of the Fraud Act 2006 and were introduced into the recorded crime series with effect from April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/4">Where bank, credit card, or store card accounts are opened using identities to which the individuals are not entitled, and then used to commit fraud, then an offence of 'Fraud by False Representation Cheque, Plastic Card and Online Bank Accounts (NOT eBay or Pay Pal)' should be recorded.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/5">If there is no intent to commit fraud and there is evidence that an account has been created using a false, stolen or improperly obtained identity document contained within the Identity Cards Act 2006 then an offence under the new classification 'Possession of False Documents' should be recorded.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/6">Statistics for all the new recorded crime offence classifications referred to above will be available for 2007-08 and will be published in July 2008. Information on fraud and forgery offences recorded by the police using the old classifications is available in table 2.04 of 'Crime in England and Wales 2006/07'. The table can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="f.724W.12/8">Equivalent data for court proceedings and cautions for fraud offences (under the old classifications) can be found in the Criminal Statistics England and Wales publication which can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="f.724W.12/10">Tables 2.8 and 2.13 show prosecutions and crown court trials for fraud and forgery and table 3.16 shows convictions and cautions for fraud and forgery broken down by offence class.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/11">Court proceedings data for 2007 for the offences referred to above will not be available until the autumn of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/12">With regard to information collated by the British Crime Survey on victims of such crimes, according to the 2006-07 BCS, 2 per cent. of adults had experienced their personal details being used in the last year without their permission in one or more of the ways asked about. This proportion includes those who came to know about the identity fraud, but the true figure could be higher because some respondents may not have known about the deception.</p>
	<p pid="f.724W.12/13">Detailed information from the 2005-06 BCS on ID fraud is contained in section 3.5 of Home Office Statistical Bulletin 10/07 entitled 'Mobile phone theft, plastic card and identity fraud: Findings from the 2005/06 British Crime Survey'.

	<p pid="f.725W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;..... crime is affected by a range of factors and it is therefore too crude simply to compare increases in police funding with changes in crime and then draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the police in reducing crime-not least because increases in policing and their visibility can in fact provide the public with more confidence to report more crime incidents. Current Home Office research shows that, when controlling for some of these factors&mdash;for example changes in the economy, demography and social factors&mdash;increases in police strength, visibility and focus have had a significant impact on reducing crime.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="f.726W.2/1">The potential requirements for the sharing of information between the National Ballistics Intelligence Service Database (NABIS) and the National Firearms Licensing Management System was examined, and discussed, in detail by key stakeholders (including forensic and investigatory professionals) throughout the lifetime of the project management process.</p>
	<p pid="f.726W.2/2">It was found that the potential crossover between the data held by the systems was very small, due to the very low instances of legally held firearms being used in gun crime and the small overlap in information shared between the two applications. Furthermore, the data descriptors of 'firearms recovered at Scenes of Crime' and 'firearms being licensed' may be somewhat different and, as a result, inquiries would be passed from NABIS to expert firearms officers in the Licensing Departments. As a consequence, it was agreed that any risk of legally held firearms being used for criminal purposes was so low that given the difficulty of automating a matching process between systems, the cost of building such an interface would outweigh any perceived benefits.</p>
	<p pid="f.726W.2/3">The NABIS system has been designed to accredited police corporate data model standards, which means that information sharing may be possible in the future providing that there is a business case to do so.</p>

	<p pid="f.729W.8/3">However, BERR officials, working with other Government Departments, the telecommunication service providers, the emergency services and representatives of deaf and other user organisations, have identified a technical solution for providing an emergency SMS text service for the deaf, and those with hearing or speech impairment. Technical development will be necessary before trials can be carried out. It is hoped that the work will be completed later this year. The service will provide an alternative option for those who routinely use SMS text and either do not use a text relay service or may be in a situation where it is not available.</p>
	<p pid="f.729W.8/4">As SMS does not provide a real time service and cannot be a substitute for voice or text relay services, any emergency SMS service will only be available to those who have registered with the service and accept its limitations.</p>

The chief officer may consult the Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Record Office (ACPO CRO), a specialist unit which provides advice on the removal of DNA and fingerprint records, before making a decision. If a chief officer decides that a DNA profile should be removed from the NDNAD, they will instruct the NDNAD Custodian that the profile be removed and the DNA sample destroyed.</p>

It is not possible to disaggregate the costs of removing profiles and samples from general NDNAD service delivery costs or the general administrative costs of the other organisations involved.</p>

	<p pid="f.732W.8/2">A DNA sample is biological material containing cells with a person's DNA, whereas a DNA profile is a numerical sequence stored on the NDNAD, which is an information technology system. A subject sample is taken from an arrested person, usually by means of a swab which picks up cells from the inside of the cheek. A crime scene sample is one retrieved from material at a crime scene, for example blood, semen or saliva. A DNA sample is analysed to produce a DNA profile by an accredited supplier of forensic science services. A DNA profile is a numerical sequence, representing part of the DNA in the sample, which can be entered on the National DNA Database.</p>
	<p pid="f.732W.8/3">The costs of processing, and retaining, DNA samples fall to individual police forces. They vary depending on the contractual relationship between the police force and the forensic supplier, which is commercially confidential.</p>
	<p pid="f.732W.8/4">The cost of retaining DMA profiles is the cost of running the NDNAD Information Technology system. In the most recent year for which figures are available, 2006-07, this was &pound;2,041,743. Dividing this figure by the number of subject and crime scene profiles held gives an average cost per profile of 45 pence for that year.</p>

	<p pid="f.735W.11/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what steps will be taken to improve information on the flows and the geographical distribution of international migration. (206846)</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/5" class="indent">Much work has already been carried out to improve these statistics. The sample size of the International Passenger Survey was increased to collect more information on the flows of emigrants. Improvements to the methodology used for distributing migrants to the local authority level in the mid year population estimates were implemented (based principally on use of household and port survey sources in combination at regional level and IPS questions on length of stay). These changes were implemented in the mid-2006 population estimates issued in August 2007 and were used to revise previously published estimates for 2002 to 2005. They also fed into subsequent ONS population and labour market statistics (e.g. 2006-based National Population Projections, 2006-based Subnational Population Projections to be published in June 2008 and Labour Force survey reweightings issued in May 2008).</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-04">4 February 2008</phrase>, the Minister for Local Government announced to the House that a cross-Government programme would be put in place to improve population and migration statistics, driven by senior officials from central Government and the Local Government Association, and led by the National Statistician. It will take forward the recommendations of the 2006 interdepartmental Task Force on Migration Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/7" class="indent">A specific objective of the work programme relates to gaining better information on migrants as they enter or leave the country, and therefore making improvements to gross and net migration flows. This work includes:</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/8" class="indent">improvements to port surveys to ensure they are more focussed on collecting migration information, cover more emigrant flows, and involve more of the ports that migrants typically arrive at or depart from,</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/9" class="indent">a longer term aim of using data from the new e-borders programme (and other controlled migration systems) that will collect detailed administrative data on migrants.</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/10" class="indent">The programme also includes research relating to improving the geographic distribution of migration within the UK, for example:</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/11" class="indent">improving the statistical methodology of population estimation to take into account administrative sources that provide a more timely picture of the distribution of migrant populations than the 2001 Census,</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/12" class="indent">developing methods for sharing key administrative data sources such as the Department for Work and Pensions data on benefits and the Department for Children, Schools and Families Schools Census data,</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/13" class="indent">developing new and timely indicators of the impact of migration at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="f.735W.11/14" class="indent">This is high priority work for the ONS and other government departments and is being progressed with due pace.</p>

	<p pid="f.738W.2/1">The development of the Olympic Security Programme is led by the Olympic Security Directorate, located within the Metropolitan Police Service, but reporting functionally to the Home Office Olympic Security Director. Protective security, including the consideration of armed protection requirements, is a key part of the planning process that is being undertaken. Any such requirements will be subject to the delivery and approval of a costed security plan being prepared by the Olympic Security Directorate. Provision will be met from within the maximum funding envelope of &pound;600 million.</p>
	<p pid="f.738W.2/2">However, we do not comment upon protective security arrangements and their associated costs for categories of individuals as to do so could compromise the integrity of those arrangements and affect security of those concerned.</p>

	<p pid="f.744W.2/1">Police and local authorities have available a range of measures to deal with antisocial behaviour, including the nuisance caused by unsolicited car windscreen washers. The measures are usually employed incrementally and it is important that they should be proportionate to the behaviour concerned. Among the available measures normally used for low-level antisocial behaviour are warnings, acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs), and injunctions. For more serious cases, antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) may be used. In addition, the police have powers to disperse groups of two or more where their presence or behaviour has resulted, or is likely to result, in a member of the public being harassed, intimidated, alarmed or distressed. These could be used where more than one person is engaged in unsolicited windscreen washing in a particular location.</p>

	<p pid="f.752W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) operates to a set of public service standards which are to issue 90 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="f.752W.2/2">The targets mentioned above are not CRB targets for completion of a disclosure but part of an internal service level agreement (SLA) in place between the CRB and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). This SLA has been agreed by ACPO on behalf of the 43 local police forces in England and Wales and the time taken by each force to complete their part of the enhanced disclosure process is measured against these targets. By meeting these targets the police forces directly affect the CRB's ability to meet the public service standard for enhanced disclosures.</p>

As such a distinction is not necessary at present, the Environment Agency has no intention of using this power immediately, and therefore there will be no effect on anglers in the short to middle term.</p>

	<p pid="f.757W.2/1">The Environment Agency is under no legal obligation to offer any concessions at all, and has publicly stated that it will use a significant proportion of the monies raised by the higher duty rates to continue to improve access to angling for the disabled and senior anglers.</p>
	<p pid="f.757W.2/2">The Environment Agency carried out its own research into these concessions in relation to those offered by other organisations. The research revealed that the typical concession offered by others is 0 to 10 per cent. and that the revised level of 33 per cent. is still generous in comparison. The concessionary rate will be reviewed again in 2010 along with the other rod and net licence duties.</p>
	<p pid="f.757W.2/3">The Environment Agency faces challenges to implement the EU recovery plan for stocks of European eel in England and Wales, to take forward work on conservation of stocks of Atlantic salmon and sea-trout, and to comply with measures to implement EU rules on the control of fish diseases. Anglers have asked the Environment Agency to increase its focus on enforcing illegal fishing, and the Agency also has a corporate target to increase participation in angling by 2 per cent. a year.</p>
	<p pid="f.757W.2/4">Unless its income is increased to cover inflationary pressures, the Environment Agency would have to cut its services to anglers. For it to maintain its targets the Environment Agency must fully assess all its income sources, and adjust them where necessary to reflect its statutory obligations.</p>

	<p pid="f.759W.8/1">Following the outsourcing of IT services to IBM in October 2004, computers/laptops are no longer classed as departmental assets as they form part of the overall contract for the provision of IT services. All IT equipment therefore belongs to IBM and DEFRA is not charged for replacement equipment. DEFRA does not keep a record of laptops replaced following loss or theft.</p>
	<p pid="f.759W.8/2">DEFRA does not centrally record the individual replacement of lost or stolen mobile telephones or PDAs. Individual business units are required to maintain records of equipment held and run delegated budgets for the purchase of communication equipment. To gather the requested information from individual business units across Defra would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

However, where there is a shortfall in civil service Gateway reviewers, suitably accredited external resources may be provided by the Office of Government Commerce at a charge.

Waste collection authorities submit returns on a voluntary basis. However, the statutory requirement associated with LATS only started from 2005-06. Prior to this, all returns were voluntary.</p>

	<p pid="f.767W.8/1">The Government's policy on byways open to all traffic (BOATs) is set out in a document entitled 'Use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way&mdash;the Government's framework for action', which was published in January 2005. In this document we made clear our intention to legislate to curtail claims for vehicular rights of way, where those claims derive from historic use and dedication for use by non-mechanically propelled vehicles. These proposals now form the basis of Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="f.767W.8/2">The case of 'R on the Application of the Warden and Fellows of Winchester College and Humphrey Feeds Ltd <i> v.</i> Hampshire county council and the Secretary of State' was essentially about what is meant by an: &quot;application made in accordance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 14 to Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981&quot;, within the meaning of section 67(6) of the 2006 Act and whether such an application, made for a byway open to all traffic, would have engaged the exceptions in section 67(3) of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 and thereby have preserved public rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles that were the subject of such an application.</p>
	<p pid="f.767W.8/3">The Court of Appeal ruled that, for the purposes of section 67(6) of the 2006 Act, an application must be accompanied by copies of all the documentary evidence that the applicant wished to adduce or rely upon and a copy of a map drawn to the prescribed scale.</p>
	<p pid="f.767W.8/4">It seems likely that there are many cases pending where, in light of this judgment, the conclusion will be that, even where there was an application for a BOAT made before the relevant date (as set out in section 67(4) of the 2006 Act), the requirements of paragraph 1 of schedule 14 will have not been complied with, within the strict terms emphasised by the judgment, and therefore the public rights of way for mechanically propelled vehicles will have been extinguished.</p>
	<p pid="f.767W.8/5">Version 5 of DEFRA's online guidance on Part 6 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which will be published shortly, will include revised guidance on this aspect of the legislation. We have also issued revised guidance to rights of way inspectors to enable them to deal accordingly with any cases before them.</p>

We will be applying this derogation to goats as the total UK population is less than the EU threshold.</p>

	<p pid="f.770W.2/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures to promote greater transparency in the consumer credit market so that, before they enter into a credit agreement, consumers have the information they need to make an informed choice and are aware of the terms and conditions of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="f.770W.2/2">The Consumer Credit (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2004 specify the information which must be disclosed to borrowers before a regulated consumer credit agreement is made and they specify the manner in which the information must be disclosed. Borrowers should therefore be fully aware of the terms, such as the type of interest rate applicable, before they enter into any agreement.</p>
	<p pid="f.770W.2/3">In addition, the Consumer Credit Directive, which, it seems likely, will be due to be implemented by October 2010, will include a requirement for lenders to provide borrowers with a key standard information sheet before entering into a contract.</p>
	<p pid="f.770W.2/4">Furthermore, the Consumer Credit Act 2006 strengthens consumer rights, by enabling consumers to challenge unfair lending agreements before the courts. Courts are able to consider the entirety of a relationship between debtors and creditors to determine whether any of the circumstances arising from an agreement are unfair to the debtor. The Act also introduces an alternative dispute resolution scheme under which consumers have access to a free and independent means of resolving disputes with their lenders by taking their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, rather than having to go through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="f.770W.2/5">Further protection is provided through the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, which come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>. These introduce a general prohibition on the use of unfair commercial practices that harm consumers' economic interests. Unfair commercial practices will include failure to inform consumers of material information they need to know to make informed purchasing decisions. Any concerns that the practices of traders may infringe this prohibition may be brought to the attention of OFT or Trading Standards.</p>
	<p pid="f.770W.2/6">In addition, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations enable consumers to challenge any term which has not been individually negotiated in a consumer contract, where that term causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties to the detriment of the consumer. If the court agrees that the term is unfair, it will not be binding on the consumer.</p>

	<p pid="f.775W.5/1">The UK already has one of the best consumer law regimes in the world. This has recently been strengthened by the introduction of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, implementing the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, so as to provide a comprehensive approach to unfair commercial practices and close off loopholes in previous legislation. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 has brought in tough new protections against rogue lenders and debt collectors. The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 will require all estate agents in the UK to belong to approved redress schemes dealing with complaints about the buying and selling of residential property, give enforcers greater powers to remove rogue estate agents from the market, and create a new, stronger and more coherent consumer advocacy body.</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/2">The Government are also planning to provide more rights for consumers who enter into contracts at home, by extending the right to the seven day cooling off period from unsolicited visits to include solicited visits.</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/3">The Government are currently undertaking a review of the consumer law regime that is:</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/4" class="indent">examining the scope for simplification of existing legislation and enhancing flexibility and future-proofing while maintaining necessary protections;</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/5" class="indent">exploring avenues to simplify and rationalise enforcement, allowing greater targeting of action on higher-risk sectors or business; and</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/6" class="indent">investigating the options for improving consumer empowerment and redress.</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/7">We have launched a call for evidence, with views invited by <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-31">31 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="f.775W.5/8">Beyond legislation, the funding to the successful scambusting and illegal money lending pilots that target rogue traders has been extended. In addition, the Government have set up the Consumer Direct helpline to provide consumers with practical advice on resolving problems.</p>

	<p pid="f.783W.2/2">The UK remains concerned, about allegations of the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan. The UK has raised its concerns through the EU and has discussed the issue with the Uzbek Government. The EU welcomed Uzbekistan's signing of the International Labour Organisation Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour earlier this year and has urged Uzbekistan to implement effectively its international obligations in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="f.783W.2/3">The UK Government continue to call on businesses to look at their supply chains and take appropriate action if they find evidence that goods has been produced using child labour.</p>
	<p pid="f.783W.2/4">There is no legal requirement for goods to bear marks indicating its origin. As such, it would be difficult for the Government to establish a blanket ban on imports of Uzbek cotton and clothing. Similarly, products manufactured using Uzbek cotton in a third country would legitimately bear the country of manufacture as the country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="f.787W.8/1">The Government have no plans to introduce specific protections in this area. However, recent reforms have strengthened protections for vulnerable consumers.</p>
	<p pid="f.787W.8/2">From April 2008, reforms to the consumer credit licensing regime introduced by the Consumer Credit Act 2007 have given the OFT stronger powers to investigate and take action against rogue traders who lend irresponsibly. OFT will take a risk-based approach to enforcement, focusing its activities on those sectors where the risk of consumer detriment is highest. It has indicated that the home credit sector will be among those most carefully monitored. OFT will bring forward guidance this year for lenders about activities which may constitute irresponsible lending.</p>
	<p pid="f.787W.8/3">Furthermore, the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>, provide additional protection for vulnerable consumers. Under these regulations, a commercial practice, such as aggressive or misleading sales techniques, may be found unlawful where it is likely to adversely affect only a clearly identifiable group of vulnerable consumers in a way which a trader can reasonably foresee, by virtue of mental or physical infirmity, age or credulity.</p>
	<p pid="f.787W.8/4">The consumer credit directive, which will be transposed into UK law by 2010, will provide further consumer protections through the introduction of a general right of withdrawal from credit agreements within scope, giving consumers a 14 day cooling-off period after signing their agreement. The Government will also bring forward regulations extending cancellation rights to contracts for goods and services purchased on the doorstep following a solicited visit by a trader. Consultation on draft regulations closed last month.</p>

	<p pid="f.789W.2/1">The 10 per cent. discount rate used to appraise nuclear power against other generation options is based on an assessment of the cost of capital faced by private sector electricity generators. It is used to produce estimates of generation costs for fossil fuel and low carbon generation options so that their costs can be compared against each other. The Treasury Green Book discount rate is then used to discount the cost differences between options over time in order to estimate the cost or benefit to the economy of one generation option over another.</p>

	<p pid="f.800W.2/1">The feasibility study focuses on tidal range power generation because the key resource of the Severn estuary is its tidal range&mdash;it has the second highest tides in the world (up to 14 metres) and around 90 per cent. of total UK practical tidal range resource. Whereas, as the Sustainable Development Commission's recent study confirms (Turning the Tide, published October 2007) the tidal stream resource of the Severn estuary is much smaller and represents a minor part of the total potential of UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="f.800W.2/2">The feasibility study is however considering proposals for tidal stream development where this is in combination with tidal range development.</p>

In its response (February 2008, URN 08/648), the Government stated that:</p>
	<p pid="f.801W.5/2" class="indent">Regulators should be encouraged to think about whether they can be more proactive in using competition law, including market investigation references to the Competition Commission;</p>
	<p pid="f.801W.5/3" class="indent">Impact assessments provide transparency and as such should be an integral part of the policy-making process;</p>

	<p pid="f.801W.5/5">With regard to effectiveness, Government maintains an active interest in looking at the regulatory regime as a whole, and has tasked the Better Regulation Executive with this role. However, as bodies independent from government, regulators assess their effectiveness through their own corporate governance structures. Further assessment beyond this is primarily a matter for Parliament.</p>
