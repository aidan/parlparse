	<p pid="a.435W.3/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills brought together the science, innovation, higher and further education agendas together for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/2">In order to promote the new Department, it spent a total of &pound;171,441. This included two events for stakeholders and delivery partners, a leaflet to explain the training offer for businesses and the inclusions of DIUS stands and publicity at key events for employers and universities.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/3">In addition the Department spent &pound;953,911 on the creation of a new website. This included the design of both an initial website launched shortly after the creation of the Department and a later improved version. This total covers the purchase of hosting and content management system as well as project management and content migration (i.e. staff) costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.435W.3/4">As well as promoting the Department these activities were also used to inform employers and individuals of the support services it funds to help them. These continue to be managed by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.3/2">We have recognised that those on the lowest incomes might have difficulty paying the fixed line levy and that is why we have confirmed that those on social telephony schemes will be exempt. The social telephony schemes are available to those on income support, income-based Job Seeker's Allowance, Employment Support Allowance (income-rated) or Guaranteed Pensions Credit and should be an accurate indication of ability to pay. We have no plans for additional exemptions from the levy.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.6/4">Since the latter statement was released, neither this Department nor its predecessor Departments have received any further representations on the compliance of Phorm's technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/5">The Government statement of September 2008 was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/6" class="indent">The UK is committed to providing a high level of consumer protection. We take our community obligations very seriously especially in the area of data protection and e-privacy. The possible future use of Phorm technology has raised material concerns in this area and the UK authorities are working to ensure that if it is introduced into the market for internet based advertising services, this is done in a lawful, appropriate and transparent fashion.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.6/9" class="indent">the profile is based on a unique ID allocated at random which means that there is no need to know the identity of the individual users;</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.6/11" class="indent">search terms used by the user and the advertising categories exclude certain sensitive terms and have been widely drawn so as not to reveal the identity of the user;</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/12" class="indent">Phorm does not have nor want information which would enable it to link a user ID and profile to a living individual;</p>
	<p pid="a.442W.6/13" class="indent">users will be presented with an unavoidable statement about the product and asked to exercise a choice about whether to be involved; and</p>

	<p pid="a.443W.11/2"><i> </i>Each regional development agency (except the London Development Agency&mdash;see table) participates in two statutory over-arching strategies: the regional economic strategy (RES) and the regional spatial strategy. The aim of the RES is to improve economic performance and enhance regional competitiveness, addressing market failures that prevent sustainable economic development, regeneration and business growth. It is drawn up and kept under review by the RDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.11/3">The RSS (which incorporates a regional transport strategy) provides a spatial framework to inform the preparation of land-use programmes. It takes into account provision for new housing; priorities for the environment; transport, infrastructure, economic development, agriculture, minerals extraction and waste treatment and disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.11/4">RDAs may also lead the development of non-statutory strategies with regional partners. Examples of these are listed in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.11/5">Following the Government's 2007 Sub-National Review of Economic Development and Regeneration, RDAs are working with local authorities to prepare development of integrated regional strategies, replacing the current regional economic strategy and regional spatial strategy.

	<p pid="a.456W.9/1">The assets management and sales strand of HM Treasury's Operational Efficiency Programme (OEP) was established to ensure more efficient and commercial operation of assets held in the public sector. The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre (QEIICC) was one of nine government assets listed for further work in the pre-Budget report 2008 last November. The OEP final report published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.456W.9/2" class="indent">&quot;Following the statement in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report, further work on the QEIICC has been undertaken. Although, in theory, the QEIICC could be disposed of now, this would be potentially at a significant discount to its underlying value. A more measured approach is required. The conclusions are, therefore, as a first step, to undertake a site development study within three to six months advised by a firm of property professionals. It will explore the opportunity of redeveloping the existing site, in a way that is sympathetic to planning considerations and current business operations. This could entail retaining the existing conference business for the foreseeable future. Marketing and disposal could take place at various stages depending on market evolution and prevailing risk and reward considerations, but at the latest by mid 2012.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.465W.2/1">Since the formation of the large, single-cap badge The Royal Regiment of Scotland, the separate identities of its antecedent regiments have been preserved in a number of ways, not least by including them prominently in the battalion titles, for example; The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, and The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Preservation is further illustrated by the retention of golden threads in uniforms and accoutrements such as the Black Watch red hackle and the Highlanders' blue hackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/2">The identities of the regiment's battalions are very clear and easily understood by its officers and soldiers and the wider community in Scotland. The regiment places great importance in its heritage and uses its history to inspire and nurture its new recruits and current members; the regimental history taught to its soldiers is captured in a handbook which is given to all new recruits. The Army ensures that regimental traditions, heritage, cultures and local connections continue through the excellent relations between its retired soldiers, the serving community, and the outstanding support from the local communities associated with their antecedent regiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/3">There are no plans to introduce a single colour of hackle for all Territorial Army (TA) soldiers in The Royal Regiment of Scotland as this would run contrary to the traditions of infantry regiments in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/4">However, 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (6 SCOTS) currently wear either a black or white hackle while 51st Highland, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland (7 SCOTS) wear a variety of colours&mdash;each colour representing one of the former Scottish infantry regiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/5">This variety of head dress (within a regiment, battalion, and in some cases a company) is as a result of the reorganisation of the infantry structure. It is very unusual in the British Army and contrary to normal regimental integrity.</p>
	<p pid="a.465W.2/6">Therefore, the regimental headquarters of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is currently considering proposals from each of the two TA battalions to have their own unique and distinctive hackle to establish their own identities, which will then be consistent with the other five Regular Army battalions in The Royal Regiment of Scotland, each of whom wear their own single coloured hackle.</p>

	<p pid="a.467W.2/1">The BTV8 vaccination programme played a vital role in keeping the UK free from circulating BTV8 disease last year, with vaccination levels in the region of 60 per cent. across England.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.2/2">Vaccination remains voluntary in 2009. BTV8 vaccine is readily available both from the remaining Government underwritten supply and from the three manufacturers who are supplying vaccine direct to the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.2/3">If adequate vaccination levels are not reached this year, and BTV8 is reintroduced, the disease may spread to unvaccinated animals. Evidence suggests that the disease is still present and circulating in some neighbouring EU member states. Farmers and livestock keepers should not become complacent and should vaccinate their animals for BTV8 as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.2/4">Veterinary practices have played and continue to play a crucial role in making vaccine available to livestock keepers and advising on best practice usage to livestock keepers to ensure that disease does not spread.

	<p pid="a.470W.9/1">The success of Operation Kimia II has been mixed so far. The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia continues to carry out attacks against the civilian population and the Democratic Republic of Congo armed forces in north and south Kivu provinces. However, the military effort against the FDLR in north Kivu has maintained pressure on the group. We understand that in some areas the FDLR has been forced to withdraw from ground it had held.</p>
	<p pid="a.470W.9/2">The operation extended into south Kivu only recently. It is too early to assess its impact there but we continue to urge the UN peacekeeping mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Congolese armed forces to do all it can to protect civilians. While it remains our view that military pressure is necessary to weaken the FDLR, a lasting solution to the problems posed by the militia requires a political settlement.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.2/1">We have received no specific information concerning the use by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia of civilians as human shields in Shabunda. However, recent reports suggest that Shabunda territory is under the control of the FDLR, who continue to carry out acts of violence against civilians in South Kivu province. The Democratic Republic of Congo army has recently extended its operations against the FDLR into South Kivu, supported by UN peace-keepers. I commend their efforts to restrict the activity of this illegal militia.</p>

However, given the difficult terrain and mobility of rebel groups, MONUC is unlikely to be able to prevent all isolated attacks on civilians.

	<p pid="a.491W.5/1">The number of defendants found guilty at all courts for 'obtaining property by deception' in Cleveland police force area, the North East Region and England and Wales, for the years 1998 to 2007 is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/2">Data have been provided for Cleveland police force area as information for Teesside and Middlesbrough and East Cleveland constituency is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/3">The Fraud Act 2006 which was implemented in January 2007 repealed eight sections of the Theft Acts 1968-1996, including section 15 of the Theft Act 1968, Obtaining property by deception.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/4">Government are determined to tackle the problem of fraud, whether the victim is a multi-million pound organisation or a single individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/5">Following a cross-Whitehall review of fraud, Government have allocated &pound;29 million over three years to implement the National Fraud Programme. This includes the creation of a National Fraud Strategic Authority, launched last October, which published its first National Fraud Strategy on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-19">19 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/6">The statistics provided in this answer are for fraud offences where either the statute or the offence description identifies the fraud as relating to 'property fraud'. However, the definition of &quot;property&quot; under the 1968 Theft Act is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/7" class="indent">&quot;Property includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other tangible property&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/8">Therefore this could include a fraudulent acquisition of anything from a mortgage to a mobile phone. A number of other fraud offences may include 'property fraud', but as the individual circumstances of the offence are not held on the court proceedings database maintained by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, it is not possible to separately identify them. One example of this is Section 2 of the 2006 Fraud Act, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-14">14 January 2007</phrase> and states:</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/9" class="indent">&quot;Dishonestly making a false representation to make a gain for oneself or another&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/10">Data under this offence have not been included in the table, as it may cover offences not connected with &quot;property&quot;. The number of defendants found guilty under this offence in England and Wales from <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-14">14 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> was 2,574.</p>
	<p pid="a.491W.5/11">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

The Government have recently set out its approach to improving public services in publications such as Excellence and Fairness: Achieving World Class Public Services; Working Together: Public Services on your side and Building Britain's Future.</p>
	<p pid="a.501W.5/3">The approaches outlined support the Public Service Agreements which set out the Government's top priorities for improving public services and other outcomes. At the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007, the Government set out 30 cross-departmental PSAs covering areas such as better health and wellbeing, safer communities and educational standards. Progress on PSAs is reported to Parliament in the Departmental Annual Reports and the Autumn Performance Report.

IFD have updated the methodology used to derive main disabling condition to reflect this change in the live system.<br/> A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to disability living allowance.
