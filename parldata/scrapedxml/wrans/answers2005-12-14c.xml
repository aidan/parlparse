This self assessment then helps inform the key areas for improvement. Each LSP awards itself an overall &quot;traffic light' assessment which reflects both progress made and challenges faced by each LSP. LSPs are encouraged to share these assessments at a local level&mdash;however at a national level we can say that 36 percent. have self assessed as 'green', 46 percent. as 'amber green' and 18 percent. as 'amber red'.

	<p pid="c.1979W.6/1">The Secretary of State has not received specific advice on dust suppression techniques, and circumstances in which dry stripping of asbestos containing materials is permissible. However, the current Approved Codes of Practice (ACOP) under the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002-Work with asbestos insulation, asbestos coating and asbestos insulating board (L28), and Work with asbestos which does not normally require a licence (L27) were approved by the Health and Safety Commission in 2002, with the consent of the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.6/2">Under the regulations and ACOPs, employers are required to prevent exposure to asbestos and where this is not reasonably practicable, to reduce exposure to as low a level as reasonably practicable. When exposure can not be prevented, employers must chose a working method or combination of methods which reduce exposure to the lowest levels reasonably practicable and document these in the written risk assessment and plan of work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.6/3">Acceptable methods of asbestos removal and the effectiveness of dust suppression techniques will depend on a range of factors to be considered as part of the risk assessment for the job in hand. They include the type of asbestos material, its condition, and the amount to be removed. Often a combination of methods will be needed. Paragraphs 67&ndash;74 of L28 (for work with licensed materials) and paragraphs 74&ndash;76 of L27 (for work with non-licensed materials) set out methods for work with different types asbestos containing materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.6/4">These paragraphs, and paragraph 29<i>(f)</i> of L28 also include references to dry stripping. Although they state that there may be some exceptional circumstances where dry stripping of licensable materials may be justifiable, the Health and Safety Executive has not encountered such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.6/5">Further guidance on reduced dust methods of working can be found in the Health and Safety Executive publication Controlled asbestos stripping techniques for work requiring a licence (HSG 189/1), and for work with non-licensable materials in Introduction to asbestos essentials: Comprehensive guidance on working with asbestos in the building maintenance and allied trades (HSG 213); Asbestos essentials task manual: task guidance sheets for the building maintenance and allied trades (HSG 210); and Working with asbestos cement (HSG189/2).</p>

	<p pid="c.1982W.2/5" class="indent">If deemed necessary the customer can also be referred to specialist partner organisations who deliver a variety of provision including Work Preparation, WORKSTEP and New Deal for Disabled People, for additional support.

	<p pid="c.1986W.5/2">The UK, with our EU partners, is committed to ensuring that the rights of disabled children are effectively addressed in the UN convention, taking into account the fact that there is an existing convention on the rights of children. At the most recent meeting of the UN Committee tasked with drafting the convention, the UK acting as EU President proposed text regarding the general obligations of states in respect of disabled children. We believe that the proposed text will ensure that the rights of disabled children are recognised across the convention in relation to all the obligations on states. The UK is working to ensure that this wording is included in the final text.</p>

	<p pid="c.1990W.0/1">New scheme funding requirements will replace the minimum funding requirement for private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes from <phrase class="date" code="">30 December 2005</phrase>. This flexible framework will give trustees greater leverage in framing the scheme's funding strategy and determining the contributions paid by the employer. In addition, from <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2006</phrase> current HM Revenue and Customs requirements for pension schemes to reduce an actuarial surplus will be abolished. This will remove a factor which may have played a part in some decisions to allow pension fund contribution holidays in the past.

We offered people the opportunity to express views by e-mail, in writing, by telephone, in various languages including Welsh and Braille and had copies of the consultation available in easy read and audiotape.

We also have information on return to work credit awards. However, we can provide information on job entries recorded through these channels and this is provided in the following table. The total number of job entries that actually occur will be higher than this as there will be a significant number of benefit leavers that have found jobs that were not the result of a direct intervention from Jobcentre Plus. The job entry proportion, as shown in the table, is an under-estimate of the true underlying job entry rate due to the fact that more recent cases will have had less time to find a job.</p>

	<p pid="c.1999W.5/1">The Department receives a range of correspondence on pension issues including stakeholder pension inquiries but there have been no recent representations specifically on stakeholder pension policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1999W.5/2">Prior to the introduction of stakeholder pensions in April 2001, the Government advised that it would undertake a review of a number of provisions contained in the Stakeholder Pension Regulations 2000 after they had been in operation for three years. This review was concluded in October 2004, and after careful consideration, it was decided that no changes were necessary at that time. It was, however, recognised that developments in train in the wider pensions field might have a bearing on those provisions and that it might be necessary to look at them again at some point over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1999W.5/3">Following the Sandier report in July 2002, which looked at medium and long-term retail savings in the UK, we reviewed the stakeholder pensions charge cap. This resulted in the annual management charge being revised from 1 per cent. of the value of the fund a year to 1.5 per cent. for the first 10 years of membership, reducing to 1 per cent. thereafter for stakeholder pension policies bought on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. We also introduced the requirement for providers to offer lifestyling, the process where at least five years before retirement the members pension savings are gradually moved into less volatile arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.2001W.2/3">HSE does not produce guidance aimed specifically at the general public. However it does produce a range of guidance relating to the safe use of ATVs, including quad bikes, used in agriculture. HSE also works through the media to raise public awareness of the causes of accidents in agriculture involving ATVs, using press releases and the annual accident statistics. In addition HSE works with industry's ATV/Quad Group, formed by the Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA) and the Outdoor Power Equipment Council (OPEC), which represents the majority of ATV manufacturers and suppliers. The group produces guidance and promotes the safe use of ATVs and quad bikes across the range of uses. As part of this work HSE has produced an instructional video, co-funded by the manufacturers of ATVs and quad bikes, that the manufacturers and suppliers have agreed to supply to all who buy an ATV or quad bike from members of the AEA and OPEC.</p>

International and United Kingdom regulations concerning safety and efficacy of medicines require testing for botulinum toxin products at various stages of their processing, from harvesting through to marketing as a finished product for use as a prescription only medicine.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.2/3">The European Pharmacopoeia, which sets legal standards for many medicines, requires the product to be looked at in either a mouse test called an LD50 or with another test that has been shown to give similar information. Unfortunately, currently there are no tests that have been shown to be reliable enough to measure the product's strength.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.2/4">Tests are being developed but at the moment they can only be used during the early stages of the manufacturing process. However, an acceptable assay in an animal model still remains a requirement to test the finished product before it can be released for use. Research work is ongoing in both the product companies and elsewhere to try and develop a reliable equivalent test that could replace the animal test but as yet no test has been approved by the Pharmacopoeia.</p>

	<p pid="c.2007W.5/1">DEFRA has policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England but operational responsibility falls to the various flood and coastal defence operating authorities who are expected to assess local risk and possible impacts and solutions. The Environment Agency is the principal operating authority responsible for flood risk management in England and this includes the risk of flooding from the sea. Measures to reduce coastal erosion risk fall to maritime district councils under the Coast Protection Act 1949.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.5/2">The Holderness coastline is subject to erosion, management of which is principally the responsibility of East Riding of Yorkshire council. At the southern end of the coastline the land is more low-lying and subject to both erosion and coastal flooding; the Environment Agency therefore also has responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.5/3">Rising water levels in the Humber estuary have been the main driver for development by the Environment Agency of the Humber Estuary Flood Risk Management Strategy (HFRMS) which was published in draft form for public consultation in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.5/4">The HFRMS highlighted the serious issue of coastal erosion at Kilnsea where it is estimated that within two years erosion could lead to the loss of a flood defence embankment that protects eight houses to the south and east of Kilnsea village. At Easington, the HFRMS noted that the combination of erosion and wave overtopping is damaging the Easington Lagoons designated habitat site. The Environment Agency is also considering the potential, impacts for the coast and estuary from future serious breaches of Spurn point and a joint study is being set up with other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.2007W.5/5">Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) around the English coast are currently being revised. These provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present a long-term policy framework to manage them in a sustainable manner. East Riding of Yorkshire council will lead on the review of the &quot;Flamborough Head to Gibraltar Point&quot; SMP.</p>

	<p pid="c.2011W.0/1">Farmers' markets, which this department has responsibility for, are an important outlet for local food producers, with the added advantage that the direct sales they can stimulate leave producers with a bigger share of the retail price. They have been shown to help bring life back into town centres and to stimulate trade in surrounding shops on days when they are held. They can also play a part in reinstating a more individual character to the local area, where high street uniformity has possibly crept in, and in restoring a more traditional 'market town' atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="c.2011W.0/2">The Department has encouraged farmers' markets by stressing to local authorities the benefits to the rural economy and to town centres which such markets can bring. In addition, we have also provided funding, at both a national and regional level, under our various grant schemes to help establish and raise awareness of farmers' markets. Earlier this year we provided funding for the 'Farmers Market' conference organised by The National Farmers' Retail and Market Association (FARMA) which was held at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London. Officials meet regularly with representatives from FARMA (an organisation that represents over 700 direct selling outlets) to explore how we can work together on our common goals of reconnecting farmers to their markets and helping them to add value.</p>

	<p pid="c.2011W.6/2">Flood mapping is a complex, detailed and extensive process that will never be completely accurate but the Environment Agency is committed top provide the best currently available information using nationally consistent principles.</p>

Responses to the recent public consultation on &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, DEFRA's developing new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management, reinforced the need to continue this area of investigation alongside consideration of how other rural land management techniques might contribute to managing flood risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.2013W.0/1">The Department funds much of the UK work on climate change, its impacts and appropriate adaptation measures and so we are in regular contact with leading experts in this field.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.0/2">The main effects on the coastline relate to sea level rise, compounded by long term land movement. For the UK, estimates were published in the 2002 UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) Scenarios of Climate change. Other factors include the frequency, duration and intensity of storms which drive waves and surges.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.0/3">The effect of climate change on river levels depends on complex interactions between rainfall patterns (including both the frequency, intensity and duration of severe storms and longer term rainfall patterns that determine the degree of catchment wetness) and physical catchment characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.0/4">The Department has since 1989 issued precautionary guidance on the climate change impacts that should be taken into account when designing flood and coastal erosion risk management measures. This was last updated in 2003 to take account of the UKCIP 2002 scenarios and other specific research on river and coastal impacts. The guidance is kept under review in the light of emerging research results; for example, those presented by leading experts at DEFRA's conference on 'Dangerous Climate Change', held in Exeter in early 2005. In developing our new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management&mdash;Making Space for Water-we have made a specific commitment to review our guidance in 2007. To support this review DEFRA has just commissioned a major piece of research over a 30 month period to understand, better the potential impacts on river flow of a range of future climate scenarios.</p>

	<p pid="c.2014W.5/1">Farmers' markets, which this Department has responsibility for, are an important outlet for local food producers, with the added advantage that the direct sales they can stimulate leave producers with a bigger share of the retail price. They have been shown to help bring life back into town centres and to stimulate trade in surrounding shops on days when they are held. They can also play a part in reinstating a more individual character to the local area, where high street uniformity has possibly crept in, and in restoring a more traditional 'market town' atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/2">The Department has encouraged farmers' markets by stressing to local authorities the benefits to the rural economy and to town centres which such markets can bring. In addition, we have also provided funding, at both a national and regional level, under our various grant schemes to help establish and raise awareness of farmers' markets. Earlier this year we provided funding for the 'Farmers Market' conference organised by The National Farmers' Retail and Market Association (FARMA) which was held at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London. Officials meet regularly with representatives from FARMA (an organisation that represents over 700 direct selling outlets) to explore how we can work together on our common goals of reconnecting farmers to their markets and helping them to add value.</p>
	<p pid="c.2014W.5/3">My noble Friend, Lord Bach, spoke at the &quot;Making markets, Creating places&quot; conference held at Borough Market in June 2005. That conference focused on the key role markets can play in towns and cities and highlighted their potential for supporting the growing numbers of quality food producers looking to sell their products. The event brought together leaders in the urban regeneration and food policy fields along with those who have been at the forefront of revitalising city centre markets in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.2019W.2/1">CPS Essex performance data for the second quarter of 2005&ndash;06 shows improvements across a range of key indicators (measuring delivery of services to the public). The Area is achieving an overall rating of amber/green (on a scale where red indicates a negative likelihood and green indicates a positive likelihood) in relation to the likelihood of it meeting current targets. This equates to an overall performance improvement from the first quarter of 2005&ndash;06 and suggests improved delivery of Area business. These measurements relate to the Essex as a whole and do not break down to team performance within the county.</p>
	<p pid="c.2019W.2/2">In addition, Essex CPS was designated as ready to move onto the statutory charging scheme with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">Monday 12 December 2005</phrase>. This reflects a significant achievement for the Area in relation to the provision of pre-charge advice to Essex police officers as part of the national rollout under the CPS Charging Programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.2023W.6/1">We aim to develop a more improved approach to training and testing. This will be based on research. To this end my Department has recently let two contracts. One is about improving the delivery of road safety education. The other is a review of pre-driver education, which will study the attitudes and influences on driving style that are developed at a young age and before any formal training is undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="c.2023W.6/2">In addition the Cohort Study of Learner and Novice Drivers is looking at the methods used and experiences gained of those learning to drive and compares them to how the candidates performed in the practical driving test. The study also follows a sample of drivers for a 3-year period to analyse the experiences they have gained as novice drivers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2023W.6/3">Two new projects are also about to be awarded. The Evaluation of the Driving Standards Agency Drivers' Record will investigate the extent of use of the Drivers' Record, and the influence it has on the level and nature of pre-test driver training and experience, and on driving test performance. The second new project concerns the Development of the Pass Plus Scheme for Newly Qualified Drivers, which will explore possible means of improving both the impact and uptake of Pass Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2023W.6/4">Research continues on the content, delivery and recruitment to existing pre-test and post-test motorcycle training. The project, being conducted by TRL, is addressing issues such as key competencies and skills, whether training should vary according to bike type, how courses can attract riders and how the new practical test being introduced in 2008 will impact on current training courses.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.5/2">The European Court of Justice's judgement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September</phrase> this year confirmed that where application of criminal penalties is essential to ensure that Community rules are fully effective, measures relating to the criminal law may be adopted under the treaty establishing the European Community. The court also confirmed, however, that as a general rule criminal law matters do not fall within the Community's competence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.5/3">The role of the European Commission is to propose legislation, which may then only be adopted in accordance with the relevant procedural provisions in the treaty. The Commission could present a proposal for a directive including a requirement for member states to establish criminal offences. If this proposal was consistent with the European Court of Justice's judgement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September</phrase> and if it was adopted by the Council (or the Council and Parliament in the case of co-decision), then member States would be obliged to implement the directive. Directives that are intended to confer rights on individuals can in some circumstances be relied upon in national courts by those individuals against the state where the state has failed to implement the directive by the prescribed implementation date, i.e. may give rise to direct effect. These conditions, however, would not be satisfied by the provisions of a directive which were concerned with the establishment of criminal offences rather than the creation of rights for individuals.</p>

Victim Support is an independent charity and it takes decisions about how best to use its resources to raise public awareness of its work.</p>
	<p pid="c.2035W.5/2">Additionally the Department funded a project to research more effective ways to recruit volunteers. Recruitment materials developed were shown to be highly effective.</p>
	<p pid="c.2035W.5/3">The Department responds to a lot of correspondence from the public in which it highlights the work of Victim Support. The victim and witness walkthrough on the public cjsonline website highlights the work of Victim Support and we have placed a duty on the police, from April 2006, to refer relevant victims to Victim Support unless they request not to be referred.</p>

	<p pid="c.2037W.9/1">Companies conducting Assessment Phase work under contract agree the price in competition, by reference to market forces or where competition is not available under the policy on No Acceptable Price No Contract. When negotiating the contract terms and conditions risks are allocated between the company and the Ministry of Defence on the basis of who is best able to manage them. Companies who decide to carry out private venture work at their own risk do so as part of their normal business. The result of this work might later lead to a MOD contract in which case the company normally seeks to recover their costs through the commercial arrangements agreed at the time.</p>

	<p pid="c.2039W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence's approach to the assessment of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss in the War Pensions Scheme reflects that of the Government as a whole and is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts including an Industrial Injuries Advisory Council review. The Ministry of Defence also routinely scrutinises the published peer reviewed literature to ensure that compensation policy and approaches continue to take account of contemporary evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2039W.0/2">The threshold for compensation for noise-induced hearing loss was introduced into the War Pensions Scheme in 1993. The Government consulted the Central Advisory Committee on War Pensions on this change which formed part of a wider package of changes that included the removal of rank differentials from war disablement pensions and increases in the rate of disablements pensions above the rate of inflation; the most severely disabled other ranks gained most from these increases. The Central Advisory Committee is a statutory body whose role is to consider matters put before it by the Minister. It includes members from the principle ex-service organisations including those representing disabled veterans.</p>
	<p pid="c.2039W.0/3">I met Dr. John Low, chief executive of the RNID, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October</phrase> to discuss his organisation's concerns, including about the threshold for compensation. The RNID submitted a paper to the Department on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December</phrase>. I will arrange to meet Dr. Low again in the new year once the Department has considered the RNID paper.</p>

For planning purposes, we assume that collocation will lead to a reduction of at least 240 civilian and 100 military posts. However, the Army is still determining the possible size and structure of the new HQ organisation and we are unlikely to make an announcement until late 2006. Similarly, project costs and the budget for Project Hyperion continue to be refined and will be confirmed at Main Gate, which is unlikely to occur before November 2006.</p>

For example: in the Crown Court there have been percentage point reductions of 11.1 in Merseyside, 7.2 in Manchester, 7.0 Bedfordshire, 6.0 in Essex and 5.8 in Nottinghamshire. In the magistrates courts we have seen percentage point reductions of 9.0 in Merseyside, 8.2 in Humberside, 6.3 in Nottinghamshire, 5.8 in Manchester and the West Midlands.

	<p pid="c.2048W.9/1">The UK Government's policy on alternatives to Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) was made clear in our position of March 2005. We believe that the European Commission should be ready to provide an alternative to an EPA at the request of any African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) country. Any alternative offered should provide no worse market access to the EU than is currently enjoyed under Cotonou preferences.</p>
	<p pid="c.2048W.9/2">The deadline for any ACP country to request an alternative has been extended from 2004 to the end of 2006, at the request of the ACP themselves. To date, no ACP countries have requested an alternative, nor disengaged from the ongoing EPA negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2048W.9/3">However, DFID has already supported research to feed an independent assessment into the debate on what steps would be needed to make one of the non-reciprocal alternative options&mdash;the generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme&mdash;a viable alternative to EPAs. In addition, a formal and comprehensive review of EPAs will be undertaken by the EU and ACP in 2006 to check that the negotiations and preparations are on track. In the context of this review, the UK will actively encourage the European Commission and other EU member states, to consider all possible alternative options available, particularly if requested by any ACP country.</p>

	<p pid="c.2049W.2/1">The European Commission will be providing transitional assistance to those African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) who will lose out as a result of reform, to help them to adjust to the change in price. The Commission have proposed &euro;40 million of funding for transitional assistance in 2006, which is still being debated by the European Parliament and EU member states. While the Commission has indicated that funding for 2007 to 2013 will be more substantial, the exact amount will be decided as part of the debate over the next financial perspective. The UK Government will be aiming to achieve appropriate levels of funding as part of this broader agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2049W.2/2">In its draft regulation of June 2005, the Commission proposed that the &euro;40 million of funding for 2006 would come from the Commission's external relations budget. While the Commission has not yet made any official announcements about how much funding it will propose for 2007 to 2013, it has proposed that this should be funded out of the new Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (also in the external relations budget).</p>
	<p pid="c.2049W.2/3">Assistance will be delivered through country-specific plans, which are to be 'elaborated in the country itself, in dialogue with the Commission'. In order to avoid delays in the disbursement of transitional assistance funding, the Commission is aiming to provide part of its funding to ACP countries in the form of budget support where this is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.2049W.2/4">The Commission expects that the 2006 funds will be available before the end of 2006. The exact timing will depend in part on the speed with which the sugar protocol countries complete their action plans. DFID are providing over &pound;250,000 to the six sugar protocol countries in the Caribbean to help them complete these plans in a timely manner.</p>
	<p pid="c.2049W.2/5">The Commission stated in their draft regulation that allocation will be based on the needs of each country, related in particular to the impact of the reform on the sugar sector in the country concerned, and to the importance of the sugar sector in the economy. We expect more detailed criteria to be determined in the New Year.</p>

In Tajikistan, our support to NGOs is largely through community development and livelihoods programmes, and third party arbitration courts. We are also working with local NGOs through a regional HIV/ AIDS programme in Central Asia. This programme has just begun in Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and will run to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.2052W.5/1">DFID has no further plans at the moment to increase the UK's contribution to the Global Fund. Prior to the Replenishment Conference in September, the Global Fund calculated that on the basis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the UK would have to contribute US$320 million for 2006 and 2007&mdash;equivalent to 4.5 per cent. of the Global Fund' s resource needs for the period <sup>1</sup> . At the conference we increased our pledge to exceed our GDP &quot;fair share&quot;&mdash;to US$344 million for the replenishment period.</p>
	<p pid="c.2052W.5/2">The Global Fund is just one instrument to channel funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) the UK was the second largest donor, of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) country-members, providing direct bilateral support for HIV and AIDS to recipient countries in 2004. Of US$2.7 billion provided by DAC members in 2004 the UK contributed 20.5 per cent., second only to the US at 49.6 per cent. <sup>2</sup> In comparison the French Government provided 0.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2052W.5/3">The UK Government is committed to spending at least &pound;1.5 billion over the next three years in AIDS related work, including our pledge to the Global Fund. Most of our spending on AIDS will go direct to developing countries, through Government, non governmental organisations or the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.2052W.5/4">With regards to malaria and TB, DFID is a board member of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM). We have contributed &pound;48.5 million to the RBM since 1999. We have pledged &pound;7 million to the Stop TB Partnership through to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.2056W.2/1">The Government's better regulation agenda, which includes the implementation of both 'Less is More' and Philip Hampton's recommendations, is focused on lighter-touch regulation, concentrating on cases where action is needed. The Government have no specific numerical target for the number of forms or inspections carried out following the implementation of these reports, but reducing the number of unnecessary forms and inspections is a central part of its agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.2056W.2/2">As set out in the better regulation action plan announced in May this year, Departments and regulators have been asked to publish simplification plans, containing information about the number of forms they send to businesses and the measures being taken to reduce their burden. All plans will be published by Pre-Budget Report 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2056W.2/3">Philip Hampton's report recommended that regulators act proportionately, in accordance with an open and transparent risk assessment process. The principles of proportionality and openness are to be included in the forthcoming Regulatory Reform Bill, and have already been incorporated into the regulatory impact assessment process that Departments have to follow.</p>
	<p pid="c.2056W.2/4">The implementation of 'Less is More', which will in due course lead to a target for the reduction of administrative burdens, will also drive this work forward.</p>

In this context, we are concerned about reports of enforced sterilisation and abortion.

	<p pid="c.2063W.2/1">The British Government welcomed the decision to open the crossing point at Ledra Street and we are therefore disappointed that difficulties have arisen. In our view, these provide a worrying example of the lack of trust between the parties in Cyprus. The deeper causes of the Ledra Street controversy can only be addressed through a meaningful process of negotiation aimed at a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. In the meantime, we strongly support the conduct of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) over Ledra Street, and its efforts to convert the current controversy into a genuine confidence building measure.</p>

	<p pid="c.2069W.2/1">The Bill is described as a measure against extremism, terrorism and crime and would give Russian authorities greater control over non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

	<p pid="c.2069W.2/2">At this early stage, it is not possible to judge with any certainty what the ultimate effect of the law will be. The draft legislation will have to pass a further two readings in the Duma before it is presented to the Federation Council from where it will then be passed to President Putin to sign into law. At each stage there is the possibility that the legislation will be amended.</p>

Enhancements include better arrangements to collect information on the number of consultants engaged, what they are doing and that a sound and properly approved business case is in place. In addition, accounting arrangements have been enhanced to ensure costs against both programme and running cost expenditure can be identified.</p>

	<p pid="c.2073W.5/1">The Governments document Every Child Matters Change for Children (December 2004) sets national and local priorities for children's services in England based around an outcomes framework containing five outcomes for all children and young people, including disabled children and young people. These outcomes were given legal force in the Children Act 2004. Within this framework, local authorities evaluate their own services and set their priorities for development. The Department monitors services through annual priorities meetings with local authorities, guidance to them on preparing their plans, and field force support including where necessary formal intervention. Inspectorates assess the contribution of services to improving the outcomes for children through annual performance assessments of children's services by Ofsted and the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and multi-inspectorate joint area reviews of children's services. These mechanisms consider the impact of services on disabled children and their families.</p>

This could include making improvements to the provision of drinking water.</p>

Nor have we made a formal assessment of the impact of our policies on the number of faith schools. Decisions about whether new faith schools should open are made locally, following consultation, by the School Organisation Committee or schools adjudicator if the Committee are not unanimous. Decisions are made on the merits of the individual proposals, and in the light of local circumstances.</p>

The Association is due to report back at the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="c.2076W.8/2">September 2002, the Increased Flexibility programme (IFP) for 14 to16-year-olds has enabled schools, in partnership with FE colleges to offer pupils the opportunity of vocational learning through new GCSEs in vocational subjects and part-time placements in colleges. In 2003/04 we estimate that there were around 90,000 14 to16- year-olds participating in the programme of which around 70 per cent. were being taught in FE colleges for part of the week, and 3 per cent. attended other providers.

	<p pid="c.2077W.5/1">This Government continue to build upon the improved support for part-time students introduced in 2004/05. In the current academic year, a statutory fee grant of up to &pound;885 (for a student studying at 75 per cent. of the equivalent full-time course) and a course grant of up to &pound;250 are available for students domiciled in England and Wales. The grants are means-tested in order to target funding most effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.2077W.5/2">From 2006/07 fee grants for English students studying in England will be increased by 27 per cent. (compared to 2005/06). That means that a student studying at 75 per cent. intensity could receive up to &pound;1,125 in fee support. In addition, the course grant of up to &pound;250 will continue to be available. The National Assembly for Wales will be responsible for determining student support arrangements for Welsh-domiciled students from the academic year 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="c.2077W.5/3">Part-time students who need additional financial help with fees or other costs may be provided with discretionary support through their Higher Education Institution (HEI). My Department is allocating &pound;12 million to support part-time students at HEIs in England during 2006/07, an increase from &pound;3 million in 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.2077W.5/4">It is for individual institutions to determine the type and amount of pastoral and other support they provide for their students.</p>

Increase the number of adults with the skills required for employability and progression to higher levels of training through:<br/> improving the basic skill levels of 2.25 million adults between the launch of 'Skills for Life' in 2001 and 2010, with a milestone of 1.5 million in 2007; and reducing by at least 40 percent. the number of adults in the workforce who lack NVQ 2 or equivalent qualifications by 2010.<br/> Working towards this, one million adults in the workforce to achieve level 2 between 2003 and 2006.</td> <td>The first part of this target covers those aged 16 and above in England, who have left compulsory education excluding those in school sixth forms.<br/> The target refers to individuals significantly improving their basic skills. This could be through public or privately supported provision. Publicly supported provision is largely funded by the Learning and Skills Council, but also includes provision through, Jobcentre Plus, the Prison Service and other Government funded routes. The LSC are also proposing to have this target.<br/> Improvement refers to the individual passing an appropriate attainment threshold in:<br/> Literacy, Numeracy or ESOL at Entry Level 3, Level 1or Level 2 mapped to the National Standards developed by the Qualification and Curriculum Authority.<br/> Key Skills test in Application of Number or Communication at Levels 1 or 2<br/> GCSEs in Maths or English.<br/> There will be portfolio-based assessment for some, especially those at the lowest skill levels. The target refers to numbers of adults not qualifications.<br/> Progress will be monitored through collation of administrative statistics on recruitment, retention and achievement from the Learning and Skills Council and other relevant sources. This data will be received quarterly. Additional sources include quarterly data of learning within the Prison Service and Jobcentre Plus. To improve timeliness, quarterly administrative statistics on qualifications will also be collected directly from Awarding Bodies. This will also be used to verify LSC, Prison Service and Jobcentre Plus achievements, assess the coverage of these sources and allow adjustments for under-coverage.<br/> The time lag between qualifications and data collected by the LSC is about six months and for Awarding Body data is about three months.<br/> The target period began on 1 April 2001 and ends on 31 July 2010 at the end of the academic year 2009/10. Final data on achievement will be available in Autumn 2010. A milestone of 1.5 million achievements by 2007 will be reported against in Autumn 2007.<br/> The second part of the PSA target covers attainment of all economically active adults in England between the ages of 18&ndash;64 (males) or 18&ndash;59 (females). Economically active adults, who also constitute what is meant by &quot;the workforce&quot;, are either employees, self-employed or unemployed     according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition and thus actively seeking work.<br/> Progress towards the target will  be measured in terms of the increase in the number of economically active adults with a level 2 or higher qualification between 2001 and 2010.<br/> The data used to monitor progress towards achieving the target come from the Autumn quarter of the LFS (available in January of the following year).<br/> All achievements recorded through the LFS, whether gained through public or private investment, will count towards the target This reflects the nature of the target as a shared ambition, whose achievement is dependent not just on Government interventions and funds but also on the voluntary actions of employers and individuals choosing to spend time and private resources on achieving qualifications.<br/> The baseline for 2010 is the Autumn 2001 LFS figure (when 16.0 million economically active adults had at least a level 2 qualification whilst 7.1 million were below level 2). After allowing for the estimated increase in the size of the workforce between 2001 and 2010, achievement of a 40 percent. reduction in the numbers without a level 2 requires an additional 3.6 million first level 2 or higher qualifications over that period. From spring 2007 the LFS is likely to change from being a seasonal quarterly survey to calendar quarters. The 4th quarter (sampling in October, November and December) will provide the closest comparison to the old Autumn quarter (sampling in September, October and November) used to set the target baseline. Therefore the final target outturn will be assessed using the 4th quarter of the 2010 LFS.<br/> The baseline for the 2006 milestone target is autumn 2002 to be assessed against the autumn 2006 quarter of the LFS.<br/> The Level 2 threshold is reached by obtaining any of the following: Five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C; an intermediate GNVQ; an NVQ level 2 or any other equivalent Level 2 qualification; one A-level (grade A to E); 2 AS levels (grades A to E) or any other full Level 3, Level 4 or Level 5 qualification.<br/> Figures related to this target have been previously published in an annual statistical first release (SFR) since 2001, most recently in &quot;The Level of Highest Qualification Held By Young People and Adults: England 2003&quot;. published on 5 February 2004. The SFR is within the National Statistics remit.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.2081W.2/1">In relation to schools, since 2000, we have provided &pound;6,000 bursaries to PGCE trainee teachers in a range of priority subjects. We have also provided them with a &pound;4,000 &quot;Golden Hello&quot;. From September 2005 the bursary for mathematics and science trainees rose to &pound;7,000, and from September 2006 it will increase to &pound;9,000 for all priority subject trainees. Mathematics and science teachers will also be provided with an increased &quot;Golden Hello&quot; of &pound;5,000 (&pound;2,500 for other priority subjects).</p>
	<p pid="c.2081W.2/2">Routes into teaching are now also much more diverse. Over 15 per cent. of newly qualified teachers are trained through employment based teacher training schemes (EBTTS)&mdash;mainly the Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP), the Registered Teacher Programme (RTP), and the Overseas Trained Teacher Programme (OTTP). Each of these schemes carries its own incentives, comprising of a combination of support with the costs of training, salary grants and training grants.</p>
	<p pid="c.2081W.2/3">We also started 'Teach First' in 2003 and this involves training top graduates from some of the UK's top universities to achieve Qualified Teacher Status. Trainees are trained to teach priority subjects in some of London's most challenging schools. The scheme began in London and will be extended to Manchester in 2006 and four other cities from 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="c.2081W.2/4">The TDA is also funding enhancement courses to increase the number of people able to start initial teacher training in physics, chemistry and mathematics. These courses fill gaps in the subject knowledge of participants who in all other respects meet the requirements for teaching. Following a successful pilot, these courses will be made available nationally from January 2006, and will enable up to 700 additional people per year to qualify to teach in these subjects. Courses are free to participants, and each participant receives a training bursary of &pound;150 per week.</p>
	<p pid="c.2081W.2/5">All secondary teacher training will enable participants to teach to GCSE level, and in many cases to A-Level.</p>
	<p pid="c.2081W.2/6">In the post-compulsory sector, there are two main incentive programmes in place for attracting new teachers. Training Bursaries were introduced in 2000 and offer an additional &pound;6,000 in shortage areas but rising to &pound;7,000 for Maths and Science, and this will rise to &pound;9,000 from September 2006. &quot;Golden Hellos&quot; were introduced in 2002 and currently offer an additional &pound;4,000 for shortage areas (e.g. ICT, engineering, construction) but rising to &pound;5,000 for Maths and Science.</p>

Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;5.5 billion this year and will rise further to &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="c.2089W.2/1">The Primary National Strategy has been asked to renew and update its framework for the teaching of mathematics. The renewed framework will reflect the significant improvements in mathematics teaching we have seen since the framework was introduced in 1999 and will draw on the latest evidence to ensure that it supports schools and settings to raise attainment still further by delivering education tailored to the needs of every child.</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/2">The strategy's terms of reference are to ensure that the renewed framework for teaching mathematics provides schools and settings with:</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> a clearer set of age-related outcomes relating to learning progression in mathematics, which will inform the structure of the curriculum;</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> better sign-posting to the range of teaching materials and professional development opportunities currently on offer to support teaching practice;</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/5" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> an increased sense of drive and momentum on mathematics, making adjustments to learning objectives involving some progressive scaling up of expectations for each year group.</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/6">A period of informal consultation is currently under way. Discussions are being held with consultancy groups drawn from national samples of head teachers, teachers, local authority representatives, subject and professional organisations and higher education institutions. A consultation forum has been set up on the DfES website. To date, well over 100 contributors have taken part in consultancy group discussions and the website consultation forum has had 40 contributions posted on it, many of which are from local authorities feeding back comments from their meetings with local teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2089W.2/7">The strategy will continue to hold discussions with experts across the mathematics community to elicit their views on proposed content and structure of the revised framework and will post documentation on the website for wider comment. After Easter 2006, a draft revised framework will be published for more formal consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.2092W.11/1">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), has in place a bovine tuberculosis (TB) control programme, which aims to bring about a substantial reduction in TB disease levels in Northern Ireland. The incidence of TB has been decreasing in Northern Ireland since early to mid-2003. This trend has continued during the first ten months of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.11/2">The control measures are based on a programme of testing, the slaughter of infected animals, the restriction of movements of animals to and from infected herds and surrounding herds, and the tracing of contact animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.11/3">Following the TB policy review undertaken in 2002, DARD has introduced a number of new measures to strengthen the control of TB in Northern Ireland. The most important of these measures are tighter restrictions on overdue tests and changes to the valuation system, including the establishment of an independent appeal panel to resolve valuation disputes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.11/4">Work is also underway on the feasibility of further measures that can be introduced to control TB. This includes a pilot on the use of the gamma interferon blood test, in combination with skin testing, to assist in the detection of TB in cattle in certain circumstances, and a review of the existing arrangements for TB testing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2092W.11/5">In relation to badgers and TB, a Badger Stakeholder Group was established in May 2004 to review all the relevant information available on badgers and to consider the potential need for a badger management strategy to help reduce TB levels in Northern Ireland. At present, work is being finalised on cost/benefit information relevant to Northern Ireland to assist the Group, and the results of that work will be presented to the Group at a further meeting. The Group is expected to report in early 2006. No decision will be taken on badgers in Northern Ireland until the work of the Badger Stakeholder Group has been completed.</p>

	<p pid="c.2098W.8/1">Housing Associations assumed responsibility for the delivery of social housing from the Housing Executive in 1998. This answer therefore refers to Housing Association planned starts. The social housing development programme operates on a five-year time frame and is rolled forward each year to take account of changing needs and priorities. A 10-year projection is therefore not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.2103W.8/1">The change in the number of pensioners, recorded by the Family Resources Survey as in poverty, should be treated with some caution, because some variation is to be expected from one year to the next in the results of sample surveys. Results from a longer period of time would be required to confirm the trend. It would not be prudent to speculate about possible explanations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.8/2">Since 1997 we have taken many steps to tackle pensioner poverty, including the introduction of pension credit, winter fuel payments and free television licences. Also, since 2000 the basic state pension has risen substantially more than inflation. As a result of these measures during 2005&ndash;06 pensioner households will be on average &pound;29 a week better off while the poorest third of pensioner households will be on average &pound;39 a week better off compared with 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.8/3">Pension credit has been key to this increase in income, currently guaranteeing a minimum income of &pound;109.45 a week for single pensioners and &pound;167.05 for couples. The Government are committed to increasing the guarantee credit element of pension credit by earnings next year and in the next spending round 2006 to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.2105W.0/1">The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified second hand smoke as a Group 1 human carcinogen. Other Group 1 carcinogens include asbestos, arsenic, benzene and radon gas.</p>
	<p pid="c.2105W.0/2">The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the US and the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have concluded that even proposed new technologies, such as displacement ventilation systems, which may reduce second hand smoke exposure levels by 90 percent., still leave exposure levels which are 1,500 to 2,500 times the acceptable risk level for hazardous air pollutants. The conclusion of the OSHA/ACGIH ventilation panel is that dilution ventilation is not a viable control option for Environmental Tobacco Smoke.</p>
	<p pid="c.2105W.0/3">The US Surgeon General, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organisation, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the American Medical Association and the American Lung Association have all concluded that there is no safe level of exposure to second hand smoke.</p>
	<p pid="c.2105W.0/4">The Government's Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) has concluded that exposure to second hand smoke is a cause of lung cancer and, in those with long-term exposure, the increased risk is estimated to be in the order of 24 percent. In 2004, SCOTH indicated that the weight of evidence published on the causal effect of exposure to second hand smoke on the risk of ischaemic heart disease is now stronger than at the time of SCOTH'S 1998 report and that the increased risk is estimated to be in the order of 25 percent. SCOTH also concluded that the evidence published since 1998 continues to point to a strong link between exposure to second hand smoke and adverse effects in children.</p>

The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and Invest Northern Ireland continue to work closely with the retail multiples to encourage them to increase trade with Northern Ireland suppliers. Also, as part of the implementation of the &quot;Fit For Market&quot; report, supermarket representatives are currently participating in the development of a domestic marketing campaign for local produce. I consider that this work is vital to maximise the uptake of local produce and bring long-term benefit to the Northern Ireland agri-food industry.</p>

I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.2107W.5/4" class="indent">It is estimated that less than 1% of households in Northern Ireland are not connected to the public water supply. Water Service does not, at present, have a database of all household customers connect to mains water and cannot therefore supply the information on a constituency basis. However, a comprehensive customer database is currently being developed in preparation for the proposed introduction of domestic charging from April 2007 and this will identify any households not connected to the public water supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2107W.5/5" class="indent">Water service currently has a duty to provide water and sewerage services but is not required to do anything which is not practicable at a reasonable cost. For this reason, Water Service has always operated a policy of reasonable cost. The allowances for watermain schemes are &pound;5,000 for properties, which were occupied and on which rates were being paid on or before <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-31">31 May 2000</phrase>, and &pound;2,900 for other properties. The higher reasonable cost allowance for existing properties not connected to the public watermain reflects the importance attached to reducing the number of such properties. The policy provides Water Service with an objective mechanism to consider applications for new water and sewerage services in a consistent and equitable manner. The policy seeks to strike a balance between the interests of householders and taxpayers, within the context of resources made available for water and sewerage services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2107W.5/6" class="indent">Where the cost of providing a first-time service exceeds the total reasonable cost allowance, Water Service will proceed with the scheme if the householders who will benefit from the scheme agree to meet the balance.</p>

In other words, we do not collect directly the information you require on the volume of water used by farmhouses. However, the nearest estimate of the domestic consumption could be obtained from the data relating to detached properties which is included in the sample of 5,000 domestic properties. The volume of water used by detached properties was 415 litres per property per day in 2003/04 and 448 litres per property per day in 2004/05.</p>

This drew on a wide range of sources including programmes organised by the International Energy Agency as well as a public consultation, and estimated costs of &pound;38-&pound;127 per tonne of carbon for abatement on coal fired plant. This should be compared to the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which is highly uncertain although a recent report for DEFRA indicated a range from &pound;35-&pound;1,000 per tonne of carbon emitted.</p>

	<p pid="c.2112W.2/2">Diverse supplies, delivered through competitive markets, are the most efficient way to ensure security of gas supply. The Government is committed to working with others to provide an appropriate framework for international trade in gas, and to developing partnerships with gas producing and transit countries. However, there is concern that changes in other Governments' national rules are potentially diverting cargoes of Liquefied Natural Gas away from Great Britain, and that gas supplies via the interconnector from continental Europe have not fully responded to recent strong price signals; Ofgem and the Government are pursuing these issues with the European Commission. The Government's Energy Review, due to report in 2006, will look at the reliability of energy supplies in the medium and long term.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-Budget statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December</phrase> were subject to detailed analysis to ensure that the North sea tax regime delivers the Government's objectives of striking the right balance between oil producers and consumers, by promoting investment and ensuring fairness for taxpayers. They are not expected to have a significant effect on exploration for oil and gas on the UK continental shelf. They are also not expected to have a significant effect on production. While the increase in the rate of the supplementary charge may impact a very small number of marginal investments, the Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement should provide an incentive to investment, particularly by new entrants, a small but important sector for the continued vitality of the North sea. The industry can now plan for the future safe in the knowledge that there will be no further increases in North sea taxation for the lifetime of this Parliament and with the offer of discussions with Government to tackle wider structural issues which affect the stability of the North sea oil tax regime.</p>

It was not designed to provide long-term core funding for these organisations. Under the 2004 spending review for the period 2006&ndash;07 to 2007&ndash;08, the DTI is making available a &pound;6 million per annum contribution to regional development agencies, toward their support for enterprise in under-represented groups and deprived communities. The Government have also introduced the Community Investment Tax Relief scheme to enable community development funding agencies to raise finance from the private sector. The first 23 accredited Community Development Finance Institutions are aiming to raise over &pound;80 million this way, which is double the figure that has been committed to the sector through the Phoenix Fund. Furthermore, following the Graham Review of the Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme, there is now scope for more Community Development Finance Institutions to become Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme lenders under the new arrangements and it is hoped this can be taken forward from next March.</p>

The regulation of gas and electricity supply, including arrangements in respect of vulnerable customers, is the responsibility of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Ofgem requires gas and electricity suppliers, under section 37 of their licences, to provide services for persons who are of pensionable age, disabled or chronically sick. These obligations include the maintenance of a Priority Service Register, and the provision of special services to meet the access, communication and safety needs of eligible customers. Relevant information about customers on the register is passed to gas and electricity distribution companies to enable them to comply with their obligations in the event of certain categories of supply failure.</p>

	<p pid="c.2117W.2/1">I assume the hon. Member is referring to Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs).</p>
	<p pid="c.2117W.2/2">Many microgenerators already benefit from the Renewables Obligation (RO). However, feedback from microgenerators, as part of the current Review of the RO, suggested that the some of the administrative requirements might act as a barrier to accessing the benefits of the RO. One potential barrier is that the RO order defines the obligation in terms of the supply of electricity to customers in Great Britain. As a result there is a requirement that even generators that consume their own electricity must first sell it to a supplier before buying it back for their own consumption.</p>
	<p pid="c.2117W.2/3">The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill is currently before Parliament, and the Government intend to use this to introduce primary legislation that would allow the removal of this requirement for small generators. The Government would also like to use the same Bill to introduce primary legislation, which would allow agents to act on behalf of small generators through the process of accreditation and claiming ROCs and allowing ROCs to be issued to agents. It will also allow agents to amalgamate the output of small generators.</p>
	<p pid="c.2117W.2/4">The Government are also carrying out further work, outside of the current Review of the RO, to address other barriers preventing the widespread take-up of microgeneration technologies. The Government will be publishing a strategy for the promotion of microgeneration next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2121W.0/1">A study by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in 2004 suggests that wind farms have no lasting impact on UK house prices. It shows that local house prices recover from any initial impact once a wind farm has been operating for two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2121W.0/2">Also evidence from the &quot;Public attitude to wind farms: a survey of local residents in Scotland&quot; conducted by MORI in 2003 suggests that those living nearest to wind farms are their strongest advocates.

	<p pid="c.2121W.3/1">The UK has played a leading role in ensuring that the international framework to promote international labour rights and to tackle abuses of those rights throughout the world is in place, particularly through its work with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which is the UN specialised agency responsible for developing, promoting and monitoring labour standards. DWP as lead Department for the ILO play an active role in the ILO Committee on Multinational Enterprises and DTI fully supports the promotion and follow-up of the ILO Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy which seeks to enhance the positive social and labour effects of multinational corporations' operations throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.2121W.3/2">We also actively encourage UK-based international companies which operate in other countries, and which are subject to the laws applicable in those countries, to apply high standards of corporate behaviour, including those which protect workers' rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.2121W.3/3">For example, DTI promotes the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises which recommend standards of responsible business conduct for businesses operating in or from the 39 adhering countries and have written to the FTSE 100 companies to raise awareness of these expectations. We have also set out our approach to encouraging environmentally and socially responsible practice internationally in our International Strategic Framework on Corporate Social Responsibility published in March.</p>

Seasonal 'flu refers to the virus that circulates in the human population and causes widespread illness each winter. Pandemic 'flu will only occur after an avian virus has mutated into a novel strain which can spread easily between humans, and to which they do not have immunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.2125W.5/2">The Department is currently developing plans for mass vaccination for pandemic influenza. Plans will depend on a number of factors, such as the rate at which a vaccine is supplied to the United Kingdom. In October 2005, the Department announced that it is inviting manufacturers to tender for a contract to supply pandemic influenza vaccine once the pandemic strain is known. The proposal to purchase in advance the capacity needed to make a pandemic influenza vaccine will make sure that an effective vaccine is available for use in the UK as quickly as possible after an influenza starts. The UK will need approximately 120 million doses to be available as soon as possible.</p>

For example, if the patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels the operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital, but who have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.</p>

Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; other emergency patient needing theatre; theatre list over-run; equipment failure; administrative error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</p>

	<p pid="c.2130W.5/1">Responsibility for the provision of local services rests with local national health service organisations working in conjunction with local stakeholders and their strategic health authorities. I understand that the local disposition of services between Barnet hospital, which is a new private funded initiative funded hospital, and Chase Farm hospital is proposed to be the subject of an engagement exercise with local people. There is still much further work to be done taking into account the results of engagement before proposals reach the stage of formal consultation which is expected in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2130W.5/2">A strategic outline case has already been approved for an &pound;80 million development on the Chase Farm site which would replace many of the old Victorian buildings. A revised outline business case is expected by the North Central London strategic health authority towards the end of November for the development which will need to be seen in the context of the future services on the site. It offers a good opportunity to replace unacceptable buildings and to demonstrate a commitment for appropriate services on the Chase Farm hospital site well into the future.</p>

National roll-out of choose and book is progressing, supported by the Department and NHS Connecting for Health.

	<p pid="c.2134W.5/1">The evidence from personal dental service pilots is that moving away from a fee-per-item system supports dentists in carrying out simpler courses of treatment, such as fillings, where there are fewer individual items within each course. This frees up significant time that can be used in part to see a greater range of patients. The new general dental service (GDS) contract will allow all dentists to work in this way. The new type of GDS contract will also require dentists to have regard to the new National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines on patient recall intervals. These guidelines are likely to mean many patients are recalled by their dentist less often than the current six monthly intervals. The dental reforms will also give primary care trusts (PCTs) the financial ability to commission new NHS dental services more readily if a dentist in their area chooses to deregister NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/2">Dentists will no longer receive payment based on the number of patients registered but in return for a guaranteed annual contract value they will be expected to provide an agreed level of service over the course of a year. Taken in conjunction with the application of the NICE guidelines this will support improvement in patient access.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/3">It is not possible to predict with complete accuracy the overall impact that these measures will have but we are confident that they will together support significant improvement in patient access.</p>

	<p pid="c.2136W.5/18">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2136W.5/19">1. Registration rates (i.e. the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery (not the patient's address). So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="c.2136W.5/20">2. The registration rates use population estimates for the primary care trust areas for the nearest year for which data are available. Figures for 1997 to 2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2004 have been calculated from 2003 population data.</p>
	<p pid="c.2136W.5/21">3. The changes in registration period from two years to 15 months under the General Dental Services from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase> affected the registration numbers from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures. Data for 2004 and 2005 include some personal dental service proxy registrations, that is counts of patients seen in the past 15 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.2140W.2/19">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2140W.2/20">1. Registration rates, that is the percentage of the population registered with a dentist, have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery, not the patient's address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="c.2140W.2/21">2. The registration rates use population estimates for the PCT areas for the nearest year for which data is available. Figures for 1997&ndash;2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated from 2003 population data.</p>
	<p pid="c.2140W.2/22">3. The changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months under the general dental services from <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> affected the registration numbers from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures. Data for 2004 and 2005 include some personal dental service proxy registrations, that is, counts of patients seen in the past 15 months.</p>

HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

The data does not represent the number of HIV tests offered and taken up by the population resident within each SHA, as many patients cross health boundaries to access GUM clinics. In addition, the gender and sexual orientation mix varies between clinics. Some clinics are attended by a high number of men who have sex with men and consequently this influences the number of HIV tests offered and taken.</p>

	<p pid="c.2149W.2/1">Measures to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS were set out in the &quot;National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV&quot; (2001) and the public health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, published last November, available from the Library and from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/05/89/45/04058945.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/05/89/45/04058945.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2149W.2/2">These measures include targeted HIV prevention and health promotion work with those most at risk of HIV infection, such as gay men and African communities, provided through community organisations such as the Terence Higgins Trust and the African HIV Policy Network. The Choosing Health White Paper also announced a new high profile national campaign, to promote safer sex messages, aimed at reducing the prevalence and spread of all sexually transmitted infections including HIV. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December</phrase>, the Department published for consultation and action plan to tackle HIV related stigma and discrimination, which is available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/39/93/04123993.pdf">www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/39/93/04123993.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2149W.2/3">In addition to these national measures, primary care trusts are responsible for providing HIV prevention and services which meet the needs of their local populations. To support them in this role, the Department, working with professional bodies, has published recommended standards for national health service HIV services; a toolkit of best practice for sexual health promotion, and guidance on commissioning.</p>

	<p pid="c.2153W.8/1">It is important to be clear about the differences between seasonal 'flu, avian 'flu and pandemic 'flu. Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds. Seasonal 'flu refers to the virus that circulates in the human population and causes widespread illness each winter. Pandemic 'flu will only occur after an avian virus has mutated into a novel strain which can spread easily between humans, and to which they do not have immunity.</p>
	<p pid="c.2153W.8/2">The Government are building a stockpile of antiviral drugs to treat people who become ill with pandemic 'flu rather than for prophylaxis. Since the stockpile of Tamiflu is intended to be large enough to cover all of those likely to become ill, the issue of prioritisation between competing claims for antiviral drugs ought not to arise. However, if a pandemic strikes before the stockpile is complete or the clinical attack rate is higher than expected, antivirals will need to be prioritised, initially health care workers, and to those who fall into one of the &quot;clinical at risk&quot; groups, as defined by seasonal 'flu. Once a vaccine for the pandemic 'flu strain has been developed, health care workers and other essential service key workers may need to be vaccinated first, as it will be important to maintain health and other essential services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2153W.8/3">Final decisions will be made based on emerging information about the pandemic virus. However, given it is unlikely that a vaccine will be available for the first wave of a pandemic, it is important that businesses consider how they would maintain services.</p>

	<p pid="c.2155W.9/1">The implementation of the &quot;national service framework for mental health&quot; is envisaged to take 10 years and a comprehensive account of the progress made in the first half of the implementation period is available in the national director for mental health's report, &quot;The National Service Framework for Mental Health&mdash;Five Years On&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.2155W.9/2">Most of the targets set for mental health services in the &quot;NHS Plan&quot; have now been met.

	<p pid="c.2155W.9/3">Since the publication of the NHS Plan, 205 secure beds and 75 specialist rehabilitation hostel places for people with personality disorders have been created. The NHS Plan included a target to move up to 400 inappropriately placed patients out of the high security hospitals, which was achieved by its end of 2004 target date. All prisoners with severe mental health illness now have a care plan and 360 prison in-reach staff have been recruited to help manage prisoners with severe mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="c.2155W.9/4">At the end of March, Leicester Partnership NHS Trust, which delivers mental health services in North West Leicestershire, was providing six crisis resolution, one early intervention and four assertive outreach teams. In addition, 38.7 whole-time equivalent (wte) graduate primary care, 10 wte community gateway and 2.2 wte carer support staff were employed by the Leicester Partnership NHS Trust at the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="c.2160W.0/1">The NHS Pensions Agency is to become part of the Business Services Authority (BSA) on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. This was first announced in the report, &quot;Reconfiguring the Department of Health's Arm's Length Bodies&quot; published in July 2004. This report reflected Government policy to reduce costs of administration through modernisation of systems and use of private sector capability where appropriate. &quot;The Implementation Framework for Reconfiguring the DH's Arm's Length Bodies:, redistributing resources to the NHS frontline&quot; published in November 2004 built on this approach. In implementing these reports, consideration is being given to market testing a wide range of the BSA's functions, not just those of the NHS Pensions Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/2">Following a review of the NHS Pensions Agency by KPMG, a report recommending full outsourcing of this mostly administrative business was published on <phrase class="date" code="1998-05-21">21 May 1998</phrase>. The decision to outsource elements of the business was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-06">6 March 2000</phrase>. The KPMG report was placed in the Library of the House on the same day. Expressions of interest were invited through the official Journal of the European Community on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-20">20 June 2000</phrase> and 33 organisations responded.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/3">The outcome of the procurement process was to award a contract covering about half of the NHS Pensions Agency's functions to Paymaster (1836) Limited with an option to expand to all its functions at a point in the future. The contractual terms agreed at that time obliged the NHS Pensions Agency to negotiate with Paymaster (1836) Limited first on any proposed expansion of the outsourcing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/4">Should a decision be made to expand the existing outsourcing arrangements at the NHS Pensions Agency, full consultation will be undertaken with both trade unions and employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/5">If outsourcing some or all of the NHS Pensions Agency is extended as a result of current negotiations, employees dealing with NHS Pensions and the student bursary scheme will transfer to the private sector partner under the provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/6">The resulting contract with the private sector supplier will reflect the principles of the Joint Statement of Good Practice issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase> by the Department, NHS Employers, the Confederation of British Industry and the Business Services Association, together with a number of trade unions. That statement commits private sector suppliers who contract with the NHS to meet minimum standards on pay, conditions of service and work force issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.0/7">Similarly, contractors are required to offer all transferring NHS employees membership of a pension scheme broadly comparable to the NHS scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.2161W.2/1">NHS Professionals is currently working with officials in the Department to develop a three year corporate strategy underpinned by annual business plans so that it can become self-financing and prepare to take on independent status from 2007&ndash;08 as proposed in the review of Departmental arm's length bodies in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2161W.2/2">NHS Professionals meets the Best Payment Practice in the NHS, which requires at least 95 per cent. of suppliers to be paid within 30 days. During the financial year 2004&ndash;05 it received two statutory demands for payment, paid a total of &pound;2,000 to compensate for late payment and other associated legal costs and spent a total of &pound;2.5 million on external consultants. The external consultant costs included the provision of internal audit facilities, support for the relocation of the main offices in the south to a new contact centre and the development of a new booking system. Information relating to the percentage of suppliers of services to NHS Professionals waiting for payment of services rendered is not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="c.2162W.2/1">The Department has had several discussions with stakeholders. In our proposals sent out on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>, we indicated that we were minded to require primary care trusts (PCTs) to reduce their service-provision functions by the end of 2008. Since that document, we have listened to stakeholders. The policy moving forward, in relation to service-provision, is that this will be a matter for PCTs to determine locally. So any move away from direct provision of services will be a decision for the local NHS within the framework set out in the forthcoming White Paper and after local consultation, including professions allied to medicine.</p>
	<p pid="c.2162W.2/2">We will support PCTs who want to do that, but we will not instruct PCTs to do it, nor will we impose any timetable. What matters is getting the best services for each community&mdash;and that is what the White Paper will focus on.</p>

	<p pid="c.2165W.11/1">The Department is not currently funding and has no plans to commission studies specifically related to poverty and health.</p>
	<p pid="c.2165W.11/2">The Department has supported and continues to support a range of studies looking at associated issues. Over the last eight years, research has been commissioned on both the impact of socio-economic circumstances on health, and also on the impact of mainstream and targeted services. For example, projects have been supported on inequalities in the outcome of pregnancy; the health effects of welfare advice in primary care, and on the effect of out of home day care on the health of disadvantaged families. A project on inequalities in the health of older people looked at the association between health and material and social well-being among older people using various indicators.</p>
	<p pid="c.2165W.11/3">In addition, the Department is the principal funder, with other Government Departments, of the five-year English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The study was begun in 2003 and is gathering data on income, housing, health and other areas from its representative sample of some 12,000 people aged 50 and over.</p>
