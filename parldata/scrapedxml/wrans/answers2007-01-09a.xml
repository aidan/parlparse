(109632)</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/5" class="indent">(a) Infant mortality rates in England for years since 1978 are routinely published in Table 2.1 of Health Statistics Quarterly which can be accessed using the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/HSQ32.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/HSQ32.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/7" class="indent">(b) Infant mortality rates in the routine and manual group are not available prior to 1997. This is because until 2000 infant mortality rates were published by Social Class based on father's occupation. The nearest equivalent Social Class groups prior to 1997 are not comparable see background note 5. In 2001 Social Class was replaced by the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), and since then infant mortality figures have been published by NS-SEC. It is not possible to use NS-SEC for data prior to 2001 because there is not a one-to-one equivalence with the Social Class classification; an approximation is used, referred to as NS-SEC90 because it is based on the 1990 occupational classification. NS-SEC90 is used specifically to aid interpretation of trends over time in infant mortality and was calculated back to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/8" class="indent">The table below shows infant mortality rates in England and Wales from 1997-1999 to 2003-2005, for the routine and manual group and for all births inside marriage/joint registrations. We provide data for England and Wales as progress on the infant mortality target is assessed using these data as figures for the routine and manual group for England alone are not readily available.</p>

Any changes to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy control legislation must be carried out on the basis of a thorough risk assessment, based on sound science. It is unlikely that any change could be made before 2008 at the earliest. Meanwhile, we are required to enforce the legislation that is currently in place.</p>

An estimated 45,000 to 50,000 g-IFN tests may be undertaken each year, depending on circumstances arising in the field.

	<p pid="a.479W.0/1">The eco design for energy using products (EUP) framework directive requires the European Commission, in consultation with member states, accession countries, industry and other interested parties to bring forward a three-year work plan by July 2007. In the interim, the Commission has committed to bring forward proposals for implementing measures following the priorities in the EU Climate Change Programme. 14 product studies are currently under way, with a further six due to start before June 2007. These studies will provide the basis for decisions as to whether the products should be subject to mandatory implementing measures under the EUP directive. The products currently being studied include televisions, motors, domestic cold appliances, plus a study on standby.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/2">The Government's Market Transformation Programme is engaged with the project teams carrying out the studies to provide detailed information and advice from the UK's perspective. This will help to make sure the studies are robust and comprehensive. As a result of pressure from the UK and other member states, the Commission has recently agreed to &quot;fast-track&quot; a study on simple set-top boxes, while respecting the terms of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.479W.0/3">The Government's Energy Review, published on<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>, clarified our intention to work with other governments, manufacturers and retailers to phase out the least efficient light bulbs. There are ongoing discussions between the Government and the Lighting Association and retailers about the best way to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="a.480W.3/1">DEFRA announced a &pound;750,000 investment in research on ruminant nutrition regimes to reduce methane and nitrogen emissions in December 2006. This research project will build on our knowledge base and take an integrated approach to the development of ruminant nutrition regimes to deliver reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, per animal and per unit of meat and milk output. Approaches for consideration include the modification of forage based diets, alterations to concentrate feed formulation and ingredients, and feed supplements. All options and solutions will belooked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.3/2">This research builds on a wealth of past work, where MAFF and DEFRA have invested in research to improve the productivity of dairy cattle. The resulting increases in individual cow milk yields can reduce methane emissions per unit of milk produced. The DEFRA research has included for example developing grass varieties that are high in sugar and lead indirectly to a reduction in methane emissions. Complementary private sector research, including research sponsored by DEFRA through our Sustainable Livestock LINK Programme, has raised the efficiency of dairy production.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.3/3">The Government are also developing a strategy on anaerobic digestion (AD), a system that can be used to capture and utilise methane emissions from livestock wastes, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AD is particularly applicable and effective on dairy units, and provides a potential source of renewable energy and heat.</p>

	<p pid="a.489W.5/3">Section 45 (1) (b) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a duty on the local authority to make arrangements for the collection of commercial waste in its area, if requested by the holder of the waste to collect it. Therefore in order to fulfil this duty, the authority must have arrangements in place to deal with waste from commercial sources. Irrespective of whether it provides the service itself or contracts some other body to do the work, the local authority is still in control of the waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.5/1">Cheshire Rural Recovery (now renamed Cheshire Rural Enterprise) was formed in 2003 as a five year, &pound;10 million scheme to assist in delivering improvements to Cheshire's rural economy. The scheme manages a number of projects such as the Rural Small Building Scheme, which aims to refurbish under-used rural buildings, and Saddle Up which supports the equestrian sector. The exact criteria for the different areas of support can vary depending on the grant The Guidelines for applicants are available on the Cheshire Rural Enterprise website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cwhrural.info/">http://www.cwhrural.info/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/3">The scheme has now committed virtually all of its resources. To date, two projects have been supported in Winsford, mainly though their impact on the wider rural area:</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/4" class="indent">(i) As part of the Rural Business Development programme managed through Business Link, TCR Irrigation were supported to purchase specialist equipment. A &pound;15,300 grant was offered of a &pound;51,000 total project cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/5" class="indent">(ii) Support has been provided to develop a new radio station to be based in Winsford but covering a large area of rural Cheshire. A &pound;18,980 grant was offered of a &pound;71,470 total project cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/6">As a rule, the urban areas of Winsford are not eligible for rural recovery grant support as the town has not been classed as a Market Town. The surrounding rural hinterland of the town would be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/7">The administration costs for Cheshire Rural Enterprise are not managed at a borough council level but are administered for the scheme as a whole. The administration costs for the whole scheme are set at6.5 per cent. of the total approved.</p>

There is no direct relationship between the value of notes produced by the Bank in any year and the number of notes put into circulation.

	<p pid="a.497W.0/1">The new tax regime for registered pension schemes included additional flexibilities to make it easier for pension providers to offer lump sum death benefits as part of an individual's overall personal pension arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.0/2">By saving in any tax-privileged pension vehicle, individuals are committing to using the resulting fund for the purpose of providing an income in retirement.

According to the new business statistics collated by the Association of British Insurers, 17,090 term assurance policies were sold as pension products in the quarter ended <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June 2006</phrase> and another 44,580 policies were sold in the quarter ended <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.498W.2/2">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) assumed responsibility for the regulation of general insurance on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-14">14 January 2005</phrase>. The introduction of the FSA's regime served to implement the EU's Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) 2002/92/EC in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.2/3">The IMD requires the UK to regulate various insurance mediation activities in connection with contracts of insurance, including long-term insurance business, commercial insurance and reinsurance. The activities required to be regulated include sellingand administering such insurance contracts by intermediaries. The IMD does not apply where a number of specified conditions are met, however the selling of insurance along with powered mobility products is not capable of meeting all of these conditions. In general, those undertaking insurance mediation must either be authorised to do so by the FSA, be an appointed representative of an authorised firm or be a member of a designated professional body that allows the firm to be exempt from authorisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.502W.0/1">We are concerned by all reportsof inter-religious conflict in Nigeria. Unfortunately, clashes between religious groups are not uncommon. The primary underlying cause of the conflict in northern Nigeria is rivalry between ethnic groups over the control of resources and power.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/2">Our High Commission in Abuja is aware of a local dispute in Dutse in Jigawa state, which occurred on19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-20">20 September 2006</phrase>, during which a small number of people were injured and churches were burnt down. The police quickly took control and imposed a curfew. There have been no further outbreaks of violence in the area and this appears to be an isolated situation, which boiled over. Our High Commission in Abuja regularly raises incidents of religious conflict with the Nigerian authorities but no representations have been made about this specific incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/3">My noble Friend Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, recently met with representatives of Christian and Muslim communities at an interfaith seminar in Kaduna to see the work they are undertaking to build bridges to better interfaith understanding. We continue to urge restraint and reconciliation on all sides and stress that intervention must be carried out with full respect for human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/4">Supporting measures to address religious conflict is also a key part of our conflict prevention strategy for Nigeria. We are funding projects to build trust between Nigeria's various religious communities. This includes support to the excellent work of Coventry Cathedral on building trust and understanding at grass-roots level between different religious and ethnic communities, which has contributed to a drop in the level of violence and an increased level of dialogue between Christians and Muslims. We are also funding the work of the Bridge Builders Foundation, a mixed Christian and Muslim organisation operating in northern Nigeria, to look into the causes of recent conflict between Christians and Muslims. They are in the process of setting up early warning mechanisms in all the northern States to prevent future conflict.</p>

Again, some of this is a cohort affect, with older pensioners with no qualifications being replaced by younger pensioners with higher qualification attainment. In terms of numbers, this suggests that about 1.5 million fewer pensioners had no qualifications in 2003 than in 1991 (5.26 million compared with 6.70 million).</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.6/137">The proportion of the working age population enduring financial distress (defined as either having problems meeting housing costs or has been more than two months in arrears with their mortgage or rent in the past year) has fallen from 15.2 per cent. in 1991 to 5.6 per cent. in 2003, translating into a reduction of about 3.2 million individuals. In 1991 about 5.2 million working age adults were enduring financial distress, compared to 2 million in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/138">There has also been a fall in the proportion of pensioners enduring financial distress over the period, from 6.9 per cent. in 1991 to 1.5 per cent. in 2003. (Although note that this may not be a very good measure of financial distress among pensioners, because a substantial proportion of pensioners do not have housing costs). This reduction translates into a fall in the numbers of pensioners suffering financial distress of about 0.5 million (from 0.7 million in 1991 to 0.2 million in 2003).</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.3/1">The Africa Conflict and Humanitarian Unit (ACHU) was established in 2003 to co-ordinate DFID's humanitarian and conflict prevention work in Africa. It works closely with the central Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department (CHASE) on policy and the overall coherence of DFID's global response. ACHU also provides the secretariat for the joint DFID/FCO/MOD Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP).</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/2">ACHU has a staff of 10, made up of the Head ofthe Unit, three humanitarian advisers, two conflict advisers, two programme managers, a programme officer, and an information and communications officer. Two regional conflict advisers, based in Africa, also report to the Head of ACHU. These work jointly to DFID, FCO and MOD under the auspices of the ACPP.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/3">ACHU does not have its own programme budget, nor is it an operational unit. It is an advisory unit supporting DFID's country and regional offices in Africa, and advising the Africa Director on the use of the divisional reserve to meet humanitarian needs. ACHU is also able to call on the central operational team based in CHASE for back-up support in the event of a major catastrophe or to provide supplementary staff support when work loads are high. DFID provides humanitarian assistance in response to needs across Africa as a whole, not just to those countries where we have a country programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/4">DFID does not work with a fixed budget for humanitarian aid in Africa, but responds according to need and in proportion to the UK's role as a leading humanitarian donor within the international community. Preliminary estimates of likely levels of need are made at the start of each financial year, and adjusted on the basis of ongoing assessments as the year unfolds. For this reason, it is not possible to predict what levels of humanitarian spending are likely over the next three years. We do, though, expect to maintain our position as a leading humanitarian donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/5">Over the past three financial years DFID has spent a total of &pound;565.6 million on bilateral humanitarian aid in Africa: &pound;125.4 million in 2003-04, &pound;171.0 million in 2004-05, and &pound;269.4 million in 2005-06. In the three years since 2003-04, Africa's share of DFID's total bilateral humanitarian assistance has risen from40.4 per cent. to 65.6 per cent. Humanitarian needs in Africa in 2005-06 were exceptional, and we do not expect spending to be so high in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/6">In its role as secretariat for the ACPP, ACHU oversees a joint DFID/FCO/MOD budget for conflict prevention work in Africa. Over the past three financial years this has stood at &pound;50.0 million for 2003-04,&pound;60.0 million for 2004-05, and &pound;60.0 million for 2005-06. In the current year the ACPP budget is&pound;63.0 million, rising to &pound;64.5 million in the next financial year. The ACPP budget is currently under review in the context of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. The forward budget for conflict prevention work in Africa from 2007-08 onwards is yet to be announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/7">Since its inception, ACHU has supported DFID and wider HMG conflict and humanitarian work throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including in the Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa.</p>

Between<phrase class="date" code="2003-01-18">18 January 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, there were17 coroner-confirmed suicides or open verdict deaths among UK regular armed forces deployed on Operation Telic since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-18">18 January 2003</phrase>. This includes deaths both in theatre and since their return, among the approximate 100,000 personnel deployed during this period. During this period, there were a further40 suicides or open verdict deaths among those who were not deployed on Operation Telic.

Aircraft are not available for tasking if they are undergoing scheduled maintenance, modification programmes or any other unforeseen rectification work that can arise on a day to day basis. The figures do not reflect the fact that an aircraft assessed as not fit for purpose may be returned to the front line at very short notice to meet the operational need.</p>

Organisations who do not want FBE to publicise their project do so for a number of reasons, for example, they are in the midst of negotiations to purchase a property and would regard details of the investment as commercially sensitive, or where it is engaged in sensitive work such as running a women's refuge where they do not want to publicise their work or their location.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.2/2">Peterborough is a Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) &quot;intensive&quot; area&mdash;which means that all aspects of the programme are in place there. These include drug testing for heroin and crack/cocaine following arrest for &quot;trigger offences&quot;, or any offence where a police officer of inspector rank or above suspects the misuse of such drugs caused or contributed to the offence. For those who test positive there is a requirement to attend an initial assessment with a drugs worker and, where applicable, restrictions on bail are used to encourage offenders to address their drug misuse problems. Other features of the programme are the case management of offenders and the brokering of access to other service such as housing or training support.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.2/3">The DIP management information system indicates that, in September 2006 the cumulative caseload for Peterborough Drug Action Team area stood at 99 clients. In this context, being on the caseload means that individuals are being case managed by drug workers, having been assessed as requiring interventions which are agreed in a specific care plan. The drugs worker will ensure that there is at all times co-ordination of the care plan, which in addition to drug treatment this may include support with issues relating to accommodation, finances and rebuilding family relationships. The cumulative caseload will change as new clients are engaged and existing ones no longer require management or are temporarily suspended while their management is supervised elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.2/4">Drug related crime is falling. Acquisitive crime, to which drug-related crime makes a substantial contribution, fell by almost 16 per cent. between April 4 and March 6.</p>

Experience in the custodial sector has shown that the introduction of alternative providers has helped to raise performance: there have been efficiency savings of up to 8.5 per cent. improved standards of decency and innovation in staffing structures and prison design. The public sector has also raised its game in response. We expect to see similar effects in probation.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.0/1">Mentoring for children in care features in a number of local authority programmes and voluntary sector initiatives and there is anecdotal evidence of its potential benefits. In recognition of this the Department is providing up to &pound;1.5 million for the development and evaluation of an adult mentoring programme for 600 looked after children aged between 10 and 15 to be delivered through the voluntary and community sector. In addition, peer mentoring is a feature of a three-year DfES funded pilot project led by the School Home Support Service UK which is designed to support children in care who are making the transition from primary to secondary school.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.5/2">The Learning and Skills Council has carried out a radical restructuring exercise which will ensure that it becomes even more effective at identifying and responding to learning and skill needs. The new structure will include around 150 new local partnership teams, which will work with key local stakeholders to secure a wide choice of high quality provision which reflects what individuals, employers and wider communities want and help to deliver our long term economic success. They will work alongside a number of specialist Economic Development teams, and will be supported by nine new regional centres that will provide core operational services and co-ordinate the LSC's work with regional partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.5/3">The new structure is expected to require 1,100 fewer posts across the whole organisation. The LSC continues to do all it can to avoid making compulsory redundancies, and estimates that nationally these changes will save up to &pound;40 million per year, which can be directed to front line services.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.8/1">Currently Ofsted visits child care providers before registration and inspects them within seven months of joining the register, and then at least once within the next three years. Through the Childcare Act 2006 we are reforming the inspection and regulation of child care and from September 2008 Ofsted will operate two registers: The Early Years Register (EYR), for children up to five; and the Ofsted Childcare Register (OCR), for school aged children and for child care for younger children not required to be registered. The OCR will be compulsory for providers of child care to children aged five to seven and voluntary for other child care. Regular inspections will continue after 2008 for providers, including nurseries, registered on the EYR. Inspection of child care registered on the OCR will be carried out proportionately on the basis of risks to children. Ofsted will at any time be able to request evidence that registered providers are meeting the OCR requirements, and will carry out the majority of inspections on a random basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.5/1">Child care provision, free at the point of delivery has been a universal entitlement for all four-year-olds since 1998 and for all three-year-olds since 2004. It is widely supported by parents, providers, local authorities and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/2">My colleagues and I regularly meet representatives of a range of stakeholders with an interest in the free entitlement and other child care issues. These meetings have been opportunities to celebrate the progress that we are making together towards the delivery of our Ten Year Childcare Strategy commitments and to discuss issues of implementation including those relating to the 2006 code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/3">Since the code of practice came into force in April 2006, Ministers and officials have received a range of correspondence from a variety of stakeholders. Correspondents routinely acknowledge the benefits of the free entitlement for children, and demonstrate commitment to its delivery. A number of correspondents have raised issues relating to the arrangements for increasing the free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks and to 15 hours per week by 2010, and a number have expressed views about the Government's position on providers charging parents for elements of their free provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/4">In responding, I have been clear that the Government provide sufficient funding to local authorities for the delivery of a universal free early learning entitlement that benefits all children regardless of their parents' income or ability to pay. Local authorities have discretion over the use they make of funding from the Dedicated Schools Grant including the rates at which they fund early education in all types of setting. They are encouraged to fund early years provision equitably across settings in accordance with local circumstances. It has always been unacceptable for providers to charge so called &quot;top up fees&quot; for the free entitlement, in addition to the money they receive from local authorities for delivering the free entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/5">We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code of practice, to which 585 responses were received, the majority from private providers. Most respondents were content with the extension of the free entitlement to 38 weeks in all sectors. None of those who responded questioned the requirement to ensure that the entitlement is entirely free at the point of delivery.</p>

However, officials within my Department have actively engaged with the ODI in a number of areas relating to furthering equality for disabled people including preparation of the Department's recently published Disability Equality Scheme and on the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit (PMSU) programme 'Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People'. In addition, the head of the ODI has addressed a meeting of the DfES board and directors, chaired by the permanent secretary. Furthermore, two of my senior officials are members of the ODI board of management which is jointly responsible for co-ordinating the strategy and steering the work of the ODI, in line with the 20-year vision for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.2/1">It has been an underlying principle of the Industrial Injuries Scheme since its introduction in 1948 that benefit under the scheme should be payable only to people injured or disabled as a result of their work and not the population at large. The purpose of Pneumoconiosis Etc. (Workers Compensation) Act 1979 is to provide compensation for sufferers of certain dust related diseases (or their dependants on their behalf) who are unable to claim damages from employers. No payments have been made to the relatives under either scheme where they have exposure to asbestos from washing overalls and the Department operates no other schemes under which compensation would be payable.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.2/2">We have asked officials to carry out a review of the current Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme. The present scheme may no longer meet the needs of our modern society. We will look at all aspects of the scheme, but have not yet looked in any detail at any particular component of the scheme. We will however be looking at all options for the future and we intend publishing a consultation document in early 2007. The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform has met the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (MAC) and discussed the issue of the review of the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme. MAC has also recently met with the miners group of MPs where issues around asbestos related diseases were discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced measures to speed up the handling of claims for people suffering from mesothelioma and committed to having a full dialogue with interested parties. As part of that dialogue, we recently undertook a consultation exercise that ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>. The Department is now looking carefully at all suggestions in developing options for action.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.0/1">In the 12 months up to November 2006 a total of &pound;4,743,502.99 has been recovered in respect of benefits paid in mesothelioma cases in Great Britain and &pound;18,756.46 in Northern Ireland. Information is not available at local authority or constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/2">The rationale behind compensation recovery is twofold. Firstly it ensures that the taxpayer (via the benefit system) does not subsidise the costs arising from a compensator's actions. Secondly it ensures that an injured person is not compensated twice for the same need, once via the benefit system and again via the compensation payment. This is achieved by an offset mechanism within the scheme, which allows the compensator to reduce the compensation by some or all of the benefit repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/3">Legislation to exempt payments made to former employees of Turner and Newall (and associated companies) suffering from asbestos related diseases from the scheme is currently being brought forward. The exemption is being made due to the unique nature of these cases. Payments are being made from two Trust Funds set up for the sole purpose of meeting asbestos liabilities. Due to the insolvent position of the parent American company however the Trust will not meet the claims in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/4">Operating the compensation recovery scheme in these cases would further reduce payments to those suffering from asbestos related diseases. The exemption does not breach either of the fundamental principles of the scheme as the finite amount to be paid out has already been established and the sufferers will only receive a small portion of their gross compensation awards.</p>

	<p pid="a.572W.5/1">LiMA is programmed on the basis of the current personal capability assessment (PCA) and descriptors. Before the revised PCA is implemented, the LiMA system will be completely reprogrammed to take into account the changes to both the physical and mental function assessments. This reprogramming cannot start until the regulations governing the revised PCA have been laid.</p>
	<p pid="a.572W.5/2">Reports based on the revised PCA, which are being used for evaluation purposes, are completed manually by Atos Origin healthcare professionals. But in justifying their choice of revised descriptors, the healthcare professionals are drawing on their expertise as disability analysts and on their familiarity with the up to date consensus of medical opinion that underpins the LiMA system.</p>

	<p pid="a.573W.2/1">We work with employer and partner organisations to help people who have been made redundant access a range of services aimed at helping them find alternative employment. The help provided will vary depending upon particular needs, not the age group of individuals, or the period of unemployment following redundancy. Typically, this involves the provision of information, advice and guidance about jobs and how best to secure alternative employment. In the case of large-scale redundancies that have a significant impact on the local labour market, additional help, for example, skills transfer analysis and job focussed training may be provided through the Rapid Response Service. This help is not age related but it is time bound to 12 weeks before and 12 weeks following someone being made redundant.</p>
