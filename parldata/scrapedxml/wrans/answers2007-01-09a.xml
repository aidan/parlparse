(109632)</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/5" class="indent">(a) Infant mortality rates in England for years since 1978 are routinely published in Table 2.1 of Health Statistics Quarterly which can be accessed using the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/HSQ32.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/HSQ32.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/7" class="indent">(b) Infant mortality rates in the routine and manual group are not available prior to 1997. This is because until 2000 infant mortality rates were published by Social Class based on father's occupation. The nearest equivalent Social Class groups prior to 1997 are not comparable see background note 5. In 2001 Social Class was replaced by the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), and since then infant mortality figures have been published by NS-SEC. It is not possible to use NS-SEC for data prior to 2001 because there is not a one-to-one equivalence with the Social Class classification; an approximation is used, referred to as NS-SEC90 because it is based on the 1990 occupational classification. NS-SEC90 is used specifically to aid interpretation of trends over time in infant mortality and was calculated back to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.5/8" class="indent">The table below shows infant mortality rates in England and Wales from 1997-1999 to 2003-2005, for the routine and manual group and for all births inside marriage/joint registrations. We provide data for England and Wales as progress on the infant mortality target is assessed using these data as figures for the routine and manual group for England alone are not readily available.</p>

	<p pid="a.471W.5/1">The Department's draft regulatory impact assessment, as amended following consultation in July this year, makes clear that there may be some up front costs for the transition from decriminalised (DPE) to civil parking enforcement (CPE). These costs include training and IT costs. Under CPE, as with DPE, local authorities will be able to cover the costs of their enforcement activity through income from parking charges and any parking penalty charges. Any deficits in the financial year can be covered from the general fund and repaid in subsequent years.</p>

However, we would need to consider carefully whether to apply for such a derogation. Any changes to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy control legislation must be carried out on the basis of a thorough risk assessment, based on sound science. It is unlikely that any change could be made before 2008 at the earliest. Meanwhile, we are required to enforce the legislation that is currently in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.478W.3/1">Departments are committed to meet the sustainable operations targets on energy efficiency and carbon emissions that were announced in 2006. The targets are &quot;outcome focussed&quot;&quot;, and in order to meet them Departments are encouraged to put in place the most suitable means to attain them, which would include making sure computers are switched off at night. It is also mandatory for Departments to work with the Carbon Trust to identify energy savings and, when purchasing computer equipment, to do so in line with &quot;Quick Wins&quot; product standards, which specify only energy-efficient computers and monitors.</p>

In the interim, the Commission has committed to bring forward proposals for implementing measures following the priorities in the EU Climate Change Programme. 14 product studies are currently under way, with a further six due to start before June 2007. These studies will provide the basis for decisions as to whether the products should be subject to mandatory implementing measures under the EUP directive.

	<p pid="a.480W.3/1">DEFRA announced a &pound;750,000 investment in research on ruminant nutrition regimes to reduce methane and nitrogen emissions in December 2006. This research project will build on our knowledge base and take an integrated approach to the development of ruminant nutrition regimes to deliver reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, per animal and per unit of meat and milk output. Approaches for consideration include the modification of forage based diets, alterations to concentrate feed formulation and ingredients, and feed supplements. All options and solutions will belooked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.3/2">This research builds on a wealth of past work, where MAFF and DEFRA have invested in research to improve the productivity of dairy cattle. The resulting increases in individual cow milk yields can reduce methane emissions per unit of milk produced. The DEFRA research has included for example developing grass varieties that are high in sugar and lead indirectly to a reduction in methane emissions. Complementary private sector research, including research sponsored by DEFRA through our Sustainable Livestock LINK Programme, has raised the efficiency of dairy production.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.3/3">The Government are also developing a strategy on anaerobic digestion (AD), a system that can be used to capture and utilise methane emissions from livestock wastes, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AD is particularly applicable and effective on dairy units, and provides a potential source of renewable energy and heat.</p>

We do not hold data centrally on the proportion of HEFCE funding retained by individual validating institutions but the proportion is likely to vary to reflect, among other things, the variety in the division of responsibilities between higher education institutions and further education colleges, and the different levels of service that the former may offer the latter.</p>

	<p pid="a.481W.2/2">The Stern Review says that around 18 per cent. of global greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, and highlights the importance of reducing deforestation as part of the global effort to combat climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/3">In South East Asia, particularly Indonesia, there has been an observed increase in use of fire in land management (via slash-and-burn agriculture) and for large-scale conversion of primary and secondary forests into permanent agriculture or tree plantations.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/4">There is a pressing need to find effective ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from deforestation, not only to tackle climate change but also because of the co-benefits to communities dependent on forests and for biodiversity. The UK Government's policy is that emissions reductions from reduced deforestation should be part of developing countries' participation in climate change agreements and our strategy to achieve this is to participate actively in the climate negotiations and associated technical discussions that can bring it about.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/5">The UK has also supported action to improve forest governance through the work of the Department for International Development (DfID). For example, DFID's Multistakeholder Forestry Programme in Indonesia is supporting civil society-government partnerships, to change the way in which forestry policies are made and address tenure rights for forest-dependent people. This means giving a stronger voice to local citizens and a higher priority to environmental sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.481W.2/6">In 2002 the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia that commits both governments to work together to tackle illegal logging and the associated trade in timber between the two countries. In January 2006, new funding of &pound;24 million over five years to tackle illegal logging and underlying governance problems was announced. This will focus on tropical countries in Africa and Asia.</p>

	<p pid="a.482W.2/1">The Met Office has records of tornadoes reported by its network of manned observing stations. The only such recorded occurrence of a tornado was at Chivenor, Devon at 09:00 on<phrase class="date" code="1960-08-04">4 August 1960</phrase>. This, of course, does not preclude other events that were not detected by the Met Office's stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/2">The tornado over north west London was generated within a fast moving squall line moving east on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase>. Data were collected from numerous observational systems as this weather event passed over the UK. However, due to the small scale of the phenomena reported, no single operational synoptic observational system was close enough to measure the tornado directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/3">Tornadoes are too small to be directly considered as part of current climate models. Any effect of climate change must be inferred from larger scale phenomena. To date, there is no clear indication of what effect climate change might have on either the frequency or intensity of tornadoes in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/4">Research, funded by Ministry of Defence through the Public Weather Service (PWS), has been conducted at the Met Office in the past to examine the predictability of tornadoes and associated severe thunder storms. There are no current plans to fund further PWS research at the Met Office on the occurrence and predictability of tornadoes.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/5">Extensive research is also carried out at the Met Office, funded as part of the PWS, into the occurrence and predictability of extreme weather events. The primary output of PWS-funded research is to improve prediction of high impact weather in the UK. However, this research does not address any future changes in the frequency or intensity of such events.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/6">The main avenue of DEFRA funding for research on future extreme events in the UK is through the Met Office Hadley Centre and UK Climate Impacts Programme. DEFRA has also funded, or is funding, work at the Hadley Centre through the Climate Prediction Programme into future global extremes, including extra-tropical storms, tropical storms, drought, extreme precipitation and heat waves. However, DEFRA has not funded any specific research on the effects and frequency of tornadoes.</p>
	<p pid="a.482W.2/7">DEFRA does not hold information on either the number of people injured or the costs incurred as a result of tornadoes.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.2/6">The IPCC has completed three assessment reports to date, in 1990, 1996 and 2001. The first and second reports provided a firm foundation on which to build climate policy and were influential in developing an international response to climate change, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The third report presented important advances in the scientific understanding of climate change and its projected effects and showed clearly the effect of human activities on the climate system.</p>

	<p pid="a.484W.8/1">Ocean acidity has been relatively stable for over 20 million years. However, the seas are becoming more acidic as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed at the sea surface. Models suggest that surface pH has decreased by 0.1 pH unit since pre-industrial times.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.8/2">The full impacts of acidification remain largely unknown and, at present, we have little hard evidence of changes that have occurred, or are occurring, in UK waters. However, it is predicted that organisms such as corals, some plankton, shellfish and sea urchins may become less able to produce calcareous parts, such as shells, by the middle of this century if the current trend continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.8/3">We still do not have enough information to assess the consequences of ocean acidification for the UK population and economy, but DEFRA and the Department for Trade and Industry are aware of the possible effects and are funding research on the impact of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, and consequent ocean acidification, on the marine environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.484W.8/4">We also intend to develop a pilot marine monitoring programme for measuring acidity in the UK shelf sea as well as further ecosystem-based measurements in conjunction with the Natural Environment Research Council under their Oceans 2025 initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.487W.9/1">During the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, Sir Nicholas Stern had regular meetings with the Secretary of State to keep him updated on the review's likely findings. However, the Stern Review was an independent report to Government, so the authors were not responsible for its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.9/2">The key policy conclusions set out by the Stern Review's final report were in line with the UK's existing climate change policy measures and the work being taken forward following our Energy Review, in the DfID White Paper, and the forthcoming Energy White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.9/3">Our response to the Stern report&mdash;some of which was announced at the report's launch and some in the pre-Budget report&mdash;has two main focuses. First, we want to integrate the Stern report's recommendations about international climate change into the UK's own international climate change policy. For example, the report set out the key role of carbon pricing to ensure that the costs of climate change are factored into all economic decisions. The Chancellor, the Environment Secretary and the Trade and Industry Secretary subsequently published the Government's vision to ensure that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme works to become the centre of a global carbon market.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.9/4">Second, we are committed to taking action at home that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions without reducing economic growth. For example, the Stern report suggests a credible long-term framework is crucial to ensure effective low-carbon investment decisions and thus enhance competitiveness. In this respect, we announced a new Climate Change Bill, which will put into statute the Government's long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050 and set out a framework for achieving this. This will also strengthen our ability to be global leaders in a future international framework for climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.487W.9/5">We will continue to consider the conclusions of the Stern Review carefully to see if there is more we should do to ensure a sufficient global response to climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.489W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October 2006</phrase> I publicly congratulated all waste authorities in England for complying with their obligations during 2005-06. England's total allocation of allowances for that period was set at 15.2 million tonnes, and the calculated amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) sent to landfill was 12.4 million tonnes. That surplus is available to local authorities in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/3">In 2009-10, the amount of BMW which can go to landfill will fall to 11.2 million tonnes. Waste disposal authorities will have to reduce the amount of BMW going to landfill by about 1.2 million tonnes compared to 2005-06. England is making good progress to meet this target, assuming that current trends continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/4">The flexibilities provided by the landfill allowances trading scheme (LATS) will enable waste disposal authorities to meet their obligations under the scheme in the most cost effective way. It is up to each authority to plan how to comply with its duties in any scheme year. It is not possible to predict how any individual authority will choose to comply with the requirements of the scheme in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.2/1">The temporary EU ban on the import of wild birds, imposed in October 2005 in light of the threat from avian influenza, is still in place with the latest extension until <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>. During the passage of the NERC Bill there were calls for the UK to permanently ban imports of wild birds. At that time the European Commission had been asked to consider whether there were grounds for extending the ban on a more permanent basis and we felt it would be premature for the UK to introduce any stricter measures pending the development of a wider EU position. We expect a decision from the Commission on this issue soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.5/1">Cheshire Rural Recovery (now renamed Cheshire Rural Enterprise) was formed in 2003 as a five year, &pound;10 million scheme to assist in delivering improvements to Cheshire's rural economy. The scheme manages a number of projects such as the Rural Small Building Scheme, which aims to refurbish under-used rural buildings, and Saddle Up which supports the equestrian sector. The exact criteria for the different areas of support can vary depending on the grant The Guidelines for applicants are available on the Cheshire Rural Enterprise website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.490W.5/3">The scheme has now committed virtually all of its resources. To date, two projects have been supported in Winsford, mainly though their impact on the wider rural area:</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/4" class="indent">(i) As part of the Rural Business Development programme managed through Business Link, TCR Irrigation were supported to purchase specialist equipment. A &pound;15,300 grant was offered of a &pound;51,000 total project cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/5" class="indent">(ii) Support has been provided to develop a new radio station to be based in Winsford but covering a large area of rural Cheshire. A &pound;18,980 grant was offered of a &pound;71,470 total project cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/6">As a rule, the urban areas of Winsford are not eligible for rural recovery grant support as the town has not been classed as a Market Town. The surrounding rural hinterland of the town would be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.490W.5/7">The administration costs for Cheshire Rural Enterprise are not managed at a borough council level but are administered for the scheme as a whole. The administration costs for the whole scheme are set at6.5 per cent. of the total approved.</p>

	<p pid="a.493W.2/1">In addition to meeting its costs for the upgrade of the transmission network for digital switchover, the BBC will meet Digital UK's communication costs and a share of Digital UK's operational costs. The cost to the BBC to support Digital UK amounts to &pound;228 million for the period of digital switchover. In addition, the BBC will also fund the digital switchover help scheme for people 75 or over or who have a significant disability.

There is no direct relationship between the value of notes produced by the Bank in any year and the number of notes put into circulation. The Bank's policy is to meet retail banks' demand for new notes. This demand determines the value of notes issued (ie new notes put into circulation by the retail banks) each year. In addition to producing notes to meet demand, the Bank may also vary production to alter the level of its contingency stocks.</p>

	<p pid="a.497W.0/1">The new tax regime for registered pension schemes included additional flexibilities to make it easier for pension providers to offer lump sum death benefits as part of an individual's overall personal pension arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.497W.0/2">By saving in any tax-privileged pension vehicle, individuals are committing to using the resulting fund for the purpose of providing an income in retirement.

	<p pid="a.498W.2/2">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) assumed responsibility for the regulation of general insurance on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-14">14 January 2005</phrase>. The introduction of the FSA's regime served to implement the EU's Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) 2002/92/EC in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.498W.2/3">The IMD requires the UK to regulate various insurance mediation activities in connection with contracts of insurance, including long-term insurance business, commercial insurance and reinsurance. The activities required to be regulated include sellingand administering such insurance contracts by intermediaries. The IMD does not apply where a number of specified conditions are met, however the selling of insurance along with powered mobility products is not capable of meeting all of these conditions. In general, those undertaking insurance mediation must either be authorised to do so by the FSA, be an appointed representative of an authorised firm or be a member of a designated professional body that allows the firm to be exempt from authorisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.502W.0/1">We are concerned by all reportsof inter-religious conflict in Nigeria. Unfortunately, clashes between religious groups are not uncommon. The primary underlying cause of the conflict in northern Nigeria is rivalry between ethnic groups over the control of resources and power.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/2">Our High Commission in Abuja is aware of a local dispute in Dutse in Jigawa state, which occurred on19 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-20">20 September 2006</phrase>, during which a small number of people were injured and churches were burnt down. The police quickly took control and imposed a curfew. There have been no further outbreaks of violence in the area and this appears to be an isolated situation, which boiled over. Our High Commission in Abuja regularly raises incidents of religious conflict with the Nigerian authorities but no representations have been made about this specific incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/3">My noble Friend Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, recently met with representatives of Christian and Muslim communities at an interfaith seminar in Kaduna to see the work they are undertaking to build bridges to better interfaith understanding. We continue to urge restraint and reconciliation on all sides and stress that intervention must be carried out with full respect for human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.502W.0/4">Supporting measures to address religious conflict is also a key part of our conflict prevention strategy for Nigeria. We are funding projects to build trust between Nigeria's various religious communities. This includes support to the excellent work of Coventry Cathedral on building trust and understanding at grass-roots level between different religious and ethnic communities, which has contributed to a drop in the level of violence and an increased level of dialogue between Christians and Muslims. We are also funding the work of the Bridge Builders Foundation, a mixed Christian and Muslim organisation operating in northern Nigeria, to look into the causes of recent conflict between Christians and Muslims. They are in the process of setting up early warning mechanisms in all the northern States to prevent future conflict.</p>

The UK was able to inform discussions about what actions the international community would be able to take. Resolution 1718 made clear that the DPRK should: cease immediately all further nuclear testing; observe a moratorium on nuclear and missile testing; and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, thus enabling IAEA inspectors back in to the DPRK and reports to be made on its facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.504W.6/136" class="italic"> (x) Enduring financial distress</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/137">The proportion of the working age population enduring financial distress (defined as either having problems meeting housing costs or has been more than two months in arrears with their mortgage or rent in the past year) has fallen from 15.2 per cent. in 1991 to 5.6 per cent. in 2003, translating into a reduction of about 3.2 million individuals. In 1991 about 5.2 million working age adults were enduring financial distress, compared to 2 million in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.504W.6/138">There has also been a fall in the proportion of pensioners enduring financial distress over the period, from 6.9 per cent. in 1991 to 1.5 per cent. in 2003. (Although note that this may not be a very good measure of financial distress among pensioners, because a substantial proportion of pensioners do not have housing costs). This reduction translates into a fall in the numbers of pensioners suffering financial distress of about 0.5 million (from 0.7 million in 1991 to 0.2 million in 2003).</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.3/1">The Africa Conflict and Humanitarian Unit (ACHU) was established in 2003 to co-ordinate DFID's humanitarian and conflict prevention work in Africa. It works closely with the central Conflict, Humanitarian and Security Department (CHASE) on policy and the overall coherence of DFID's global response. ACHU also provides the secretariat for the joint DFID/FCO/MOD Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP).</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/2">ACHU has a staff of 10, made up of the Head ofthe Unit, three humanitarian advisers, two conflict advisers, two programme managers, a programme officer, and an information and communications officer. Two regional conflict advisers, based in Africa, also report to the Head of ACHU. These work jointly to DFID, FCO and MOD under the auspices of the ACPP.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/3">ACHU does not have its own programme budget, nor is it an operational unit. It is an advisory unit supporting DFID's country and regional offices in Africa, and advising the Africa Director on the use of the divisional reserve to meet humanitarian needs. ACHU is also able to call on the central operational team based in CHASE for back-up support in the event of a major catastrophe or to provide supplementary staff support when work loads are high. DFID provides humanitarian assistance in response to needs across Africa as a whole, not just to those countries where we have a country programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/4">DFID does not work with a fixed budget for humanitarian aid in Africa, but responds according to need and in proportion to the UK's role as a leading humanitarian donor within the international community. Preliminary estimates of likely levels of need are made at the start of each financial year, and adjusted on the basis of ongoing assessments as the year unfolds. For this reason, it is not possible to predict what levels of humanitarian spending are likely over the next three years. We do, though, expect to maintain our position as a leading humanitarian donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/5">Over the past three financial years DFID has spent a total of &pound;565.6 million on bilateral humanitarian aid in Africa: &pound;125.4 million in 2003-04, &pound;171.0 million in 2004-05, and &pound;269.4 million in 2005-06. In the three years since 2003-04, Africa's share of DFID's total bilateral humanitarian assistance has risen from40.4 per cent. to 65.6 per cent. Humanitarian needs in Africa in 2005-06 were exceptional, and we do not expect spending to be so high in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/6">In its role as secretariat for the ACPP, ACHU oversees a joint DFID/FCO/MOD budget for conflict prevention work in Africa. Over the past three financial years this has stood at &pound;50.0 million for 2003-04,&pound;60.0 million for 2004-05, and &pound;60.0 million for 2005-06. In the current year the ACPP budget is&pound;63.0 million, rising to &pound;64.5 million in the next financial year. The ACPP budget is currently under review in the context of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. The forward budget for conflict prevention work in Africa from 2007-08 onwards is yet to be announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/7">Since its inception, ACHU has supported DFID and wider HMG conflict and humanitarian work throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including in the Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.516W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> DFID has committed a total of &pound;123 million to support the second phase of the Government of India's National AIDS Control Programme (NACP 2) over the period 2000 to 2007. Of this, &pound;90 million will have been spent by March 2007. The remaining funds will be rolled into DFID's support to the third phase of the programme which will begin in April 2007 and to which DFID is planning to commit additional resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/3">Most of the current funding goes through the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to eight focus states: Orissa, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Part of DFID's funding is also provided through a challenge fund directly to non-government organisations, in order to fill gaps in the national programme. DFID's support is primarily for implementing prevention interventions, including focused education and behaviour change programmes for people at high risk of HIV, such as truckers, female sex workers, men having sex with men and injecting drug users. However, activities to support the expansion of care and support to people with HIV, including the training of health workers and development of networks of positive people, are also funded. DFID encourages comprehensive programmes including prevention, treatment, and care. It is not possible to attribute the proportion of funds going to each specific component.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/4"><i> (b)</i> DFID provides significant funding to UNAIDS in India (&pound;5.9 million from 2001 to March 2007) to strengthen the UN response to HIV and AIDS. During NACP 2 DFID has also committed &pound;9.1 million to other UN agencies including UNICEF for work on HIV education among adolescents, UNDP for work on prevention of trafficking and HIV in women and girls and UNODC for expanding prevention of HIV among drug users.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.2/5">In addition, the UK is a major contributor to the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, which has approved programmes in India of over US $492 million over a five-year period. GFATM funds are an integral part of the overall resource framework for the next phase of the National AIDS Control Programme, and will enable the Government of India to scale up access to antiretroviral treatment from the current low base&mdash;to reach the goal of 340,000 people on treatment, including 40,000 children.</p>

All identified errors have been corrected in the December pay run.

Organisations who do not want FBE to publicise their project do so for a number of reasons, for example, they are in the midst of negotiations to purchase a property and would regard details of the investment as commercially sensitive, or where it is engaged in sensitive work such as running a women's refuge where they do not want to publicise their work or their location.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.2/2">Peterborough is a Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) &quot;intensive&quot; area&mdash;which means that all aspects of the programme are in place there. These include drug testing for heroin and crack/cocaine following arrest for &quot;trigger offences&quot;, or any offence where a police officer of inspector rank or above suspects the misuse of such drugs caused or contributed to the offence. For those who test positive there is a requirement to attend an initial assessment with a drugs worker and, where applicable, restrictions on bail are used to encourage offenders to address their drug misuse problems. Other features of the programme are the case management of offenders and the brokering of access to other service such as housing or training support.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.2/3">The DIP management information system indicates that, in September 2006 the cumulative caseload for Peterborough Drug Action Team area stood at 99 clients. In this context, being on the caseload means that individuals are being case managed by drug workers, having been assessed as requiring interventions which are agreed in a specific care plan. The drugs worker will ensure that there is at all times co-ordination of the care plan, which in addition to drug treatment this may include support with issues relating to accommodation, finances and rebuilding family relationships. The cumulative caseload will change as new clients are engaged and existing ones no longer require management or are temporarily suspended while their management is supervised elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.541W.3/1">The NDNAD does not record whether people on it are in prison. However, there are good reasons for believing that the great majority of the prison population has a profile on the NDNAD. Forces have had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA Database in 1995. For the first few years this power was exercised in relation to more serious offenders, but from 2000 onwards additional funding was made available under the DNA Expansion Programme to make it standard practice to take samples from all offenders. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>

The public sector has also raised its game in response. We expect to see similar effects in probation.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.8/1">Implementation of the strategy is well under way. At its heart is the need to tackle the issue at a local level and reduce the number of women tied to the streets by addressing the reasons for their involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.8/2">So far as the latter is concerned, the Government have invested &pound;600 million in drug treatment provisions, with over 140,000 people successfully completing drug treatment programmes. We also plan to introduce a new penalty requiring women to engage with services to deal with the issues behind their involvement in prostitution, including drug addiction and homelessness. In addition to this, the Sexual Violence Action Plan, due to be published in the new year, has a number of specific measures aimed at addressing sexual violence against people involved in prostitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.8/3">The strategy provides a framework for local areas to develop their own co-ordinated response to the problems associated with prostitution in their areas.

	<p pid="a.559W.0/1">Mentoring for children in care features in a number of local authority programmes and voluntary sector initiatives and there is anecdotal evidence of its potential benefits. In recognition of this the Department is providing up to &pound;1.5 million for the development and evaluation of an adult mentoring programme for 600 looked after children aged between 10 and 15 to be delivered through the voluntary and community sector. In addition, peer mentoring is a feature of a three-year DfES funded pilot project led by the School Home Support Service UK which is designed to support children in care who are making the transition from primary to secondary school.</p>

	<p pid="a.559W.3/1">During the 2005/06 academic year the total Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) expenditure was &pound;443.5 million, of which &pound;396.8 million was specifically spent on student payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.559W.3/2">The estimated total cost of EMA if it was extended to all young people in full-time further education, based on the 2005/06 full-time education participation figures which include A Level students, is &pound;1,057 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.2/2">The length of time taken to effect an inter-country adoption is dependent on the complexity of the individual case. A range of bodies is involved in the process, including foreign authorities, adoption agencies, and embassies. The process of identifying a prospective 'match', between would-be adopters and a foreign child, is usually the lengthiest element of the process, which takes a period of several months but can take more than a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.5/2">The Learning and Skills Council has carried out a radical restructuring exercise which will ensure that it becomes even more effective at identifying and responding to learning and skill needs. The new structure will include around 150 new local partnership teams, which will work with key local stakeholders to secure a wide choice of high quality provision which reflects what individuals, employers and wider communities want and help to deliver our long term economic success. They will work alongside a number of specialist Economic Development teams, and will be supported by nine new regional centres that will provide core operational services and co-ordinate the LSC's work with regional partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.5/3">The new structure is expected to require 1,100 fewer posts across the whole organisation. The LSC continues to do all it can to avoid making compulsory redundancies, and estimates that nationally these changes will save up to &pound;40 million per year, which can be directed to front line services.</p>

The OCR will be compulsory for providers of child care to children aged five to seven and voluntary for other child care. Regular inspections will continue after 2008 for providers, including nurseries, registered on the EYR. Inspection of child care registered on the OCR will be carried out proportionately on the basis of risks to children.

	<p pid="a.562W.2/2">The single substantive change to the delivery of the free early education entitlement, set out in the 2006 Code of Practice, was the extension of the minimum free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks. Following full public consultation, we made clear our recognition that not all providers would be able to extend their provision to 38 weeks and that, at the relevant local authority's discretion, they could be funded for the provision they actually delivered. Furthermore, all local authorities received additional funding to support the extension to the free entitlement. We therefore concluded that there should not be a substantive regulatory impact and that a regulatory impact assessment was not required.</p>

	<p pid="a.562W.5/1">Child care provision, free at the point of delivery has been a universal entitlement for all four-year-olds since 1998 and for all three-year-olds since 2004. It is widely supported by parents, providers, local authorities and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/2">My colleagues and I regularly meet representatives of a range of stakeholders with an interest in the free entitlement and other child care issues. These meetings have been opportunities to celebrate the progress that we are making together towards the delivery of our Ten Year Childcare Strategy commitments and to discuss issues of implementation including those relating to the 2006 code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/3">Since the code of practice came into force in April 2006, Ministers and officials have received a range of correspondence from a variety of stakeholders. Correspondents routinely acknowledge the benefits of the free entitlement for children, and demonstrate commitment to its delivery. A number of correspondents have raised issues relating to the arrangements for increasing the free entitlement from 33 to 38 weeks and to 15 hours per week by 2010, and a number have expressed views about the Government's position on providers charging parents for elements of their free provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/4">In responding, I have been clear that the Government provide sufficient funding to local authorities for the delivery of a universal free early learning entitlement that benefits all children regardless of their parents' income or ability to pay. Local authorities have discretion over the use they make of funding from the Dedicated Schools Grant including the rates at which they fund early education in all types of setting. They are encouraged to fund early years provision equitably across settings in accordance with local circumstances. It has always been unacceptable for providers to charge so called &quot;top up fees&quot; for the free entitlement, in addition to the money they receive from local authorities for delivering the free entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.562W.5/5">We conducted a full public consultation on the 2006 code of practice, to which 585 responses were received, the majority from private providers. Most respondents were content with the extension of the free entitlement to 38 weeks in all sectors. None of those who responded questioned the requirement to ensure that the entitlement is entirely free at the point of delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.2/2">I am responding on behalf of Lord Adonis, who leads on this area. There have been no meetings at ministerial level. However, officials within my Department have actively engaged with the ODI in a number of areas relating to furthering equality for disabled people including preparation of the Department's recently published Disability Equality Scheme and on the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit (PMSU) programme 'Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People'. In addition, the head of the ODI has addressed a meeting of the DfES board and directors, chaired by the permanent secretary. Furthermore, two of my senior officials are members of the ODI board of management which is jointly responsible for co-ordinating the strategy and steering the work of the ODI, in line with the 20-year vision for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Leslie Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what assessment he has made on the performance of Jobcentre Plus in dealing with claimants. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus employs around 71,000 staff dealing with some 235 million contacts from customers per year. Every working day, we conduct 36,000 work-focused interviews, and process over 15,000 new benefit claims. Through our website, we enable customers to access details of around 300,000 job vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/5" class="indent">We are part way through a process to transform the way the business operates to provide improved labour market and benefit services more efficiently and with fewer staff. In our new offices, which are already in place across most of the country, customers experience a more welcoming and professional environment and our Contact Centres and e-channels provide greater flexibility in the ways customers can contact us. I am pleased to say that, this year, Contact Centre performance has consistently exceeded our internal target of answering 90 percent of calls. from customers. In addition, the vast majority of people contacting Jobcentre Plus to make a new claim for benefit can expect to be called back within 36 hours (currently 86 per cent.), helping to ensure that people receive the financial and work-focused support that they need at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/6" class="indent">Following pilots of a new Standard Operating Model in North Lincolnshire and Central London, Jobcentre Plus has begun to roll-out changes to its delivery model to improve further our customer service. Changes to be introduced over the coming months include: an 0800 number for new claims customers, to replace the 0845 service; and a single call to the contact centre to claim benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus must make more progress in the time taken to process new benefit claims and we have a new target for 2006-07 called the Actual Average Clearance Time target. A dedicated Customer Experience Improvement Team has been put in place to drive performance improvements in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.5/8" class="indent">Performance on Income Support (IS) and Incapacity Benefit (IB) clearance times has shown some improvement this operational year and we are currently on track to hit the IB element of this target. We aim to build on the improvements seen so far during the remainder of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.570W.2/1">It has been an underlying principle of the Industrial Injuries Scheme since its introduction in 1948 that benefit under the scheme should be payable only to people injured or disabled as a result of their work and not the population at large. The purpose of Pneumoconiosis Etc. (Workers Compensation) Act 1979 is to provide compensation for sufferers of certain dust related diseases (or their dependants on their behalf) who are unable to claim damages from employers. No payments have been made to the relatives under either scheme where they have exposure to asbestos from washing overalls and the Department operates no other schemes under which compensation would be payable.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.2/2">We have asked officials to carry out a review of the current Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Scheme. The present scheme may no longer meet the needs of our modern society. We will look at all aspects of the scheme, but have not yet looked in any detail at any particular component of the scheme. We will however be looking at all options for the future and we intend publishing a consultation document in early 2007. The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform has met the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (MAC) and discussed the issue of the review of the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme. MAC has also recently met with the miners group of MPs where issues around asbestos related diseases were discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.570W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced measures to speed up the handling of claims for people suffering from mesothelioma and committed to having a full dialogue with interested parties.

	<p pid="a.571W.0/1">In the 12 months up to November 2006 a total of &pound;4,743,502.99 has been recovered in respect of benefits paid in mesothelioma cases in Great Britain and &pound;18,756.46 in Northern Ireland. Information is not available at local authority or constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/2">The rationale behind compensation recovery is twofold. Firstly it ensures that the taxpayer (via the benefit system) does not subsidise the costs arising from a compensator's actions. Secondly it ensures that an injured person is not compensated twice for the same need, once via the benefit system and again via the compensation payment. This is achieved by an offset mechanism within the scheme, which allows the compensator to reduce the compensation by some or all of the benefit repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/3">Legislation to exempt payments made to former employees of Turner and Newall (and associated companies) suffering from asbestos related diseases from the scheme is currently being brought forward. The exemption is being made due to the unique nature of these cases. Payments are being made from two Trust Funds set up for the sole purpose of meeting asbestos liabilities. Due to the insolvent position of the parent American company however the Trust will not meet the claims in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.0/4">Operating the compensation recovery scheme in these cases would further reduce payments to those suffering from asbestos related diseases. The exemption does not breach either of the fundamental principles of the scheme as the finite amount to be paid out has already been established and the sufferers will only receive a small portion of their gross compensation awards.</p>

Although in some cases payments may be made for years before 2002, a separate breakdown of payments for the earlier years is not available Information from 2002-03 is in the following tables.</p>

Figures for clerical payments made in these years are not available broken down by country. However clerical payments are included in the figures from 2004-05.<br/> 2. Malta and Cyprus joined the European Union and therefore became part of the European Economic Area in May 2004. Winter fuel payments could be paid to eligible former UK residents living in these countries from winter 2004-05. The figures for winter 2004-05 include some payments made for earlier years where entitlement had been established but not paid prior to leaving the UK.<br/> 3. Figures for payments made are rounded to the nearest five and figures for costs are rounded to the nearest 1,000.</td> </tr>
