Subject to these specific requirements, the Authority will need to judge with whom and how it should consult.

In order to secure these improvements at the earliest opportunity, by incorporating the changes in the May 2003 timetable, the Authority had limited time for consultation.

	<p pid=".527W.2/1">I am satisfied that the Highways Agency's decision not to extend the existing 30 mph speed limit on the A49 to include the Condover turning is correct. On the basis of the criteria that we use to decide appropriate speed limits, an extension would be very difficult to justify. In addition, West Mercia Police have confirmed that they would not support an extension in this case.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.2/2">The Route Management Strategy for the A49 between Ross-on-Wye and Shrewsbury is looking at all existing speed limits along the route in the light of the criteria to ensure consistency. That work will include the Condover turning where there have been two personal injury accidents in the last 10 years. A report is due in the spring.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.2/3">The introduction of speed limits is very carefully controlled as, to impose an inappropriate limit that would not appear reasonable to most drivers in the prevailing conditions could bring the national system of speed limits into disrepute and lead to greater non compliance.</p>

	<p pid=".536W.2/1">We do not have robust data for the numbers of prisoners and young offenders diagnosed as suffering from dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/2">Many of the experts in this field hold differing views on whether or not the percentage of the prison population suffering from dyslexia is higher than that of the wider community. Some feel that what may appear to be indicators of dyslexia are in fact the result of a whole range of social factors that could include the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, physical injuries, interrupted schooling and lack of parental support. Conversely, others suspect that there is a high incidence of dyslexia among this specific group and that the frustrations arising from this learning difficulty have contributed to their offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/3">Research has also provided conflicting results. In 1998 research from Cambridge University's Institute of Criminology, based on a survey of 323 prisoners at nine establishments, found that only around 4 to 6 per cent. of prisoners were dyslexic.</p>
	<p pid=".536W.2/4">The most recent research (1999), from the Dyslexia Institute, is based on a survey of nearly 100 young offenders at HMYOI Feltham. This study, which measured cognitive ability as well as dyslexia, found that 17.5 per cent. screened positive against indicators for dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid=".537W.2/1">A survey carried out in 2001 indicated that around a quarter of establishments had staff trained to support learners with dyslexia. Under the Government's Skills for Life strategy, staff in all prisons and young offender institutions will have access to training so that they can identify indicators of dyslexia, know when to refer learners for specialist assessment, and provide appropriate educational programmes for them. This will be further enhanced in those young offender institutions caring for 15 to 17-year-olds by the appointment of special educational needs co-ordinators, and of learning support assistants on a ratio of one to every 10 learners.</p>
	<p pid=".537W.2/2">New diagnostic assessments for prisoners, to be administered after initial assessment by a specialist teacher, will offer guidance on when to refer learners for a full dyslexia assessment with an educational psychologist or other appropriately trained person.</p>
	<p pid=".537W.2/3">The majority of people with dyslexia do not require specialist teaching. They need high quality basic skills teaching which adopts a variety of inclusive strategies to support the needs of all learners. An inclusive learning handbook for all staff in prisons and YOls to be published this spring will increase the understanding of the needs of those with dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.2/2">New guidance was issued last year regarding the procedures schools should follow for the collection and recording of pupils' ethnic group. Schools should in the first instance seek information via parents, and any response (including a refusal to provide information) must be respected. However if there is no response at all to the school's inquiries it has the option of ascribing an ethnic group to the pupil based on its own best judgment. In this event various steps have to be taken in order to comply with data protection rules, and the fact that ascription has taken place must be shown alongside the ethnic group itself&mdash;both in the school's own records, and in any information passed on to the LEA or to the Department in the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC). This year's PLASC returns from schools will reflect the ethnic group information which they have collected under the new guidance, including details of whether that was provided by parents or pupils or ascribed by the school. However these returns will not be received and processed until about April.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.8/1">To meet the standard to become a Sector Skills Council, an organisation should be employer-led. This means it should be launched and led by employers but should also involve other important organisations in the sector, such as trade unions. We recognise that a component of many SSCs will be support from their trade association but the SSC, as an organisation licensed by Government and in receipt of public funds, must be wholly independent of it or any holding company. In the case of Skillsmart, we have made it clear that to become a fully licensed SSC it will need to be independent of the British Retail Consortium.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.8/2">On the question of funding, my Department will meet part of the costs of an SSC (up to &pound;1 million core contribution) to give capacity to allow SSCs to take a more strategic approach underpinned by proper research and avoid being compromised by commercial interests. But we have always expected our &pound;1 million would lever significant additional private investment into skills and productivity development in the sector.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.8/1">Local education authorities (the statutory sector) and a range of voluntary organisations provide the Youth Service. The priority age group for the service is 13 to 19-year-olds but the target age group may extend to 11 to 25-year-olds in some cases.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.8/2">Provision is usually in the form of youth clubs and centres, or through &quot;detached&quot; or outreach work aimed at young people at risk from alcohol or drug misuse, or of drifting into crime. There is an increasing emphasis on youth workers working with disadvantaged, disaffected, and socially excluded young people.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.8/3">In December 2002 the Government launched the document &quot;Transforming Youth Work Resourcing Excellent Youth Services&quot; which provides a cross Government view of the key elements of a high quality, well managed and properly resourced Youth Service. The document underpins the Transforming Youth Work programme and the Government's commitment to work with local authorities to ensure the delivery of a high quality Youth Service for young people which is at the heart of the Connexions Service. The document emphasises that local authorities should ensure the delivery of a service which targets the 13&ndash;19 age range but may also be working at the margins with 11&ndash;13 and 19 to 25-year-olds. The document confirms this existing age range criteria for the Youth Service.</p>
	<p pid=".541W.8/4">Under the Learning and Skills Act, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a specific responsibility to help both young people and adults with learning difficulties and disabilities. The broad remit of the council enables it to fund a wide range of learning provision when considering their particular needs. This includes activities offering opportunities for non-formal types of learning, and learning which does not lead to a qualification. For adults, particularly those with special needs, this provision will be more suitable than a youth work curriculum provided by the Youth Service.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.2/2">To make life better for children, parents and communities, on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase> we launched the new Sure Start Unit. This brings together at a national level responsibility for early education, child care and health and family support in one, cross-departmental unit. Drawing on best practice in early education, child care and Sure Start local programmes, the guiding principles of the new unit are:</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/3" class="indent">Working with parents and children;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/4" class="indent">Services for everyone (responding to varying needs);</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/5" class="indent">Flexible at the point of delivery;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/6" class="indent">Starting very early;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/7" class="indent">Respectful and transparent;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/8" class="indent">Community driven and professionally coordinated;</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/9" class="indent">Outcome driven (core purpose&mdash;better outcomes for children);</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/10">These national changes will be reflected in some reorganisation of the local support the unit provides to ensure that mainstream services for children and parents are delivered in accordance with the unit's guiding principles. We are currently considering how best to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/11">This national change does not, however, alter the existing roles and responsibilities of Local Authorities and Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships (EYDCPs). Local authorities will retain their significant responsibilities under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 for early years and child care. This includes setting up and maintaining EYDCPs to assist in preparing early years strategic plans and developing the local provision of child care.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.2/12">At a national level, responsibility for Sure Start, early years and child care have been brought together in one cross-departmental unit (the Sure Start Unit). This unit led by Baroness Ashton who is a joint DfES/DWP Minister will continue to provide support to the local delivery of services through a network of regionally-based teams and advisors, ensuring that people with the most appropriate skills and experience are available to assist delivery of this important area of the Government's agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".543W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December 2002</phrase>, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, set out his strategy to improve behaviour and attendance in all schools. In doing so, he underlined our commitment to the Public Service Agreement: by 2004, to reduce truancies by 10 per cent. compared to 2002, to sustain the new lower level, and improve overall attendance levels thereafter. To achieve this objective, we have introduced a range of initiatives, such as the co-ordination of national truancy sweeps, funding for electronic registration systems, the development of guidance for more effective prosecutions and a sustained publicity campaign aimed at parents and pupils. In addition, we are proposing a new package of support and sanctions, such as behaviour and attendance training and audits available to all secondary schools from September, fixed penalty notices for parents of persistent truants and the introduction of parenting contracts.</p>
	<p pid=".543W.2/2">Ministers and officials in this Department and the Home Office are in regular contact on truancy issues, for example through the Government's Street Crime Initiative and in developing measures for the proposed Anti-Social Behaviour Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.6/1">None. There is no evidence that this is a significant problem. Aviation fuel can only be legally jettisoned in an emergency, when Air Traffic Control would advise the pilot to do so, if at all possible, either over the sea or over 10,000 feet above ground level so that the fuel would vaporise. Emergencies are by definition rare occurrences. There is no incentive for jettisoning fuel illegally&mdash;it is an expensive commodity. If aviation fuel were to be jettisoned it would biodegrade readily and therefore would not be expected to have a long-term impact. As aviation fuel contains no more than the smallest traces of chlorine or bromine, it will make no contribution to ozone layer depletion.</p>

	<p pid=".547W.6/1">Since the publication of the UK's Climate Change Programme in November 2000, the following main actions have been taken to promote energy efficiency in the domestic, business and public sectors:</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/2">The Climate Change Levy, a levy on the business use of fuel, was introduced in April 2001. Receipts, forecast at &pound;1 billion a year, are recycled back to business&mdash;including &pound;50 million for business energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/3">Climate Change Agreements have been reached with 44 sectors of energy intensive industry. Participants in these agreements pay a reduced rate of Climate Change Levy (20 per cent. of the full levy) in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency targets over a 10-year period.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/4">The Carbon Trust was launched in April 2001, and receives two-thirds of its annual budget from recycled receipts from the Climate Change Levy, it encourages and promotes the development of low carbon technologies to support the transition to a low carbon economy. It offers an interest free loan scheme for small and medium-sized businesses and provides funding for the development of low carbon technologies through the Low Carbon Innovation Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/5">The Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme enables businesses to claim 100 per cent. first year capital allowances on investments in a range of approved energy saving technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/6">The UK Emissions Trading Scheme was launched in April 2002. Companies in Climate Change Agreements can trade within the scheme to help meet their targets. Participants entering directly into the scheme can trade to meet emission reduction targets delivering 1.1 MtC by 2006. Energy efficiency measures help participants to meet their targets.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/7">New requirements have been introduced for local authorities. Authorities have to know their buildings' energy consumption and carbon emissions. From 2002&ndash;03 they are required to benchmark their energy use in operational property and street lighting, and will set local improvement targets from 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/8">The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2002&ndash;05 (EEC) places a challenging but realistic obligation on electricity and gas suppliers to promote improvements in domestic energy efficiency. Suppliers will achieve individual EEC targets by encouraging and assisting consumers to take up energy efficiency measures. It is expected to save 0.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2005. It will also help those on lower incomes&mdash;who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on energy&mdash;by focussing at least 50 per cent. of energy savings on consumers in receipt of benefits or tax credits.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/9">Since its launch in June 2000, the new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme&mdash;which is now marketed as Warm Front&mdash;has helped over 400,000 households through the installation of a range of insulation and heating measures. Warm Front is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the private sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/10">The Community Energy Programme is a &pound;50 million grant programme operational from 2002&ndash;04 aiming to promote community heating in the UK, primarily through the use of CHP. It will install and refurbish community heating schemes, benefiting people on low incomes while contributing to the Climate Change Programme by reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 0.15 million tonnes of carbon a year.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/11">Part L of the Building Regulations covering energy efficiency provisions was revised in October 2001 and the changes came into effect in 2002. These require work on new buildings and the refurbishment of the existing stock to conform to higher energy efficiency standards including those relating to building insulation, air-tightness, lighting, space heating, hot water, boiler performance and replacement glazing. It is estimated that the package of measures introduced in October will reduce carbon emissions from the domestic sector by 0.8 million tonnes per year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/12">The Treasury introduced in the 2002 Budget, a VAT reduction on certain energy saving materials installed under grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.6/13">The Government have provided funding for the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to help individual households, local authorities and others improve domestic energy efficiency. Since 2000, EST has created the Practical Help advisory service, expanded its local authority support programme providing dedicated staff to 23 areas across the UK, introduced a new grant scheme for innovative projects and expanded its network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres providing households with advice and support. EST has developed the Energy Efficiency Recommended (EER) labelling scheme (with energy efficiency manufacturers, retailers and installers) to provide easy identification of energy efficient products. EST has also developed EEI&mdash;the network of accredited installers in the insulation and heating industries.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.2/1">The UK Climate Change Programme published in November 2000 sets out the range of policy measures&mdash;regulation, economic instruments, information programmes and public expenditure&mdash;that the Government and the devolved administrations are introducing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to meet the UK's climate change targets. The measures in the Programme will deliver wider environmental, social and economic benefits. Measures to stimulate more efficient use of energy by business, for example, will help improve competitiveness. The Programme is also designed to offer incentives to industry to develop new, low carbon technologies and to exploit the growing international market for more efficient processes and renewable technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.2/2">The Programme includes two legislative measures that affect industry directly, each of which was subject to individual regulatory impact assessments as part of the normal policy development process. The industries affected by the legislation will include some that are important to the delivery of the policy measures in the Programme, but the Government has not produced a separate assessment of the specific impacts on them.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.2/3">The first legislative measure is the EC Directive 96/61 on integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC), which applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of certain industrial activities and, inter alia, contributes to the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, as well asimproving the energy efficiency of most of the energy intensive sectors of industry. The impact of the Directive, and the legislation implementing its requirements in England and Wales, was considered in the regulatory impact assessment published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-26">26 April 2000</phrase>. It is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/ippc5/pdf/ippc5.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/ippc5/pdf/ippc5.pdf</a>. The Directive has some impact on combined heat and power (CHP) technology, which the Government is supporting because of its high efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".553W.2/4">The second legislative measure is the energy efficiency provisions contained in Part L of the Building Regulations for England and Wales, which were amended by the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001. The aim is to improve the energy performance of all types of building, including those used for industrial and commercial purposes, to reduce energy use and therefore emissions of carbon dioxide. The Building Regulations are the responsibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The amendments came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. A regulatory impact assessment for the Regulations was published by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister) when the Regulations were made. It is available on the ODPM website at <a href="http://www.safety.odpm.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/ria/ria-01/index.htm">http://www.safety.odpm.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/ria/ria-01/index.htm</a>. I understand that, in accordance with normal practice, the Office intends to investigate how the amended Regulations are being implemented around 2004, when there is a sufficient sample of works compliant with the new requirements.</p>

Within that overall recovery requirement, there are no individual targets for the recycling and retreading of tyres, and the Government have no present plans for introducing such targets. Figures for 2001 show that value was recovered from over 60 per cent. of the estimated 480,000 tonnes of tyres disposed of in the UK that year. Significant additional recovery capacity has since been brought forward and is anticipated to be taken up as the landfill directive requirements bear down.</p>

	<p pid=".560W.3/1">The Thames Barrier and associated defences provide a high standard of protection to London and the Thames Estuary against a combination of tidal/fluvial flood risks, the principal risk being from tidal surge events.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.3/2">A generous allowance for sea level rise was built into the design for the Thames Barrier and associated defences and thus we have today a standard of 0.05 per cent. risk of flooding from tidal surge in any one year. As sea level rises, this standard of protection will reduce as planned to the design standard of 0.1 per cent. risk of flooding from tidal surge by the year 2030. This will provide a level of protection equivalent to 2 metres above the maximum level of the 1953 flood event and is the highest standard of protection in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".560W.3/3">The Environment Agency, with Defra support, is engaged in a number of studies and investigations which are reviewing the current and future needs of London's tidal defences, including the overarching planning and research project &quot;Planning for Flood Risk management in the Thames Estuary&quot;. This is developing a flood risk management strategy for London and the Thames Estuary for the next 100 years, and includes climate change research, geomorphological and flood modelling, engineering studies and the development of management intervention and decision-testing models. This is the first year of a six year project which will provide a plan for the establishment of the next generation of tidal defences for London and the Thames Estuary post 2030.</p>

Some of the respondents, however, did not specifically stipulate that timber should be sourced from both legal and sustainably managed sources. Six (7 per cent.) were using other strategies such as procuring through regional buying consortiums that had sustainable procurement policies in place.

	<p pid=".566W.2/1">Ten different individuals and organisations have made representations to the British High Commission in Nairobi since January 1999 to ask for compensation for alleged victims of repression by the British authorities during the period of the Mau Mau rebellion. The latest approach was on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-19">19 October 2002</phrase> on behalf of the &quot;Mau Mau Original Trust&quot;. In addition, BHC officials received a delegation of Mau Mau veterans on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-23">23 October 2002</phrase>. Responsibility for the actions of the colonial Government of Kenya passed to the Government of Kenya at Independence in 1963.</p>

	<p pid=".568W.3/1">When he met President Kostunica and Foreign Minister Svilanovic in late 2002, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised our serious concerns about reports of arms sales from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) to Iraq and Liberia, in breach of UN sanctions. He urged them to ensure a thorough investigation, leading to prosecutions of those responsible. Since then Mr. Cekovic, Head of Jugoimport, and Mr. Djokic, Assistant Minister for Defence, have been sacked, the Jugoimport office in Baghdad closed and a commission established to investigate Jugoimport's activities. The FRY has also cancelled a bilateral agreement with Iraq and suspended bilateral military industrial agreements with all states that are subject to UN sanctions. Svilanovic has promised further investigation and possible prosecutions. The United Kingdom is considering the provision of technical assistance to the FRY to ensure effective regulation of arms exports. On <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase> UK experts visited Belgrade to conduct a preliminary assessment; a follow-up visit will take place soon. The EU provides support to the FRY's reform process, including improving the democratic control of the armed forces, from its Common Foreign and Security Policy budget.</p>

	<p pid=".571W.8/1">The Afghanistan Support Group (ASG) in December brought together the Afghan Government, the United Nations and donors to discuss progress already made in Afghanistan and the next steps in the reconstruction process. A key element of the ASG was the launch of the 2003 UN appeal for the Transitional Assistance Programme forAfghanistan. Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani also made a brief presentation on the budget for the coming year. Few donors were in a position to make specific pledges 2003 but most were able to confirm that they expected to provide a similar level of funding as they had provided for 2002; around $1 .Sbillion.</p>
	<p pid=".571W.8/2">It was also agreed by all present that this would be the final ASG. A new Development Forum, designed to ensure greater Afghan leadership of the reconstruction effort will supersede it. The new forum will have 12 Consultative Groups within its structure where selected donors can work with government on specific sectors. Until such time as the first Development Forum in March, the Japanese agreed to lead a transitional humanitarian group on humanitarian issues in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".572W.0/1">A great deal has been achieved since January 2002, when we pledged &pound;200 million to the reconstruction of Afghanistan at the Tokyo conference. A broad-based Transitional Administration has been elected. A new currency has been issued. 3 million children have returned to school, and polio has almost been eradicated.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/2">The 2002 harvest saw grain production rise by 80 per cent. compared to 2001. The power station and airport in Kabul are being refurbished. The rebuilding of the roads system has begun, and work is continuing on customs reform and the drafting of a new constitution.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/3">However, much remains to be done. One of the most pressing issues is to improve security for those living outside Kabul, and to extend the authority of the elected government beyond the capital. This is of fundamental importance to both the reconstruction effort, and in order to ensure human rights are respected. In December President Karzai issued a decree setting out plans for a multi-ethnic national army, and in the last month the first Provincial Reconstruction Team was deployed in Gardez province, under US leadership. First reports indicate that the security situation has improved as a result. The UK is actively considering leading a PRT in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/4">An important development has been the signing by Afghanistan's neighbours of Good Neighbourly Relations declaration by Afghanistan's neighbours. The declaration, essentially an agreement to maintain constructive relations and not to seek influence by exploiting ethnic rivalries, was signed by all Afghanistan's immediate neighbours in December 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/5">Work on humanitarian relief is also continuing. We contributed &pound;11 million to the UN's Winterisation programme to help ensure that vulnerable communities had adequate shelter and food over the winter, and a further &pound;2 million to the UN snow-clearing operation to ensure that aid reaches remote communities. Early indications are that this programme is going well, helped by a relatively mild winter. DFID will shortly be conducting a humanitarian assessment mission to formulate our strategy for the coming year.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/6">The Development Forum meeting in Kabul in March will be important in setting the priorities for reconstruction and international assistance over the next year.</p>

	<p pid=".576W.11/1">None. The construction of the road referred to took place from 1990 to 1993. Officials from the then Overseas Development Administration were aware of various complaints from people living in communities (not between Westlands and St. Austin, but further north on the same road) and discussed these with European Commission officials. The EC Ombudsman subsequently investigated and concluded that there had been no mal-administration on the part of the EC.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.5/1">While it is essential to deal with the problem of unsustainable debt in the poorest countries as part of our efforts to assist in eradicating poverty, complete cancellation of debt is not required; nor is it the most effective means of delivering aid resources to reduce poverty. We do not support the proposal for 100 per cent. cancellation of IMF and World bank loans, which is neither desirable nor equitable. For these institutions to provide 100 per cent. relief would risk skewing limited development resources away from other very poor countries, which have handled their debt well. Countries need to borrow&mdash;initially only on very concessional terms&mdash;to finance their poverty reduction strategies. In this way, they can re-establish their creditworthiness, which will also help them attract private investment and accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/1">PCD is using existing software to block inappropriate e-mails and therefore the new system has minimal cost. In the first week the system blocked 908 inappropriate e-mails sent to parliamentary e-mail addresses. The system filters incoming e-mails from non-parliamentary addresses and will not affect internal communications, outgoing e-mails or e-mails received from remote workers attached to the parliamentary data and video network (PDVN) via Citrix. The sender of any e-mail that is blocked will be notified and invited to contact the intended recipient to arrange for the blocked e-mail to be unblocked. This will prevent any genuine e-mail from being lost.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/2">PCD recognises that on occasions, constituents might use strong language: for example, if they are writing about a constituency issue on which they have firm views, or of which they have had a bad direct experience. Incoming e-mails that contain only a few mild expletives will be unaffected. Only those e-mails which contain a high proportion of the most offensive obscenities are blocked automatically.</p>

	<p pid=".583W.2/1">All applications for wind farm developments are considered against prevailing planning policies, taking account of representations received following normal advertising and consultation procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/2">The main policy guidance in this area is contained in &quot;A Planning Strategy for Rural Northern Ireland&quot;. This states that all proposals for wind farms will be assessed in respect of their implications for the visual, ecological and historic landscapes; the implications for agriculture; and the safety and amenity of local residents. It also makes it clear that permission will not be granted for wind turbine development in any location where it would have a seriously detrimental impact on the amenity of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty or on any area designated for its conservation, scientific, archaeological or historic interest.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/3">Consultation on wind farm proposals will normally include the Environmental Health Department of the relevant local Council, the Department of the Environment's Environment and Heritage Service, the Department for Regional Development's Roads and Water Services, the Ministry of Defence, and the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/4">In addition, under the Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999, the Department may require an Environmental Statement where a proposal is located in a 'sensitive area' and/or involves the installation of more than two turbines, or the hub height of any turbine or height of any other structure exceeds 15 metres. This Statement will provide the Department with detailed information about the impact that a proposal may have on the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/5">It is not normal procedure to consult the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on planning applications that, although in scenic areas, do not have a direct impact on tourism, and thus do not fall within the statutory remit of the Board. It is not, therefore, the practice of the Planning Service to consult the NITB automatically in relation to planning applications for wind farms and there are no plans to introduce such a practice.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/6">The English Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG 22) 'Renewable Energy' states that, apart from the movement of the blades, the development of a wind farm warrants no different approach in terms of ecological considerations from any other development, and evidence suggests that the risk of collision between moving turbine blades and birds is minimal both for migrating birds and for local habitats.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.2/7">Applications for wind farms will sometimes be made in, or close to, areas designated as of ecological importance, and such applications will be rigorously examined under the policies and guidance contained in Planning Policy Statement 2, 'Planning and Nature Conservation'. However, in terms of any potential direct impact of a wind farm proposal on the integrity of sites designated as of wildlife importance, including those designated for the conservation of birds, the Planning Service's main source of advice and guidance will remain the Department's Environment and Heritage Service and there are no plans to introduce a practice of consulting the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on wind farm applications.</p>

Tyrone. This application was presented to Strabane district council on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-26">26 February 2002</phrase> with a recommendation to refuse. The reasons for refusal were that the proposal would:</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/3" class="indent">be significantly detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the area;</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/4" class="indent">have an adverse effect on nature conservation interests;</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/5" class="indent">have an adverse effect on Lough Lee from construction activity and contamination.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/6">The application was deferred by the council to allow a site meeting to take place. This meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase>, and as a result the applicant indicated verbally that he will withdraw the application.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/7">(ii) Planning application K/2001/048/F for a wind farm in the district of Omagh, in the townlands of Lough Hill, Castlecraig, Curraghmacall and Drummahon, Co. Tyrone. The access would be from the Meenacloy Road via an existing forestry road through the townlands of Meenacloy, Meenabog, Ally and Sloughan, and Drumquin, Co. Tyrone. Planning Service is awaiting further consultation responses and the proposal is still under consideration by the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/8">(iii) Planning application L/2001/1346/F for a wind farm in the district of Fermanagh, in the townlands of Garrane, Mullaghfad, Corraleek and Corragunt, and Rosslea, Co. Fermanagh. Planning Service is awaiting further consultation responses and the proposal is still under consideration by the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/9">(iv) Planning application L/2001/1514/F for a wind farm in the district of Fermanagh, in the townlands of Callagheen and Garrison, Co. Fermanagh. This proposal was presented to Fermanagh district council on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-16">16 January 2003</phrase> with a recommendation to refuse. The reasons for the refusal were that the proposal would:</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/10" class="indent">be detrimental to the visual amenity and character of the proposed area of outstanding natural beauty;</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/11" class="indent">have an adverse impact on nature conservation.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/12">The council deferred the application to allow for an office meeting, the date of which is to be arranged.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/13">(v) Planning application L/2002/1042/F for a wind farm in the district of Fermanagh, in the townlands of Glenarn, Stranahone and Stranadarriff, Tappaghan Mountain and Lack, Co. Fermanagh. Planning Service is awaiting further consultation responses and the proposal is still under consideration by the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/14">(vi) Planning application L/2002/1183/F for a wind farm in the district of Fermanagh, in the townlands of Caricknabrattoge, Carrowmaculla, Eshmeen and Tully, and Lisnaskea, Co.

It is anticipated that this will lead to broadband networks being extended more widely.

	<p pid=".590W.9/2">ISI Centres were established as part of the Information Society Initiative, which was re-branded as UK online for business in 2000. The centres themselves were established to provide independent and impartial advice to SMEs about information and communication technology. When the re-organisation of the Small Business Service and the Business Link Organisation took place, it was agreed that the provision of this ICT advice would be delivered through the Business Link network and the equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many of the ISI advisers were subsumed into the Business Link organisation. There are therefore no ISI centres still in existence.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.9/1">The profitability and affordability of trips depend on several factors, including the price of tobacco products, the cost of passage to other EU member states and the level of disposable income available to different shoppers. Variations in cost between routes and products, in shoppers' income and in their understanding of existing unlimited shopping rights, prevent explicit or quantifiable relationships being derived about the likely response&mdash;in terms of the number of shoppers, the frequency of their trips and the scale of their purchases&mdash;to changes in indicative levels for tobacco. The assumptions used to inform the estimates of the revenue impact of the new indicative levels reflect Customs' best judgment on the basis of the available evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".603W.2/1">As I stated in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-16">16 January 2003</phrase>, HM Customs and Excise's survey data of cross-channel travellers shows that the majority of travellers make no purchases of cigarettes and that, of those who do make purchases, two-thirds purchase below the previous indicative level of 800 cigarettes, and that a further 15 per cent. purchase above. The recent change to the levels can be expected to have little effect on the shopping patterns of these travellers.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.9/2">The Presidency and the Commission introduced their work programmes for ECOFIN. The principal objective would be to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and boost confidence and growth through a renewed commitment to structural reforms.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/3">The council reached political agreement on the tax package, based on proposals outlined by the presidency at the <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-03">3 December 2002</phrase> ECOFIN meeting, and discussed at the <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December 2002</phrase> ECOFIN meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/4">The council confirmed the agreement at the Feira European Council that the objective of the EU should be exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible. And it confirmed the rejection at Feira of an EU-wide withholding tax, which would have had severe implications for the London bond market.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/5">Political agreement was reached that 12 member states will move to automatic exchange of information on the savings income of EU residents. Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will move to automatic exchange of information by the end of the first full fiscal year from the date when the council agrees by unanimity that the third countries named at Feira have committed to the OECD standard of exchange of information on request.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/6">Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will operate a transitional withholding tax of 15 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, 20 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>, and 35 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>. The council agreed that the EC should enter into an agreement with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino to adopt the same rates of withholding and maintain the 35 per cent. after adoption of exchange of information to the OECD standard.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/7">The council assessed that in respect of dependent and associated territories the necessary reassurances had been received that the same measures would be applied as in EU member states, and that in respect of the United States the necessary reassurances had been received that equivalent measures would be applied.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/8">The council committed itself to formal adoption of the tax package before the European Council in March 2003. This is dependent upon receiving firm offers from Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, San Marino and Monaco to enter into agreements as outlined, and on the council assessing the work of the Code of Conduct Group on the rollback of the identified harmful business tax measures of member states and of dependent and associated territories.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/9">In furtherance of the ultimate objective of exchange of information on as wide a basis as possible, the council asked the commission to continue negotiations with Switzerland and the other third countries for the exchange of information and to report back to the council before 2007, and to enter into discussions with other important financial centres.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/10">On the Stability and Growth Pact, the council adopted Opinions on the Stability and Convergence programmes of Sweden, Finland, Greece, Italy, Germany and France. The council adopted a Recommendation on an Excessive Deficit Procedure for Germany. It also adopted a Recommendation on an Early Warning for France, with France abstaining.</p>
	<p pid=".605W.9/11">In view of the lengthy discussion on the tax package, the presidency decided to postpone discussion of energy taxation and VAT administrative co-operation to the <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase> ECOFIN.</p>

	<p pid=".608W.10/1">The effects of exchange rate changes are difficult to isolate with any confidence, but the Government recognise the difficulties that the recent weakness of the euro has caused for exporters, including many small businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.10/2">The Government seek a stable and competitive pound over the medium-term, and the best contribution it can make is to deliver low, stable inflation and sound public finances. Previous experience shows that any short-term attempt to manipulate the exchange rate can lead to wider economic instability, with damaging consequences for small businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question on the net immigration of non-EU nationals to the UK from 1992 to 2001. (93370)</p>
	<p pid=".611W.2/4" class="indent">The information requested is provided in the attached table which shows the net migration estimates for non-EU nationals for 1992 to 2001. Two different estimates are shown in the table: (i) interim revised net migration estimates for non-EU nationals for 1992 to 2001 that take preliminary account of the 2001 Census results, and (ii) the original series of net migration estimates for non-EU nationals compiled prior to the results of the 2001 Census becoming available; it should be noted that the latter series has now been withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".611W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates shown in the table take account of dependants of asylum seekers. The Office for National Statistics are working closely with the Home Office to ensure that the best use is made of the recently available detailed Home Office information on dependants of asylum seekers in preparation of the revised international migration series which will be published in late Spring 2003. These revised estimates will be based upon more detailed information from the 2001 Census and further research work and will supercede the interim series included in the attached table.</p>

	<p pid=".613W.2/1">The global economic slowdown of 2001 was the principal cause of recent difficulties faced by UK manufacturers. G7 industrial output grew by 4.7 per cent. in 2000. During 2001 it contracted by 3.6 per cent. This was the sharpest slowdown in G7 industrial activity since 1975. But manufacturing output showed signs of stabilising in the course of 2002&mdash;in Q3 it rose by over 1 per cent., ending six consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.2/2">The stable macroeconomic framework is creating the right underlying conditions to enable manufacturing to invest, grow and prosper. The UK stands ready to benefit from any sustained recovery in the sector due to strong economic fundamentals and the Government's pro-active enterprise agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.2/3">In particular, corporation tax is now lower than in any major industrialised country. Cuts in capital gains tax mean the UK's CGT regime will be more favourable than the US's from April. R&amp;D tax credits for large companies will provide an important boost to UK manufacturing and RDAs have been created to drive growth in every English region.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.9/1">Circular 06/98 &quot;Planning and Affordable Housing&quot; advises that local planning authorities should define in their local plans what they regard as affordable housing, based on up-to-date surveys and other data of local need. The circular explains that definitions should be framed to endure for the life of the plan, for instance, through references to the level of local incomes and their relationship to house prices or rents, rather than to a particular price or rent.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.9/2">Circular 06/98 also provides guidance on the securing and controlling of the occupancy of such housing by, for example, the involvement of a registered social landlord or through the use of appropriate planning conditions or obligations. The Government are looking at circular 06/98 and whether it needs to be revised. An announcement will be made shortly.</p>

It recognised particularly that much of the contaminated land identified under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 will be subject to voluntary remediation through the planning system as part of the process of redevelopment. This revision of the contaminated land aspects of Planning policy guidance note 23 will be incorporated later this year in a new Planning policy statement, accompanied by a technical annexes on development on land affected by contamination.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.2/1">To meet the decent homes target for social housing the investment needed has to both tackle homes that currently fail the standard and prevent homes from falling below it. For homes currently owned by local authorities the estimated average annual investment in their stock required to deliver decent homes is &pound;3.5 billion at current prices. This figure will reduce with stock losses from this sector. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not yet have comparable figures for homes owned by Registered Social Landlords.</p>

Under Office of the Deputy Prime Minister central posting arrangements, all posts are open to part-time workers or job sharers. In very exceptional cases where line managers consider that a post cannot be filled on a part-time/job share basis, they must make a case to Human Resources setting out compelling reasons for this.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.11/1">Targets are not set centrally for refuge places for women. It is for local authorities to assess need for refuge places in their areas and to take steps to address that need. Supporting People Commissioning Bodies have recently completed shadow strategies setting out their assessment of service provision for local people, including for women experiencing domestic violence, and how they will address gaps in supply. The Government's steer to Commissioning Bodies on preparing these strategies encouraged them to give particular consideration to provision for high risk or vulnerable groups, such as women fleeing domestic violence.</p>

In Coventry, 35 household spaces in women's refuge provision for women at risk of domestic violence were recorded. In the West Midlands, 474 such spaces were recorded.</p>

	<p pid=".632W.0/1">As I informed the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January 2003</phrase>, the Government's preliminary conclusion is that we should agree to the US request to upgrade RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes. Ballistic missile early warning would continue to be the station's primary role. The upgrade would enable the radar to track incoming missiles more accurately and guide interceptions by defensive missiles if necessary. We will take full account of the views which have been expressed in public and parliamentary discussion before communicating a final decision to the US Administration.</p>

It is expected that all of these will be modified to improve their performance in desert conditions. In addition to the Challenger 2 tanks that we are modifying for contingency operations, consideration is being given to modifying further Challenger 2s. This decision does not in any way effect those tanks deploying, and will therefore be taken as part of the routine equipment planning process. I will write to the hon.

	<p pid=".636W.8/1">The Eurofighter aircraft requires large areas of airspace in which to train. Following a review of current allocation of air space, the National Air Traffic Control Services and the Ministry of Defence have therefore agreed to redesignate airspace over the North Sea. Three large managed areas have been designated which, when required, may be &quot;booked&quot; and used for military training. Only the most northerly designated training area covers any land, and within this area all flights will be conducted above 24,500ft. Under Government guidelines public consultation regarding the use of airspace is not required except where flight takes place below 7,000ft.</p>
	<p pid=".636W.8/2">The conduct of military flying is taken extremely seriously and any complaints are thoroughly investigated by the Ministry of Defence. Particular rules govern supersonic flight and these will continue to be strictly enforced.</p>

	<p pid=".638W.8/1">The Strategic Defence Review recognised that conflict prevention, peace support, and crisis management require a powerful force that is capable of immediate and, if necessary, sustained operations. It established the concept of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces to provide more capable, more deployable, and better supported Joint Forces. The initial operating capability was achieved in 1999, and elements have been deployed successfully both on operations and exercises. 16 Air Assault brigade, also formed in 1999, combines airborne and air mobile assets with, in the future, the new attack helicopter, and provides a further significant enhancement to our tactical mobility.</p>

Detailed Force Protection advice on countering the Asymmetric threat from terrorist attack is available in both Tactical and Reference publications and is the subject of continual assessment and periodic update as new information and feedback is obtained. This doctrine comprises both a generic description of likely threats and consideration of numerous measures that Commanding Officers need to consider adopting depending on their area of operations. The advice covers methods of reducing ship and personnel vulnerability to attack, enabling Commanding Officers to formulate a defensive posture commensurate with their operational state and location; reducing the risk of attack from an enemy who holds the advantage of surprise and method.</p>

	<p pid=".642W.2/1">The threat from terrorist attack is kept under constant review and the Ministry of Defence works closely with other Government Departments on the protection of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy's worldwide Maritime Trade Operations&mdash;known as UK MTO arrangements&mdash;enable a number of options to be offered in support of merchant shipping, graduated to the prevailing threat. These range from the provision of routine advice and guidance through to naval supervision. The appropriate level of MTO support required in a given area remains under constant assessment. For example, UK MTO arrangements in the Gulf have been enhanced since October 2001 by the establishment of a UK MTO liaison cell in the region. If necessary, higher level Maritime Trade Operations can be implemented very quickly. Information on specific measures to protect naval shipping were provided in my answer to the hon.

	<p pid=".644W.0/1">Immunisation against anthrax is just one component of the range of defensive capabilities available to our Armed Forces which protect them against, and enable them to respond to, chemical and biological threats. These include detectors, warning and reporting systems, physical protection including respirators, decontamination equipment and procedures, and other medical counter measures such as antibiotics. We have assembled a package of information and education materials which we hope will encourage Service personnel to take advantage of the additional protection that immunisation against anthrax provides. We are confident that the majority of personnel now deploying to the Gulf will opt to receive immunisations against anthrax, and expect take-up to improve further as the programme expands.</p>

	<p pid=".645W.9/1">When employers close their defined benefit schemes, they are seeking to put a limit on the long term liabilities of the company. Given the nature of these liabilities, however, closure is unlikely to have an immediate or even necessarily a short term impact. This is because the existing liabilities will still have to be met for the continuing life of the scheme irrespective of whether new members are being accepted. The Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement' (Cm5677) sets out the Government's view that, for this and other reasons, closing or winding up pension schemes are not in the interests of either employers or employees. The Green Paper, therefore, sets out a range of proposals to simplify the regulatory regime for pensions, which could save employers &pound;150 to &pound;200 million a year in administration, and thus make it easier for employers to continue to provide final salary schemes and other types of pension arrangements for their employees. We have launched a wide ranging consultation in which we are seeking views on this approach including its impact on employers.</p>

	<p pid=".647W.8/1">Paper-based instruments of payment can be vulnerable to fraudulent attack in a number of ways: they can go astray in the post, be lost or stolen, or be manipulated or counterfeited by a determined fraudster. We estimate that total benefit and pension losses from paper-based instruments of payment fraud in 2000&ndash;01 were around &pound;77 million.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.8/2">We have several measures in place to counter fraud, such as the Order Book Control System (OBCS). This makes use of barcode readers in post offices to scan order books that have been printed with a barcode on the front cover. OBCS alerts the post office clerk when a stop notice has been placed on an order book and instructs them to impound the book immediately. Crucially, the stop notice is activated in whatever post office the book is presented for payment and not only in the customer's designated post office. This helps to ensure that order books reported lost or stolen are not cashed, but instead impounded.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.8/3">Introducing direct payment into a bank, building society or post office card account as the normal method of benefit payment for the Department's customers will result in significant savings to public funds. It is a much more secure method of payment. Work is on-going to develop a more secure method of payment to replace existing order books and girocheques for those customers who cannot or choose not to be paid by direct payment.</p>
	<p pid=".647W.8/4">The post office card account is a Post Office product and detailed operational questions are the responsibility of the chief executive for the Post Office. However, the Department's officials will continue to work in close co-operation with the Post Office to ensure that the card account is as secure as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".651W.5/2">Currently the majority of Church of England clergy must retire on reaching 70, under the Ecclesiastical Offices (Age Limit) Measure 1975. Since the Government is still consulting on how the Employment Directive&mdash;to which Chapter 6 of the Green Paper refers&mdash;should be implemented as regards discrimination on grounds of age, it is not yet possible to say what its effect will be and whether changes will be required to the 1975 Measure.</p>

	<p pid=".657W.8/32">In April 2001, New Deal 25 plus was extended and enhanced to provide a flexible, more individually-tailored service to help more people get jobs and remain in them. This included the introduction of an Intensive Activity Period (IAP) for participants after an initial Gateway period. The IAP provides a wider package of tailored help, which might combine, for example, work experience, work-focused training, help with motivation and soft skills, and help with job search. From April 2001, all those eligible for New Deal 25 plus joined this re-engineered programme.</p>

	<p pid=".659W.8/19">1. Production of comparable cross-country estimates is extremely difficult due to substantially different rules in various countries. Eurostat say about their numbers:</p>
	<p pid=".659W.8/20">&quot;This indicator is not perfect. Old-age pensions may cover different areas in different countries, and the retirement age differs from country to country (for both the legal age and the effective age).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".659W.8/21">However, Eurostat's: &quot;European Social Statistics&mdash;Social Protection Expenditure and Receipts&quot; (ESSPROS) is regarded as the best available measure.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.8/22">2. The definition of pensions in the ESSPROS methodology includes basic and supplementary schemes, sometimes known as first-pillar and second pillar schemes, but excludes third-pillar arrangements, for example personal pensions in the UK. The ESSPROS pensions aggregate comprises of only part of periodic cash benefits under the disability, old-age, survivors and unemployment functions in ESSPROS.</p>
	<p pid=".659W.8/23">3. In the case of the UK, the pensions aggregate recorded in ESSPROS comprises of benefits payable under the disability, old-age and survivors' functions and occupational pensions. It excludes lump-sum benefits payable on retirement (approximately 0.7 per cent. of GDP in 1999). Personal pensions are also not included in the ESSPROS social protection definition of pensions (approximately 1.5 per cent. of GDP in 1999).</p>

	<p pid=".661W.3/2">Generally, legal representation in employment tribunal proceedings in England and Wales is excluded from the scope of public funding, though funding for general legal advice falling short of advocacy is available under the Legal Help Scheme. However the Lord Chancellor has the power under Section 6(8)<i>(b)</i> of the Access to Justice Act 1999 to authorise funding in exceptional cases where the Legal Services Commission asks him to do so. In Scotland representation before an employment tribunal is available to anyone who meets the statutory tests for Assistance by Way of Representation (ABWOR). ABWOR allows a solicitor to appear on behalf of a client before the Tribunal.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.6/2">There is very little information about same-sex couples in this country. The Labour Force Survey suggests that there are about 50,000 cohabiting same-sex couples in the UK. Around one in twenty of the individuals in these couples say they are claiming income related benefits or tax credits. There appear to be very few who are pensioners. Same sex couples are treated as individuals for the purposes of determining entitlement to income related benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.6/3">We already treat same sex couples as individuals for the purpose of determining entitlement to income related benefits. Any estimate of the savings made from treating unmarried heterosexual couples as couples rather than as individuals would depend on assumptions about, for example, the number of individuals who would otherwise choose to claim benefit and about whether benefit would be paid for their children.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.0/2">The private rented sector is now only some 10 per cent. of the whole housing market, and regulated tenancies have become only a small part of the private rented sector. This means that even though the Survey of English Housing is a large survey, the sample of regulated private tenancies is not large enough to allow reliable figures to be produced for individual regions and for individual years. Tabled is the estimated annual average number of regulated and deregulated tenancies for the period 1998&ndash;99 to 2001&ndash;02 for London, and for broad regional groupings. Annual estimates of regulated and deregulated tenancies in England are also shown from 1996&ndash;97 to 2001&ndash;02. There is no reason to expect that the trends in individual regions have been significantly different from those for England as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".664W.3/2">The abolition of ACT was part of a package of measures introduced over the period 1997 to 1999 aimed at creating an improved climate for long term investment. Subsequent tax changes have also been designed to promote enterprise and encourage economic growth. There are practical difficulties in assessing the impact of these changes, and in any case, it does not make sense to evaluate the impact of one part of this series of measures in isolation.</p>

	<p pid=".667W.5/1">A survey of the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain was carried out in 1999 by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of the Department of Health, Scottish National Executive and National Assembly for Wales. Prevalence rates were produced for five to 15-year-olds in the three main categories of mental disorder; ie, conduct disorder, hyperactivity and emotional disorder.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/2">The key findings on prevalence were that:</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/3" class="indent">about 10 per cent. of children aged five to 15 in Great Britain had a mental disorder in 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/4" class="indent">5 per cent. had conduct disorders (eg aggressive and antisocial behaviour), 4 per cent. had emotional disorders (eg anxiety, depression) and 1 per cent. were hyperkinetic (inattention, over-activity);</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/5" class="indent">mental disorders were significantly more common in boys than girls in both the five to 10 and the 11 to 15-year-old age groups.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/6">The survey also found that mental disorders were more likely among children:</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/7" class="indent">in lone parent compared with two parent families</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/8" class="indent">who had a parent with a mental disorder</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/9" class="indent">in families of social class V (unskilled occupations) compared with social class I (professional occupations)</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/10" class="indent">in families with a gross weekly household income of less than &pound;200 compared with &pound;500 or more</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/11" class="indent">who had a physical health complaint</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/12" class="indent">who had special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid=".667W.5/13">The prevalence of mental disorders in children were not unexpected nor were the associations between the risk factors and levels of disorder. They are in line with similar studies in Western Europe and the United States. This information has proved very useful in providing a benchmark for further work, such as that being undertaken by the child and adolescent mental health module of the Children's National Service Framework.</p>

	<p pid=".671W.6/2">National trends in fruit and vegetable consumption since 2001 cannot as yet be fully ascertained due to the considerable time it takes to undertake dietary surveys and their analyses. The latest national food survey data shows that between 1999 and 2000, household weekly purchase of fruit and fruit juice continued to increase, from 1,063 g to 1,121 g, whereas household consumption of vegetables continued to decrease, from 1,095 g to 1,077 g. This information does not take account of wastage.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.6/3">National evaluation of pilot five a day community initiatives&mdash;one year intervention between 2000 and 2001&mdash;showed that the initiatives stemmed a fall in fruit and vegetable intakes. There was no overall change in fruit and vegetable intake in the intervention group but there was a fall in intake by almost half a portion in the control group. The intervention was found to have had a positive effect in people with the lowest intakes. Those who ate less than five a day at baseline increased their intakes by one portion over the course of the study.</p>
	<p pid=".671W.6/4">Detailed information on fruit and vegetable intakes was collected as part of the Health Survey for England for the first time during 2002. The collection of this information in future years will allow an examination of national trends by age, sex and geographic region.</p>

We envisage that local, regional and national public health teams will be assisted by better microbiological services consisting of a complementary network of local public health and regional microbiologists, working with others at the national level, all of whom will have responsibility for operational support in the event of a major incident, including biological attacks. Interim management arrangements are being put in place at national, regional and local level to ensure that the HPA will be able to address key threats from its inception.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.0/3">Surveillance to detect untoward events and outbreaks will continue to be monitored by the communicable disease surveillance centre.

	<p pid=".674W.3/2">The Department commissions several annual surveys that include questions on lifestyle issues:</p>
	<p pid=".674W.3/3">The Health Survey for England is a series of annual surveys about the health of people in England. This information is used to underpin and improve targeting of nation-wide health policies. The survey was carried out in 1991&ndash;1993 by the Office for Population Censuses and Surveys, which is now part of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). From 1994 onwards, the survey has been carried out by the joint survey unit of the national centre of social research and the department of epidemiology and public health at University College, London. The survey includes questions on smoking, drinking, obesity, fruit and vegetable consumption and in certain years, physical activity, but it extends beyond lifestyle questions and covers a wide range of subjects to do with the general health of the population.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.3/4">The ONS general household survey, &quot;Living in Britain&quot;, is a continuous survey which has been running since 1971 and is based each year on a sample of the general population resident in private; that is, non-institutional, households in Great Britain. It covers a wide range of topics of relevance to households, families and individuals, including questions on smoking and drinking.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.3/5">The ONS omnibus survey is a multi-purpose survey carried out by the ONS for Government Departments and other public or non-profit making bodies. Interviewing is carried out every month and each month's questionnaire covers a variety of topics, reflecting different user's requirements. Included among these from time to time will be questions on smoking, drinking and contraception.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.3/6">The annual survey of drug use, smoking and drinking among young people in England is part of a series established in 1982 and provides national estimates of the proportion of young people aged 11&ndash;15 who smoke, drink alcohol and/or take illegal drugs.</p>

The National Diet and Nutrition Survey showed that more than one in ten children aged 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; years were anaemic. Early introduction of cow's milk is associated with increased risk of anaemia. The Infant Feeding Survey 2000 reported that by the age of nine months 54 per cent. had introduced cow's milk, compared to 61 per cent. in 1995, while 8 per cent. were giving cow's milk as a main drink, compared to 15 per cent. in 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.3/2">The Department recommends that unmodified cow's milk be given as a main drink only after the age of one year and may be used in small quantities in the preparation of solid foods in the second half of infancy. After one year, diet should include a variety of foods to ensure that it is adequate in iron, vitamin C and D.</p>

	<p pid=".677W.3/1">The information requested is not collected at individual hospital level but at trust level.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.3/2">The reasons for measuring at trust level is because hospital wards generally care for both men and women. To provide the required levels of privacy and dignity for patients, wards are split into single sex bays, or single rooms, or otherwise configured to provide adequate segregation of gender. It is the responsibility of each national health service trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.3/3">In 1998, we set three clear objectives which were designed to deliver separate sleeping areas and separate toilet and washing facilities for men and women, and to safeguard the privacy and dignity of patients who are mentally ill.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.3/4">Today, 98 per cent. of NHS trusts provide single-sex sleeping accommodation and have robust operational policies in place which protect patients' privacy and dignity. 95 per cent. of NHS trusts have met additional criteria set for mental health facilities. The target to provide separate toilet and washing facilities for men and women will be met by the end of March. 93 per cent. of NHS trusts currently meet this requirement, and a further 2 per cent. of NHS trusts have works underway to deliver the required standard, affecting just 32 wards, which will be completed by the end of the March.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.3/5">Nationally, over 98 per cent. of NHS wards meet privacy and dignity guidelines. New hospitals and hospital facilities currently being built will bring the remaining wards to the necessary standard.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.6/1">It is not possible to estimate the precise number of patients who have received Roaccutane (isotretinoin) in the United Kingdom in the last five years. However, it has been estimated that approximately 375,000 treatment courses of isotretinoin have been prescribed between 1983 and May 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.6/2">The table provides the total number of suspected psychiatric disorders reported during each of the past five years through the Yellow Card Scheme for Roaccutane.

	<p pid=".687W.6/12">A report of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the medicine. The number of reports received should not be used as a basis for determining the incidence of a reaction as neither the total number of reactions occurring, nor the number of patients using the drug is known.</p>
	<p pid=".687W.6/13">With expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Medicines Control Agency is currently leading a European-wide review of the product information of isotretinoin products, including Roaccutane, with the aim to ensure that up to date and consistent information is provided to health professionals and patients to optimise its safe use. This review is likely to take some months to complete. Any new advice will be communicated to health professionals and patients.</p>

No other hospital trusts within the West Midlands South Strategic Health Authority (StHA) area have issued red alerts in the period.</p>
	<p pid=".688W.5/3">During this period, the trust experienced a significant amount of pressure, largely due to diarrhoea and vomiting outbreaks, in addition to an increase in thelevels of emergency admissions. Each health community within the StHA has an agreed escalation policy described in winter plans. Each phase of escalation policy is triggered by specific operational difficulties. When the circumstances deteriorate to such a level, patients are diverted to a nearby, alternative hospital, often within the same trust.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.12/1">Changes under the Police Reform Act 2002 make it easier for all relevant authorities to obtain anti-social behaviour orders (ASBO). Interim orders are now available, as are orders on conviction in the criminal courts. From April orders will also be available in the county courts. In addition, the British Transport Police can now apply directly for orders. The Home Office has issued guidance on these changes to assist practitioners in their implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".689W.12/2">Measures to further improve ASBOs are being introduced under the forthcoming anti-social behaviour bill.</p>

	<p pid=".697W.2/1">Lancashire Constabulary has conducted successful operations to deal with major criminal activities which affect the community, such as drug dealing, burglary and car crime. The Chief Constable's July 2002 Constabulary Ambition Statement for Lancashire gives priority to leadership, resource management, communication, community engagement and delivering results. All are important for the promotion of community cohesion, which is central to the work of the police across the country and particularly in areas with fragmented communities.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/2">Specific steps being taken by Lancashire Constabulary include:</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/3" class="indent">community beat managers in strategic areas around the county, particularly in Burnley and Pendle, each with responsibility for a particular area, providing a constant link with the public, dealing with community issues and reducing crime; they are also the best link with young people, and help respond to rumours and provide reassurance. To raise their profile, they are having a new uniform insignia, and commitment is being made to continuity by not redeploying them to other duties and by maintaining individuals in post for a minimum of two years;</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/4" class="indent">the proactive work of the newly-formed hate crime unit in Burnley and Pendle, which has significantly improved detection rates for racially aggravated violent crime, enhancing community confidence;</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/5" class="indent">the community and race relations (CRR) strategy incorporates youth issues, responses to racial incidents and crimes, ensuring equitable service delivery and developing the recruitment, retention and progression of staff with regard to CRR and cohesion issues through training;</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/6" class="indent">intelligence-led problem-oriented approaches, at all levels of policing and in all departments, which involve monitoring tension indicators and other threats to public safety and working in partnership with outside agencies and members of the public; and</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/7" class="indent">community safety teams in each of the six divisions, with a central strategic team at headquarters, dedicated to working on community-based projects, particularly those that relate to minority communities; the teams work to reassure the public, provide communities with a link to the police, deal with hate crime and gather intelligence on community tensions.</p>
	<p pid=".697W.2/8">I would like to express appreciation of the work of Lancashire Constabulary in these and other measures implementing the recommendations of the Burnley Taskforce (Clarke report), of the Cantle report and of the Ministerial Group on Public Safety and Community Cohesion following the summer 2001 disturbances in Burnley. This has been taken forward by a multi-agency forum with local authorities and other agencies, with a view to ensuring effective partnership working.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.0/1">No unit cost information is available for the specific costs of drug treatment and testing orders (DTTO) in Kent and Tunbridge Wells. The assessed national average unit cost of a DTTO is &pound;6,000, of which &pound;2,400 is retained by the probation service to cover supervision, enforcement and other related costs. The balance of &pound;3,600 per order is transferred to the Department of Health pooled treatment budget to cover treatment and related costs.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.0/2">234 orders have been commenced in Kent since the national roll-out of DTTOs in October 2000. Kent probation area has been set a target of 160 DTTOs in the current year and 86 orders have been made to <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-30">30 November 2002</phrase> including six orders in Tunbridge Wells.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.0/3">It is increasingly the practice of the courts when considering a breach of an order, to allow the DTTO to continue where good progress has otherwise been shown. Information is collected centrally on the total number of breach actions initiated but is not available in a form which allows the incidence of breaches to be linked to an individual order.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.0/4">Since national roll-out in October 2000, Kent probation has initiated breach action which resulted in the revocation of 121 orders: 91 for failure to comply, and 30 following a conviction for another offence. However, some of these offences were committed before the order began. Results from local intelligence sources, including the police, suggest that the volume of offending for this chaotic group of offenders is reduced and maintained over time for those responding to their treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.3/1">Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.3/2">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Kent. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&ndash;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).</p>
	<p pid=".701W.3/3">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.3/4">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.8/2">The Government have responded to public concerns about the nuisance and distress caused by juveniles riding off-road motor bikes across public parks, village greens or the countryside without authority by securing new powers for the police to deal with the anti-social use of any motor vehicle whether on- or off-road. The new powers are contained in section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 and the Police (Retention and Disposal of Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2002, both of which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.8/3">The new powers build on existing road traffic legislation by enabling the police to seize any vehicle being driven carelessly or inconsiderately or off-road without authority and in such a way as to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. This will enable the police to deal more immediately and more effectively with the nuisance. The new powers will inconvenience those who misuse their vehicles and see them liable to meet the costs involved in seizure and storage in order to recover them.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.8/4">The Home Office has written to all chief officers of police, drawing their attention to the new provisions and advising them on application.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.3/1">The table gives the readily available information on the number of traffic officers in each police force in England. This covers the three years since 1999, in which year the definition of traffic officer used by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary changed. The definition is now &quot;staff who are predominantly employed on motor-cycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties&quot;. This definition excludes those engaged in accident investigation, vehicle examination or radar duties.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.3/2">The adoption of an intelligence-led approach to traffic policing, the integration of such policing with other core activities, the increased use of cameras and other technology, and the more effective use of police resources can lead to a reduction in dedicated traffic officers without a reduction in performance in meeting traffic-related targets or enforcement levels.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.3/3">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has created a protocol to safeguard expertise and credibility by providing a common standard within the police service for the conduct of collision investigation and reconstruction. Under this, police forces should aim, at the primary level, to train collision investigation officers to the level of the appropriate City and Guilds qualification or an approved equivalent. The recommendation is that the qualification should be achieved within two years of the officer first undertaking this type of work. In addition, specialist officers are required to undergo continuing professional development, which provides a means of maintaining and enhancing their expertise and ensuring the maintenance of standards.</p>
