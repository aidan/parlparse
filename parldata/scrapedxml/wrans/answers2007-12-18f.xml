	<p pid="f.1228W.3/1">Departmental and other select committees in the Commons may already conduct post-legislative scrutiny exercises on any Acts falling within their area of activity, either as a separate inquiry or as part of other inquiries. Many committee inquiries contain elements of post-legislative scrutiny. In respect of certain Acts, specific provision for post-legislative scrutiny is included within the terms of the Act (for example the Pensions Act 2007). The Government expects to be responding shortly to the recommendations of the Law Commission, in its 2006 Report on &quot;Post-Legislative Scrutiny&quot; (Cm 6945), relating to a more systematic approach to post-legislative scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="f.1231W.14/1">Infant diagnostics for HIV continue to be a challenge in resource-limited settings. The most common way to test for HIV is to identify antibodies to the virus, but antibody tests are not reliable in very young children. A new approach to HIV diagnosis in infants was therefore introduced in some African countries in late 2006. This involves testing 'dry blood spots' collected in a way that does not need specialist equipment at the point of care. This technology offers a vital opportunity for timely access to lifesaving treatment and care services for children who are infected with HIV. However, these services are just getting started in many countries and therefore relatively few infants have been able to receive such tests to date.</p>
	<p pid="f.1231W.14/2">The UK announced support of &euro;20 million for UNITAID in September 2006, as part of a 20 year commitment, increasing to &euro;60 million per year by 2010 subject to performance. This month, UNITAID, together with UNICEF, launched a joint initiative that will include support to early paediatric diagnosis to improve early access to paediatric HIV treatment for HIV-infected infants.</p>

We are working closely with other donors and government to agree how our support should be continued. Our current phase of support finishes this January.</p>

Ugandans are now better informed when designing policies to support the sector. In addition our programme has supported a financial consumer education campaign to better inform microfinance consumers of their rights and responsibilities. The programme also helped a range of financial institutions improve services to better meet the needs of over 750,000 clients and establish over 4,000 self-managed village savings and loan associations.

Reliable figures are hard to obtain as many Zimbabweans have crossed borders illegally. The UN and governments in host countries consider most of those who have left Zimbabwe to be economic migrants. As economic migrants they are not recognised as refugees nor protected under various international conventions governing the treatment of refugees. Over 160,000 Zimbabweans were deported from South Africa up to the end of October 2007, already a significant increase on the numbers deported in the whole of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="f.1236W.6/1">The licensing system under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is demand-led and the Home Office has no control over the number of project licence applications received. Our objective is to minimise the number of animals used in particular programmes of work. We cannot influence the overall amount of animal research which takes place as this is determined by a number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour.</p>
	<p pid="f.1236W.6/2">We are, however, fully committed to encouraging the development of alternatives to animal experimentation where this is possible and under the 1986 Act, the use of animals in scientific procedures will not be licensed if alternative non-animal techniques are available. The establishment of the National Centre for the Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) by Government in May 2004 and continued contributions to its funding by the Home Office demonstrates our ongoing commitment in this area.</p>
	<p pid="f.1236W.6/3">Assessing the overall impact of the adoption of non-animal methods is not easy, however some insights can be drawn from the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals published each year. For example, the use of such methods has reduced the number of mice used each year for monoclonal antibody production from several thousand to zero. Also, between 1996 and 2005 the introduction of the Limulus Assay for some classes of pyrogen testing reduced rabbit use for this purpose from 16,457 to 8,769.</p>

	<p pid="f.1237W.3/1">The information requested is shown in the following table. The figures given show the number of subject sample profiles retained on the National DNA Database at <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October 2007</phrase> which were taken by forces in England and Wales, and the number of individuals that these profiles represent. They include over 26,000 subject sample profiles taken from volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="f.1237W.3/2">It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). Thus the number of individuals on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. fewer than the number of subject profiles. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long-term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of all such redundant replicate profiles.</p>
	<p pid="f.1237W.3/3">Information on the NDNAD is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. The address of the person sampled is not recorded. Thus the figure for Suffolk (for example) includes people from outside Suffolk whose DNA was sampled by Suffolk police, and excludes people from Suffolk whose DNA was sampled by forces elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="f.1239W.2/2">Cautions data are only collected by the Ministry of Justice by police force area. Information held centrally does not allow a breakdown of cases by individual police services area within Essex nor can data be provided for the number of cautions issued in Southend.</p>

To help police officers exercise their discretion, guidance from the Home Office requires the police to check nationally and locally held records before administering a simple caution.</p>
	<p pid="f.1239W.2/4">A simple caution is a non-statutory disposal which allows the police to deal quickly and simply with less serious offences, to divert offenders where appropriate from appearing in criminal courts and to reduce the likelihood of re-offending. Whether to caution an offender for a criminal offence is an operational matter for the police, and, in the case of indictable-only offences, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The police must consider whether a simple caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender, and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="f.1240W.3/1">In 2004 Government established the National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NCSRs) to advance and promote the replacement, refinement and reduction of the use of animals in research. This is the first such centre to be established in the world and it receives funding from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) via the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). In September this year, I announced NCSRs would receive &pound;2.4 million, an increase of &pound;1 million, for 11 new 3Rs projects. The CSR period will see further increased funding rising from &pound;2.3 million in 2007-08 to just over &pound;5 million in 2010-11. The centre also received &pound;250,000 funding from the Home Office in 2007-08. Home Office funding after 2007-08 will be confirmed in due course.</p>
	<p pid="f.1240W.3/2">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) regulates the use of animals in scientific procedures in the UK. The principles of the 3Rs are implicit in the ASPA; all UK scientists are therefore legally obliged to use alternative approaches to the use of animals where possible, to use the minimum number of animals, and to use protocols which cause the least pain, suffering or distress.</p>

The Government have commissioned two reviews of particular relevance to the future of major science research projects and physics departments in the North West. It has asked Sir Tom McKillop to advise on the best way to implement the Government's vision for the Daresbury Science and Innovation Campus as part of his independent review into the future of the Manchester City Region and the North West economy. The Government have also asked Research Councils UK to conduct a number of further reviews of the health of disciplines in the UK. Bill Wakeham, Vice Chancellor of Southampton University, will lead the first of these reviews, which will address the health of physics in the UK.</p>

The cost of moving the NIMR to its new site has therefore yet to be determined and will in part rely upon the detailed analysis of the scientific advisory team and the yet to be appointed project director and his/her team. While the project cost has been broadly estimated by the consortium at around &pound;500 million, this figure is indicative only and has yet to be finalised for future programme evaluation purposes, as has the total cost to the MRC.

These plans have been evaluated by the Metropolitan police and the Central Tours Office. The design and construction of the ramp are part of the original design.</p>

	<p pid="f.1248W.9/2">The Environment Agency is responsible for enforcing compliance in England, with the Action Programme under the nitrates directive. Inspections are undertaken either as part of the cross-compliance enforcement regime (the Action Programme is a statutory management requirement) or as part of the standalone enforcement regime under the nitrates directive. Available enforcement statistics are summarised in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="f.1248W.9/13">The cases of non-compliance tabled have, to date, led to 162 producers in England having their subsidy reduced since cross compliance was introduced in 2005. Calculating the total amount of funding deducted in each year from subsidy payments would require intensive interrogation of the single payment scheme database. Therefore it is not possible to provide these figures within the time available.</p>

	<p pid="f.1251W.2/2">The first meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase> at which its role and future work were discussed. Terms of reference will now be worked-up for agreement at the next meeting. It is expected that the Group will meet three times a year. The Group itself will decide how long it continues. No specific resources have been allocated to the Group as it will make use of existing departmental resources as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="f.1251W.5/1">From April 2008 and for the three-year comprehensive spending review (CSR) period, the Environment Agency and other operating authorities (i.e. local authorities and internal drainage boards) will deliver a number of outcome measures agreed with DEFRA. Targets will be set in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="f.1251W.5/2">During the CSR period, the current prioritisation method will migrate to a new system based around these outcome measures. While the new method is being developed and tested, the Environment Agency will use the existing system, moderated to take account of the outcome measures, urgent works or those required to fulfil legal requirements.</p>
	<p pid="f.1251W.5/3">The achievement of these measures is an integral part of the prioritisation of the capital investment programmes for all operating authorities. As a result, all flood management and coastal erosion management schemes will be prioritised on a common basis.</p>
	<p pid="f.1251W.5/4">As part of its strategic overview role for inland flooding and forthcoming strategic overview for matters associated with coastal flooding and erosion, the Environment Agency will administer the grant-in-aid arrangements, including extending its national programme management role to the prioritisation of schemes proposed by other operating authorities.</p>
	<p pid="f.1251W.5/5">The priority score thresholds for the period from 2002-03 to 2005-06 were set by DEFRA as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="f.1251W.5/8"> <td></td> <td><i> Priority Score Thresholds</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="f.1251W.5/9"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>19</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="f.1251W.5/12"> <td>2002-03</td> <td>20</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="f.1251W.5/15">DEFRA did not set a threshold score in 2006-07 when the Department's programme was fully committed. However, the priority score system has still been used to inform the allocation process for capital investment, moderated for urgent works or those required to fulfil legal requirements.</p>

	<p pid="f.1255W.2/2">The Government have taken a range of steps to assist parents of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs).</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.2/3">The Early Years Support programme has produced a Family Pack, including a booklet containing information for the parents of children with ASDs, who are going through the process of getting a diagnosis or have been recently diagnosed. It was produced in association with the National Autistic Society and Parents' Autism Campaign for Education. Over 50,000 copies have been distributed.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.2/4">Under the Children, Young People and Families Grant Programme, the then Department for Education and Skills provided a grant of &pound;220,000 over a three-year period to the TreeHouse Trust in 2006-07. This grant is to carry out work with parents' groups and local authority professionals on collaborative working towards better autism services and making information on ASDs more readily available. This year under this grant programme the Department for Children Schools and Families has awarded The National Autistic Society &pound;200,000 over the next three years. This money will expand provision of courses to provide parents with an overview of autistic spectrum disorders; strategies on improving communication; guidance on educational rights and access to services and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.2/5">The 'Aiming High for Disabled Children' report (May 2007) announced &pound;280 million over 2008-11 to improve provision of short breaks for families of disabled children. Children with ASDs and their parents will benefit from this funding.</p>

	<p pid="f.1255W.5/2">In 2002, the autism working group of the former Department for Education and Skills, published good practice guidance on autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). The guidance is for schools, local authorities and others who provide for children with autism. Part one gives general guidance on autistic spectrum disorders and part two gives pointers to good practice which can be used to audit and develop provision. The online version contains examples to illustrate the pointers. Over 32,000 copies of the guidance have been distributed on demand.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.5/3">The Department-funded regional partnerships have also provided resources for schools. For example guidance on delivering the curriculum for children with ASDs in secondary schools (north-west) and a video illustrating effective practice for children with ASDs (south-west). South-central has developed guidance for learning support assistants and Merseyside a transition toolkit for children with ASDs moving from primary to secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.5/4">In 2007-08 six of the nine regional partnerships are being funded for autism related innovation projects. For example the south-east partnership has been awarded a grant of &pound;50,000 to support secondary inclusion for young people with Asperger's syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.5/5">In October this year the Government launched the Inclusion Development Programme (IDP). This &pound;2 million project will improve the skills of teachers by advising them on how to develop teaching strategies for children with SEN and providing guidance on dealing with common classroom challenges. Phase two of the programme, which includes the production of training materials, will focus on support for children with ASDs.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.5/6">This year the Government also provided funding for a group of voluntary organisations, The National Autistic Society, the TreeHouse Trust and the Council for Disabled Children, to set up the Autism Education Trust. The trust was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">12 November</phrase>. The aim of the trust is to bring together voluntary and independent providers to plan and develop further improvements in education provision for children with autism.</p>
	<p pid="f.1255W.5/7">In addition to these specific resources, children with ASDs will benefit from the sustained increases in funding for children with all types of special educational need (SEN). Local authorities' planned spending on SEN stood at almost &pound;4.9 billion in 2007-08, up from almost &pound;2.8 billion in 2000-01. Indicative SEN funding in mainstream schools rose by 52 per cent. from almost &pound;1.3 billion in 2003-04 to over &pound;2.0 billion in 2007-08 and school budgets for special schools rose by 31 per cent. from almost &pound;1.1 billion to over &pound;1.4 billion over the same period.</p>

	<p pid="f.1259W.2/1">We expect all Sure Start children's centres to have a building as a focal point that is clearly identifiable as the Sure Start children's centre. A centre may comprise several neighbouring buildings each hosting some of the core services, although only one of these should be clearly identified as the reception and act as the centre's postal address. Ideally, we want to see services collocated, and under one roof, but accept that this will not always be achievable. In rural areas for example, where a centre serves families living across a wide geographical area, there will often be a main centre and a number of 'outreach' sites which support the delivery of services close to where families live. We are aware that some local authorities do use the term 'virtual children's centre' where they already have a range of services up and running, serving children and families, but the new building that will be the Sure Start children's centre is still under construction.</p>

We have, however, asked our delivery contractors, Together for Children (TfC), to ensure that local authorities and local health partners are working together to plan and deliver children's centre services. TfC are also collecting evidence of good practice to share and disseminate with local authorities and the health service.</p>

	<p pid="f.1262W.6/1">Information on the number of permanent exclusions broken down by school term is not available. Information is collected retrospectively via school census (SC) returns. Prior to 2005/06, school census returns were made on an annual basis. Since 2005/06, data for secondary schools have been collected termly, primary schools began making termly returns in 2006/07. As this is a new collection, data on numbers of permanent exclusions are subject to checking by local authorities.

In 2004 we published a non-statutory framework for religious education, on which we encourage Agreed Syllabus Conferences to base their syllabuses. The framework places inclusion, tolerance, diversity and interfaith dialogue at the heart of children's learning. These principles are shared both by the Department and faith communities. It is up to schools and teachers to use their professional judgment as to how best to deliver religious education within the locally agreed syllabus and in the spirit of the framework.</p>

	<p pid="f.1269W.2/1">Local authorities and admission authorities must act in accordance with the school admissions code. In relation to siblings at primary schools, it says that admission authorities should make sure in their oversubscription criteria that, as far as possible, siblings (including twins, triplets or children from other multiple births) can attend the same primary school, as long as they comply with the infant class size regulations. The code goes on to say that children at secondary school age are usually more independent, but does provide guidance for admission authorities on how to help meet parents' wishes where they wish siblings to continue to attend the same school.</p>
	<p pid="f.1269W.2/2">The code makes schools' admission arrangements fairer and more transparent for parents. The code applies to admissions to schools from September 2008. We are therefore planning to look at what impact the code has had from 2008.</p>

	<p pid="f.1282W.14/1">It has not proved possible to provide a break-down of the proportion of children of each ethnicity who were living in workless households in each region in each quarter since January 1997. Data from the Labour Force Survey provide very small sample sizes when the data are broken down by both region and ethnicity, leading to figures that may be misleading. Officials are currently investigating ways of overcoming this problem, and I will write to the hon. Member in the near future, if the analysis is feasible.</p>
	<p pid="f.1282W.14/2">Historical data at a national level is however readily available. The proportion of children living in workless households stood at 18.4 per cent. in 1997. Since then the overall trend has been falling; in 2006, the proportion of children living in workless households stood at 15.3 per cent. In 2007 the Labour Force Survey moved from spring to calendar quarters (Q2), consequently the 2007 figure of 16 per cent. is not directly comparable with previous years.</p>

Workless individuals are those who are either unemployed (International Labour Organisation definition) or economically inactive (that is, not in employment).<br/> In line with the 2006 Eurostat directive, the Labour Force Survey has shifted away from the use of seasonal data (spring) and instead refers to second quarter (Q2) figures, in order to assess the progress of the Children in Workless Households target.

	<p pid="f.1284W.2/2">Since January 2003, 85 new voluntary aided schools have been established. During the same period, 49 maintained schools changed category to become voluntary aided schools.</p>
	<p pid="f.1284W.2/3">Proposals to establish new schools, or change category to become voluntary aided, are decided under local decision-making arrangements. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="">25 May</phrase> this year, decisions were taken by the local School Organisation Committee or schools adjudicator. Under the current arrangements, the local authority is the decision maker in most cases, except for proposals for a new school where the local authority is the proposer or has a role in the trust of a proposed trust school. An appeal to the schools adjudicator can be made in specific cases. Decision makers must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, which sets out the factors that must be considered when deciding proposals. For proposals to establish a new school this includes: the impact of standards and levels of diversity; the need for school places; the demand for the particular type of education the new school will offer; the contribution to community cohesion and a range of other factors.</p>

Prison industry workshops, including industrial laundries, account for approximately 10,000 work places. There are also a number of prison workshops employing some 800 prisoners engaged in tasks such as repairing wheelchairs and bicycles and delivering Braille services.</p>

	<p pid="f.1299W.3/1">This is an operational matter for the Audit Commission. I will ask the Chief Executive of the Audit Commission to write to the hon. Member and arrange for the letter to be published in the <i> Official Report.</i></p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred<i> , </i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-18">18 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/3" class="indent">Your parliamentary question on what plans the Audit Commission has to change audit fees charged to local authorities has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/4" class="indent">We issued consultation documents setting out the Commission's proposed scales of audit and inspection fees for 2008-09 and the indicative fee proposals for 2009-10 and 2010-11 to all audited bodies and other stakeholders on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November 2007</phrase>. A copy of the consultation document for local authorities is attached. The consultation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-11">11 January 2008</phrase>, and the Audit Commission Board will be asked to approve the 2008-09 work programme and fee scales at its meeting in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/5" class="indent">In summary, audit fees will increase from 2008-09 onwards, reflecting a number of changes that will directly increase the amount of work that auditors will need to do, and therefore the costs of the audit. Some of these are externally driven, such as the Government's requirement that the public sector adopts International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the international accountancy profession's tightening of audit standards.</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/6" class="indent">However, we have also expanded the scope of auditors' use of resources assessments, which will form a key part of the new Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) framework, to include commissioning and sustainable procurement, and strengthened the focus on efficiency, in line with the Government's expectations. The extra work is likely to increase audit fees. But auditors will look to substitute this additional work for existing audit work wherever possible. Any increases in audit fees will be more than offset by an overall reduction in the total costs of regulation over the next three years, as CAA replaces the current Comprehensive Performance Assessment</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/7" class="indent">We are also able to reduce the impact by a rigorous programme of efficiency savings, which will release 3 per cent. savings annually over the next three years. The Commission will continue to look for other opportunities to reduce the cost of our work to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/8" class="indent">I trust that this information is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="f.1299W.3/9" class="indent">A copy of this letter will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

The Secretary of State has already identified a range of possible priorities for this funding including: peer mentoring; youth support networks; leadership programmes; arts and culture; and media and sport. We will open discussions with youth organisations and young people in order to involve them in developing funding priorities and processes which reflect their perceptions of the issue of violent extremism. Processes to assess the effectiveness of the funding will be developed as part of the work to develop funding plans and specific proposals.</p>

There are many services and activities undertaken by local government, alone or in partnership, which are not directly reflected in the set but which will continue to be important to local areas and the people they serve as well as to business.

	<p pid="f.1309W.2/1">In 2004-2007, the Equality and Diversity Unit (EDU) recorded staff costs of &pound;1,951,549 and non-pay spend of &pound;989,022. The EDU was responsible for internal equality policy delivery.</p>
	<p pid="f.1309W.2/2">In July 2007, the EDU transferred to the Race Equality Unit taking seven posts, a pay budget of &pound;319,000 and a non-pay budget of &pound;16,000. The newly formed Race Equality and Diversity Division has a forecast outturn in 2007-2008 of &pound;1,951,549 pay costs (average 34.8 FTE posts) and &pound;989,202 non-pay costs. Due to machinery of Government changes it is difficult for the Department to provide more detail.</p>
	<p pid="f.1309W.2/3">One HEO maintained the workforce equalities taskforce at a cost of &pound;21,286, from July 2006 until the creation of the workforce equalities team in October 2006. These units were established to mainstream equality and diversity within Communities. The workforce equalities team now comprises two HEOs, one full-time and one working 32 hours per week. The Grade 7 team leader post is currently vacant, but assuming the post is filled on a full-time basis the costs for the team would total &pound;74,559 annually.</p>
	<p pid="f.1309W.2/4">The workforce equalities team has an annual allocation of &pound;20,000, of which &pound;8,000 is allocated to the Department's various staff networks. This leaves &pound;12,000 to be spent directly on mainstreaming equality and diversity within Communities.</p>
	<p pid="f.1309W.2/5">Like other Government Departments and as part of its commitment to ensuring good practice, Communities also pays for membership of various organisations for benchmarking purposes (e.g. Stonewall, Employers Forum on Disability) costing approximately &pound;13,100 annually.</p>

	<p pid="f.1310W.5/26" class="indent">Staff below the SCS receiving an overall 'exceeded' marking in their performance reports receive a one-off lump sum that is not pensionable or consolidated into basic salary. For the 2005-06 pay award the amounts varied from &pound;350 to &pound;1,200.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/27" class="italic"> 3. Special bonus scheme</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/28" class="indent">Staff below the SCS are also eligible to receive a special bonus to reward exceptional performance over a limited period in particularly demanding tasks or situations. Although awards are paid on an individual basis, line managers are able to make a number of awards to reward exceptional team effort&mdash;a 'team award'. Awards can be made at any time of the year and, ideally, should be paid as soon as possible after completion of the tasks to which they relate. These bonuses are not consolidated into basic salary or pensionable. Awards may be of any value up to a normal maximum of &pound;600. The award of any sum greater than &pound;600 is considered only very exceptionally.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/29">There are five different civil service pension schemes in operation at all levels in Communities and Local Government at this time: classic, classic plus, nuvos, partnership and premium schemes. The pension scheme rules are determined by the Cabinet Office. Full information on the aforementioned schemes can be obtained from the civil service pensions website:</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/30" class="indent"><a href="http://www.civilservice-pensions.gov.uk/">http://www.civilservice-pensions.gov.uk/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/31">In addition to the aforementioned schemes, civil servants including those who are not able to join one of the above schemes, may also contribute to a Stakeholder pension with Standard Life, subject to eligibility. The civil service does not make any contributions to this scheme but contributions by individuals may be made through payroll.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/32">Employees are entitled to the following expenses:</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/33" class="indent">(a) expenses when they travel on official business within the UK away from their normal workplace;</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/34" class="indent">(b) expenses when they travel on official business overseas;</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/35" class="indent">(c) certain expenses that might be payable, if the employee is offered and agrees to a permanent transfer at public expense;</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/36" class="indent">(d) certain expenses that might be payable if the employee agrees to work away from the normal workplace on detached duty; and</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/37" class="indent">(e) the reimbursement of excess fares arising from a permanent transfer at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/38">Expenses must be actually and necessarily incurred and must be supported by receipts. The submission of a claim knowingly containing false or inaccurate information may constitute a disciplinary offence and may lead to disciplinary action. The full detail of the expenses policy is set out in the staff handbook.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/39">The total expenses incurred for each salary band for each of the past 10 years can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="f.1310W.5/40">For each pay band the average age, numbers of men and women, and ethnic composition are given in the following table. In order to avoid disclosing confidential information about individual staff members we have grouped together certain salary bands.</p>

The service is provided by and managed by our telephony contractor, Siemens, who employ six agents to answer general inquiries. The contract has been in existence since October 2004 with the number of staff remaining the same. All calls are handled via a queuing system and are either responded to directly (if the information is available on their database) or transferred to a policy official. The service does not collect personal information and the only monitoring relates to statistical information on the performance of call handling activity.

	<p pid="f.1327W.5/1">Sustained economic growth and stability since 1997 have created the conditions for a growth in home ownership, with a million more home owners over the last 10 years. The Housing Green Paper, &quot;Homes for the Future: more affordable, more sustainable&quot; (CM 7191), published in July, set out the Government's assessment of progress on housing, together with plans to address the housing challenges the country faces.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.5/2">We have recently published the Housing and Regeneration Bill, which will help deliver the commitments set out in the Housing Green Paper to deliver more and greener homes, in mixed and sustainable communities. The Bill also establishes the new Homes and Communities Agency which will focus on delivering more new and affordable homes across all tenures and will drive and invest in regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="f.1327W.8/20">Estimates for each year are not available because of small sample sizes.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/21">The benchmark for assessing whether or not a household is overcrowded is the bedroom standard. This is determined for each household in accordance with its age/sex/marital status composition and the relationship of the members to one another. A separate bedroom is required:</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/22" class="indent">for each married or cohabiting couple;</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/23" class="indent">for any other person aged 21 or over;</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/24" class="indent">for each pair of adolescents aged 10-20 of the same sex and</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/25" class="indent">for each pair of children under 10.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/26">Further, any unpaired person aged 10-20 is paired, if possible with a child under 10 of the same sex, or, if that is not possible, he or she is counted as requiring a separate bedroom, as is any unpaired child under 10.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/27">This standard is then compared with the actual number of bedrooms (including bed-sitters) available for the sole use of the household. Bedrooms converted to other uses are not counted as available unless they have been denoted as bedrooms by the residents. Bedrooms not actually in use are counted unless uninhabitable.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/28">If a household has fewer bedrooms than implied by the standard then it is deemed to be 'overcrowded'. Since one bedroom will be sufficient for single person households and for married/cohabiting couples, these households cannot be overcrowded according to the bedroom standard. If a household has two or more bedrooms, fewer than implied by the standard, then it is deemed to be 'severely overcrowded'.</p>
	<p pid="f.1327W.8/29">On <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Housing announced an additional &pound;15 million funding for overcrowding and launched an action plan setting out the Government's commitment to tackling overcrowding&mdash;copies have been placed in the Library of the House. We have already announced an increase in the provision of new social housing including a year-on-year increase in the number of family homes, namely those with three or more bedrooms.</p>

A measure of how sparsely the population is distributed in an area is included in the Local Authority Central Education Functions Relative Needs Formula (RNF), the Social Services for Older People RNF, the Police RNF and the district-level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services RNF. We then ensure that no authority loses grant year-on-year on a like-for-like basis i.e. after adjusting for changes in funding and function. In order to pay for the cost of the floor, we scale back the increase above the floor for other authorities.</p>

No previously available rights have been withdrawn as a result of this. An increase in licence royalties will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>, alongside a programme to make access to the licence easier, by allowing third party intermediaries to issue the licence and receive a fee for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="f.1338W.5/2">Ordnance Survey undertakes regular reviews of all of its licence terms and conditions and charges. These reviews include routine assessments of the need for adjustments to licence terms and conditions, to maintain clarity for users and between licences intended for different purposes. The reviews take account of changes in market conditions, technology and the ways in which Ordnance Survey information is used. The assessments consider the balance between Ordnance Survey's financial obligations as a government trading fund and the impact of changes upon different types of user.</p>

	<p pid="f.1340W.11/1">Under the terms of the Planning Bill, the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) will take over the powers currently held by the Secretary of State, where a nationally significant infrastructure project would propose to use green belt land. The IPC would only be able to use these powers where this is in accordance with the national policy statement, which would set out (among other matters) how the Secretary of State believes applications referring to green belt land should be treated. Clause 125 of the Planning Bill makes clear that where an order granting development consent allows the acquisition or sale of green belt land, or frees it from any restrictions imposed on it under the Green Belt Act 1938, the IPC must notify all relevant local authorities and the Secretary of State.</p>

We will be consulting in the new year on how these proposals are to be implemented.</p>

Government policy is that open space standards, including standards for public green space as well as other types of open space, should be set locally since prescriptive national standards cannot cater for local circumstances such as differing demographic profiles and the extent of existing built development in an area. Local planning authorities should therefore undertake robust assessments of the existing and future needs of their communities for all forms of open space, sports and recreational facilities and audits of their existing open space and facilities. These can then be used to set appropriate local standards in development plans. Guidance on undertaking assessments and audits and deriving local standards is set out in &quot;Assessing Needs and Opportunities: A Companion Guide to PPG17&quot;, published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2002.</p>

	<p pid="f.1353W.9/1">We are very concerned about the continuing security and humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic and Chad. In response the UK co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), which authorises the deployment of a European security and defence police force and a UN multidimensional mission to Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic. The overall aim of the joint operation is to create the conditions necessary for voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. The mission is planned to deploy in early 2008.</p>

Its aim is to assist the government of the Central African Republic in consolidating peace and national reconciliation and strengthening democratic institutions. In addition, the UK supports the multinational force of Central Africa which has bases in the north-west of the Central African Republic and whose mandate is to contribute to the restoration of peace and security in the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p pid="f.1353W.9/3">In the medium term, a national security seminar on the Central African Republic, organised by the government of the Central African Republic and the UN Development Programme, is due to be held in March 2008. We hope this will set out a road-map for security sector reform, including of the police, army and prisons. The EU will then play an important role in co-ordinating the agreed reforms.</p>

	<p pid="f.1358W.6/1">The ability of Palestinians to move within the west bank has deteriorated due to continued or increased use of: checkpoints; curfews; roadblocks; a permit system; and the barrier. Permit and checkpoint restrictions have isolated residents of the west bank from East Jerusalem and from each other. In September 2007, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 563 obstacles were present in the west bank.</p>

	<p pid="f.1359W.2/1">We are aware of reports of human rights abuses in Papua, but the isolated nature of some areas of Papua makes it difficult to establish a clear picture. However, we investigate any credible reports of human rights abuses in Papua. Our Embassy in Jakarta regularly discusses human rights issues, including in Papua, with the Indonesian government.</p>
	<p pid="f.1359W.2/2">We encourage the Indonesian Government to allow access to Papua for the media. We were therefore pleased that the BBC correspondent based in Jakarta was given permission to visit Papua in September this year. We will continue to press the authorities to permit other journalists to visit. We recognise that, overall, Indonesia has a flourishing free media and an increasingly liberal and plural political environment.</p>
	<p pid="f.1359W.2/3">We have a general concern about corruption in Indonesia, particularly in the judiciary. The Indonesian government is committed to addressing the issue and has made some progress in tackling the problem. In December 2003, it established the Corruption Eradication Commission to investigate and tackle corruption past and present. We continue to work with the Indonesian government in order to promote good governance.</p>

	<p pid="f.1359W.5/1">For reconstruction to follow peacekeeping, UN peace support operations need to be more integrated. UN bodies and other international agencies need to work towards common strategic interests and behind a common operations plan. The Peacebuilding Commission was established in 2005 as an advisory body to direct this integrated approach. The UK plays a key role in it. The international community also needs to have the right capabilities at its disposal and the procedure and funding in place to be able to deploy them quickly. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister proposed as a starting point that UN Security Council Resolutions should not just mandate and direct the peacekeeping response to a given conflict, but also the longer term peace-building effort. He also proposed enhancing international capacity through a standby mechanism to deploy civilian reconstruction experts quickly.</p>

	<p pid="f.1360W.2/2">The review was completed in mid 2005 and suggested a number of ways in which the industry could be regulated. The review also highlighted complex issues, particularly round the definition of what activities should be regulated and how any regulations would be enforced. These issues, along with the options for regulation, continue to be the subject of ministerial correspondence and official consultation. The Government have undertaken to keep Parliament fully informed of its proposals in this area. If it is agreed that regulation is appropriate, the Government will put the proposals to public consultation.</p>

	<p pid="f.1368W.5/1">Since the publication of the 'Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England' (2004), a copy of which is available in the Library, significant progress has been made: of the 41 actions in the 2004 strategy, 26 have been delivered and a further 14 are under way. For example, an agreement between the Government and the alcohol industry to include unit content and daily guidelines advice on alcohol labels was announced in May 2007. In addition, levels of alcohol-related violent crime and offences and sales of alcohol to under-age drinkers have fallen.</p>
	<p pid="f.1368W.5/2">In June 2007 the Government introduced a renewed alcohol strategy 'Safe, Sensible, Social', a copy of which is available in the Library, that included a summary review of the 2004 alcohol harm reduction strategy (Annex C). 'Safe, Sensible, Social' is a comprehensive strategy to tackle the health and social effects of harmful drinking across the board and focuses on 18 to 24-year-old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol and adult harmful drinkers.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-12-18f.173113.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-12-18f.1371W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="1371W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/text/71218w0031.htm#07121988004574">
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/1">An article will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) bulletin Drug Safety Update in early January, which will remind prescribers that it is important to assign adverse drug reactions to a specific named product when reporting adverse reactions associated with biosimilar medicines. The European guidelines for marketing authorisation holders&mdash;Volume 9A of &quot;The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use&quot; is currently being updated to include the following text in relation to reporting of adverse reactions to biosimilar products:</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;For adverse reaction reports relating to biological products, the definite identification of the product with regard to its manufacturing is of particular importance. Therefore, Marketing Authorisation Holders should give advice to reporters to provide the (invented) name of the medicinal product and the batch number and should follow up the reports where this information is missing for completion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/3">A similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) is one that is claimed to be similar to a reference biological medicinal product authorised in the European Union (EU). Because biosimilar medicines are not identical copies of reference products, subtle differences may exist which may make a difference to their effect or side effects when taken by patients. It is preferable, therefore, that when such products are prescribed they should be clearly identified and prescribed by brand name to ensure that patients receive the exact product prescribed and that their safety in use can be properly monitored.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/4">The MHRA encourages companies who manufacture generic copies of biopharmaceutical products (known as &quot;biosimilar products&quot;) to give them a brand name so that there is no possibility that the pharmacist can substitute another biosimilar product when dispensing the doctor's prescription.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/5">MHRA has not issued a specific guideline to clinicians on substitution. All medicines, including biological medicines, should be prescribed by clinicians in accordance with the approved advice provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics which provides full information about the product, including its side effects and its use.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/6">The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain's Professional standards and guidance for the sale and supply of medicines provides advice to pharmacists on switching from innovator biological medicines to biosimilar medicines and states that, except in an emergency, a specifically named product should not be substituted by any other product without the approval of the patient or carer and the prescriber, and in the case of hospital drugs, the approval of the therapeutics committee, or in line with other similar locally agreed protocols.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/7">All new medicines carry a black triangle symbol when they are first marketed in the United Kingdom. This denotes that the product is under intensive surveillance and this period usually lasts for two years in the first instance. All biosimilar products should also have in place at the time of licensing a full Risk Management Plan which describes what is known about the safety of a product and describes the activities required on behalf of the company to ensure that relevant safety information is collected in the post marketing period.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/8">The British National Formulary (BNF) includes biotechnology medicines that are licensed in the UK. The BNF usually reflects the safety information contained within the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) that relates to the product. Biosimilar products will be designated &quot;Black Triangle&quot; medicines and will carry the black triangle symbol in the BNF.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/9">The information contained in the BNF about a product can be different from information in the SPC when it is supported by reliable clinical evidence. The BNF takes advice on the information to include from expert clinical advisers and the BNF Joint Formulary Committee.</p>
	<p pid="f.1371W.5/10">All biosimilar products are assessed for safety, and the safety data are compared with that of the innovator biological medicinal product to which similarity is claimed, prior to its authorisation. It is also mandatory for the applicant to submit an appropriate risk management plan at the time of initial marketing authorisation application, which is assessed to ensure that it demonstrates that adequate arrangements are made for continued safety evaluation.</p>

	<p pid="f.1382W.5/1">Food Standards Agency (FSA) met with the Health Food Manufacturers' Association in August. The FSA met with the Commission on 12 Sept and also held a stakeholder event to discuss the orientation paper on <phrase class="date" code="">14 September</phrase> in advance of the first Commission working group meeting with member states which took place on <phrase class="date" code="">24 September</phrase>. Such proactive stakeholder engagement will continue. FSA gave advice to Ministers in connection with the CHC reception held in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="f.1382W.5/2">Good progress has been made in promoting work carried out in the United Kingdom in establishing upper levels for vitamins and minerals and reference has been made to this in an orientation paper on setting maximum levels which was the starting point for Commission working group discussions which began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-24">24 September 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="f.1382W.5/3">We have been advised by the FSA that general discussions on the orientation paper in the working group revealed that while member states support the broad objective of setting of maximum levels on the basis of safety and science, many are yet to establish views on a range of issues and as such are not in a position to support any specific approach at such an early stage in the discussions.</p>
	<p pid="f.1382W.5/4">Ministerial responsibility for matters relating to food supplements, including the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals in these products, rests with me.

	<p pid="f.1384W.2/2">In 2007-08 the Wakefield partnership identified &pound;84,400 from the local authority contribution to the pooled budget for residential rehabilitation. This ring fenced pot is accessed by the partnership on an individual needs basis.</p>
	<p pid="f.1384W.2/3">As the Wakefield partnership covers all localities within the Wakefield area there is no separate allocation for the Hemsworth constituency. As all client applications to residential rehabilitation are based on need, it would be inappropriate to divide the funding to each suburb of the partnership.</p>
	<p pid="f.1384W.2/4">Partnership areas send their annual treatment plans to the National Treatment Agency regional teams for consideration. Drawing on data from the planning grids of the partnership treatment plans for 2007-08, the amount budgeted by 142 drug action teams (DATs) to spend on residential rehabilitation and in-patient services was &pound;84.1 million. However there were seven DAT partnerships that had not provided a figure in their treatment plans, thus the true national total may be higher than this.</p>

	<p pid="f.1385W.8/1">All food imported into the United Kingdom from third countries, or in free circulation within the European Union (EU), must comply with relevant EU legislation. Official controls on food, including genetically modified food, imported from third countries are carried out by port health authorities and local authorities at points of entry into the UK. The collection of specific data on the quantity of imported food containing genetically modified ingredients is not a legal requirement under EU official controls legislation and such data are not collected for other purposes.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.8/2">GM food is regulated in the EU under Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 (GM Food and Feed Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No. 1830/2003 (Traceability and Labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)). GM food may only be marketed in the EU if it has been authorised following a process which involves a rigorous safety assessment. GMOs which have not been authorised for use in the EU are prohibited.</p>
	<p pid="f.1385W.8/3">Food which contains, consists of, or has been produced from authorised GMOs has to be labelled as such regardless of the presence of detectable novel genetic material in the final product, or the quantity of intentionally used GM ingredient present. Labelling does not apply to foods which contain authorised GM material of 0.9 per cent. or less, provided that this presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable.</p>

	<p pid="f.1391W.2/1">In 2000, the Department issued &quot;No Secrets&mdash; guidance on developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse&quot;. Under the guidance, local authorities are allocated the lead and co-ordination responsibility in local safeguarding situations. The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) established a protocol with the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the Association of Chief Police Officers to clarify the role of key agencies collaborating in multi-agency safeguarding procedures.

	<p pid="f.1391W.2/3">While CSCI will aim to co-ordinate any regulatory action with the police or commissioners of the service, the need to give primary consideration to its own statutory responsibilities follows the key principle which emerged from the 'Longacre' inquiry. This was that while working in partnership with other agencies, CSCI will not suspend its own statutory enforcement responsibilities pending the outcome of another (e.g. criminal) process where to do so would run counter to the safety and well-being of the people who use the service. In such circumstances, CSCI will aim wherever possible to coordinate actions in order to preserve evidence and avoid impeding each other's investigations or enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="f.1392W.2/3">The NBS recognises the need to increase blood collection and has put in place a number of initiatives, such as increased marketing activity to current and potential blood donors and the introduction of an appointments system for donors.</p>
	<p pid="f.1392W.2/4">However fewer people are giving blood regularly, a trend that the NBS is working to reverse.</p>

	<p pid="f.1393W.2/1">The relevant European Union (EU) legislation requires that packaging and leaflets include information on the qualitative composition for active substances and excipients and the quantitative composition for active substances, the pharmaceutical form and content of the active drug substance in weight, volume or units of dosage, the name and address of the manufacturer, the name and address of the marketing authorisation holder and, where applicable, the name of his appointed representatives in the member states.</p>

European legislation does not exclude extrapolation of evidence based on the biosimilar product.

Therefore the type and amount of additional data to be provided shall be determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="f.1393W.2/5">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has not issued a specific guideline to clinicians on substitution.

	<p pid="f.1393W.2/6">The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain's Professional standards and guidance for the sale and supply of medicines provides advice to pharmacists on switching from innovator biological medicines to biosimilar medicines and states that except in an emergency, a specifically named product should not be substituted by any other product without the approval of the patient or carer and the prescriber, and in the case of hospital drugs, the approval of the therapeutics committee, or in line with other similar locally agreed protocols.</p>
	<p pid="f.1393W.2/7">To date there are five biosimilar medicinal products approved for use in the EU. This includes two preparations of the recombinant growth hormone, somatropin, namely Omnitrope and Valtropin and three preparations of epoetin alfa; Abseamed, Binocrit, and Epoetin alfa Hexal.</p>

	<p pid="f.1403W.0/1">The production and labelling of meat products are regulated in law. European legislation places no limit on the addition of proteins of animal or vegetable origin. If proteins are added to chicken breast products they must be correctly described on the label so as not to mislead consumers.</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/2">Added water is calculated using methodology agreed at European level. The method was developed to take account of the addition of hydrolysed collagen protein and works well for the type of product that it was developed for. The need for further methodological development is kept under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has urged the European Commission to take action on the use of hydrolysed proteins from different animal species in poultry products, including in chicken breast products. The European Commission responded with a number of actions, including:</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/4" class="indent">a review of legal requirements, emphasising to member states that the practice of adding proteins to poultry products is legal, but that without proper labelling it would be fraudulent. The conclusion was that the legislation was adequate;</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/5" class="indent">a European Food and Veterinary Office mission to assess poultry meat production including the use of water retention agents such as proteins. This mission covered both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands;</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/6" class="indent">the inclusion of an assessment of the use of water retention agents in a European Coordinated Programme for the Official Control of Food Stuffs.</p>
	<p pid="f.1403W.0/7">In relation to assistance from the Government of the Netherlands, adverse sampling and testing results on imported frozen chicken breasts with added water and protein from the Netherlands have been forwarded by the FSA during 2007 to the Dutch enforcement authorities. The Dutch authorities have taken action against the relevant company.</p>

We understand that it is difficult to obtain accurate data as it is a subjective judgment as to whether alcohol is the cause of an accident or injury. However, research into violence related accident and emergency admissions last year concluded there had been a 2 per cent. drop and that licensing reform had not led to increases in violent crime in the night time economy.</p>

Contours are generated by a computer model validated against actual noise measurements in line with latest internationally recommended guidance.</p>
	<p pid="f.1428W.11/2">Future predictions, such as the contours for various possible scenarios in the Adding Capacity at Heathrow airport consultation, rely on assumptions about the likely fleet mix and are therefore necessarily indicative. I am nevertheless satisfied that ERCD's noise modelling, whether historical or prospective, is reliable and robust.</p>

These include encouraging local authorities who are responsible for the roads on which most cycling takes place to develop local cycling strategies and improved cycle networks through increased Local Transport Plan settlements. Local authorities outside London increased their spend on cycling, from &pound;29.5 million in 2001-02 to &pound;36 million in 2005-06. A report for Cycling England in 2004 showed over 80 per cent. of local authorities had improved their performance in providing facilities for cyclists.</p>

	<p pid="f.1430W.8/5">Employers also have a part to pay in encouraging their staff to cycle to work. Secure cycle parking, showers and changing facilities can support Government initiatives such as the group consumer credit licence we have made available to all UK businesses to enable employers to purchase cycles for their employees to cycle to work and take advantage of tax savings. Around 70,000 people are already participating in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="f.1434W.8/3">These include enabling powers to require serious, including repeat, offenders to retake the driving test at the end of their period of disqualification; to improve the operation of the drink drive rehabilitation scheme; to close certain loopholes in the law relating to high risk offenders; and to establish a statutory alcohol ignition interlock programme.</p>
	<p pid="f.1434W.8/4">We have recently launched the THINK! 2007 Christmas drink drive publicity campaign which is running in parallel with the seasonal police enforcement campaign.

	<p pid="f.1441W.2/1">A decision not to allow Stagecoach South Western Trains (SSWT) rail services to make use of Waterloo International terminal has not been made.</p>
	<p pid="f.1441W.2/2">It is primarily the railway infrastructure outside Waterloo that limits the number of trains that can use the station rather than the number of platforms. Therefore the need is to run longer trains rather than more trains. So we are planning a large scheme to make all the platforms long enough to accommodate 10 and 12 car trains and to modify the junction layout on the approaches to the station. Such a scheme would allow the use of up to 50 per cent. longer trains than currently use the short platforms and would result in a large increase in capacity. The scheme also presents opportunities at Waterloo International to reconfigure the passenger circulation space and the interchange with other transport modes, and to better integrate the station into the surrounding area. Such an ambitious scheme requires very detailed planning to make the most of this unique opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="f.1441W.2/3">In order to make the best use of the facility in the meantime, the Department is working closely with Network Rail and SSWT to finalise the design and costs of the partial conversion of Waterloo International to accommodate some domestic services. Therefore some services could use platform 20 of Waterloo International from the timetable change date in December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="f.1442W.0/1">The Department for Transport's aim is transport that works for everyone. It is committed to understanding the transport needs of all social groups and has a wide-ranging programme of work to support this.</p>
	<p pid="f.1442W.0/2">In June 2007, the Department published an evidence-based review on mobility, which looked at travel choices, behaviour and attitudes, as well as barriers to travel and measures to overcome barriers for different social groups, including children and young people, adults on low income, those living in rural areas, black and minority ethnic groups, women, disabled people and older people.</p>
	<p pid="f.1442W.0/3">In November 2007, the Department also published two research reports looking at travel needs, behaviours and aspirations of older people and young adults.</p>
	<p pid="f.1442W.0/4">These reports can be found on the Department for Transport's website.</p>

However, the most recent assessment by the Defence Medical Services of the number of military in-patients being treated at UK NHS hospitals on a particular day (<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>) showed that there were 23 service in-patients being treated in NHS hospitals hosting Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs), and 19 in-patients being treated under the auspices of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) at Birmingham hospitals. A small number of military in-patients will also have been treated at other NHS hospitals. The precise number in this category on a particular day is not recorded centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. We assess from earlier data collection that around a further 15 to 25 service personnel are treated as in-patients in NHS hospitals on a typical day, in addition to those in the hospitals hosting the RCDM and MDHUs.</p>

	<p pid="f.1448W.0/1">The MOD has discussed pandemic influenza planning with officials from NATO and the United States Administration but no central record of the number of occasions was kept.</p>
	<p pid="f.1448W.0/2">The MOD has regular meetings with Department of Health and Health Protection Agency (HPA) officials. An MOD Consultant Public Health Physician is a standing member of the HPA Influenza and Respiratory Programme Board, which meets monthly to discuss influenza pandemic issues such as the latest research, exercises, port health, vaccines, anti-virals and developments.</p>
	<p pid="f.1448W.0/3">In addition, UK National preparations are being co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS), whose role is to ensure that the UK is resilient in the event of a disruptive challenge such as pandemic flu. Cross-departmental pandemic flu planning has been under way since early-2005 through the MISC 32 Flu Working Group (FWG) which a representative from the MOD attends. At the last meeting of this group on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December 2007</phrase>, the 23<sup>(rd)</sup> to be held, its name was changed to the Pandemic Flu Implementation Group (PFIG) to signify a step change in its work programme from policy development to policy implementation. Additionally, in the last two years there have been two cross-government pandemic flu exercises; 'Shared Goal'(held in 2006) and 'Winter Willow' (held during January and February this year). The Department was involved in both exercises as part of the central Government response, providing development assistance, personnel to man the COBR cell and Min(AF) representing the MOD at the ministerial Civil Contingencies Committee. In the case of Winter Willow, MOD additionally participated through Joint Regional Liaison Officers (JRLOs) engagement in regional exercise play.</p>

	<p pid="f.1450W.2/1">The Department does not have a specific budget ceiling for telephone allowances. Each eligible Service person is entitled to 30 minutes of publicly funded call time per week. The cost of this call time will vary according to whether the call is made on a cabin satellite telephone, an IRIDIUM satellite telephone, an INMARSAT telephone or by one of several other means and whether the call is made to a UK landline, mobile telephone or to an overseas destination. The amount paid will also vary dependent upon the amount of the allowance personnel use. Moreover, whilst telephone allowances for exercises and enduring tasks such as the Falkland Islands are paid for by the Department, the cost of the telephone allowance for personnel deployed on contingent operations, e.g. Iraq and Afghanistan, is met by HM Treasury and is not paid from the Ministry of Defence budget. For illustrative purposes only, the average amount paid to the welfare communications contractor for the second half of Financial Year 2006-2007, after the allowance had increased to 30 minutes, was &pound;504,000 per month. This would equate to some &pound;6 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="f.1451W.5/2">These surveys and focus groups, which have been running in various forms for decades, can look at everything from attitudes about Service life to surveys that investigate physical and psychological health.

	<p pid="f.1454W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence policy on recycling is fully aligned with the overall objective of Government policy on waste to protect human health and the environment by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever possible. Our sustainable approach to waste management involves reduction, re-use and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="f.1454W.2/2">The Department's policy is that non-hazardous waste products&mdash;especially those from offices&mdash;should be recycled. This includes, for example, paper, glass, aluminium cans, fluorescent tubes, printer cartridges, and toners. Where suitable recycling infrastructure exists, waste metals, oils, building rubble and similar waste streams should also be consigned to recycling.</p>
	<p pid="f.1454W.2/3">MOD policy is that all procurement decisions should take into account the maximum potential for recycling of procured items, and the maximum use of products based on recycled materials. Use of recycled materials should be considered if they are fit for purpose, meet technical specification requirements and cost the same or less than new products.</p>
	<p pid="f.1454W.2/4">More information on MODs policy on waste management can be found in Joint Service Publication (JSP) 418, the MOD Sustainable Development and Environment Manual, a copy of which can be found in the Library of the House. In addition, MOD has published a Sustainable Waste Management Strategy, which can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="f.1459W.2/1">Chest seals are supplied in Team Medic Packs, which are issued from a central pool for both theatres. These are issued to personnel who have been trained to fulfil an extended first aid role within the unit only. The number of packs issued to a unit will depend on the operational context at any given time. There have been no shortages in fulfilling operational demands for chest seals.</p>
	<p pid="f.1459W.2/2">It is possible to provide data on the numbers issued from 2006 only when new information management structures were introduced in theatre. Quantities of chest seals issued to the supply sections of the respective theatres are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="f.1459W.2/5"> <td></td> <td><i> Operation Telic</i></td> <td><i> Operation Herrick</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="f.1459W.2/10">The increase in numbers does not correlate with usage and does not reflect a rise in the number of chest wounds within operational theatres as un-used chest seals can be reissued to incoming units and replacement is required when the packaging, is damaged. Additionally, the introduction of the Team Medic, a combat soldier who has been identified, trained and equipped to take charge of the treatment and evacuation of casualties, has also contributed to the increase in numbers.</p>

	<p pid="f.1468W.9/1">Some of the gas and most of the oil produced on the UK Continental Shelf is exported rather than being consumed domestically, so the gross volume of imports is not equivalent to total UK consumption minus total UK production. The Department does not estimate the gross volume of imports of oil or gas expected in future years.</p>
	<p pid="f.1468W.9/2">Projections of future net imports can be derived by subtracting projected UK Continental Shelf production from projected UK demand, although projections of the latter have been made for only the years 2010, 2015 and 2020. These are available in Annex J to the paper on Updated Energy and Carbon Emissions Projections published alongside the May 2007 Energy White Paper at:</p>
	<p pid="f.1468W.9/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/page39534.html">http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/page39534.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="f.1468W.9/4">Based on the published projections, net imports of oil in 2010 would be 176 million barrels; in 2015, 301 million barrels; and in 2020, 392 million barrels. The average price for oil so far in 2007 is $72/barrel, about &pound;36/barrel. If net imports in future years were bought at that price, the cost would therefore be about &pound;6.4 billion in 2010; &pound;10.9 billion in 2015; and &pound;14.1 billion in 2020.</p>
	<p pid="f.1468W.9/5">For gas, net imports in 2010 would be about 36 billion cubic metres (bcm); in 2015, 68 bcm; and in 2020,79 bcm. The average wholesale spot price for gas so far in 2007 is 30p/therm, equivalent to about &pound;109 million/bcm. Thus, if imports in future years were bought at 2007 prices, the cost would be about &pound;3.9 billion in 2010; &pound;7.4 billion in 2015; and &pound;8.6 billion in 2020.</p>

It is an independent body that was established by the six major gas and electricity suppliers following an investigation by Ofgem into suppliers' billing practices. It investigates billing and transfer complaints made by domestic customers who have been unable to resolve the matter with their supplier. Under the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, redress arrangements will be put on a statutory basis, and will apply to all suppliers. The Government recently consulted on the scope of these new arrangements, including proposals to provide small businesses with access to the schemes.

	<p pid="f.1473W.2/1">In preparing the Government's response to the national public consultation on the post office network, discussions were held with Post Office Ltd. about the overall timetable for the network change programme. It was the company's view that implementation of the changes was deliverable by the end of 2008 and the Government response confirmed that the aim was to complete the programme within that period. In July, Post Office Ltd. published an indicative timetable for local consultations on their area plan proposals to complete the programme by the end of 2008. In finalising their timetable for local consultations for post office closures and new outreach services, Post Office Ltd. were asked to take into account Cabinet Office guidelines regarding election periods. These clearly state that consultations should not be launched, and decisions relating to them announced, in a local election period. Successive administrations of both parties have observed these arrangements for many years. The aim remains to complete the network change programme by the end of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="f.1475W.5/5">In July 2006 the independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) reported to Government its recommendations for the long term management of higher activity radioactive waste. In October 2006 Government accepted the primary recommendations of geological disposal coupled with robust, safe and secure interim storage until such time as a geological disposal facility is available. Government also confirmed they wished to explore a site selection approach for this facility based on the concept of voluntarism, as recommended by CoRWM. Government recently held a public consultation on the framework for implementing geological disposal and will report their findings shortly, with a White Paper anticipated in the new year to set out the way forward for the implementation process designed to deliver a geological disposal facility and ensure interim storage remains safe and secure in the meantime.</p>

Membership subscriptions paid on behalf of minors by their parents or legal guardians can be regarded as qualifying donations providing the usual Gift Aid conditions are met. There is no scope within the existing legislation to extend this treatment. The Government continue to look at ways of building on the success of the Gift Aid scheme and increasing donations to charity, and is currently considering responses to the recent consultation on Gift Aid to this end.</p>

	<p pid="f.1493W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of young people in each parliamentary constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber were unemployed in each year since 1997. (174297)</p>
	<p pid="f.1493W.0/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of unemployment for local areas from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="f.1493W.0/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows estimates for each Parliamentary Constituency in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, for the 12 month periods ending in February from 1998 to 2004 from the annual LFS, and for the 12 months from March 2005 to March 2007 from the APS. Table 1 shows the number of unemployed aged 16-24 resident in each constituency.</p>
	<p pid="f.1493W.0/6" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Changes in the estimates from year to year should be treated with particular caution.</p>
	<p pid="f.1493W.0/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA).

	<p pid="f.1501W.2/1">In cases where a household has broken down, both customers remain jointly and severally liable in law for any outstanding overpayment.</p>
	<p pid="f.1501W.2/2">However, the law also allows HM Revenue and Customs to exercise discretion over how much of any overpayment it seeks to recover. In cases where a couple have separated, HMRC will consider carefully how much it should seek to recover from each of the parties, while still recognising that it has the legal authority to collect back the full amount from either of the parties and a duty to protect the public finances.</p>
