This is a sector average which is adjusted for each institution to take into account the following factors: subject of study, qualifications on entry and age on entry. The benchmarks can be used to show how a university is performing compared to the sector as a whole, and also help to determine whether a meaningful comparison can be drawn between two or more universities.</p>

	<p pid="c.960W.2/1">Train to Gain is a service specifically designed to give employers access to the advice and support they need to help them identify and then meet the skills their businesses need to succeed. It was launched in April 2006. Up until November 2007, the latest period for which figures are available, the Train to Gain service reports that 317,010 people have started a programme of learning and 153,300 have thus far successfully completed their learning activity, including over 131,00 full level 2s. However it would be misleading to simply use these output measures to calculate a percentage or success rate because many learners are still working to complete their course and new people are starting learning programmes through Train to Gain every day. DIUS and LSC officials are working to establish a sound methodology to enable a true success rate to be derived once sufficient data has been collected. This will be published as soon as it becomes available.</p>

All work is carried out under contracts. These are grouped as: lump sum contracts; consultants' commission contracts; term contracts; and jobbing contracts. Lump sum contracts are let with the main contractor for a specific project. Consultants' commissions may be let for a specific project, though it is more likely that a consultant from a framework agreement would be used. Framework agreements can be let for any of the types on contract mentioned and have been let so far mainly for consultancies such as project management, architecture, engineering and quantity surveying. Special term contracts are let for planned maintenance such as lifts or grounds maintenance. Measured term contracts are let for carrying out small electrical, mechanical or building works. Jobbing contracts are used for one-off small works.</p>

	<p pid="c.966W.6/1">The Government of Afghanistan leads on coordinating and implementing counter-narcotics strategy in Afghanistan. The UK, as Afghanistan's G8 partner nation on counter narcotics, works extremely closely with the Afghan Government on its counter-narcotics policy. Our embassy in Kabul's counter narcotics team conducts capacity-building work within the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics and helps implement the Afghan Government's national drug control strategy nationwide. In addition, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) troops are mandated to provide support to Afghan-led counter narcotics operations. Head Quarters-International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) co-ordinates the NATO forces operations and deconflicts them from Operation Enduring Freedom activities. The Government of Afghanistan chairs counter-narcotics meetings which the UK and US embassies, and ISAF attend.</p>

	<p pid="c.967W.2/1">The UK funded a review of the Afghan Government's national drugs control strategy (NDCS) and the institutional framework supporting it in the summer of 2007. The review recommended a greater focus on implementation of the NDCS in the provinces. As a result, the Afghan Government has developed, with UK support, a new provincial strategy. It centres on giving provinces responsibility for devising their own counter-narcotics plans, in support of national counter-narcotics priorities. This provincial approach conforms to the NDCS and ensures counter narcotics will be better embedded into the full range of Afghan Government development and rule of law initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.967W.2/2">The UK's role in the strategy is to support the Afghan Government implement its NDCS, and lobby for continued and increased international assistance. Our ambassador in Kabul has observer status on the Afghan Cabinet Sub-Committee on Counter Narcotics.</p>

	<p pid="c.974W.2/2">Pension credit was introduced in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.2/3">The capital disregard at that time was &pound;6,000 for a single pensioner or a pensioner couple and &pound;10,000 for a pensioner living in a care home.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.2/4">Had the disregard been up rated by prices, the &pound;6,000 capital disregard would now be set at &pound;6,766 and the &pound;10,000 disregard would be set at &pound;11,277.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.2/5">Had the disregard been up-rated by earnings, the &pound;6,000 capital disregard would be set at &pound;7,012 and the &pound;10,000 disregard would be set at &pound;11,687.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.2/6">There is no requirement in social security legislation to review the value of the capital disregards in income-related benefits in the same way that there is for weekly benefit amounts. The capital disregards are not, therefore, routinely up-rated.</p>
	<p pid="c.974W.2/7">At least 80 per cent. of pension credit recipients have less than &pound;6,000 capital. So any changes would not benefit the majority of existing recipients or those currently eligible (around 80 per cent. of those eligible for pension credit also have capital below the current capital disregard.)</p>

	<p pid="c.977W.8/1">The economic assessment within the Pagham and East Head Coastal Defence Strategy is being developed by the Environment Agency in accordance with DEFRA project appraisal guidance and the Treasury &quot;Green Book&quot;. This assesses the damage avoided by protecting existing assets from flooding and coastal erosion. By 2108, without maintenance of all the existing defences, it is estimated that damage in the order of &pound;334 million (at today's prices) would occur. This figure is not the same as the total value of assets, nor does it include damage to non-housing infrastructure, for which no figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="c.977W.8/2">In terms of total asset value and based upon the work completed to date, there are currently 1,028 residential properties at risk of flooding, with an estimated value of around &pound;250 million. Due to sea level rise, this figure is expected to increase to 1,230 properties by 2028 and 3,960 properties by 2108. These equate to estimated values of &pound;300 million in 2028 and &pound;960 million in 2108 at today's prices.</p>

	<p pid="c.980W.5/1">In 2006 DEFRA published a study that reviewed the various technologies that might be used to achieve biological containment and be used as biosafety tools for crops. This study assessed the current state of play of <i> (a)</i> the effectiveness and <i> (b)</i> the reliability of genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs) as well as other containment technologies for potential use as biosafety tools. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) also provided advice on the findings of this report. Both the study and the ACRE advice are available on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="c.986W.9/1">My Department has regular discussions with Communities and Local Government (CLG) about a wide range of issues, including sustainable waste management. Decisions on planning for residual waste treatment rest with Local Authorities rather than central Government. It is also local authorities, in conjunction with the waste industry, that build waste facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.9/2">The number of new incinerators built will depend on the technologies and scale of facilities chosen by local authorities. Guidance on planning for waste facilities is contained within Planning Policy Statement 10, published by CLG in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.986W.9/3">Recycling rates are growing fast, but there will always be some wastes that cannot be recycled. 11 per cent. of waste is currently incinerated in England, but an increase is likely to be needed to be able to meet landfill directive targets, despite big improvements in waste recycling and minimisation. Recovering energy from waste (including via incineration) offers a considerable climate change benefit compared to the alternative of landfill. This is primarily through avoided landfill methane emissions, with energy generated from the biodegradable fraction of waste also offsetting fossil fuel power generation.</p>

In England and Wales a child under 10 is below the age of criminal responsibility and so cannot be prosecuted and convicted, so by definition those of this age on the DNA Database had not been convicted of any offence. Also, in England and Wales the police have no power to take a DNA sample from an under 10 without the consent of a parent or guardian. In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight, so the nine children whose details had been submitted by Scottish forces may have been convicted of an offence.</p>

	<p pid="c.994W.2/2">The ecstasy, opium and LSD reported on page 22 of SOCA's Annual Report were seized within the UK. The majority of the seizures of cocaine and heroin took place outside of the UK. Trafficking routes frequently involve a number of countries and the route from producer to the UK will be deliberately circuitous to avoid detection by law enforcement. These are the same routes used to traffic drugs to other European states and it is, therefore, impossible to determine accurately what proportion of an individual shipment will be destined for the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1014W.0/1">First Capital Connect (FCC) is not required to report punctuality and reliability statistics at service group level as part of its franchise agreement. FCC reports punctuality as a whole across its business and the Public Performance Measure (PPM) Moving Annual Average (MAA) has increased from 87.56 per cent. in April 2006 to 89.52 per cent. in the latest railway period for which statistics are available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1014W.0/2">There are no specific requirements regarding levels of crowding on FCC's routes. The Department's general requirements for crowding are that passengers should not be expected to stand for more than 20 minutes. The franchise agreement does contain a capacity provision benchmark which gets progressively more challenging over the life of the franchise. To date FCC has achieved the required standard in every railway period since the franchise commenced.</p>

	<p pid="c.1023W.9/2">Flood affected local authorities have also been able to apply to Communities and Local Government for help through the Bellwin scheme which provides financial assistance to local authorities dealing with emergencies. Exceptionally, the terms of the present schemes, have been made more generous because of the circumstances of the recent floods. Gloucestershire county council received an interim payment of &pound;1.1 million to help with its costs in clearing up after last summers floods and Gloucester city council received an interim payment of &pound;114,000. Both may receive further payments once they submit final claims. Claims have also recently been received from Gloucestershire police, Worcester city council, Cheltenham borough council and Cotswold district council.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.9/3">Gloucestershire county council was allocated &pound;1,007,900 from the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.9/4">The Department of Transport has agreed to provide Gloucestershire with &pound;10,000,000 for the repairs required to local roads. Assessments are continuing and further funding is expected to be confirmed when that work is complete.</p>
	<p pid="c.1023W.9/5">The Environment Agency's estimated annual spend in Gloucestershire on controlling development, flood warning and awareness, flood risk mapping, maintenance of flood defences and watercourses is 1.5 million. They have spent an estimated extra &pound;400,000 in Gloucestershire since the summer floods of 2007 on flood recovery, data collection, watercourse maintenance and repairs to flood defence assets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/2" class="italic"> Audit Commission</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/3">The Audit Commission is an independent body with statutory responsibilities to regulate the audit of local government bodies and NHS bodies in England. The Commission's statutory responsibilities in relation to audit are set out in the Audit Commission Act 1998. They are to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/4" class="indent">appoint auditors to local government and NHS bodies;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/5" class="indent">prescribe how auditors should carry out their functions through a statutory Code of Audit Practice, which is approved by Parliament at five-yearly intervals;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/6" class="indent">set scales of fees for audit work; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/7" class="indent">make arrangements for certifying grant claims and returns.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/8">The Commission appoints professionally qualified auditors, known as district auditors, from its own staff and also private firms of auditors. Once appointed, auditors carry out their statutory and other responsibilities, and are required by the Code of Audit Practice to exercise their professional judgment, independently of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/9">The statutory independence of auditors means that the Commission cannot:</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/10" class="indent">interfere with an appointed auditor's exercise of his or her professional skill and judgment in performing his or her statutory functions;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/11" class="indent">substitute its own judgments for those of an appointed auditor in the exercise of those functions; or</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/12" class="indent">direct an appointed auditor to act or to review his or her decisions, as only the courts have the powers to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/13">The Commission appoints the auditors to the GLA and its associated bodies including the LDA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/14">Quite apart from its audit functions, the Commission also has powers to carry out inspections of best value authorities (which include the LDA and some functions of the GLA) under section 10 of the Local Government Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/15" class="italic"> District auditors (a ppointed auditor)</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/16">The Audit Commission Act 1998 sets out the specific statutory duties of appointed auditors. They are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/17" class="indent">to comply with the Code of Audit Practice;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/18" class="indent">to give an opinion on the financial statements of the audited body;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/19" class="indent">to satisfy themselves that the accounts comply with statutory requirements and have been compiled in accordance with proper practices;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/20" class="indent">to satisfy themselves that the audited body has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/21" class="indent">to certify completion of the audit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/22">In addition, auditors of local government bodies have other statutory duties and powers:</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/23" class="indent">to consider issuing a public interest report about any matter that comes to their attention during the audit, which they judge should be considered by the audited body or brought to public attention;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/24" class="indent">for local government bodies (which includes the GLA and LDA):</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/25" class="indent">(a) to decide whether the audited body should consider formally, and respond to in public, matters raised in an audit report;</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/26" class="indent">(b) to give electors the opportunity to raise questions about the accounts, and consider and decide on objections received from electors about the accounts; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/27" class="indent">(c) where unlawful expenditure has been or is about to be incurred by an audited body, to issue an advisory notice, to apply to the courts for a declaration that an item of account is unlawful or apply for judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/28">The Code of Audit Practice requires that where, in the course of an audit, representations are made to the auditor or information is provided that is relevant to the audit, or matters relevant to the audit otherwise come to their attention, auditors should consider whether the matter needs investigation and action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/29" class="italic"> Local Government Ombudsman</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.5/30">The Local Government Ombudsman is an independent body charged by Part III of the Local Government Act 1974, as amended, with investigating complaints against local authorities, including the Greater London Authority and the London Development Agency, alleging maladministration causing injustice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1027W.5/1">The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) will not have planning powers as of right.

	<p pid="c.1027W.5/2">The scope of the HCA's powers in relation to green belt will depend upon which planning functions are conferred upon the HCA in the designation order.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.5/3">If the designation order confers development plan functions on the HCA, it would be able to propose alterations to green belt boundaries through the development plan preparation process. However, this would involve a detailed process including public consultation and scrutiny by an independent planning inspector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.5/4">Where the HCA is given the power to determine planning applications, the HCA would be able to determine whether development should be allowed in the green belt. Any such decision will need to be taken in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise and in particular the HCA will have to decide whether the benefits of the proposed development would outweigh the harm it would cause.</p>
	<p pid="c.1027W.5/5">In either situation, the HCA would be subject to the same requirements as any other local planning authority in terms of complying with the strong protection policies in PPG2.</p>

	<p pid="c.1029W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.5/2">My Department has regular discussions with Communities and Local Government (CLG) about a wide range of issues, including sustainable waste management. Decisions on planning for residual waste treatment rest with local authorities rather than central Government. It is also local authorities, in conjunction with the waste industry, that build waste facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.5/3">The number of new incinerators built will depend on the technologies and scale of facilities chosen by local authorities. Guidance on planning for waste facilities is contained within planning policy statement 10, published by CLG in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1029W.5/4">Recycling rates are growing fast, but there will always be some wastes that cannot be recycled. 11 per cent. of waste is currently incinerated in England, but an increase is likely to be needed to be able to meet landfill directive targets, despite big improvements in waste recycling and minimisation. Recovering energy from waste (including via incineration) offers a considerable climate change benefit compared to the alternative of landfill. This is primarily through avoided landfill methane emissions, with energy generated from the biodegradable fraction of waste also offsetting fossil fuel power generation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1036W.0/1">There are a number of ways to measure exclusion. One method is to look at people or places that have a combination of linked problems, such as unemployment, discrimination, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime, bad health and family breakdown. Recent analysis by the Social Exclusion Task Force found that around 140,000 families with children (or 2 per cent. of all families with children) in Britain experienced five or more disadvantages in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.0/2">Previous work commissioned by the former Social Exclusion Unit found that approximately 1.86 million (or 5.2 per cent.) of working age adults in Britain experienced five or more disadvantages in 2003, down from 2.43 million (or 7 per cent.) in 1997. For pensioners this was 1.8 million people (or 16.8 per cent.), down from 2.37 million (or 23 per cent.) in 1997.</p>

The cash increases against the 2007-08 baseline reflect additional resource funding for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's contribution to the 5 Hour Offer. This amounts to &pound;39.95 million over the CSR 2007 period and will be jointly delivered with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (which is contributing an additional &pound;60 million).</p>

	<p pid="c.1066W.6/2">The Long Term Condition Whole System Demonstrators (WSDs), promised in the White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot;, will explore the effectiveness of telehealth and telecare in supporting integrated care for those with heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. There are three demonstrators in the programme located in Kent, Newham and Cornwall. The demonstrators will be robustly evaluated by a consortia of academic organisations in order to fully assess the business case for such service models.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.6/3">As part of the WSDs the vital signs of several thousand individuals will be measured over a period of at least a year. The vital signs that are measured will be determined on an individual basis following assessment and the development of a care plan. The monitoring of heart activity, blood pressure and lung capacity will be included in the options available to people within the WSD communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.6/4">The equipment needed to measure vital signs can be standalone e.g. a blood pressure monitor. However, within the WSDs we are testing the role of assistive technologies as part of an integrated health and social care system. The vital sign measurements will therefore be remotely monitored regularly by health professionals. Feedback and treatment regimes will be tailored based on these readings. To facilitate this the peripherals such as blood pressure monitors will be connected to a telehealth hub that is linked via a phone line or broadband to systems that are securely monitored by clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="c.1066W.6/5">In addition, the Department's telecare policy is set out in &quot;Building Telecare in England&quot;, which was published in July 2005. The Department provided &pound;80 million of funding, through the Preventative Technology Grant, to support the mainstreaming of telecare services and to benefit up to 160,000 additional users. This policy will support people with a range of long term conditions with a number of localities investing in telehealth equipment to enable the monitoring of vital signs in the home.</p>

	<p pid="c.1072W.9/1">We understand from the chairman of the Healthcare Commission that it categorises the complaints it receives by subject type and specialty, for example 'delay in diagnosis-General Practice'. Categories are then related to &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot; (published in 2004), the centrally set standards against which NHS performance is assessed.

	<p pid="c.1073W.5/1">The National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended, place a legal obligation on providers of NHS hospital services to establish whether patients are ordinarily resident in the UK and, if not, whether they are exempt from charges under the provisions of the regulations or liable to pay for any treatment provided. The Department of Health has provided comprehensive guidance on implementation of the charging regulations to help NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts to discharge their obligations under these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1073W.5/2">All patients attending hospital for the first time in a course of treatment should be asked specific residency questions. Depending on the answers, the patient may be referred to the hospital's overseas visitors manager for further inquiries to be made. This should be done as soon as is reasonably practicable, taking into account the patient's medical condition. Where it is established that the patient is a chargeable overseas visitor, they should be informed as soon as possible of the estimated cost of the treatment being sought. In the case of routine elective treatment, guidance recommends that a deposit equivalent to that estimated cost should be obtained before treatment begins. However, immediate necessary treatment required to preserve life or to prevent a condition from becoming life-threatening, should be provided without delay, with issues around charging and payment dealt with once the patient has been stabilised.</p>

	<p pid="c.1074W.2/1">The guidance issued on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-01">1 June 2000</phrase>, Safety, privacy and dignity in mental health units: guidance on mixed sex accommodation for mental health services, outlines the practical steps that staff should take to ensure the safety, privacy and dignity of those who are mentally ill. Additionally, it contains specific guidance on the design of mental health units, which can be a significant factor in maintaining privacy for vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/2">The 2007-08 NHS Operating Framework for England, published in 2006, states that primary care trusts (PCTs) should ensure local implementation of the commitment to reduce mixed-sex accommodation and maximise privacy and dignity in situations where the need to treat and admit takes precedence over complete segregation1. The 2008-09 Operating Framework, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December 2007</phrase>, calls on PCTs to work with all trusts to agree, publish and implement stretching local plans for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/3">Also, in December 2007 the Institute for Innovation and Improvement published Privacy and Dignity: the elimination of mixed sex accommodation which states:</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/4" class="indent">'In mental health services additional issues should be considered with respect to gender separation. The nature of mental health care is such that ward environments need to be safe and homely. Service users may stay for many months or years in some units. In order to promote privacy, dignity and safety appropriate polices, procedures training and clinical supervision'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-15">15 August 2007</phrase>, we announced that the 'Dignity in Care' campaign would be extended to cover mental health services. The campaign has proved successful in raising awareness of dignity in care and driving forward improvements in the way in which people are treated.</p>
	<p pid="c.1074W.2/6">In order to promote privacy and dignity, staff vigilance underpinned by appropriate policies, procedures and training are as important as the physical environment. This is reflected in the core standards measured by the Healthcare Commission as part of the annual health check with which all trusts need to comply. This checklist will assist trusts to demonstrate their compliance with a number of standards, in particular that healthcare organisations have systems in place to ensure that staff treat patients, their relatives and carers with dignity and respect.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-02-05c.184219.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-02-05c.1076W.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="1076W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/text/80205w0029.htm#08020563008154">
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/1">The size, quantity and content of the stockpile is guided primarily by the policy objective of using antiviral medicines effectively in order to prevent hospitalization and deaths arising from pandemic influenza, and supporting our 'stay at home policy'. To achieve this we are planning to increase our antiviral stockpile from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. This should be enough to ensure treatment for all those that become symptomatic, including in a 'worst case' scenario where the maximum predicted attack rate is reached.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/2">Safety and patient acceptability is key. All Neuraminidase inhibitors are generally well tolerated by patients but the side effects from amentadine make it less suitable for stockpiling. The form in which the medicine comes is also important; while Oseltamivir is a capsule, Zanamivir has to be administered using an inhalator. The possible development of antiviral resistance also needs to be taken into account. Resistance is known to develop quickly to amantadine, making it unsuitable for stockpiling. We are currently considering stockpiling a second Neuraminadase inhibitor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/3">In principle, antiviral medicine treatment will be available for all symptomatic patients from the onset of a pandemic. A move to prioritisation of treatment would only be made if information became available to suggest that demand for antiviral treatment would outstrip supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/4">If the clinical attack rate exceeds the quantity of antivirals stockpiled, access to countermeasures will be based on the need to:</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/5" class="indent">Reduce serious illness and deaths; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/6" class="indent">Reduce transmission and spread.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/7">Final decisions can only be made once we know what the clinical impact of the pandemic is.</p>
	<p pid="c.1076W.8/8">As for the use of our existing stock of pre-pandemic vaccine, the Government has a stockpile of 3.3 million doses of H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine for health care workers. However, the Human Resources guidance for the national health service is still being consulted on. Final guidance detailing the eligibility of staff for A/H5N1 based upon clinical assessment of staff who may be at risk will not be available until after the responses received during the consultation are collated and analysed.</p>

The CHM and its Expert Advisory Groups have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines. The advice of CHM/MHRA remains that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions (typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). This view concurs with that of the World Health Organization, the United States Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency.</p>

This requires that all NHS organisations in England comply with legislation relating to fire safety. The guidance it contains about the installation of sprinklers in health care buildings is consistent with the policy of the Chief Fire Officers' Association.</p>
	<p pid="c.1084W.0/3">While the &quot;Firecode&quot; guidance does not specifically require the installation of sprinkler systems in patient care areas of health care buildings, it does make it clear that the design team is expected to consider the advantages that might be gained by installing sprinklers throughout the building. Firecode does however recommend that auto-suppression systems (which can include sprinkler systems) should be installed in clearly defined high fire risk or high fire load areas that are located adjacent to patient accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1090W.5/1">In the immediate post-conflict period, UK Government's strategy in Sierra Leone focussed on establishing peace and security, ensuring macroeconomic stability and re-building state institutions. The aim was to create the overall framework of stability and rule of law that was necessary for economic development to take hold. This strategy was complemented by specific economic programmes to support investment by removing many of the administrative barriers and improving governance in the mining sector. DFID has spent approximately &pound;164 million over the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1090W.5/2">Currently the DFID Sierra Leone office is managing a &pound;10 million portfolio of multi-year interventions to stimulate growth in the private sector, as well as a recently agreed &pound;20 million programme to support the energy sector, and a &pound;16 million programme to modernise tax administration, reducing costs of compliance for businesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.1091W.5/1">South Africa has the highest burden of HIV and AIDS in the world. Over 5.5 million people are infected, and it is estimated that in 2007 over one sixth of the world's population with HIV live in South Africa. Recent data from antenatal clinics suggest a modest decline in prevalence rates: in 2006 29 per cent. of all pregnant women had HIV, down from 30 per cent. in 2005. However, the UNAIDS Global update states that there is no evidence of a decrease in HIV among young South Africans.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/2">Over the past year there has been renewed optimism that South Africa is beginning to scale up efforts to tackle HIV and AIDS. On <phrase class="date" code="">3 May</phrase> the South African Cabinet approved a new national strategic plan for AIDS, with interim targets that put South Africa on track to achieve universal access by 2011. The plan is overseen by a re-vitalised South African National AIDS Council which brings together all government departments and 17 civil society sectors, including people living with HIV and AIDS, business, researchers, women, faith based organisations and traditional leaders. The UK provided technical assistance, through UNAIDS, to this revitalisation process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/3">DFID has also directly supported India (&pound;28.5 million, 2002-10), Bangladesh (up to &pound;50 million, 2005-10), and Iraq (about &pound;21 million since 2003) to upgrade their energy sectors. We have recently committed &pound;20 million to help Sierra Leone (2008-13).</p>
	<p pid="c.1091W.5/4">We spent approximately &pound;1.75 million during the last five years on energy research to help developing countries address energy sector challenges and have committed a further &pound;3.75 million (2007-12) to look at the contribution bio-energy can make to poverty reduction in Africa. We are planning to develop an additional research programme to look at energy policy options for developing countries as they consider what action is needed to tackle climate change.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-02-05c.184199.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-02-05c.1094W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="1094W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/text/80205w0032.htm#08020563008232">
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/1">The Department for Children, Schools and Families is absolutely clear that support staff such as teaching assistants are not substitutes for qualified teachers. Provided certain conditions are met, however, support staff are permitted to carry out &quot;specified work&quot;, which includes delivering lessons to pupils. These conditions are set out in The Education (Specified Work and Registration) (England) Regulations 2003 and (Amended) Regulations 2007 and accompanying Guidance <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11731/Time_for_Standards_2007.pdf">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/_doc/11731/Time_for_Standards_2007.pdf</a> and are: that the member of staff concerned carries out the work in order to assist or support the work of a qualified teacher in the school and is subject to the direction and supervision of a qualified teacher in accordance with arrangements made by the head teacher of the school; and that the head teacher is satisfied that the support staff member has the skills, expertise and experience required to carry out the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/2">In determining whether the person has the skills, expertise and experience required to carry out specified work, the head teacher should have regard to the standards for higher-level teaching assistants that are published by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/3">In addition, the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group (WAMG), which includes the majority of school workforce associations and unions and employers, as well as the Department and Welsh Assembly Government, has published guidance on cover supervision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/w/wamg_guidance_cover.pdf">http://www.tda.gov.uk/upload/resources/pdf/w/wamg_guidance_cover.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/5">During cover supervision, no active teaching takes place but pupils continue their learning by carrying out a pre-prepared exercise under supervision (usually by a member of support staff). The guidance makes clear that cover supervision is appropriate only for short-term absence and that the head teacher must be satisfied that the member of staff supervising the class has the necessary training and skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1094W.0/6">Guidance and support to schools on the use of support staff for providing cover, as well as more generally, is also available through a network of local authority-based workforce advisers funded by the Training and Development Agency for Schools. Any school wanting further advice on this issue is best advised to contact the local authority concerned.</p>

	<p pid="c.1095W.5/1">The Department has recently provided the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) with targets for teacher training places in secondary subjects for the three year period 2008-09 to 2010-2011. We will make available approximately 800 secondary school food technology teacher training places in this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/2">These figures were all based on outputs from our teacher supply model, which takes account of range of factors that determine how many teacher training places we need to set for future years. One of these factors is new curriculum pressures or initiatives that will affect the number of teachers needed in different subjects, and one of these was a need to provide more teachers of food technology. The targets we gave the TDA therefore made allowance for an expansion in this area. The modelling and targets also took account of the fact that there will be significantly fewer secondary pupils in the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/3">We have been working with the TDA to find ways of increasing the number of teachers of food technology in recent years. We will continue to do so in pursuit of this new commitment that the Government have announced.</p>
	<p pid="c.1095W.5/4">Approximately 15 per cent. of secondary schools do not currently offer food technology at key stage 3. In March 2008 we will be carrying out a survey of these schools in order to understand what additional support will be needed to enable them to offer food technology. In advance of the results of that survey, no estimate has been made of the cost of retraining existing teachers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1098W.2/2">Training providers must design their programmes to enable trainees to meet the standards for qualified teacher status. These standards set out what the outcomes of training must be, but neither this Department nor the Training and Development Agency for Schools prescribe either the content of training, or the amount of time that must be spent on each aspect of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.1098W.2/3">Most training takes place in schools and this provides trainees with the opportunities they need to meet all of the standards. The standards themselves require trainees to be able to teach across the range of core and non-core subjects of the pupils' curriculum, including PE. In addition, all trainees are expected to be able to create safe learning environments when they teach.</p>
	<p pid="c.1098W.2/4">The overall amount of time available for training on many primary programmes is inevitably limited. Training providers themselves make professional judgments about the balance of the various elements of the training programme. Additionally, they are required to take account of individual training needs and to personalise training provision to meet the needs of individual trainees. The specification of training hours for aspects of provision would not be consistent with this flexible approach.</p>

	<p pid="c.1099W.2/2">A variety of work has been developed to improve the emotional wellbeing and mental health of school children. The National Healthy Schools programme which has existed since 1999 promotes a whole school approach to both physical and emotional health, and one of its core themes is emotional health and wellbeing. To achieve national healthy school status, schools now need to satisfy the criteria for all four core themes and last year new guidance was issued on promoting emotional health and wellbeing to support work in this area. Currently 95 per cent. of schools have joined the National Healthy Schools programme and 55 per cent. are meeting the new standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/3">The National Framework for Children and Young People and Maternity Services (NSF), published in 2004, set out a 10-year programme of improvements for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). In support of this, grant funding to local authorities for CAMHS has increased from &pound;10 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;91 million in each financial year from 2003-04 to 2007-08 to strengthen the provision of targeted mental health services for children and adolescents. We also announced plans in 2007 for an independent review of CAMHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/4">The Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme was created to develop all children and young people' social and emotional skills at school, which help to underpin emotional wellbeing, and it was made available to primary schools in 2005. Approximately 60 per cent. of primary schools have voluntarily adopted SEAL, and 15 to 20 per cent. of secondary schools are expected to start implementing it by July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1099W.2/5">In 2007 we announced that we will invest an additional &pound;60 million over three years to support schools to work with mental health practitioners and others to improve the mental health and emotional wellbeing of pupils.</p>

With the support of the local authority, proposals have been published by a group which include parents for a new secondary school to open in Sheffield in 2011 to replace two closing schools.

	<p pid="c.1101W.5/1">There has been no change in Government policy towards small rural schools. The Department has taken, and will continue to take, measures to support both schools and communities in rural areas. The presumption against the closure of rural primary schools, which we introduced in 1998, is working well and local authorities must continue to make decisions on the future of rural schools in accordance with our statutory guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1101W.5/2">Responsibility for the overall planning of school places rests with local authorities and we expect them to ensure that school places are where parents want them. The case for closure needs to be strong and clearly in the best interests of educational provision in the area. There are other actions that can be taken to reduce surplus places without closing schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.1101W.8/1">The distribution mechanism for DSG does not include value for money criteria in relation to education services in rural areas. The starting point for the calculation of 2008-09 DSG allocation is each authority's DSG guaranteed unit of funding per pupil, which in turn depends on the amount the authority budgeted to spend in 2005-06. This was closely related to the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) calculation, which took account (as one of a number of factors) of the needs of rural authorities through an addition for pupils in primary schools: this recognised the additional costs faced by rural authorities in keeping open more small primary schools than other authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1108W.2/1">The Government believes it is important that miners who complain to the Law Society under the coal health compensation schemes get the level of service and compensation they deserve. The Government therefore takes a close interest in this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/2">The legal profession is independent and as such complaints about solicitors are a matter for the Law Society rather than Government. However the Government seeks regular updates from the Law Society and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to ensure that progress is being made in dealing with these complaints against solicitors. The Government appointed the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner in 2004 as an independent regulator of the Law Society's complaints handling functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/3">The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) has authorised investigations into 60 firms of solicitors; 20 firms have been referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the SRA has won the first three disciplinary cases heard there. To date, solicitors have refunded over &pound;3 million to miners. This figure is expected to rise as more investigations are completed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/4">The Government have legislated in the Legal Services Act 2007 to create an independent Office for Legal Complaints, which will remove complaints handling from the legal professional bodies. It will also enable approved regulators to deal more effectively with cases of widespread wrongdoing in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/5">In June 2007, the Government sent a joint letter to all the solicitors involved in the scheme to remind them again of their obligations to pay back money to claimants where this was taken without their consent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/6">The LCS is taking forward awareness raising initiatives such as the Rother Valley Pilot which involved mailing an information pack to each named individual on the DBERR database of original government coal health compensation schemes COPD and VWF claimants within the Rother Valley parliamentary constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.2/7">The LCS will now write to all living claimants on the DBERR database in order to raise awareness and to identify all outstanding consumer dissatisfaction within a 12-month period.</p>

The boundary commissions may depart from strict application of the rules in specified circumstances, in particular if special geographical considerations apply. The Government agreed in their response to the Committee on Standards in Public Life's Eleventh report, &quot;Review of the Electoral Commission&quot;, that it would be appropriate to review the current legislation in relation to the conduct of parliamentary boundary work.

In addition, under the same the machinery of Government changes, approximately 3,200 former Home Office Civil Servants joined the Ministry of Justice. These staff were subject to the Home Office pay award during 2002-07 and payments to them (including those for the Office of Criminal Justice Reform and the Probation Service) are included in the figures provided by in the response to the same question for the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="c.1111W.2/1">The Government agree with the principle of individual registration but is not yet convinced that it could be implemented in Great Britain (GB) without causing a significant drop in the registration rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/2">An assessment of the set up and ongoing cost for introducing individual registration was made following the Electoral Commission's Voting for Change Report in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/3">At that time, it was estimated that the cost of an annual canvass under household registration stood at approximately &pound;40 million. Likely costs of the annual canvass under individual registration were estimated at approximately &pound;55 million and the one off set-up costs of implementing individual registration at approximately &pound;17 million. These figures did not take account of the potential for the ongoing costs of individual registration to be mitigated by reducing the frequency of the annual canvass as in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/4">Under section 67 the Electoral Administration Act 2006, the Electoral Commission has power to collect financial information about expenditure of registration. This will provide up to date and more complete data to estimate costs for policy changes for elections in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/5">Our vision for electoral registration is clear: we want to protect the rights of every eligible person to participate in the UK's democratic process by ensuring complete, accurate and secure electoral registration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1111W.2/6">Any new system of electoral registration in Great Britain would need to be tailored to current circumstances, and in particular, would need to address the challenge of under registration as an estimated 3.5 million eligible electors are not currently registered to vote.</p>

	<p pid="c.1118W.0/1">I understand these questions to refer to the Bail Accommodation and Support Service. These are not bail hostels. The service provides accommodation in flats and houses with up to five people sharing, and support to users.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.0/2">We are providing this service because we consider that prison should be reserved for those who need to be held in custody in order to protect the public. Those defendants, innocent until proven guilty, who can be bailed should be so. Judges and magistrates have consistently asked that we provide more bail accommodation because there are numbers of defendants without accommodation whom the courts consider can be bailed if such accommodation, with necessary support, is made available. Similarly there are prisoners eligible for release on home detention curfew, with a tag, who cannot be released because they do not have an address at which they can be curfewed. The service enables prison governors to make decisions to release such people. It is not in the public interest to keep in prison people who do not need to be there.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.0/3">The service is available for defendants whom the courts have assessed as suitable for bail, and for sentenced prisoners released on home detention curfew after a thorough risk assessment by the prison governor. Excluded from the service are those convicted of or charged with sex offences, those convicted of arson in the last 10 years or charged with arson and those who pose a significant risk to the public or to ClearSprings staff or to others in a shared house.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.0/4">A list of towns or areas where accommodation is currently provided or is being sought was included in my written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January 2008</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1655W).</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.0/5">12 ClearSprings properties now used for the Bail Accommodation and Support Service were used previously for the ClearSprings asylum contract. The local authorities and police were consulted as to suitability, and were advised when the premises were made available for BASS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.0/6">There is currently one four-bed property in Grimsby. This was not previously used for asylum seekers. A three-bed property is being sought in Scunthorpe. This requirement has been identified by the regional offender manager in discussion with probation and taking account of the volume of defendants through the courts.</p>

The principle is that the transfer of documents is immediate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.0/2">In cases where a prisoner arrives at a new establishment without all the necessary documentation the reception staff would notify the appropriate department within the releasing prison, who will then forward that information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.0/3">The Prison Service Order Continuity of Healthcare for Prisoners (PSO 3050), contains guidance to improve the continuity of care received when a prisoner is transferred from one establishment to another, as well as at reception and on discharge. The prison clinical record is designed to be clear and legible, to identify medical history and pathways of care, and to improve communication between clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.0/4">The Learning and Skills Council is currently developing its Learner Summary Record Database which will, for the first time, provide a central store of learner information that can be accessed by education providers delivering learning and skills in prisons irrespective of where the offender is serving their sentence. The development of the database and indeed the operation of it are designed to minimise the period of discontinuity in an individual offender's agreed learning programme if they are moved during their sentence period.</p>
