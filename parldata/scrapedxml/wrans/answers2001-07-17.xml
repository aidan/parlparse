We as a Government back those efforts only where they need special co-ordination. In this case the Government have pledged additional funding of &pound;14.2 million, supplemented by &pound;2.1 million re-deployed by the British Tourist Authority from existing plans. This provides in full what was sought by the British Tourist Authority, after full consultation with the industry, for the whole of 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.8/2">Building on &quot;Tomorrow's Tourism&quot;, the sound strategy for tourism that we developed in our previous term of office, we will also consider giving greater emphasis to three areas: (a) changing the perception of the industry as an employer through further Government-industry partnerships; (b) continuing to drive for better and less regulation so that the industry can concentrate on growth and increasing our international competitiveness; and (c) examining whether the marketing of Britain as a tourism destination could be more efficiently co-ordinated.</p>
	<p pid=".76W.8/3">The recent foot and mouth disease outbreak has highlighted the importance of tourism to the domestic economy and we will do what we can to ensure a speedy and sustained recovery. In addition to taking forward strategy, experience so far has shown that we clearly need better and more up-to-date statistics and economic data for the sector and we will need to work with the industry to that end.</p>

	<p pid=".77W.8/1">Only <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July</phrase>, the Medicines Control Agency held a public seminar on the issue of sports supplements. The Director of the Anti-Doping Unit at UK Sport, and the Chair of the Nandrolone Review Group, which was set up by UK Sport, both attended that seminar. UK Sport is the non-departmental public body funded by the Department for Culture Media and Sport with responsibility for the drug testing programme in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.8/2">The Nandrolone Review committee reported in January 2000 and gave a strong warning to sport about the potential dangers of using supplements which may be incorrectly or inadequately labelled. Since then, considerable research has been undertaken on supplements, both in the UK and abroad, to see whether they can be responsible for producing adverse findings among athletes. Doping remains a strict liability offence in sport in order to protect athletes from those who do seek to cheat by misusing drugs. This means that athletes must be confident that what they are putting into their bodies will not lead to an adverse finding. The Nandrolone Review Group will be considering research findings in further depth and are due to produce a follow up report shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.0/1">Drug testing arrangements are organised on a UK rather than British basis to provide a consistent standard across all UK sportsmen and women subject to this type of testing. UK Sport is currently the agency with responsibility for the drug testing policy and programme and they employ 12 staff to oversee the testing operation, policy, education, information, research and international advocacy roles. UK Sport also contracts a team of 85 independent sampling officers to carry out sampling. This figure will rise and fall depending on need. For example, it will increase when international competitions are held in the UK, as next year when we host the Commonwealth Games.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/2">Prior to the reorganisation of the GB Sports Council in UK Sport in 1997, five full-time officers, and a considerable number of part-time independent sampling officers were employed in the fight against doping in sport. It is also the case that a number of governing bodies of sport employ staff, on a full, or part-time or voluntary basis in the anti-doping field. To calculate the number of staff on a per sport basis would be extremely difficult as there are currently no centrally held statistics which would accurately reflect the individual arrangements of all governing bodies. Also, calculation on a per sport basis would not provide an accurate reflection of the complexity of anti-doping procedures in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.3/1">Drug testing arrangements are organised on a UK rather than British basis to provide a consistent standard across all UK sportsmen and women subject to this type of testing. UK Sport is currently the agency with responsibility for the drug testing policy and programme. The complexities of the drug testing programme are such that it is not possible to break down figures in the way which my hon. Friend has requested. For example, footballers playing in the football league in England and Wales might not be British but may be subject to testing as they are participating in a domestic competition. Also, UK Sport does not have records of all UK athletes tested overseas unless they have commissioned the testing themselves. Where UK athletes are tested overseas at the request of the International Federation or as part of the host nation's testing programme, this information is relayed to individual governing bodies, not to the national anti-doping organisation of the athlete.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.3/2">A summary of the UK drugs testing programme for each of the last five years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".80W.8/1">I am today laying copies of the report before Parliament. It is being published as a Command Paper, and the full text will be available on my Department's website (<a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid=".80W.8/2">I am very grateful to Sir Alan Budd and his fellow members of the Review Body for their work. They have done a fine job. They were given a wide and challenging remit: to modernise the regulation of gambling in Great Britain, taking account of all relevant factors, including its social impact. Their report, based on extensive evidence and research, provides a thorough analysis of the issues and a coherent package of proposals. We are all in their debt.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.8/3">All around the world legislators have grappled with the problem of how best to regulate gambling. There is no single solution which is right for all times and for all places. Gambling itself is continually evolving. Our present gambling laws were, for example, enacted before the internet was created and they make no provision for its use as a gambling medium. Regulation equally needs to take account of changing social circumstances and public expectations. There is no doubt that our current laws, as well as being too complex and out of date, fail to reflect the extent to which gambling has become an everyday part of the way in which millions of people choose to spend their leisure.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.8/4">The Gambling Review Body has identified a number of proposals which would lift regulatory constraints which may no longer be justified. At the same time there are proposals which would provide additional safeguards which the Review Body sees as needed to achieve the overall policy aims of protecting children and the vulnerable, ensuring fairness to the punter and keeping crime out of gambling. The report accordingly recommends a new balance of regulation in the public interest. It is also clear from the report that we are looking at the scope for improving a system with many strengths: through its own and its regulators' efforts British gambling is among the world leaders.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.8/5">We now plan to discuss with interested bodies the issues which implementation of the Review Body's recommendations would raise. We shall also welcome comments from members of the public and all sources: these should be sent to my Department by the end of October. I shall want to take these consultation and comments into account before reaching final decisions on the way ahead. I shall also want to consider carefully the potential impact of the Review Body's proposals on the National Lottery before deciding how to proceed.</p>
	<p pid=".80W.8/6">In the meantime there is no reason to halt all work on changes which are consistent with the Review Body's conclusions and which can be taken forward without cutting across future legislation. We shall, for example, continue to work on plans to sell the Tote to racing and to end the horserace betting levy; and there are also regulatory reform proposals which are already subject to public consultation or parliamentary scrutiny. We need to consider them again in the light of the Review Body's work, but where progress can sensibly be made which will bring early benefits to the public and the industry alike, it should be made.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.2/1">No directions have been given to either London Underground or London Transport regarding future arrangements for the Underground.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/2">I have today written to Mr. Kiley, informing him that his appointment as chairman and member of London Regional Transport is terminated forthwith.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/3">Mr. Kiley was appointed chairman of London Regional Transport on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-08">8 May</phrase> to lead negotiations on contracts for the modernisation of London Underground. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-29">29 June</phrase>, he wrote to the Prime Minister reporting that he had been unable to reach agreement with the bidders which met his objectives and the key criteria for modernising the Tube. In the light of Mr. Kiley's inability to reach an agreement with the bidders, the Government asked London Underground to proceed with their plans for improving and updating the Tube's infrastructure within parameters acceptable to them and the bidders.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/4">When the Government decided on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July</phrase> that London Underground should be invited to press ahead with their plans for investment in a publicly-run, privately-built Tube, we hoped that Mr. Kiley would continue to be able to play a fully co-operative role. This has not been the case. Mr. Kiley has tried to use his board position to block negotiations with the bidders. He has, without authority from the board, issued instructions to senior management to halt those negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/5">I have today received a letter signed on behalf of a majority of the London Transport Board saying they cannot work with Mr. Kiley and thus it is impossible for the London Transport Board to function effectively. I have therefore decided to end Mr. Kiley's appointment as chairman and as a board member and to re-appoint Sir Malcolm Bates as chairman of the London Transport Board.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.5/1">The Government are committed to delivering long-term improvements for the travelling public, and recognise that an important aspect of doing so is to ensure better integration between modes of transport.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/2">We have seen a number of new and improved rail interchanges opened since 1997 including&mdash;Warwick Parkway, Clitheroe Interchange, Canning Town Transport Interchange, North Greenwich Station, Stratford Regional Station, Feltham Gateway and Tottenham Hale Station. There is also a new London Underground Interchange at Canada Water and a number of new bus interchanges, notably St. Paul's Bus Station, Walsall.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/3">The Safe Routes to Stations project, on which the Department is collaborating with Sustrans, Railtrack and other bodies, is progressing well. It will open up new opportunities for people to access rail and bus stations by bicycle and on foot, and demonstrate the advantages of combining public transport with cycling and walking. Work has already been carried out at a number of locations around the country, including Peterborough, Norwich, Tiverton Parkway, March in Cambridgeshire, Temple Meads in Bristol, Waterloo in London and a cycle/pedestrian access bridge linking Bodmin with Bodmin Parkway station.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/4">Last December we gave full or provisional approval to three major local transport schemes, the Allerton Interchange in Merseyside, and the Outer Circle bus showcase and Wolverhampton Centre Access in the West Midlands, which each include better interchanges between rail and public transport.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/5">Authorities have also included a range of smaller-scale interchange improvements in their local transport plans. The exact choice of measures will be for authorities to determine, but we will be monitoring closely the implementation of local transport plans&mdash;including progress on interchange facilities&mdash;through an annual progress report system. The first reports are due to be submitted by local authorities at the end of August 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/6">We expect to see further progress towards integration between modes as a result of the increased investment under the 10-Year Plan.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.5/2">The Government today published the new Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25 &quot;Development and flood risk&quot;, following the fast-track consultation in February-March this year. It substantially follows the recommendations of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee in their December 2000 report on &quot;Development on, or affecting, the flood plain&quot;, and strengthens the guidance that was previously contained in Department of the Environment Circular 30&ndash;92, which is now cancelled.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.5/3">The new PPG makes clear that building should be wholly exceptional in areas of flood plain that are currently undefended or defended to a relatively low standard and thus effectively function regularly as flood plains where water flows or is stored at times of flood.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.5/4">A risk-based sequential test outlines the appropriate planning responses to levels of flood risk to help to ensure that the problems that have occurred due to inappropriate development in flood-risk areas are reduced in future. This test gives clear priority to the development of areas that are not at high risk of flooding.

	<p pid=".93W.5/5">Application of this test through the development plan system and in the determination of individual applications will require planning authorities and developers to consult closely with the Environment Agency. Applicants will be required to assess the flood risk and impact of their proposals and to incorporate sustainable drainage systems as far as possible. Where flood defences and other mitigation measures are needed because of development, these should be fully funded as part of the development, including the necessary arrangements to maintain them for a 30-year period, after which they will be regarded as public assets and liabilities. The Government are preparing supplementary guidance on flood-resistant construction techniques to enable buildings to cope better with flooding and to recover faster.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.5/6">The emphasis on looking at flooding on the wider scale of the whole river catchment or coastal cell will be complemented by the initiative on catchment flood management plans being undertaken by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.8/1">The Health and Safety Executive consider overcrowding on trains to be a matter of comfort rather than one of safety. Accordingly there are no statutory safety limits on the number of passengers that can travel on trains. For commuter routes into London and Edinburgh train operators are required to keep overcrowding within specified thresholds. All trains in use have a nominal capacity, and operators must plan their services to ensure that the aggregated number of Passenger's In Excess of Capacity is kept to 3 per cent. over the morning and evening peaks or 4.5 per cent. for either peak in isolation. Train operators conduct annual passenger counts to demonstrate compliance. If the thresholds are breached the company is required to produce an action plan to remedy the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.2/2">I am therefore announcing today the go-ahead for the new &pound;15 million fund for regional chambers&mdash;&pound;5 million this year, and in each of the next two years. This will help them to enhance their role in providing regional input to, and scrutinising, the plans and work of the Regional Development Agencies, and to develop their position as the strategic focal point for the regions. The aim is to provide a stronger framework for representing the regions' views, not to impose burdensome new procedures on the RDAs or others.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/3">In 2001&ndash;02, &pound;500,000 is available for each chamber to develop its scrutiny role, with a further &pound;1 million set aside for initiatives, supported by the chambers collectively, on setting up the new regime. While we envisage that bids would normally be for the first year only, we have not ruled out the possibility of bids for two, or even three, years' worth of funding where that is what the chambers want. The deadline for receiving bids has been extended to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-29">29 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/4">Detailed arrangements for allocating the funding in the following two years will be settled in the light of further discussions with the chambers. The future of the funding beyond the current three-year period will be a matter for the next spending review.</p>

This includes all recommendations from leaders of political parties, and a very limited number of recommendations for holders of high public office. The decision on whether to recommend candidates in these last two categories rests with me, unlike those non-political recommendations proposed by the Commission itself, which I submit automatically to the Queen.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.2/2">There is a large scientific literature that indicates that antidepressant medication is superior in efficacy to placebo. This is particularly the case where depression is more severe. Placebos have been noted to be of some benefit and there is a range of so-called non-specific factors (care, interest and attention from the clinician) which are relevant.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.2/3">An example is the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Research Program in the United States reported in the mid 1990s. They compared two forms of psychotherapy, antidepressant medication (imipramine) and placebo. The latter two treatments also involved &quot;clinical management&quot; which included a weekly meeting with the clinician to discuss symptoms, side effects and progress. For mild depression no significant differences were found between the treatment groups. However for the more severely affected patients the antidepressant treatment was the most effective.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.2/4">Early studies with tricyclic antidepressant drugs showed that 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. of patients with depression will respond to antidepressant drug treatment as compared with 15 per cent. to 30 per cent. of those treated with placebo. The response to antidepressant medication will take at least two weeks but in some cases up to four weeks or more. The newer antidepressant drugs have been shown to have similar, but not greater, efficacy to the older style medications. The advantage of the newer drugs lies in lower toxicity and different side effects.</p>

We will continue to work closely with all the associations representing those that deliver or use NHS services. This inclusive approach means we will be able to continue to take positive action that is in the best interests of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.0/2">The diploma level route into nursing provides a generous level of bursary which is non-means-tested. No contribution is therefore required from the family income.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/3">The means-tested bursary, available to degree level students, targets low income families as it provides a higher level of support for those in the greatest need. In addition, degree level students are also eligible for assistance through Student Loans (available from the Student Loan Company), Hardship Loans and NHS Hardship Grants.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/4">Although the NHS bursary does not specifically provide help with childcare costs, extra allowances are available for single parents and for those who have dependants (including children).</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/5">A number of NHS hospitals have started schemes where they employ individuals as healthcare assistants/ nursing auxiliaries, train them to entry level standard for nurse training and allow them to retain their salary while they undertake the diploma nurse training programme.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/6">Student families on low income are also eligible to claim Working Families Tax Credit.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/7">Assistance with childcare costs is also provided for some students through charitable organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.0/8">Ministers aim to provide the widest possible access to nurse training, and continue to take a close interest in ensuring that student support arrangements promote this objective.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health is publishing today the annual report for 1999&ndash;2000, and copies are being placed in the Library. The report covers research and development work carried out by (or on behalf of) Government Departments in relation to equipment that might increase the range of activities and independence or well-being of disabled people, and in particular such equipment that might improve their indoor and outdoor mobility.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.2/2">The current report places such research in the context of the NHS Plan, and outlines the role of assistive technology in making independent living easier for older people and people with disabilities. The report describes the wide range of Government-funded projects supporting the development, introduction and evaluation of assistive technology. Relevant projects funded by the European Union are also listed.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.3/1">The UK is working within the middle east peace process to support the building of the Palestinian nation's ability to generate economic and social development that benefits the poor. DFID's support includes technical assistance to increase Palestinian capacity to negotiate with the Israelis on economic and other issues to build institutions and to improve health, education and water and sanitation services. DFID has recently approved a contribution of &pound;1.5 million to the World bank's emergency employment generation programme to the West bank and Gaza Strip, aimed at protecting vulnerable groups from falling further into poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".124W.9/1">Since it was established on <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-01">1 July 1999</phrase>, the information technology requirements of the Wales Office have been met by the National Assembly for Wales under the terms of a service level agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.9/2">There is no central record of contracts entered into by the former Welsh Office prior to that date.

We are monitoring the effect of these changes closely.</p>

Hours booked for low-flying training during this period amounted to a small decrease (of 66 hours, or less than 1 per cent.) compared to the previous training year.

	<p pid=".139W.2/1">The police investigation into the unauthorised destruction of possible Bloody Sunday rifles announced in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-17">17 February 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-02-17.648W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 648W</phrase>, was completed in April 2001. The Bloody Sunday inquiry has been fully informed of the progress of the investigation and asked, at the outset, that the scope of the investigation be widened to establish the histories and whereabouts of the 29 weapons originally examined by the Widgery inquiry in 1972.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/2">The police investigation revealed, for the first time, that the partial serial numbers provided by the Bloody Sunday inquiry generate 60 possible permutations for the 29 weapons originally sought by the inquiry. The report therefore reveals that the information on which my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-17">17 February 2000</phrase> was based, although provided in good faith, was inaccurate and incomplete.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/3">By establishing detailed audit trails for all 60 weapons, the police have been able to recover 14 weapons and confirmed that 29 have been destroyed. The police were unable to confirm the existence or whereabouts of the remaining 17 weapons, some of which have been sold, complete or in parts. Others may have either been destroyed prior to the creation of the computer record or manufactured and delivered to customers overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/4">The self-loading rifle (SLR) was declared obsolete in November 1997. A routine disposal programme involving the sale and destruction of the weapons was in progress from January 1998, although some surplus rifles were disposed of prior to this date.

	<p pid=".139W.2/27">By September 1999, when the inquiry made a formal request for weapons and provided partial serial numbers, the Ministry of Defence held six weapons but was able to identify only five as Bloody Sunday &quot;possible&quot;. Two of these weapons identified as Bloody Sunday weapons, together with a third weapon that had not been identified, were destroyed in a routine disposal programme on 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-27">27 January 2000</phrase>. The destruction only came to light after the event when the computer database was updated. My answer of <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-17">17 February 2000</phrase> incorrectly stated the dates at which the computer record was updated, rather than the actual dates of destruction.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/28">The police report concluded that the weapons were destroyed as a result of a combination of factors including inaccurate computer records, duplicated serial numbers and mistakes resulting from human error rather than an overt criminal act. Based on the police report, I am satisfied that there was no conspiracy to destroy evidence sought by the inquiry. The matter has now been referred to the chain of command to implement management improvements designed to prevent a recurrence and to determine whether any internal disciplinary action needs to be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/29">The evidence contained in the report suggests that the destroyed rifles would have been of little value to the inquiry due to duplicated serial numbers and the lack of certainty that any individual weapon was fired on Bloody Sunday. However, the police report indicates a strong possibility that a L42A1 7.62mm sniper rifle conversion can be matched to a Bloody Sunday weapon. The whereabouts of this weapon were unknown when the report was produced, but it has now been recovered by the MDP. The police investigation also confirmed that it is not possible to determine whether any rifles have retained their original barrels as large numbers of rifles were re-barrelled during the 30 or so years that the weapons remained in operational service. Detailed records were not kept to record whether a rifle had been re-barelled, or how many times this may have occurred.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.2/30">The Bloody Sunday inquiry will reach its own view as to the potential forensic value of the weapons.</p>

	<p pid=".140W.2/1">We have a good record on the safety and security of our nuclear weapons and continue to place the highest importance on work in this area. I have today placed in the Library of both Houses a table which sets out the circumstances of each of the seven accidents concerned. The information it contains is drawn from records spanning a period of 40 years and confirms that:</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/2" class="indent">There has never been a weapons accident resulting in the release of radioactive material;</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/3" class="indent">there has never been damage to a weapon which risked a radioactive leak or an explosion;</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/4" class="indent">there has never been a nuclear weapon lost.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/5">In addition to the three road traffic accidents referred to in the table, our research has identified one other, similar, event which took place in 1960 in Lincolnshire. There is no damage to the weapon involved. Since this event pre-dates current reporting system it is unclear whether, in today's terms, it would be categorised as an accident.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.2/6">The Government remain committed to greater openness on nuclear issues wherever possible. A key responsibility, however, must be to protect the safety and operational security of our nuclear forces and the people who support them. The practice of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons at any particular place and at any particular time will therefore continue to be a cornerstone of the Government's policy on nuclear weapons issues.</p>

One of the issues addressed has been access and the requirement, if any, for dredging. Discussions to date have only been of an informal nature and no decisions have yet been made on berthing or basing options for the carriers and any potential dredging requirements.

The Law Society and the Bar Council are working together to consider how, if properly regulated, contingency fees might be used more widely to benefit clients and extend access to justice. The Government have no plans to extend the use of contingency fees.</p>

Police spoke with political representatives and community activists on both sides of the community in an effort to defuse the situation and to encourage them to use whatever influence they had to resolve the differences.

	<p pid=".168W.6/1">The Government's top priority has always been to eradicate the disease. Veterinary advice is that the main way the disease is being spread is by those working with or close to animals not taking appropriate biosecurity measures. At every opportunity we have emphasised the need for everyone consistently to take stringent precautions to avoid further spread.</p>
	<p pid=".168W.6/2">However for those who have had no contact with animals or affected premises for at least seven days, the risk is considerably lower. The advice to walkers is consistent with the biosecurity message and includes: observe closed signs; use disinfectant troughs where provided; keep your dog on a lead where there are livestock; and do not leave waste food around. Footpaths within a 3 km protection zone around infected premises should normally remain closed.</p>

It also manages a panel of Wildlife Inspectors, who check compliance with certain wildlife controls.</p>

One of its main priorities is to take forward work to establish a dedicated unit to tackle wildlife crime at national level.</p>

However operational responsibility, including decisions on which projects to promote and their timing, rests with local operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency. I understand that the Agency is building on the findings of the pre-feasibility study of flooding problems in Robertsbridge, by commissioning a feasibility study to develop the outline design for suitable flood defences. The study will include consideration of flood defences for Northbridge street and Rutley close. Depending on the results of the study, I understand that the Environment Agency plans to commence works at Robertsbridge in summer 2002.</p>

Since then, the Government have established the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC). Its remit includes providing strategic advice on the ethical and social aspects of developments in biotechnology, and on their public acceptability. An AEBC sub-group is currently exploring the subject of animals and biotechnology with the aim of providing a report to Government early next year. This may include consideration of the issue of the welfare of cloned animals. More generally, the Office of Science and Technology commissioned a consultation exercise on public attitudes to biotechnology in 1998&ndash;99, which included questions on the public perception of animal cloning.</p>

For example, a person earning &pound;6,000 a year through their working life would get &pound;59 a week from state second pension, &pound;46 more than they would have received from SERPS.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.5/1">The Government intend to bring forward legislation on community investment tax credits in the Finance Bill 2002. We published a consultation document on the tax credits (&quot;Enterprising Communities: a tax incentive for community investment&quot;) in March. The consultation period closed on July 2 and generated a largely positive response. The Government will announce decisions on the outcome of the consultation in due course. There will be robust processes for monitoring the effectiveness of any scheme.</p>
