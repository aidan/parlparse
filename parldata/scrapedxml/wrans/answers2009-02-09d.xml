	<p pid="d.1521W.9/1">The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for appointing two commissioners to the Boundary Commission for Scotland. The commission is an independent and impartial advisory body, responsible for reviews of constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament, and constituencies in Scotland for the Westminster Parliament. One of the current commissioner appointments will run until <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>, the other until <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-06">6 June 2011</phrase>. The posts are part time and require around one to two days work per month during the period of a boundary review. Commissioners are paid a daily fee, currently &pound;486, for attending commission meetings and for meeting preparation. Applicants are expected to have a good understanding of the social geography of Scotland, the structure of constituencies for the Westminster and the Scottish Parliaments, and the electoral system. There are no statutory political restrictions, but it is recognised that commissioners are expected to be politically neutral. Appointments are made following Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and other relevant guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1521W.9/2">The Secretary of State may also appoint, at the request of the commission, assistant commissioners, to &quot;inquire into, and report to the Commission upon, such matters as the Commission think fit&quot;. In practice, assistant commissioners are appointed to conduct public inquiries into the commission's provisional recommendations. In Scotland, it is customary for Sheriffs Principal who preside over the relevant areas to be appointed for this purpose given their unquestioned independence and impartiality, and their local connection to the areas under consideration. These appointments are unpaid, and made for the duration of the inquiry process, typically a few months.</p>
	<p pid="d.1521W.9/3">The Scotland Office retains all official records relating to the appointment of both commissioners and assistant commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.1528W.9/4">For those military establishments where catering is provided through the Pay As You Dine programme, or as part of a multi-activity contract, the catering contractor may choose to offer Fairtrade products as part of his strategy, although the requirement does not specify that he must. There are a wide variety of such contracts in place across the Department and information on Fairtrade products on offer is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.1531W.2/2">Taking the armed forces as a whole, retention rates are relatively stable and we have seen no unexplained peaks of personnel leaving in the last 10 years. There is real concern, however, that in some important areas exit rates are too high and appear to be increasing, if only slightly, year on year. These pinch point trades are continuously monitored and specific action is taken to improve retention and indeed recruitment. The recent Command Paper (July 2008) set out over 40 measures aimed at addressing many of the disadvantages of service life while the Government's response to the Report of Inquiry into National Recognition of our Armed Forces has now been presented to Parliament detailing how we have accepted the majority of recommendations. In addition, a wide range of measures are in place to improve retention, including career management, improvement to conditions of service and work/life balance, commitment bonuses and targeted financial retention initiatives.</p>

Information is not collected on the time taken to conduct treasure inquests.</p>
	<p pid="d.1532W.5/2">Informal figures are, however, collated by the British Museum. These show that in 2007, the British Museum requested that coroners in Leicestershire hold seven treasure inquests. An average time taken between the inquests being requested and a verdict being returned is not available because one of these inquests is still ongoing, although the time taken for the other six ranged from 82 days to 515 days. A statistical average based on such a small number of cases would be very volatile and heavily dependent on the particular circumstances of each case.</p>

	<p pid="d.1534W.2/1">Wisbech magistrates court is a two criminal court room building in an accessible part of Wisbech. The building is co-located alongside the local police station (Cambridgeshire Constabulary) and their custody suite which is accessed by the courthouse. Cambridgeshire Constabulary are the tenants of HMCS. Many of the building services are linked to the adjacent police station. The courthouse has the use of two cells under a shared arrangement with the police and the Prisoner Escort Service (PECS). Recently Cambridgeshire Constabulary has made public its intention to move custody arrangements to a new county facility in March, Cambridgeshire from the end of March 2009 and will no longer provide this at Wisbech police station. The Wisbech police station will remain as an operational unit. HMCS have been actively involved in discussions with both the Cambridgeshire Constabulary and the PECs delivery organisation (GSL) as to how HMCS can ensure practical occupation of the cell area in order for the HMCS business to continue to operate as usual. Without the use of an available and suitable on site custody suite the use of the courthouse would be considerably reduced which is why the local HMCS area has been working proactively alongside both Cambridgeshire Constabulary and PECs to resolve this situation successfully. There are no current plans or proposals to change or reduce the use of this courthouse.</p>

	<p pid="d.1540W.2/1">There were 866 cases which involved a warrant of possession being issued in 2008 and which followed the original suspended mortgage possession order being made three to five years previously. There were also 103 cases which involved a warrant of possession being issued in 2008 and which followed the original suspended mortgage possession order being made 6-10 years previously.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.2/2">The Ministry of Justice does not currently hold statistical information relating to lags between suspended mortgage possession orders made and warrants of possession issues of more than 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.2/3">These figures do not indicate the number of homes actually being repossessed. Issuing a warrant of possession does not necessarily result in repossession.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.2/4">HM Courts Service automatically disposes of all possession action files including those involving suspended possession orders after three years' inactivity. Electronic records specifying the incidence and associated dates of suspended possession orders are still available for orders made within the last 10 years. However, record retention and disposition policies do not affect the enforcement of suspended possession orders. It is the duty of claimants to supply the order documents when applying for a warrant of possession to be issued.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.2/5">Record retention and disposition policies fall within the remit of the Departmental Records Officer and Head of Record Information and Management Services for the Ministry of Justice. Retention periods are determined by (a) any legislative requirement and (b) the business need of the area to which the schedule relates. No special provisions are made for the retention and disposal of records involving suspended possession orders.</p>

However, county courts in the Yorkshire and Humberside Government office region may cover areas other than the parliamentary constituencies of this region. Therefore not all possession actions at these courts necessarily relate to Yorkshire and Humber constituencies.</p>

Options for preservation include statutory designation, although it would not be appropriate to designate all of the many thousands of surviving pillboxes&mdash;careful selection is necessary. Alternatively, many of these structures have local significance and their recording on local authority Historic Environment Records is another way of improving understanding and protection.</p>

	<p pid="d.1567W.2/2">The Government have not commissioned any research solely for the purpose of investigating perceptions of Muslims within the UK. A number of pieces of Government research do provide evidence from which it would be possible to infer how Muslims 'may' be perceived. Examples of these include:</p>
	<p pid="d.1567W.2/3" class="indent">The Communities and Local Government Citizenship Survey; a large scale nationally representative survey intended to understand people's views on issues such as race equality, faith, feelings about community, volunteering and participation. It is possible to analyse responses by the faith of respondents. In addition, questions on perceptions of the subjects of discrimination include an option to select 'Muslim' as one of a number of responses.</p>
	<p pid="d.1567W.2/4" class="indent">The University of Kent 'Equality, Diversity and Prejudice in Britain' (commissioned by the Government Equalities Office, previously part of CLG); includes research on positive/negative perceptions of 11 social groups, one of which was Muslims.</p>
	<p pid="d.1567W.2/5" class="indent">The Department for Work and Pensions 'Barriers to employment for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in Britain and Constraints'; looks at a number of issues, including perceptions towards two minority groups that are predominantly Muslim.</p>
	<p pid="d.1567W.2/6">All of the above research projects were funded solely by the UK Government. It is not possible to attribute costs to the specific elements or questions which relate to perceptions of Muslims in the UK, as one question or interview can be analysed from a number of standpoints.</p>

	<p pid="d.1576W.5/1">Most of this information is not held centrally in these specific categories, and obtaining it would incur disproportionate cost. However, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does hold information on conflict-related programme activity funded through trilateral (FCO, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development) funds since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="d.1576W.5/2">From 2000 to 2007, the FCO funded its conflict-related programme activity through the tri-departmentally managed and owned Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) and Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP). The Conflict Prevention Pool (CPP) was established in April 2008 to replace the GCPP and ACPP. The CPP funds a broad range of conflict prevention work including education and mediation initiatives, and currently supports work in a number of regions (the Balkans, the Americas, Africa, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States). A separate Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF) was established in April 2008 to fund stabilisation and reconstruction activity in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

We are working closely with UN, African Union and international partners to achieve these objectives, especially UNAMID's efforts to improve security for internally displaced persons and to ensure humanitarian agencies and NGOs can operate effectively in the region.</p>

	<p pid="d.1583W.5/1">Since 2001, the following amendments have been made to local authority powers to tackle noise.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/2">The Noise Act 1996 has been amended by the Anti Social Behaviour Act 2003 so that the Noise Act powers are easier for local authorities to use.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/3">The Noise Act 1996 has been amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which extended the Noise Act to licensed as well as domestic premises. Local authorities have a discretionary power to prosecute or issue a fixed penalty notice for night noise above the 'permitted level' emitted from a dwelling or licensed premises between 11 pm and 7 am.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/4">Sections 69-81 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 introduced new powers for local authorities to deal with audible intruder alarms in their area. A local authority may designate its area (or parts of it) as an alarm notification area. The occupier or owner in respect of any premises that are fitted with an audible intruder alarm in the designated area must nominate a key holder for those premises and notify the local authority of the contact details of that key holder.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/5">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also introduced powers for local authorities to enter premises in order to silence audible intruder alarms where key holders cannot be reached, or where the alarm is not in an alarm notification area. These powers of entry apply to audible intruder alarms sounding for 20 minutes continuously or one hour intermittently, and likely to cause annoyance to those in the vicinity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/6">Section 80 (2A) of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 introduced a discretionary power for local authorities to take such other steps as it thinks appropriate to persuade the appropriate person to abate a statutory nuisance from noise within a seven-day period without serving an abatement notice. An abatement notice must still be served after the seven-day period if the local authority thinks that a statutory nuisance still exists, or is likely to occur or recur, and the abatement notice can be served at any point within the seven days.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/7">Complaints about noise from church bells would be subject to part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended), but we would expect common sense to be applied to the handling of complaints not least because church halls are part of our culture and heritage.</p>

	<p pid="d.1585W.2/1">To be eligible to apply for the Community Assets programme, applications had to be made by either the local authority that owned the asset to be transferred, or a third sector organisation that the asset would be transferred to. In each case the application had to be endorsed by the other partner, and supported by the wider community. The transfer could be in the form of a registered freehold or a registered and assignable lease of at least 20 years without a break.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/2">Applications had to address the three programme outcomes to be considered for funding:</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/3" class="indent">1. Local third sector organisations have greater security and independence, and are better able to meet the needs of the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/4" class="indent">2. Communities have more access to better quality facilities that respond to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/5" class="indent">3. There is more effective partnership working between local authorities and the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/6">Subject to meeting the initial eligibility criteria, projects were then assessed against the two following criteria:</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/7" class="indent">1. The proposed project outcomes meet an identified need and help to achieve the programme outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/8" class="indent">2. The organisation can deliver the project well and achieve the proposed outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1585W.2/9">On the basis of assessment against these criteria, 38 in-principle grants were awarded in April 2008. A full breakdown of the above criteria and published guidance on the Community Assets Programme can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1588W.17/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to respond to your question concerning how the UK ranks among other EU member states in terms of net migration in (a) 1997 and (b) the most recent year for which figures are available. (254538)</p>
	<p pid="d.1588W.17/4" class="indent">Eurostat publish net migration figures for all EU member states. These may differ from the estimates produced by individual national statistics institutes as Eurostat make adjustments to improve comparability across member states. These show that the UK had the fourth highest levels of net migration in 1997 and third highest in 2007, the latest year for which complete data are available. However care should be taken when comparing net migration estimates as a small net migration figure may mask large immigration and emigration flows.</p>

	<p pid="d.1589W.5/4" class="indent">The cost of developing an Address Register for the 2011 Census is now estimated to be about &pound;12m over the years 2008 - 2011. The additional estimated cost since my reply to your previous question in November 2008 (Hansard reference 235103) is due to a decision following successful piloting to match fully the two key national address lists - the Royal Mail Postal Address File and Local Government's National Land and property Gazetteer.</p>
	<p pid="d.1589W.5/5" class="indent">It is misleading to refer to this as a 'property database' since the Address Register will contain a list of household and communal establishment addresses linked to higher level geographic areas. The pre-requisite for a successful strategy of post-out of Census questionnaires as the primary delivery method, is the availability of a comprehensive, high quality address register for all areas of England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics is developing an address register that meets Census requirements in terms of quality and coverage and which local authorities can be confident will effectively underpin Census enumeration and outputs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1590W.0/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what consideration the Office for National Statistics has given to the classification of (a) local and (b) national road pricing schemes for the purposes of taxation statistics (252473).</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/4" class="indent">ONS produces the United Kingdom's National Accounts. The National Accounts are an internationally comparable accounting framework that describes the activities in a national economy, including the transactions that take place between sectors of that economy. The relevant international manuals are the System of National Accounts 1993(SNA93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in particular.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/5" class="indent">As part of the process of producing the National Accounts, ONS decides on the classification of institutions and transactions within the economy. This well-established process is set out in Annex A of the National Statistics Protocol on Statistical Integration and Classification available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/ns-standard/cop/protocols/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/ns-standard/cop/protocols/index.html</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/7" class="indent">Whilst ONS has not considered the classification of any proposed national road charging scheme, some other government schemes have been examined. Those examined include the London Low Emission Zone (LEZ); the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames emissions based parking charge, the London congestion charge and road/bridge toll charges.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/8" class="indent">Government revenue is mainly divided into taxes or service charges. Taxes are compulsory unrequited payments, where unrequited means that the payer does not receive anything directly in return. Service payments are requited in that they include the delivery of a service in exchange for a payment. In some instances the classification of these receipts can be difficult to interpret and the international statistical manuals recognise that &quot;the borderline between taxes and payments for services rendered is not always clear cut in practice&quot;. As a result ONS consider the nature of the receipts carefully before reaching a decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/9" class="indent">The London congestion charge and road/bridge toll charges are payments made for vehicles to use the roads within a defined zone. The charges are judged to be requited payments in line with international guidance and are therefore classified as payments for a service.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/10" class="indent">The LEZ and the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames emissions based parking charge are classified as taxes. The LEZ charge is a compulsory payment for specific vehicles to drive within the LEZ. Although the vehicles gain access to roads within the LEZ. the charging policy relates to vehicles polluting the air within the zone rather the use of the roads. The LEZ charge on the use of the non-compliant vehicle is judged to be unrequited and classified as a tax on pollution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.0/11" class="indent">Similarly, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames's charge for a permit to park in a Controlled Parking Zone, which was implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase>, is based on the emissions of the vehicle concerned. The decision to classify the charge as a tax on pollution is similar to the LEZ: the charge relates to the vehicle emissions rather than the direct consumption of a service.</p>

	<p pid="d.1595W.6/1">In 2006-07 and 2007-08 funding for the statutory minimum bus concession was provided exclusively through the Formula Grant system, which is administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).</p>
	<p pid="d.1595W.6/2">Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. local authorities are free to spend it on any services provided (not just transport services) that meet their statutory obligations. This enables local authorities to decide on their own priorities based on local requirements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1595W.6/3">It is not possible to identify how much formula grant has been allocated to a local authority for any particular service. This single pot of non-ring fenced funding allows local authorities to decide on their own priorities and provides an incentive for them to maximise value for money.</p>

	<p pid="d.1599W.2/1">The timing of the proposed dredge is a matter for London Gateway Port Ltd., subject to completion of the statutory consent process. The dredge is required in order to accommodate deep sea container vessels serving the new London Gateway port.</p>
	<p pid="d.1599W.2/2">Standard dredging practice in the Thames Estuary established by the Port of London Authority covers matters such as handling the incidental lifting of munitions left on the sea bed. Magnetometer surveys have also been conducted in order to provide the best advance information.</p>
	<p pid="d.1599W.2/3">The shortest distance from the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery to the southern edge of the proposed channel is just over 2.2 kilometres. The shortest distance from the channel to the edge of the wreck exclusion zone is 2.1 kilometres.</p>
	<p pid="d.1599W.2/4">The choice of dredging contractor is an operational matter for London Gateway Port Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="d.1599W.2/5">A public inquiry took place in 2003. Subsequently London Gateway Port Ltd. has set up a Marine Ecological Advisory Group which includes representatives from the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Marine and Fisheries Agency, the Port of London Authority and the Kent and Essex Sea Fisheries Committee, to consider among other matters the impacts of dredging.</p>

	<p pid="d.1600W.2/1">The principles of the economic model used for the assessment of freight facilities grant applications are outlined in Department for Transport publication &quot;Guide to Freight Facilities Grant (FFG) in England&quot; which was published in November 2006 and is currently being reviewed. The document can be downloaded free of charge from:</p>

	<p pid="d.1600W.2/3">The purpose of the economic model is to ensure that grants are only awarded when there is a financial need for funding. Annex 4 of the aforementioned guide deals with the financial appraisal of FFGs and, in its first paragraph, states that:</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The main financial requirement for a FFG is that compared with the road alternative, the proposed rail or water scheme would not be financially justified without grant.... This can only be a general guide; it may not cover the entire issues specific to each application. The Department can offer help and advice on specific cases.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="d.1600W.5/1">The Department for Transport has aimed to assess standard freight facilities grant (FFG) applications within four months and more complex applications within six months.

	<p pid="d.1602W.5/1">Estimates of populations within the 57 decibel noise contour with a three-runway airport were presented in the November 2007 consultation document and supporting technical report on noise. Around 242,000 people are predicted to be within the 57 decibel contour in 2020 with around 605,000 annual movements, the maximum capacity we have supported initially. The new runway could open sooner with a lower capacity, but the timing and capacity will depend on the planning process and the mechanism we are establishing to ensure that local environmental limits, including noise limits are met, and will continue to be met.</p>

	<p pid="d.1606W.5/1">Since 2005 a report on the contributory factors, including speed, reported by police officers who attend personal injury collisions has been published as part of &quot;Road Casualties Great Britain&quot;. The DFT-funded &quot;On The Spot (OTS)&quot; study involves additional non-police investigation of road collisions to explore the characteristics of personal injury collisions in depth. The OTS study is currently examining the characteristics of crashes that involve excessive or inappropriate speed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1606W.5/2">In addition, there is a wide range of research on the link between speed and casualties which may be found on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="d.1606W.5/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1606W.5/4">For example, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) published a review of non-UK studies in 1994 which established a link between vehicle speed and the risk of a collision. This indicated that, in broad terms, a 1 mph reduction in average speed can reduce accident risk by around 5 per cent. In 2000 TRL published a report investigating whether this general rule could be applied to different types of UK roads and to further understand the relationship between vehicle speed and accident frequency. The report concluded that the percentage reduction in accident frequency for a 1 mph reduction in average speed is between 2 per cent. and 7 per cent. depending on vehicle speeds and the nature and layout of the road.</p>

	<p pid="d.1615W.2/1">The humanitarian situation remains grave with up to 1.3 million displaced in eastern Democratic of the Congo (DRC) and many conflict affected communities in need of emergency assistance. According to the UN, almost 130,000 people in Province Orientale have been recently displaced by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) attacks and almost 300 killed in January as Joint DRC/Ugandan/South Sudan military operations are underway. There are also Joint Rwandan and DRC military operations in North Kivu to tackle the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR). Humanitarian access and protection of civilians remain key areas of concern. John Holmes, UN Under-Secretary General and Emergency Relief Co-ordinator will be visiting DRC between 6-<phrase class="date" code="2009-02-10">10 February</phrase> to assess the humanitarian response and protection concerns in North Kivu and Province Oriental.</p>
	<p pid="d.1615W.2/2">The UK Government are a major donor to DRC and will provide &pound;230 million between 2009-10 and 2010-11. We have developed a development programme which responds to the needs and constraints of the country, balancing meeting short-term needs (e.g. humanitarian assistance) with helping to lay the foundation for long-term development. We have worked closely with the international community to develop a joint donor framework and donor co-ordination is slowly improving. Given the high levels of poverty DRC remains under-funded overall. However, there are currently significant operational constraints to absorbing further aid.</p>

	<p pid="d.1618W.0/1">Since the previous question raised by the hon. Member, HM Treasury and its agencies have had no apprenticeships or advanced apprenticeships in place. Efforts are made to raise awareness of the programmes available and HM Treasury and its agencies will continue to seek to attract potential candidates to apprenticeship schemes including with our outsourced suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1618W.0/2">Methods used to promote the advantages of the apprenticeships and trying to recruit to the Government Pathway scheme include circulating literature and holding promotional events with external suppliers. The lack of take-up can be attributed to the highly skilled workforce that is already in place. A recent sample of HM Treasury and Office of Government Commerce colleagues found 98.6 per cent. of respondents were qualified to level 2 or above. This suggests the pool of potential applicants for apprenticeships is relatively small.</p>

	<p pid="d.1630W.2/1">The benefit to a household from a reduction in VAT of 2.5 percentage points, net of increases to alcohol and tobacco duty, is, on average, &pound;275. This amount is derived from HMRC revenue forecasts, and therefore cannot be used for analysis by decile and household type.</p>
	<p pid="d.1630W.2/2">Household spending patterns vary widely within deciles and household types, so estimates of savings on such a basis should be treated with caution. This is exacerbated by there being greater sampling variability associated with estimates for deciles and groups of given household types due to the relatively small sample sizes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1630W.2/3">However it is possible to infer the following estimates of the benefit of the VAT reduction by household type and income decile, based on figures for average expenditures on VAT published by the ONS in their article &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes, 2006-07&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1630W.2/4">The estimates assume the majority of the VAT reduction will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices in line with past experience, and that spending patterns remain unchanged.</p>

To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the personal capability assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits, so, for example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on grounds of mental or behavioural disorders would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the personal capability assessment; or on the effects of any associated mental health problems. Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation.<br/> 2. Mental impairments are defined as organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (F00-F09), mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19), schizophrenia, scizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-F29), mood affective disorders (F30-F39), neurotic, stress related and somatoform disorders (F40-F48), behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors (F50-F59), disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60-F69), mental retardation (F70-F79), disorders of psychological development (F80-F89), behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90-F98) and unspecified mental disorder (F99).

	<p pid="d.1648W.5/2">People aged over 25 are eligible for all Government supported training for adults including apprenticeships. 27,200 adults aged 25 and over started an apprenticeship in 2007-08 and 16,800 between August and October in 2008-09. The Government are currently investing &pound;4.5 billion in adult skills, through Train to Gain, Skills for Life and other work related training. There is now a legal right for all adults to get training up to national vocational qualification level 2 if they do not already have a qualification at this level.</p>
	<p pid="d.1648W.5/3">The Department is also working with DWP to create a joined up employment and skills system that gives low-skilled and unemployed adults the skills and support they need to find sustained employment. The Employability Skills Programme has been designed to meet the complex needs of Jobcentre Plus customers, and Local Employment Partnerships aim to open up opportunities for people on benefits who are often overlooked in the labour market. The Government are making a reality of our commitment to integrate the employment and skills systems. The aim is that all of those out of work will get the help they need to address their skills needs, find employment and progress in work through continued skills development.</p>

	<p pid="d.1650W.0/2">The target audience for the Skills for Life strategy is adults in England with literacy and/or numeracy skills below Level 2 and this includes learners aged 25 years and over. The increase in the number of Skills for Life (literacy, language and numeracy) learners aged 25 years and over (and in all other age groups) in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was part of our Skills for Life strategy to improve the basic skills of 2.25 million adults between 2001 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1650W.0/3">The strategy is based around boosting demand, ensuring capacity, raising standards and increasing learner achievement. The boosting demand element included work with employers to raise awareness of the issue and the successful 'Get On' campaign to encourage individuals to improve their skills. DIUS is refreshing its Skills for Life strategy and will soon be publishing a delivery document.</p>

	<p pid="d.1657W.5/3">To be eligible for LSC funding an individual needs to satisfy the residency criteria set out in LSC Learner Eligibility Guidance. In general, this means that they need to have been lawfully living in the UK, European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) for the three years prior to the start of their course.</p>

	<p pid="d.1661W.2/2">However, there are also a number of measures in place to help people finance postgraduate studies. For example, we recently announced proposals to reposition career development loans as a key additional source of support to help people finance learning, as new professional and career development loans (PCDLs).

	<p pid="d.1661W.5/1">The Government are determined to ensure that finance is no barrier to going to university. Having a degree remains one of the best pathways to a rewarding career: employers prize the highly-developed skills and talents that graduates bring to their businesses. Going to university is an investment for the future, with graduates benefiting over their lifetime from their decision to go into higher education. The Government's priority is to assist students to achieve a first degree. That is why statutory student support is concentrated on undergraduates.</p>
	<p pid="d.1661W.5/2">No matter what the short-term outlook for the economy, it is sensible for individuals to look at how they can fulfil their potential&mdash;and for many that means postgraduate study. The number studying at postgraduate level have increased by 27 per cent. in the last decade. The Government continue to promote the importance of higher level skills and supports excellence in higher education, including through providing significant funding for internationally acclaimed research activity through the various research councils which support postgraduate study. In the decade since 1997, the Government's support for the UK research base has risen from &pound;1.3 billion to &pound;3.4 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1661W.5/3">It is up to individuals themselves to decide which private finance providers to select to fund their postgraduate study. To help learners tackle the challenges arising from the economic downturn, we recently announced proposals to reposition career development loans as a key additional source of support to help people finance learning, as new professional and career development loans (PCDLs). PCDLs will offer more people the opportunity to reskill and improve their employment prospects by offering more generous terms for the learner, such as loans up to &pound;10,000 and lower interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="d.1661W.5/4">Like career development loans, PCDLs will be commercial loans offered by participating banks and supported by the Government. The decision on which course the loan is used for, including who provides the course, lies with the individual and that is made clear to them before they take out a loan. The Government pay the interest on the loan during the period of study, after which the individual must repay the loan capital plus remaining interest in full. Deferred repayment terms are subject to the banks' loan policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1661W.5/5">Further Government funding may be available for individuals through the Access to Learning Fund (ALF). The fund allows universities and colleges to provide extra discretionary support for students in particular need; it is administered directly by universities and colleges, which are best placed to assess students' circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.1661W.5/6">We continue to work closely with the higher education sector to monitor the impact of the current economic climate on students and institutions; and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) are considering further measures to address the immediate needs of the economy, including funding for short courses which might lead to up-skilling.</p>

	<p pid="d.1664W.2/1">The interest rate applicable to pre-1998 student loans is governed by the Education (Student Loans) Act 1990 and the Student Loans (Regulations) 1998 which set out that for the period between <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-01">1 September</phrase> and the following <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August</phrase> the interest rate is the daily rate which results in an APR equal to the RPI (retail price index).

Moreover, if a borrower's income falls below &pound;25,936 per annum, they can apply for their repayments to be deferred.</p>

	<p pid="d.1671W.3/1">The Government have long-standing, sound systems and flexible policies in place to deal with crime. These have led to significant reductions: overall crime, as measured by the British Crime Survey, has fallen by 39 per cent. since 1997. They also mean that we are well placed to prevent future rises in crime. As the Association of Chief Police Officers pointed out in January, the police service has never been in a better and stronger position to meet challenges caused by the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="d.1671W.3/2">The Government are not complacent about crime and are taking early action to ensure that crime stays down. Burglary is a crime that people worry about during hard times; there are good programmes in place to tackle burglary but the Government are rightly keen to explore what more can be done to support people to protect their homes. That is why the Home Secretary held a summit on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February</phrase> with a number of public, private and voluntary sector partners, including leading DIY retailers, the police, local government colleagues, British insurance industry representatives, residential landlords, Age Concern and others to discuss further practical measures to support people, particularly the most vulnerable.</p>

However, employers who propose to make 20 or more redundancies at one establishment are required to notify my noble Friend the Secretary of State of the proposal under provisions contained in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. During the period <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>, the Department was notified of 6,240 proposed redundancies in the pharmaceutical industry in Great Britain.

This is often utilised to overcome issues around the timing of expenditure. Whilst there is no need to process such transactions between the RDAs generally (because they are all non voted), funds to the LDA are voted (because it is governed by the Greater London Authority) and any changes are, therefore, necessarily reflected in supplementary estimates.</p>

	<p pid="d.1683W.8/2">Merger control functions in the UK are carried out by the UK's independent competition authorities. Cases are considered on grounds of their impact on competition in the relevant markets. This provides the primary method of protecting the interests of UK consumers and promoting economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="d.1683W.8/3">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has a duty to make a reference to the Competition Commission (CC) if it believes that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services. Under section 73 of the Enterprise Act 2002 the OFT may, instead of making a reference to the CC, accept appropriate undertakings to take such action as it considers appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1683W.8/4">One recent example is the acquisition by Co-operative Group Limited (Co-op) of Somerfield Limited. Under the terms of the undertakings accepted by the OFT on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-15">15 January</phrase>, the Co-op will divest stores in 133 areas across the UK to resolve competition concerns raised by the merger.</p>

	<p pid="d.1686W.11/1">Legal proceedings involving the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government are handled on behalf of the Secretary of State by the Treasury Solicitors Department, which has supplied the information requested in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="d.1686W.11/2">The upper part of the table ('client group DCLG') shows the cases in which the Department was directly involved. The lower part of the table ('client group PINS') shows cases where, although the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government was cited as the respondent, the challenged decisions had been delegated by the Secretary of State to a Planning Inspector, and so in practical terms the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) and not the Department was the respondent.</p>
	<p pid="d.1686W.11/3">This right hand column shows the number of cases filed in the calendar years 2006, 2007, 2008. The number of cases filed, and in which the Department was directly involved were, respectively 2006: 162, 2007: 135, 2008: 99. The corresponding figures for cases handled by the Planning Inspectorate were 2006: 172, 2007: 181, 2008: 212.</p>
	<p pid="d.1686W.11/4">The table also shows the number of cases closed per year. For example, of the 162 cases directly involving the Department which were opened in 2006, 17 were closed in 2006, 56 were closed in 2007, 47 were closed in 2008, one has been closed in 2009, and 41 still remain open. The table shows the equivalent figures for cases opened in 2007 and 2008, and the figures for cases handled by the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1686W.11/5">The Department of Communities and Local Government was created on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase>, so no legal proceedings naming the Department were filed before that date. The figures for 2006 in the table do however include cases opened between <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase> involving the predecessor Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid="d.1693W.0/2">The low cost home ownership programme is helping to make home ownership more affordable to first time buyers throughout England through a range of shared ownership and shared equity schemes. In response to the current difficult market conditions, we have expanded the availability of shared equity, which allows qualifying first time buyers to buy a property with the help of an equity loan (which can be used as a deposit). This includes the introduction of the new HomeBuy Direct scheme (which will give up to 18,000 first time buyers the opportunity to access affordable home ownership with an equity loan of up to 30 per cent. (funded on equal terms by Government and the participating developers).</p>

	<p pid="d.1702W.5/2">We recognise that, despite the recent fall in house prices, the turbulence in the global financial markets has resulted in severe restrictions on mortgages and in many cases a requirement for purchasers to have significant deposits, making it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder.</p>

For example, we have introduced HomeBuy Direct, a new scheme offered in partnership with house builders that is designed to help up to 18,000 first-time buyers into affordable home ownership with the aid of an equity loan of up to 30 per cent. (which can be used as a deposit). We are also taking steps to improve mortgage funding markets, as this is key to lowering mortgage costs and increasing the availability of affordable mortgages. Following on the Crosby Report's recommendations on mortgage finance markets, the Government will provide up to &pound;50 billion of guarantees on new mortgage lending (and eventually on other assets).</p>

	<p pid="d.1705W.2/1">The findings from each annual report of the Citizenship Education Longitudinal study cannot be viewed in isolation. Together they will inform policy development and enable us to improve the quality and delivery of citizenship education. The sixth annual report recognises that citizenship education, although a very helpful measure, is unlikely by itself to address the 'democratic deficit'. It suggests that schools and citizenship education provision are likely to have an indirect influence through democracy in schools and student efficacy on student attitudes and intentions. As we set out in the Children's Plan, the Government's aim are for all young people to want and be able to participate and take responsible action. We believe that the new duty on schools to invite and consider the views of pupils on matters that affect them will help to strengthen efficacy levels among children and young people and encourage them to continue to play an active part in their community.</p>

However, there are some elements of history that we believe are of vital importance and will continue to ensure that they are covered by all schools&mdash;the study of the Holocaust is one of these.

	<p pid="d.1710W.3/1">&quot;Faith in the System: the role of schools with a religious character in English education and society&quot; was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-10">10 September 2007</phrase> and outlined the Government's and faith schools providers' shared vision on the role of faith schools in the English education system and wider society. The document does not represent a set of new policy initiatives but aims to dispel some of the common myths and misunderstanding around faiths schools. In it, the Government and faith leaders of all faiths that have publicly funded schools in England reaffirmed their commitment to continue to work together and with all schools to improve the life chances of children, to build bridges to greater mutual trust and understanding, and contribute to a just and cohesive society, while nurturing children in their faith and as engaged citizens. We know that the principles of &quot;Faith in the System&quot; are embedded in faith schools and that they are committed to working with other schools and to meeting the needs of all pupils, whether they are of the faith or not.</p>
	<p pid="d.1710W.3/2">For example, the Board of Deputies of British Jews have developed the &quot;Shared Futures&quot; linking project, which aims to link minority faith schools and schools without a religious character where the significant majority of pupils are of a single faith. The Church of England (CofE) is now committed to reserving 25 per cent. of school places at new CofE schools for pupils from the local neighbourhood regardless of faith background or none; and last year, the Catholic Education Service (CES) launched new preliminary guidance for all Catholic schools in England on the statutory duty to promote community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1710W.3/3">The faith groups are now working together to take forward &quot;Faith in the System&quot;, with the CES taking the lead in organising a follow-up conference, which is due to be held in autumn this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1710W.3/4">The costs of printing the &quot;Faith in the System&quot; document were &pound;5,208 (&pound;6,119 including VAT).

	<p pid="d.1711W.2/2"><i> </i>It is crucial that young people have the right skills to compete in an increasingly fast changing global economy. Communication skills in other languages, combined with an understanding and appreciation of other cultures, will become increasingly important for the jobs of the future. We have made no specific assessment of this issue and have no plans to issue specific guidance to schools on intercultural competencies. However, intercultural understanding is a key concept within compulsory language learning for 11 to 14-year-olds, where pupils learn to appreciate other cultures, recognise different ways of seeing the world, develop an international look and communicate with native speakers where possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.1711W.2/3">Citizenship education equips pupils with the knowledge and skills needed for effective and democratic participation. This includes such areas as the changing nature of UK society, the diversity of ideas, beliefs, cultures, identities, traditions, perspectives and values that are shared; migration to, from and within the UK and the reasons for this, the UK's relations with the European Union and the rest of Europe, the Commonwealth, the United Nations and the world as a global community.</p>

We are also investing &pound;10 million per year to 2011 on Sing Up, the National Singing Programme spearheaded by Howard Goodall. With this early introduction to quality music experiences we believe that children will come to see themselves as musicians and will have a real and long-lasting enjoyment of music which will encourage them to continue their learning as they move into secondary school. The compulsory Music Curriculum at Key Stage 3 is now much more focussed on performance and hands-on music making. The curriculum builds on students' own interests and skills and should, therefore, engage them more fully which in turn will encourage them to continue with their studies in music through to GCSE and A Level.</p>

However the School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.1732W.8/1">We believe that all young people should participate in education or training until at least 18. Young people who stay on after 16 are more likely to gain higher levels of qualifications by 18 than those who do not and are less likely to commit crimes, behave antisocially or to suffer ill health. The Education and Skills Act 2008 introduced compulsory participation until 18 for all young people and this will ensure that the entire education system focuses on the needs of the all young people, including those with profound and multiple learning difficulties. It may be that the most suitable and appropriate provision for a particular young person would continue to be a special school, in which case this should be the key factor in determining where that young person receives their education.</p>
	<p pid="d.1732W.8/2">There is a vital and continuing role for special schools as part of an inclusive education system, meeting young people's needs directly and working in much closer partnership with mainstream schools to build expertise throughout the system. The present Special Educational Needs statutory framework provides for children and young people with statements to be taught in mainstream schools where this is what their parents want and is compatible with the efficient education of other children. It also provides for parents to seek a special school place and to have this preference considered. If a young person with SEN remains at school after reaching age 16, the school and the local authority continue the SEN arrangements already in place, subject to further regular reviews. If a young person with SEN continues their education at a further education college the Learning and Skills Council has a duty to take regard of the young person's learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1732W.8/3">The Children, Skills and Learning Bill creates the conditions for local authorities to assume responsibility for funding for learners with profound and multiple disabilities in 2010 and we believe this is the best way to develop a continuous system of support and provision from age 0-25.</p>

	<p pid="d.1742W.8/1">The safety and efficacy of medicinal products is formally assessed from clinical trials submitted at the time of marketing authorisation. These data are carefully evaluated by the independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to authorisation for evidence that the products work and are acceptably safe. The longer term safety of the use of medicines in routine clinical practice is closely monitored by the MHRA, including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by health professionals and patients through the Yellow Card scheme, to ensure that benefit risk balance continues to be favourable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/2">The safety of Vioxx (rofecoxib), the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) and salmeterol has been under continuous review by the MHRA since these medicinal products were first authorised. Any new data or possible safety issue to emerge has been carefully evaluated and, as necessary, appropriate action taken to update the product information for prescribers and patients to reflect the emerging safety profile and where necessary revised prescribing advice has been issued.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/3">Vioxx (rofecoxib) was a selective COX-2 inhibitor, a type of non-selective anti-inflammatory drug, licensed for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain conditions. In 2000, comparative clinical trial data raised concerns over the risk of heart attacks and other thrombotic cardiovascular events in association with use of rofecoxib. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM, the predecessor to the CHM) reviewed the safety of rofecoxib on several occasions between 2000 and 2003. This led to updates to product information and prescribing advice on the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events. In 2004, the manufacturers of rofecoxib withdrew the product after clinical trial data comparing rofecoxib with placebo (a dummy pill) provided the first definitive evidence of an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, evident after 18 months of treatment. The safety of other selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was fully reviewed between 2004 and 2006 and the conclusion was that the benefits of the authorised NSAIDs continue to outweigh the risks in the licensed indications.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/4">SSRI antidepressants are used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Ongoing concerns about the safety of the SSRIs in early 2003 prompted a review by an Expert Working Group of the CSM of the risk of suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions associated with the SSRIs. The Expert Working Group conducted a comprehensive review of the safety of this entire class of drugs, examining all available evidence and reviewing all the regulatory advice issued. The MHRA published key findings and updated advice to healthcare professionals and patients as the review progressed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/5">Salmeterol is a long-acting adrenoceptor beta agonist (LABA) used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The CSM and CHM have reviewed the safety of salmeterol on a number of occasions, leading to updates to product information and communications to remind healthcare professionals of the appropriate use of LABA in the treatment of asthma. The balance of risks and benefits of LABA was recently reviewed at the request of CHM, and was considered positive in the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents, provided LABA are used with inhaled corticosteroids. The outcome of the review was published in the MHRA bulletin Drug Safety Update, which is available on the MHRA website.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/6">There are currently no complementary or alternative medicines with marketing authorisations for the treatment of major conditions such as osteoarthritis, depression or asthma therefore the MHRA does not hold any information on the usage of complementary and alternative medicines for these conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1742W.8/7">Some years ago the MHRA considered a number of applications for marketing authorisations for products containing St. John's Wort (<i> Hypericum perforatum</i> L.) for mild to moderate depression. However, the applications were refused due to lack of adequate evidence of safety and efficacy.</p>

Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services practices also taking part.<br/> 3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.<br/> 4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national information technology system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br/> 5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, PCTs and strategic health authorities objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients.<br/> 6. QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br/> 7. Figures presented here are just the number of patients on the disease register for dementia.</td> </tr>

For previous years the North East total is the sum of the constituent organisations existing at the time.  <i> Notes:</i>  The Information Centre (IC) have provided data from the national Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) to answer part (a) and data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to answer part (b). (a) The national QOF records the number of people recorded on practice disease registers. A register exists for coronary heart disease (CHD). Register counts are available for the last four financial years. The IC are unable to supply information for all the areas requested as some are not health regions. Where this occurs we have supplied information for the health areas that best fit those requested. Furthermore, some of these health areas have changed under the reconfiguration of PCTs and SHAs in 2006. (b) Figures from the HES give a count of hospital admission episodes with a primary diagnosis of &quot;coronary heart disease&quot; (CHD). This is not a count of people treated as the same person could have been admitted several times and this also excludes treatment taking place in primary care. <i> Definitions</i><i>  Table 1</i> QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services contract on 1 April 2004. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services practices also taking part. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br/> The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, PCTs and SHAs objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients. The QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists. <i> CHD Register&mdash;definition</i> In order to call and recall patients effectively in any disease category and in order to be able to report on indicators for coronary heart disease, practices must be able to identify their patient population with CHD. This will include all patients who have had coronary artery revascularisation procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients with Cardiac Syndrome X should generally not be included in the CHD register. Practices should record those with a past history of myocardial infarction as well as those with a history of CHD.<br/> <i> Table 2</i><i> Ungrossed data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes (hospital admissions)</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Primary diagnosis</i> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify CHD are as follows: 120&mdash;Angina pectoris 121&mdash;Acute Myocardial infarction 122&mdash;Subsequent myocardial infarction 123&mdash;Certain current complications following acute myocardial infarction 124&mdash;Other acute ischaemic heart diseases. 125&mdash;Chronic ischaemic heart disease. <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. <i> Data quality</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Source: </i>Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

During 2001 regulations were put in place in respect of the administration of general anaesthesia for dental treatment under arrangements to provide general dental services and in the private sector. Thus anyone doing this in the primary care setting for the last year had to be inspected and registered by their local health authority. The large numbers of general anaesthetics undertaken by general dental practitioners (GDPs) and also the Community Dental Service had to be transferred to the hospital setting. Currently a large proportion of those general anaesthetics for treatment of dental caries are provided by the Salaried Dental Services, but out of acute hospital Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments under a services level agreement. They are usually out-patient in nature but because general anaesthetic has been given are counted as elective procedures.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/>  Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.

	<p pid="d.1764W.5/1">The &quot;Clean, safe care&quot; strategy was published in January 2008, and gave an overview of our strategy and initiatives, many of which were already well established, to tackle health care associated infections (HCAIs) and improve cleanliness. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.5/2">We have significantly reduced meticillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infections. The latest Health Protection Agency data for July to September 2008 shows a reduction in MRSA bloodstream infections of 33 per cent. compared to the same quarter in 2007. In 2008, the national health service met the nationwide target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections compared to 2003-04 levels. Latest figures also show a 62 per cent. reduction compared to the quarterly average in 2003-04, making further progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.5/3">The number of death certificates that mentioned MRSA decreased by 4 per cent. from 1,652 in 2006 to 1,593 in 2007. This is the first time the number of death certificates mentioning MRSA has fallen since ONS records began in 1993.</p>

	<p pid="d.1764W.5/14">Many patients who become infected with a HCAI have other serious and potentially fatal underlying medical conditions. Doctors are not supposed to record all diseases or conditions present at death, only those that contribute directly to it. It is a matter of individual professional judgment whether the doctor lists an HCAI as a contributory cause. There have been a number of initiatives to raise the profile of HCAIs and improve their acknowledgment as diagnoses in their own right. In October 2007 and July 2005 the chief medical officer reminded doctors of the importance of giving full and accurate information on the death certificate, particularly in relation to HCAIs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.5/15">We have commissioned an evaluation of the effectiveness the HCAI and Cleanliness Improvement Programme (one strand of the &quot;Clean, safe care&quot; strategy) with a specific focus on the work streams focused on reductions in the incidence of MRSA. We are also commissioning work to understand the ways in which hospital cleanliness relates to other aspects of a good environment, and how this might have an impact on HCAIs. These studies are in their initial stages and will provide results later in 2009.</p>

A copy of the report has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1772W.2/2">In his report, Professor Richards carefully considered equity issues before making recommendations to the Secretary of State about policy on additional private care. In line with Professor Richards' recommendations, the Secretary of State announced a package of measures to improve access to drugs on the national health service, including a new scheme from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to introduce greater flexibility in appraising expensive drugs for end of life conditions with small numbers of patients. These measures will mean that more drugs are available on the NHS, which will reduce the number of patients who may wish to buy additional private drugs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1772W.5/1">It is one of the guiding principles of the national health service that a person should have access to health services based on clinical need, and not on the ability of a patient to pay. Professor Richards' review, &quot;Improving access to medicines for NHS patients&quot;, was based on, and reinforces, this principle. &quot;The NHS Constitution&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January 2009</phrase>, also reaffirmed this as one of the key principles underpinning all that the NHS does. Copies of both documents have already been placed in the Library. Decisions by primary care trusts on funding for individual patients are no exception to this.</p>

	<p pid="d.1782W.2/1">Reducing smoking among young people is a priority for the Government. Much has already been achieved in this area, including raising the age of sale of tobacco products, legislation to strengthen sanctions available against retailers who persistently sell tobacco to children and young people, and smoking is addressed in the National Curriculum and through the Healthy Schools Programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1782W.2/2">Protecting children and young people from smoking was one of four key aspects of the Department's &quot;Consultation on the future of tobacco control&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-31">31 May 2008</phrase>. A copy has already been placed in the Library. Responses to the consultation are informing the development of a new strategy on tobacco control, which will include action to continue to tackle the uptake of smoking by young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1782W.2/3">The Government this year are taking forward tobacco control legislation intended to protect and support young people in the Health Bill. The Health Bill includes a prohibition on the display of tobacco products, which will help to eliminate the marketing of tobacco products, to which young people are susceptible. The Bill will also provide powers to restrict or ban the sale of tobacco from vending machines, removing a major source of tobacco for young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1782W.2/4">Local stop smoking services are able to provide a range of support options to anyone wanting to quit smoking, including young people. Resources are also available that can be accessed by smokers direct on smoking cessation, these include the NHS &quot;gosmokefree&quot; website and from the general NHS Smoking Helpline (0800 169 0 169).</p>

Time waited (days): Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="d.1784W.2/1">The Government support the availability of treatment services for thalassaemia that fit the model outlined in &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot;, that care should be fair, personalised, effective and safe.</p>
	<p pid="d.1784W.2/2">Key to this is the development of clinical networks of specialist care and the concept that every patient should have access to optimal specialist management and care, as well as routine care provided conveniently close to home. Clinical networks for Haemoglobinopathy disorders (thalassaemia and sickle cell) have now been established and initial meetings of stakeholders have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="d.1784W.2/3">We are also currently undertaking a peer review of service provision and commissioning arrangements for haemoglobinopathies. This will inform a programme of supportive action later in the year, in partnership with the national health service and stakeholders.</p>
