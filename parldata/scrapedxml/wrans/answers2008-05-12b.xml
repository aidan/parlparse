	<p pid="b.1292W.6/1">The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) is devolved to the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.6/2">Health Commission Wales (HCW) is currently working towards the provision of a Forensic Adolescent Consultation and Treatment Service (FACTS) in South and North Wales. HCW anticipate the service to be available in the summer of this year (2008). Part of the FACTS remit of the South Wales team will be to provide assessment and treatment advice for children in Pare prison with mental health problems. The FACTS will also assist local CAMHS teams in the development of specific services to the prison population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.6/3">The Welsh Assembly Government has made a commitment to CAMHS in its 'One Wales' document. The budget settlement included an additional &pound;4.8 million&mdash;&pound;1 million in 2008-09 and &pound;1.6 million and &pound;2.2 million in successive years&mdash;to enhance service delivery. This clearly demonstrates the priority that the Assembly Government attaches to these services. In addition, some &pound;6.5 million has been allocated to counselling in schools over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.6/4">The 2001 document &quot;Everybody's Business&quot; is embedded in the development of policy within the Assembly Government. The well-being of children and adolescents in Wales, including their mental emotional health, is of paramount importance to this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.6/5">The National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services in Wales (NSF) embeds this philosophy and the setting of targets via the Service and Financial Framework for the NHS in Wales has ensured that services are improving as evidenced by the NSF Self Assessment Audit Tool results for 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.6/6">A review of CAMHS covering all relevant agencies is being undertaken by the Wales Audit Office and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. The outcome of this review, which is expected towards the end of 2008, will contribute positively to future service developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1293W.12/1">There have been two formal studies carried out into the accident risk to pedestrians and cyclists on the A4123 in the last three years. These were A4123 Pedestrian and Cyclists Accidents Birmingham to Wolverhampton Safety Study (April 2005) and The A4123 Operational Review (January 2008). In addition a review of the needs of pedestrians under the Disability Discrimination Act has also been completed for the whole of the route. All resulted in schemes that have either been taken forward or are being considered for future development.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294W.5/1">The majority of central Government Departments are members of the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund (GCOF). The GCOF aims to fulfil the Government's commitment to offset emissions attributable to all official and ministerial air travel in central government. It is available to all central government departments and provides a simple and cost effective way to offset, as well as ensuring high environmental integrity. The GCOF runs for an initial period of three years (2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09).</p>
	<p pid="b.1294W.5/2">The GCOF is being managed by EEA Fund Management Ltd., who won the contract to source and deliver 255,000 certified emission reduction credits, with a provision for a further 50,000 credits, over three years from a range of clean development mechanism(COM) projects. Credits will be supplied from the project portfolio of Trading Emissions Plc, to whom EEA is the investment adviser.</p>
	<p pid="b.1294W.5/3">As a participant in the GCOF, the Department for Transport contributed &pound;13,445.17 to offset air travel in the year 2006-07. In addition, the Government Car and Despatch Agency contributed &pound;22,621.31 to offset Government road fleet emissions. Data are currently being collected for the 2007-08 reporting year and will be available later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.12/2">Thameslink and Crossrail are similar in concept. Both aim to connect together national rail routes with a high frequency metro style service through central London. However, Thameslink uses existing tunnels built in the 19th century, whereas Crossrail will use a new, purpose built tunnel. As a result the constraints on the physical size of the trains are different for the two projects and for that reason it is unlikely that they will be fully compatible.</p>

The figures in Table A are based on population estimates published in 2006 and as such the figures presented in Tables B to D are not directly comparable to the figures in Table A. The totals for the UK population as a whole&mdash;Table A&mdash;will not be equal to the sum of the numbers shown for UK and foreign nationals&mdash;Tables B and D respectively.

	<p pid="b.1301W.2/1">We are committed to helping all people, including deaf people, into suitable, sustainable employment through Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/2">Access to Work can provide a range of individually tailored support to enable disabled people to enter or stay in employment. Access to Work can fund specialist support for deaf and hearing impaired people in work. One type of support that deaf people may find particularly helpful is the funding provided through Access to Work for British Sign Language Interpreters, Lip Speakers or Palantypists.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/3">People with health conditions, including deaf people, may also benefit from the help that is available through Pathways to Work. This service provides extra support and opportunities to help people with health problems and disabilities gain employment and retain it. Pathways to Work provides a series of interviews with an adviser and access to programmes to increase skills or confidence, or to help manage a health condition. Financial incentives may also be available to help people move into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/4">Disability Employment Advisers in Jobcentre Plus work with people needing more extensive support. They need not be receiving benefits and may be in employment but worried about losing their job due to their disability. Disability employment advisers can advise on appropriate employment opportunities, act as advocates on the customer's behalf, and negotiate with employers, as well as refer people, where appropriate, for an occupational health assessment, or draw on the professional expertise of work psychologists specialising in working with disabled people. Disability employment advisers can also advise on specialised support available for disabled people. This includes Work Preparation, WORKSTEP, New Deal for Disabled People where it is in operation, Residential Training Colleges, Job Introduction Scheme and Access to Work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301W.2/5">Between December last year and March of this year, we undertook a public consultation 'Helping people achieve their full potential: Improving specialist disability employment services'. The consultation sought views about ways in which the Access to Work programme and other programmes for disabled people could be further improved, and ways to enhance aspects of the disability employment adviser role. We will publish our response during the summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308W.0/67">The unit tour interval is a less relevant measure when applied to the Corps of Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. This is due to the frequency with which personnel move between formed units within these Corps (the personnel deployed with a unit will be substantially different from the personnel deployed with the same unit on a previous occasion). Unit tour interval data for these Corps are not therefore, routinely collated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1311W.6/86" class="indent">This has proved to be a complex question to answer. You will be aware that most Infantry battalions have deployed on operations at least once in the last five years. The Infantry tend to deploy as formed units with the tour intervals in relation to Army units being based on (a) 'Units' defined as any Regiment deploying with a Regimental Headquarters and more than two Sub Units and (b) 'deployment' as any Unit deploying for four months or more. The Army's Harmony Guidelines recommend that Army units achieve 24 months between each six month operational tour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/87" class="indent">Elements from other Arms and Services regularly deploy as sub-units, on attachment to other units, or as individual augmentees. For example, this is the case for Royal Engineers, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel. Information on some units, such as Logistics have not been included in the return as this would incur disproportionate cost. Although other Corps may deploy with an RHQ and two or more sub units, it may not always be with the same formation or with the same individuals and would therefore make the information very difficult to collate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/88" class="indent">A Squadron is the key unit of deployment for the RAF and figures are collated accordingly. Additional Wings have been formed due to the increasing demand for Force Protection and this is the reason why some Wings have deployed fewer than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/89" class="indent">You can see from the table that while some Army units have undertaken three deployments, others have only completed one. Whilst operations have been continuing in Iraq and Afghanistan, units will also have been covering endorsed standing Military tasks such as commitments in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, the Balkans and the Falkland Islands as well as Public Duties, in addition to conducting essential training and recuperating from operations. Moreover, there have been occasions where one or two sub units of a Battalion or Regiment have deployed, but these instances do not qualify as unit deployments and are therefore not included in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311W.6/90" class="indent">I am sorry that this information has taken so long to compile, but its collation has involved trawling through a substantial amount of information to ensure as full and accurate a response as possible based on the criteria set out above. Now that this detail has been gathered it will be maintained to prevent any such delay occurring in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.11/2">An internal review of the Falklands Jetty at the Sea Mounting Centre (SMC) Marchwood was carried out in 2005. It was concluded that the Jetty can continue to routinely handle military and commercial loads weighing up to 65 tonnes. While requests for the Jetty to be used for heavier loads are still considered, these tend to be handled through alternative facilities at the SMC. The SMC holds no records to suggest it was involved in the planning considerations for the Power Station in 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.11/3">Since Marchwood Power Limited started utilising the SMC in August 2007, the MOD has worked closely with the company to ensure that its requirements are met as practicably and safely as possible.</p>

These vehicles are, however, usually loaded via Roll-On/Roll-Off facilities at the SMC's quayside. Requests for the Jetty to be used for heavier loads are still considered although these tend to be handled through alternative facilities at the Sea Mounting Centre. Prior to 2005, the heaviest load handled from the Falklands Jetty was a 215 tonne reactor in 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.5/1">When the decision to impose a routine weight restriction of 65 tonnes for loads on the Falklands Jetty was made in 2005, no assessment was carried out by MOD of the effects on traffic or the cost of delivering such loads by road. This is because an alternative loading solution exists that involves the acceptance of heavier loads using a floating crane to lift them over the Sea Mounting Centre's quay wall either onto the quayside or waiting rail transportation. To date, some 36 loads for the Marchwood Power Station, weighing between 98 and 171 tonnes, have been moved in this way.</p>

Once these measures have been implemented we will make appropriate arrangements to offset any residual carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.2/1">Our assessment is that policies to reduce energy-related carbon dioxide emissions need not limit efforts to improve energy access in the world's poorest countries; indeed these two objectives could in some instances be complementary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.2/2">Policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions will include adopting cleaner technologies, improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy. In the longer term it will require the use of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.2/3">In developing countries, improved access to reliable and affordable energy services is needed in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Energy access is lowest in rural areas, notably in sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia, often beyond the reach of grid-connected supplies. In these cases, decentralised energy production, using a wide range of renewable and conventional technologies, may offer the best solutions for increasing access to poor households and communities. A recent study by the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme concluded that renewable energy is more economical than conventional energy for many such applications.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has provided both direct and indirect support for education as part of its global response to recent humanitarian crises. In Bangladesh, the UK and other donors provided 400 temporary classrooms following the cyclone in November 2007. Other DFID-funded immediate relief helped to buy textbooks and other learning material for children in the affected areas, as well as providing technical support to help the Bangladesh Government develop a long-term school reconstruction plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.5/2">In Kenya, Mozambique and Chad direct support to education was not provided early on in the crises as DFID's humanitarian response aimed to address the most basic humanitarian needs first&mdash;shelter, food, clean water and health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319W.5/3">UK humanitarian support is also provided through the UN's Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) where DFID remains the largest donor. In 2006, the CERF released approximately &pound;500,000 to UNICEF for education interventions in Chad. Of this allocation, the UK's share amounts to approximately &pound;100,000. Since the start of 2008, Mozambique has been allocated &pound;2.4 million from the CERF, with provisions used towards the education sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.1322W.5/1">During the negotiation of the EU Directive on Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe, DEFRA undertook a review of the automatic monitoring networks taking into account the requirements of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/2">The changes to the Automatic Urban and Rural, and Hydrocarbons networks fall into three broad areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/3" class="indent">(i) A reduction in the number of carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide monitors, commensurate with the generally low levels of both pollutants currently found. However, there will be increased sulphur dioxide monitoring in some areas around particular industrial hotspots.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/4" class="indent">(ii) Movement of oxides of nitrogen monitors from agglomerations to zones, and from urban background to roadside.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/5" class="indent">(iii) The creation of a PM2.5 network, and changes to the PM10 network. In addition to setting the minimum number of PM monitors to be operated, the directive specifies the ratio of PM10:PM2.5 and urban background: roadside sites which must be operated; in both cases this ratio must be between 2:1 and 1:2.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/6">This will result in:</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/7" class="indent">the closure or removal from the network of 20 complete sites</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/8" class="indent">the opening or affiliation into the network of 33 new sites (mainly for PM10/PM2.5 and oxides of nitrogen)</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/9" class="indent">the removal of 51 carbon monoxide analysers</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/10" class="indent">the removal of 32 and the addition of five sulphur dioxide analysers</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/11" class="indent">the movement and/or addition of 29 oxides of nitrogen sites</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/12" class="indent">the addition of 67 PM2.5 sites</p>

	<p pid="b.1322W.5/15" class="indent">the removal of 13 and the addition of four ozone sites</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/16">To date the following have been completed:</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/17" class="indent">the closure or removal from the network of 20 complete sites (from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>).</p>

	<p pid="b.1322W.5/19" class="indent">the addition of 17 local authority sites into the network; a further five sites will be brought into the network during May/June. For the remaining sites, work is ongoing to identify suitable local authority sites to bring into the network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/20" class="indent">the purchase of type approved gaseous analysers for DEFRA-owned sites to replace existing non-type approved equipment. These analysers will be installed during routine site visits during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322W.5/21" class="indent">the installation of 22 reference method equivalent PM10 analysers and the procurement of 11 PM2.5 analysers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1323W.2/1">Methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) has not been detected in farmed livestock in the UK and there is no current evidence that food-producing animals form a reservoir of infection in the UK. The organism has been isolated from dairy cows, pigs and chickens outside the UK, as well as in companion animals (including cats, dogs and horses) both in the UK and elsewhere. Ongoing monitoring of the international picture is being maintained. A 12-month long study to provide an initial overview of the presence of MRSA in breeding pig herds across Europe began in January 2008. This is being carried out under Community legislation. It is anticipated that the results of this study will be published in mid 2009 and that they will inform the direction of future work by DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323W.2/2">DEFRA's Antimicrobial Resistance Co-ordination (DARC) Group continues to provide guidance on policy relating to antimicrobial resistance. The membership of the DARC Group reflects a partnership approach and includes representatives from many organisations involved in both human and animal health throughout the UK. DARC created a MRSA sub-group in 2005, through which DEFRA is assisting and encouraging various initiatives relating to MRSA from the Bella Moss Foundation (a UK registered charity promoting awareness of MRSA in animals), industry and the veterinary profession. DEFRA has funded research to better understand the epidemiology of MRSA in companion animals and livestock and any role it may play in human infections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323W.2/3">In addition to chairing the DARC Group, DEFRA's Veterinary Medicines Directorate have used various means including legislation, publication of guidance and liaison with interested parties, such as the RUMA (Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture) alliance, to achieve a co-ordinated and integrated approach to raise awareness of the issues surrounding antimicrobial resistance in animals and promote the responsible use of antimicrobials.</p>

	<p pid="b.1325W.2/1">To support table valuations, sales data are collected from a large number and wide range of sources across Great Britain. We capture around 98 per cent. of the sales data for cattle sold at public auction, and, in our view, the table valuations reflect the market situation for same category cattle. Table values are only applied for any category in any month if adequate amounts of data have been obtained. Otherwise individual valuation is used to establish market value.</p>

	<p pid="b.1326W.5/1">Acoustic deterrent devices, &quot;pingers&quot;, are required to be used in certain fisheries under Council Regulation (EC) 812/2004. Prior to enforcing the use of pingers, the UK Government wants to be sure that the pingers we recommend to be used are safe and cost-effective for the industry and offer maximum protection to porpoises. The European Commission has recognised that because of deployment problems, some member states are not able to implement pingers as required by the Council Regulation, and have recommended that member states should continue with trials to develop a working pinger. The Sea Mammal Research Unit are currently looking at the effects that a 'super-pinger' has on the population distribution of porpoises. These 'super-pingers' are larger and therefore fewer devices are required, reducing deployment problems. We will consider the results of this research when it becomes available. We are therefore not aware of how many UK vessels are currently using acoustic deterrent devices to reduce by-catch of cetaceans.</p>

	<p pid="b.1329W.8/1">Elephants are at risk from a number of factors including habitat destruction, poaching for ivory and human-elephant conflict. The UK supports several measures to tackle these threats internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329W.8/2">Through its membership of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) the UK works to protect endangered species of plants and animals at threat from trade by controlling and monitoring international trade in them. Since 2005 the UK has made payments to support the work of the Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) and has been funding the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) since 2003-04. These programmes will enable the international community to monitor whether the sale of legally stockpiled ivory has an effect on the amount of poaching and illegal global trade. Since 2003-04, the UK has also supported the work of the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group (AfESG) and in May 2007 allocated &pound;10,000 to support elephant dialogue meetings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331W.2/1">The Joint Nature Conservation Council made the following assessments of the impacts of fishing on the condition of the proposed offshore special areas of conservation (SAC) sites as part of the Offshore Marine Natura consultation process, which took place in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/2" class="italic"> Braemar Pockmarks</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/3">The biological and physical structure of the interest feature at the Braemar pockmarks site are known to have been partially impacted by bottom trawling. This has dispersed, fragmented and possibly buried some of the carbonate formations, and may also have modified the structure of the encircling pockmarks (John Hartley, pers. comm., 2005). However, much of the interest feature is still intact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/4">The prospects of this feature in terms of maintaining its structure in the future (taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort) are good. A mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area if this is deemed to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/5" class="italic"> Scanner Pockmark</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/6">The biological and physical structure of the habitat at the Scanner pockmark site is intact on the available evidence but may have been impacted by bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) (the main commercial demersal stock in the Witch Ground). Bottom trawling could have modified the structure of the pockmark, causing burial of some of the submarine structures, as well as breaking and displacement of carbonate pieces. Some fishing nets were observed caught on the structures. However, the feature appears to be largely undamaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/7">The prospects of this feature to maintain its structure in the future, taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort, are good. A mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area if this is deemed to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/8" class="italic"> North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reef</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/9">The biological and physical structure of the North Norfolk Sandbanks have been impacted locally by some gas extraction infrastructure and aggregate extraction. It is also possible that the fauna of the banks have been impacted by bottom trawling, which may have reduced the number of long-lived or fragile organisms associated with the interest feature. The physical structure of the banks is intact, if not pristine, and the biology is representative of the habitat.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/10">The prospects of this feature to maintain its structure in the future, taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort, are good. Regulations are in place to control oil and gas activity in and around SACs in the UK continental shelf designated area and developments are subject to appropriate assessment if they are likely to affect the features of a SAC. A mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area if this is deemed to be necessary. The aggregates industries' operations are currently subject to environmental assessment, and would be subject to appropriate assessment if likely to affect SAC interest features.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/11" class="italic"> Haig Fras</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/12">Available evidence indicates that the biological and physical structure of the reef interest feature at Haig Fras are intact (Rees, 2000).</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/13">The prospects of this feature to maintain its structure in the future (taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort) are good, since the basic physical structure is resilient to mechanical impacts and the reef is isolated from terrestrial sources of pollution. Due to the shape of the feature, it is likely to be avoided by bottom trawlers which could damage the reef fauna. However, a mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area if this is deemed to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/14" class="italic"> Stanton Banks</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/15">The biological and physical structure of the reef habitat at Stanton Banks is intact to the best of our knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/16">The prospects of this feature in terms of maintaining its structure in the future (taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort) are excellent. A mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area if this is deemed to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/17" class="italic"> Darwin Mounds</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/18">The biological and physical structure of the biogenic reef in this area is mainly intact although some areas have been damaged by bottom trawling. Evidence of damage was provided from sidescan sonar images in 1999 (Bett, 1999). New damage (smashed coral strewn on the sea bed) was also visible over about a half of the Darwin Mounds East during summer 2000 (Bett, 2001). A trawler was operating nearby during the surveys. Reef damage means a loss of not only the habitat itself, but the species assemblages it supports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/19">The prospects of this feature to maintain its structure in the future, taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort, are moderate. The European Commission, at the request of the UK, has adopted common fisheries policy measures which prohibit the use of bottom trawling gear within the SAC boundary. However, it is possible that some further bottom trawling may have occurred in the months before these common fisheries policy measures were in place. Equally, it is possible that illegal fishing activities take place on this site. Therefore, this feature could be degraded by fisheries in spite of reasonable conservation effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/20" class="italic"> Wyville Thomson Ridge</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/21">The biological and physical structure of habitats on Wyville Thomson Ridge is intact on the basis of available evidence, although some scarring from bottom trawling has been observed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331W.2/22">The prospects of this feature to maintain its structure in the future, taking into account unfavourable influences and reasonable conservation effort, are good. A mechanism is available through the European Commission's common fisheries policy regulations to modify fishing activity in the area, if this is deemed to be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336W.8/1">No formal assessment has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.8/2">However, the Government are monitoring levels of fly-tipping and ways in which the effects can be mitigated. In April 2004, the Flycapture database was set up to help local authorities and the Environment Agency improve information on the scale of fly-tipping and to help focus resources and identify trends in this growing environmental crime. Flycapture is enabling central and local government to demonstrate the true nature, extent and scale of fly-tipping, both nationally and locally. The data are being used to develop more effective, evidence-based policies and strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.8/3">DEFRA also funded a research report by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science into the causes and incentives of fly-tipping. The report concludes that there is not one cause of fly-tipping but a number of separate ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.8/4">Assessing the specific effect of the landfill tax on fly-tipping would be extremely difficult, not least because there are a number of different causes of fly-tipping, some of which may need to coincide before a person decides to act illegally. Fly-tipping levels also reflect the level of enforcement and other prevention activity undertaken by the Environment Agency and local authorities, which can offset any increase in illegal activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336W.8/5">Although the research recognises that one of these causes may be the cost of legitimate waste disposal, the landfill tax is an important instrument in reducing our reliance on landfill and moving to more sustainable waste management options. The actual increases, together with the knowledge of the future rate of tax, is sending a strong signal. This will change behaviour, while allowing business time to adjust and make the necessary investment in alternative waste treatment routes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338W.2/1">The UK reported in December 2007 for the first time that the 2010 national emission ceiling for nitrogen oxides (NOx) was likely to be exceeded by some 10 per cent. Though there remain considerable uncertainties with the projections, the increase is a consequence of changes in projections of emissions from energy production, and an improved methodology for predicting emissions from non-road transport mobile sources and machinery. We have commissioned a study to examine options for improving the prospects of achieving compliance, which will be finalised early in May 2008.</p>

I understand Australia is currently considering what, if any, legal avenues are available to challenge Japan's whaling operations.

	<p pid="b.1352W.6/1">The Government established the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 as a single inspectorate to bring together all strands of inspection, monitoring and the regulation of social care services, including care and nursing homes for older people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/2">We introduced national minimum standards (NMS) for care homes, domiciliary care and adult placements. The NMS are intended to ensure vulnerable and older people can live in a safe environment, where their rights and dignity are respected and staff are properly trained. All care homes in England are regulated&mdash;registered and inspected&mdash;by CSCI in accordance with statutory regulations and the NMS. CSCI has a wide range of enforcement powers and will take action to protect the welfare of residents, with the aim of raising the quality of care and level of protection for vulnerable people and ensuring that service users and their families can be confident that their welfare and interests are safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/3">We introduced the Protection of Vulnerable Adults Scheme in July 2004. This scheme, which operates as a work force ban, prevents dangerous or unscrupulous people from gaining access to older and vulnerable people in care homes or being cared for in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/4">On the recommendation of the Bichard inquiry, we are introducing a new centralised vetting and barring scheme for people working with children and vulnerable people. This scheme, as set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, will extend the coverage of the existing barring scheme and draw on wider sources of information to provide a more comprehensive and consistent measure of protection for vulnerable groups across a wide range of settings, including the whole of social care and the national health service. The new scheme will make it far more difficult for abusers to gain access to some of the most vulnerable groups in society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/5">In November 2006, the Department launched the first ever national Dignity In Care campaign. Our intention is to create a care system where there is zero tolerance of abuse and disrespect of older people and a situation where people are as outraged by the abuse of parents and grandparents as they are at the abuse of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/6">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, all health and adult social care providers that come within the scope of registration will be required to register with the new regulator of health and social care services, the Care Quality Commission (CQC). We expect CQC to begin its work in April 2009, when it will take over the duties of CSCI, the Healthcare Commission and the Mental Health Act Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1352W.6/7">CQC will provide assurance of essential levels of safety and quality of care to people using health and adult social care services in England. Our aim is to ensure that the registration system will apply equally to all health and adult social care providers, whether from the NHS, local authority or independent sectors. For the first time, there will be a single coherent, enforceable set of requirements for all providers of these services. In order to be granted registration, care providers will need to demonstrate that they can meet, or are already meeting the registration requirements. To maintain registration, they will be required to demonstrate an ongoing ability to meet those requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1354W.5/1">We will be looking at these and other roles on primary care and specialist services as part of our consideration of the consultation responses to &quot;Valuing People Now&quot;. The deadline for responses to this consultation was <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-28">28 March 2008</phrase> and the responses are currently being analysed. We will publish a revised strategy which takes account of the consultation responses in the early autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/2">The Department's good practice guidance on &quot;Commissioning specialist adult learning disability services&quot;, published in October 2007, highlights the importance of the health facilitation role working with primary care teams, community health professionals and staff involved in delivering secondary health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/3">The information requested on how many learning disability liaison nurses and health facilitators there are in the national health service, and how many of each are on permanent and fixed-term contracts is not held centrally. We do notcollect data on national health service staff contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/4">Information on the numbers of learning disability liaison nurses and health facilitators: neither group is separately identified in the NHS workforce census. However, the number of specialist learning disability nurses is collected in the census and this information is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/5">The information on how many NHS trusts have a disability equality scheme is not collected centrally. All NHS trusts are required under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act to publish disability equality schemes that set out, among other things, how they intend to meet their duties towards disability equality. To assist them in this the Department published best practice guidance&mdash;&quot;Creating a disability equality scheme a practical guide for the NHS&quot;&mdash;in October 2006. Further guidance, specific to learning disabilities, is to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/6">The information requested on how many people with a learning disability had a health action plan in place is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/7">The Department recognises that more needs to be done to improve access to NHS services for people with learning disabilities. That is why health care is one of the key priorities within the &quot;Valuing People Now&quot; consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/8">The Department has committed to a wide-ranging programme of action, set out in the document &quot;Promoting Equality&quot; that was published in March 2007 (and copies of which are available in the Library) to respond to recommendations made by the Disability Rights Commission. This action includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/9" class="indent">a programme of work to support wider implementation of annual health checks for people with learning disabilities;</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/10" class="indent">supporting primary care trusts (PCTs) (as commissioners of health services) in understanding and acting on the needs of people with learning disabilities and involving them in commissioning and reviewing services, in particular through sponsoring PCT commissioning 'exemplar sites';</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/11" class="indent">overseeing work with professional, regulatory and educational bodies to address understanding of learning disability in education and training for general practitioners, nurses and other health staff;</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/12" class="indent">improving the way that the Department of Health and the NHS evaluate key health initiatives for their impact on people with learning disabilities; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/13" class="indent">improving collection and management of information about health needs, services and health outcomes for people with learning disabilities and developing a more coordinated approach to performance monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.5/14">The Department published commissioning guidance for specialist learning disability health services&mdash;&quot;Commissioning specialist adult learning disability health services&mdash;Good practice guidance <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>&mdash;and will shortly publish further guidance on meeting the disability equality duty in relation to people with learning disabilities. The Department is also taking forward a Human Rights in Health Care Programme, helping the NHS to recognise and respect the fundamental human rights of all patients.</p>

In particular, NOMS operates two fast-track schemes for direct entry into operational manager grades&mdash;the intensive development scheme and the senior prison manager programme.

The volume of information required to complete the necessary risk assessment will vary according to the individual circumstances of the prisoner and the type of release applied for. Likewise, data are not held centrally on the number of prisoners released from custody on completion of their sentence while waiting for an application for temporary release to be considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1388W.8/1">The Ministry of Justice has published two annual reports containing statistical information on freedom of information requests received by monitored bodies (including central Government Departments) in 2005 and 2006. These reports can be found at the following address:</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/reference/statisticsAndReports.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/3">The 2007 annual report is currently being drafted for publication in June 2008. However, statistics on requests received in each quarter of 2007 have been published and can be found via the MOJ website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomofinformationquarterly.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/freedomof informationquarterly.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/5">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 requires public bodies to respond to written requests within 20 working days of receipt, but allows additional time for the consideration of the public interest in disclosing the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/6">The published reports provide statistics on the number of requests for information other than routine or &quot;normal course of business&quot; requests received during each period where: an initial response was provided within 20 working days; an initial response was given outside this time but a public interest test extension had been applied; an initial response was given outside this time and no public interest test extension was applied, and where no initial response had been given at the time the statistics were collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/7">The 2006 annual report provides statistics on the duration of the public interest test extensions in that year. Corresponding statistics for 2007 will be available when the 2007 annual report is published.</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/8">Information requests where deadlines were extended beyond 40 days is not collected in the form requested; however Communities and Local Government answered 88 per cent. of resolvable requests &quot;in time&quot; (i.e. meeting the deadline or with a permitted extension) in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1388W.8/9">For 2005 and 2006, the reports show the number of requests received by the Department which were withheld, either in full or in part, where an FOI exemption or EIR exception was applied. For 2007, there were 103 such requests, based on aggregated quarterly statistics from 2007. Requests withheld solely under the exemption applicable to &quot;information available by other means&quot; are not included; statistics on these are not collected centrally because they are treated in the statistics as routine business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1392W.2/1">The Department commissioned research, published in March 2006, looking into the effectiveness of youth training and diversion schemes. The research found that where schemes were evaluated independently there are examples of projects that have achieved clear and demonstrable outcomes for young people. Such outcomes include boosting young people's confidence and motivation; changing attitudes towards offending and antisocial social behaviour; and achieving re-engagement with education. The Wiltshire Fire Service Salamander scheme was not launched until July 2006 and therefore did not form part of the Department's research.</p>

	<p pid="b.1394W.3/1">Information about local authorities' actions under homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority level, in respect of households rather than people. Information reported includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.3/2">Since 2005, data have been collected on the number of accepted households whose reason for loss of last settled home was having left HM forces. In 2007, 211 applicants accepted as owed the main homelessness duty cited the reason for loss of their last settled home as having left HM forces, representing 0.3 per cent. of total acceptances</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.3/3">Information is also available by the priority need of the household. In 2007 there were 36 households accepted as being in priority need primarily as a result of being vulnerable through having served in HM forces. This represents less than 0.1 per cent. of all acceptances in the year. However some ex-forces personnel will be hidden within other priority need categories, for example, the presence of dependent children or having a mental illness), and so will not show up as ex-forces in these figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1394W.3/4">Many of those applicants with the HM forces priority need are likely to have the reason for loss of having left HM forces accommodation, so there will be overlap between the two figures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1394W.3/6">Rough sleeping among ex-armed forces personnel has dropped. There are no specific data for 1997 but studies at the time suggested between a quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces at some stage. There is specific information for London provided under the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN) recording system. In 2006-07, for those rough sleepers in London contacted by services, 5 per cent. had spent some time in the armed forces in the past. This has remained consistent over the last four years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1395W.5/1">Under section 167 of the Housing Act 1996 (&quot;the 1996 Act&quot;), local authorities must allocate housing in accordance with their allocation scheme. Such schemes must give reasonable preference to certain categories of person (e.g. those who are homeless, those in overcrowded housing and those who need to move on medical or welfare grounds). The legislation also allows (but does not require) local authorities to take into account other factors in determining relative priorities between those in the reasonable preference categories, including whether or not a person has a local connection with the local authority district. Local connection is defined by s.199 of the 1996 Act. This is particularly relevant in the case of service personnel, since, under the current legislation, a person will not establish a local connection with an area because of residence or employment while he is posted there in the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.5/2">The homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) provides an important safety net for people who become homeless or threatened with homelessness. In particular, English local housing authorities must secure suitable accommodation for applicants who are eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and fall within a priority need group. The priority need groups include applicants who are vulnerable for some reason, including those vulnerable as a result of having been a member of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395W.5/3">The Housing and Regeneration Bill which is currently before Parliament will amend section 199 to remove the provisions which prevent members of the armed forces from establishing a local connection in a district through employment or residence and will ensure that members of the armed forces are put on an equal footing with civilians when applying to local authorities for social housing and/or homelessness assistance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1400W.2/1">Sir Michael Pitt's interim conclusion from his inquiry into the lessons learned from the floods last summer, is that the new policy in Planning Policy Statement 25 Development and Flood Risk (PPS25), is sound but should be rigorously applied by local authorities. Work on achieving this is already well in hand. The Practice Guide to PPS25, which will provide practical advice to local authorities on implementing the policy, is due to be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400W.2/2">We have decided to amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order) 1995, so that in future, householders will only be able to pave over their front gardens without planning permission, if the surface provided would be permeable. We are taking this step because surface water run-off was a significant contributory factor to last summer's floods. We anticipate this amendment coming into force in October.</p>

	<p pid="b.1402W.11/1">The subject of the welfare of the horses which serve the tourism industry at Petra is one of real concern to many British visitors. There is a long history of efforts to improve the lot of the horses at Petra. The Brook hospital is well established there, providing veterinary care for the horses and awareness-raising for their owners for over 20 years. Although a great deal has been achieved over the years, there is still a need to improve the standards of treatment and welfare for the horses and further improvement on the ground is likely to take some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1402W.11/2">While my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has no plans to raise this specific issue with the Minister of Tourism of Jordan, officials in London have raised this with the Jordanian embassy in London and our ambassador in Amman will be taking up this issue with a range of relevant individuals and organisations in Jordan.</p>

Credits will be supplied from the project portfolio of Trading Emissions plc, to whom EEA is the investment adviser.</p>

	<p pid="b.1422W.5/1">The lead responsibility for responding to the needs of young people who have run away from home/care, including funding local initiatives if appropriate, lies with local authorities under their broader responsibilities to safeguard vulnerable young people. The Department does not routinely fund local provision, but has made funding (totalling &pound;410,500 in 2006/07 and 2007/08) available to the London Refuge, following on from the community-based refuge pilots, to support the Refuge while they develop alternative sustainable funding sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/2">Ensuring the safety and well-being of all children and young people, including those who run away from home or care, is important to this Government. In 2002, &pound;2 million was committed over three years to pilot community based refuges for young runaways, with a subsequent evaluation of these pilots. In 2006/07, &pound;31,000 was given to The Children's Society to support their research on how effectively local authorities were responding to the needs of young runaways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.5/3">Following The Children's Society report &quot;Stepping Up&quot; (August 2007) a cross- departmental working group on young runaways was established, supported by a consultative group made up of experts from the voluntary sector, to drive improvements in services for young runaways. An action plan, to be published in June, will set out ongoing actions to improve services at local, regional and national level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1422W.8/1">The Department is continuing to support huge capital investment in schools. Over CSR07 this will total &pound;21.9 billion. This is invested through a combination of our strategic, targeted and devolved programmes to local authorities and schools. Investment priorities take account of a number of factors, including the need to expand schools&mdash;which is subject to the local decision making process. Accordingly, the Department does not collect information centrally on the number of applications to local authorities for capital funding to support school expansions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.8/2">Available data show that (i) between 1999 (the first year for which information is available) and 2006, there were 20 approved proposals from schools to enlarge and increase the admission number by 27 or more, 16 approved proposals to enlarge sixth forms, and 444 smaller expansions; (ii) between 2006 and January 2008 the figures were 22, 36, and 102; and (iii) since January 2008, the figures are nine, four, and eight. We do not have figures on which of these schools were over-subscribed, or which involved a capital cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1422W.8/3">Additionally, since 2004 the Department has also operated a funding mechanism whereby successful and popular schools can, with or without the support of their local authority, apply for funding toward to the cost of expanding by a form of entry. Provided they meet the criteria set out in guidance, capital support will follow provided the expansion is agreed through the local decision making process. 22 such expansions have been agreed, and additional bids are currently being considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1425W.12/2">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) was established by the Government in 2001 to act as the UK's independent financial regulator. As part of its supervision of insurance firms, the FSA takes a risk-based approach to discussing demographic considerations with insurers, for example when assessing the robustness of an insurer's approach to risk management. The FSA requires insurers to sign off their annual returns through auditors and actuaries. This would typically involve an assessment of the impact of demographic trends.</p>

	<p pid="b.1427W.2/5">The FSA have in the last 12 months taken part in a total of 11 broadcast media appearances on the issue, including a number of radio interviews and TV appearances on programmes such as the Money Programme and the BBC News at 1. The Police have likewise been working with the media, for example targeting publications that cater to the most at risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.1427W.2/6">In the last 12 months, the FSA have also opened 250 boiler room inquiries, and the names of 215 boiler room firms have been added to their unauthorised firms list, an average of 18 per month. No estimate of cases of fraud involving boiler room operations in 2007 is available. However, the Office of Fair Trading published a report in December 2006 entitled 'Research on impact of mass marketed seams', which did assess the number of victims of high-risk investment scams more widely. The number of victims of boiler room fraud specifically could not be disaggregated from this total.</p>
