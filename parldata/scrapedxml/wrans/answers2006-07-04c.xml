	<p pid="c.897W.4/2">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not directly undertake work in this area, but closely monitors research commissioned by the European Union, Research Councils and other Government Departments to identify, characterise, and assess the impact of aircraft emissions on global climate change.</p>
	<p pid="c.897W.4/3">A major scientific report assessing the contribution of aircraft to climate change, &quot;Aviation and the Global Atmosphere&quot;, was published in 1999 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More recently, research carried out under the EU 5th Framework Project, TRADEOFF, has improved modelling techniques and reduced estimates of contrail radiative forcing by two fold compared with the previous estimate from the IPCC. Research carried out under the TRADEOFF project also supported the conclusion that aviation potentially enhances cirrus cloud coverage.</p>
	<p pid="c.897W.4/4">Aircraft-induced cirrus clouds reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth, and so mitigate global warming. However, significant uncertainty surrounding this area of study makes it difficult to assess whether increased cloudiness would reduce or increase global warming trends.</p>

	<p pid="c.897W.7/1">The rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1997 and 2004 was caused by higher than anticipated levels of economic growth and the recent rise in global energy prices which has altered the relative prices of coal and gas. However, CO2 emissions were still about 5.6 per cent. below 1990 levels and we expect CO2 emissions to fall again in the future given longer term expectations on fuel prices and as a result of policies introduced under the new Climate Change Programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.898W.5/2">Defra has assessed research on the value and uses of the gamma interferon (gIFN) blood test in other countries, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Europe. The test is now a standard tool in the cattle testing armoury of European countries with endemic TB problems, like the Republic of Ireland, Italy, Spain, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="c.898W.5/3">The gIFN test can detect some infected animals that are negative in the SICCT test (skin test) and may detect animals at an earlier stage of infection. However, the gIFN test is slightly less specific than the SICCT test, which means that it is also more likely to incorrectly identify negative animals as being infected.</p>
	<p pid="c.898W.5/4">In addition to evidence from overseas research, and in order to further improve bTB diagnostics, the Government have conducted a field trial to assess the potential benefits of using of the gIFN blood test in GB. This helped to establish that the use of this test, in parallel with the skin test, has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle where TB has been confirmed, and so hasten the elimination of infected cattle. Preparations are now being made for wider use of the gIFN test in prescribed circumstances. The results of the field trial on gIFN usage will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.899W.11/4">Defra's Business Resource and Efficiency Programme (BREW) funds a number of initiatives designed to help business use resources more efficiently and thus reduce waste. For example, Envirowise provides free advice to business on resource efficiency. The National Industrial Symbiosis Programme enables businesses to divert waste from landfill. The South West regional development agency manages local BREW funds within the region.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-04c.81120.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-07-04c.901W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" colnum="901W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060704/text/60704w0001.htm#06070447001509">
	<p pid="c.901W.5/1">The cause of the green bloom in the waters of the Hampshire Avon below Amesbury is likely to be a combination of environmental factors, including high temperatures, low water flow and consequential increases in the concentration of nutrients. There have been no significant pollution incidents at this location in the river. Rainfall and river flows have been significantly depressed over the last 20 months and, in combination with other environmental factors, this may create opportunities for algal growth. However, the May 2006 period was characterised by periods of very high rainfall. Urban and agricultural runoff may lead to direct discolouration and also contribute to nutrient enrichment in the river.</p>
	<p pid="c.901W.5/2">There is, and has been, significant investment and action to improve the quality for the Hampshire Avon in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.901W.5/3">For example, four Wessex Water sewage treatment works discharging into the River Avon have had phosphate stripping installed in their treatment process as part of the previous environmental programme periodic review. Wessex Water's current water quality environment programme for 2005-10 includes schemes to further reduce nutrient loads from sewage effluent discharges. By the end of the 2010 period, two additional sewage treatment works discharging into the River Avon are expected to receive phosphate stripping and the phosphate limits set for the four original works are expected to be reduced to half of their currently permitted limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.901W.5/4">In addition, as part of the requirement introduced by the habitats directive, the Environment Agency have asked Wessex Water to review their abstractions on the Hampshire Avon and assess their effect on the ecology of the river. The findings from this project, which will conclude by March 2008, will contribute to the Habitats Directive Review of Consents and may result in a requirement to reduce the amount of water abstracted by the water company, or for other improvements to be made in the companies' water management operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.901W.5/5">Most recently, the Hampshire Avon catchment has been identified as a priority catchment under the England Catchment-Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative (ECSFDI). The key objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of agricultural pollution and encourage farmers to take action to mitigate the impact of agriculture on the water environment, including the reduction of nutrient inputs.</p>
	<p pid="c.901W.5/6">The water framework directive (WFD) is a key driver of future action on water quality. The directive came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-22">22 December 2000</phrase> and requires member states to establish a range of measures to manage water quality by 2009 and to make them operational by 2012. A central objective of the directive is that water bodies should aim to reach good ecological and chemical status by 2015. We are working with stakeholders to develop mechanisms to tackle pressures, including both point and diffuse sources, for inclusion in River Basin Management Plans, and aim to consult on potential options for tackling non-agricultural, agricultural and hydromorphological pressures in the later part of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.905W.5/2">Progress has been good. In addition to the earlier successes of the eradication of polio and the elimination of neonatal tetanus and the increasing distribution of bed nets and their re-treatment (up from 7 per cent. in 2002 to 71 per cent. in 2004-05), the health service has taken on a rapid increase in antiretroviral treatment for HIV and AIDS. 50 sites have treated 46,000 people up from 3,000 two years ago. This is making a real difference: both saving lives and improving the quality of life of those living with HIV and AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.5/3">Critical to this success has been the additional resources made available at hospital and clinic level as a result of the increased aid channelled through the health SWAp. The Emergency Human Resources Programme has in its first year recruited an extra 580 Malawian health professionals. There are 60 volunteer specialists and nurse tutors from overseas filling key vacant posts. The intake of Malawian trainee nurses and doctors has been increased in anticipation of the improvements in infrastructure at training schools that are now under way. New, internationally recruited senior managers have taken over the central medical stores management and are charged with bringing to an end the perennial stock outs that have frustrated the health services. A new maternal mortality road map offers a way forward to address the unacceptably high level of maternal deaths in Malawi. The Ministry of Health is entering service level agreements with private sector providers, particularly the Christian Hospital Association of Malawi, that will also provide the basic essential health package free-of-charge at point of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.905W.5/4">We are encouraging the Government of Malawi to plan for universal access for HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment and to address the further human resources and management requirements that will create. We stand ready to help.</p>

	<p pid="c.907W.6/19">The UK's Regular Budget and Technical Cooperation Fund payments are fixed by reference to slightly modified standardised UN contribution rates. The modification arises because the state membership of the IAEA is not identical to that of the UN, and developing countries were initially &quot;shielded&quot; from paying the full costs of the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. The UK accordingly, this year, paid 6.137 per cent. of the total Regular Budget. The future level of the annual UK contribution to the IAEA will be determined by UN contribution rates at the time.</p>

Additional non-financial &quot;in-kind&quot; support to help the Agency deliver its safeguards and other activities is provided through the UK nuclear industry, however the financial value of this could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.6/21">The UK remains committed to our contribution to the IAEA and the only review of the UK contribution we would seek is to manage down the budget through the achievement of organisational efficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.907W.6/22">The UK's contribution to the European Atomic Energy Agency (EAEA) is paid through the UK's general contribution to the European Commission's budget. The EAEA's share of the UK contribution could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.908W.2/2">As clause 399 subsection (2) of the Company Law Reform Bill sets out, the purpose of the Business Review is to inform members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 158, which requires a director, in performing his duty to promote the success of the company, to have regard (among other matters) to: (a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, (b) the interests of the company's employees, (c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, (d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment, (e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and (f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company. Subsection (4) of clause 399 requires that the Review is a balanced and comprehensive analysis of (a) the development and performance of the company's business during the financial year, and (b) the position of the company's business at the end of that year, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The statutory provisions therefore set out the framework of the Business Review, but it is for directors of each company to determine its content according to the circumstances of the particular company. As subsection (6) requires, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance and position of the company's business, the review must include analysis using key performance indicators. Such indicators will make it easier for members to assess the development, performance and position of the company from year to year.</p>

	<p pid="c.919W.2/1">Responses to the Department's consultation document &quot;Culture at the Heart of Regeneration&quot;, published in June 2004, made clear the huge interest there is in culturally-driven regeneration in a variety of contexts, both urban and rural.</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.2/2">We know, therefore, that culture can be a driving force in achieving urban regeneration. Examples of where this has happened can be found right across the country, from the iconic cultural buildings of Newcastle-Gateshead and Salford Quays to the Eden Centre in Cornwall. We are working across Government and with our cultural bodies to ensure that the value of culture is understood by planners, developers and others, and supports regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="c.922W.8/1">Two formulae influence different parts of local authorities' transport capital allocations from the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.8/2">Firstly a formula is used to distribute the vast majority of the funding support provided for capital highways maintenance. The factors currently considered in this formula relate to roads and bridges. For roads, they are the lengths and conditions of an authority's principal, classified non-principal and unclassified roads. For bridges, they are the size of the bridge stock and the numbers of bridges requiring strengthening or major maintenance. A minimum amount for bridges per authority of &pound;100,000 is applied. The combined roads and bridges allocations are adjusted to ensure an authority's total allocation does not vary by more than 25 per cent. from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.922W.8/3">Secondly, a formula is being introduced to influence the distribution of the integrated transport block (which is for improvements to local roads and public transport, each of which generally costs less than &pound;5 million). The factors considered in this formula are related directly or indirectly to the transport shared priorities, as agreed between Government and the Local Government Association in 2002. The priorities and variables are shown in the following table. In addition, the formulaic distribution of funding takes into account previous ministerial commitments, European Union objective one designations and South East growth areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.932W.2/1">As my right hon. Friend the then Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) set out in his written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 44-46W, the new constitution provides for a modern and mature relationship between the UK and Gibraltar. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism. The constitution confirms the right of self-determination of the Gibraltarian people. The realisation of that right must be promoted and respected in conformity with the provisions of the UN Charter and any other applicable international treaties. Gibraltar's right of self-determination is not constrained by the Treaty of Utrecht except insofar as Article X gives Spain the right of refusal should Britain ever renounce Sovereignty. Thus independence would only be an option with Spanish consent. Her Majesty's Government recognise that the act of deciding on their acceptance of the new constitution in the forthcoming referendum will be an exercise of the right of self-determination by the Gibraltarian people in that context.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.2/2">The new constitution does not in any way diminish British sovereignty and gives Gibraltar much greater control over its internal affairs and that degree of self-government compatible with British sovereignty and the UK's continuing international responsibilities. If the new constitution is agreed the UK will retain its full international responsibility for Gibraltar, including for Gibraltar's external relations and defence, and as the member state responsible for Gibraltar in the EU. The UK's long standing commitment that the UK will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes will be unchanged. This is also set out clearly in the Despatch which will be published at the same time as the Gibraltar Constitution Order and the draft of which I will place in the Library of the House. I will also send a copy to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.932W.2/3">It has also been the UK's long standing view that none of its remaining overseas territories, including Gibraltar, should remain on the UN list of non self-governing territories, despite the different circumstances affecting Gibraltar, namely the application of the Treaty of Utrecht as noted earlier. However, the criteria used by the UN are outdated and fail to take account of the way that relationships between the UK and its overseas territories have been modernised. The UK does not, therefore, engage formally to seek the removal of any of the overseas territories from the UN list.</p>

	<p pid="c.943W.8/1">All allocations by the Housing Executive and registered housing associations are made on the basis of need as determined by the points awarded under the Common Selection Scheme&mdash;a scheme that was equality proofed and subject to detailed and widespread consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.943W.8/2">The Housing Executive is recognised by all sections of the community as being extremely fair in its allocations policies. However, applicants for social housing have a choice of where they wish to live and as a result less than 10 per cent. of social housing is integrated, the majority of people preferring to live in areas where they felt comfortable. The choice of where to live therefore impacts significantly on the number of allocations that can be made in specific areas, as this depends on the availability of social housing, whether through new building or re-letting of existing stock. In some areas demand is greater than supply, while in others, the opposite is true and allocations cannot therefore be made at the same ratio for all areas. This does mean that some people will have to consider other areas in order to be re-housed or have to wait longer before they are re-housed. To make allocations on the basis of religious belief would be illegal under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.943W.8/3">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive formulates plans and programmes for additional new social housing taking account of demography, current and anticipated supply as well as current and projected demand. This effectively targets additional supply on areas with the greatest demand ensuring that assessed need is met.</p>

	<p pid="c.946W.8/1">Our approach to tackling knife crime has been different to that in other parts of the UK. We have participated in the national knife amnesty, but this has been accompanied by a year-long public information campaign aimed at addressing the culture of knife carrying among young people, which is unique to Northern Ireland. In addition to this, an education package will begin in schools in September and other measures will be introduced, including the raising of the minimum age at which a knife can be legally purchased to 18-years-old. It is our intention to hold a further knife amnesty during 2006, which again is unique to Northern Ireland and this will help us to gauge how effective these initiatives have been.</p>
	<p pid="c.946W.8/2">During the amnesty almost 900 items were handed in. In addition, the incidence of knife crime during the period of the amnesty fell by 30 per cent. This is clearly a good start and evidence that the amnesty has had an impact. However we intend to continue to address the problem of knife crime and I hope to make further announcements in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.951W.5/8" class="indent">Included in the package were a number of schemes aimed at improving passing opportunities along the remaining stretch of single carriageway. Following the completion of these works, no further major improvements to the A8 are planned at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.5/9" class="indent">As regards the Al route, there is currently 21 Km of the route between Loughbrickland and the Border which is still single carriageway.</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.5/10" class="indent">Roads Service is progressing 3 projects for the improvement of these remaining sections to dual carriageway standard. They are:</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.5/11" class="indent">the Loughbrickland to Beech Hill scheme which is currently under construction and completion is anticipated in the Autumn 2006;</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.5/12" class="indent">the Beech Hill to Cloghogue scheme, the contract for which is expected to be awarded in Spring 2007. This scheme is progressing through the necessary statutory processes and was the subject of a public inquiry into the Vesting of the land during June 2006. It forms part of our PPP Package 2 with completion expected in late 2009 (subject to satisfactory completion of statutory processes); and</p>
	<p pid="c.951W.5/13" class="indent">the Cloghogue to the Border section, which forms part of a larger joint cross-border scheme to link Newry to the Republic of Ireland's Ml north of Dundalk. It is currently under construction with completion anticipated before the end of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.952W.2/1">The Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, Mr. Geoff Allister, has written to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mr. Geoff Allister, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding which junctions of the Eastern Transport Corridor between Larne and Newry do not have a right hand turning lane; and what plans he has to upgrade these junctions.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Acting Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/5" class="indent">The Eastern Seaboard Corridor is essentially comprised of the A8 Larne to Belfast road, the M2 Motorway, the A12 Westlink, the Ml Motorway and the Al to the Border, south of Newry. I can advise that on the A8 Larne to Belfast road the junctions which do not have a right hand turning lane are those at Ballygowan Road/Deerpark Road and Ballygowan Road South. However, a right turn facility at the Ballygowan/Deerpark Road junction will be constructed later this financial year, and a similar facility will be constructed at the Ballygowan Road South junction during the 2007/2008 financial year. The only other section of the A8 with no dedicated facilities for right turning movements is the section of single carriageway between Coleman's Corner and Ballynure.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/6" class="indent">You will possibly be aware that the Belfast Metropolitan Transportation Plan supports dualling this section, including the completion of the Ballynure Bypass. Subsequently, the Department has sought, through the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan, to protect the land required for this scheme. It is currently expected that the implementation of this scheme will be outside the 2015 Plan period. On completion of the dual carriageway, the priority junctions will be reduced to left-in left-out, without the need to perform right turns, other than at the main roundabouts.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/7" class="indent">On the Al Belfast to Newry road, there are currently two junctions which do not have a right turn facility. These are Ashgrove Road, which is just north of the Damolly Roundabout on the approach to Newry and to the west side of the Al, and Cloughanramer Road which is just north of the Damolly Roundabout and to the east of the A1. However, this section of the Al will be superseded by the planned Beech Hill to Cloghogue dual carriageway upgrade, which is included in Package 2 of Roads Service's Public Private Partnership Project.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/8" class="indent">Right turn movements at all other junctions along the Eastern Seaboard Corridor are accommodated within the approach lanes to roundabouts, central reserve deceleration lanes, or grade separated junctions with slip roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.952W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.961W.15/2">The information requested is not available. The information that is available is in the table. Carer's allowance is payable to carers of state pension age who meet the conditions of entitlement to the allowance and do not receive a state pension, or where the weekly rate of state pension paid is lower than the weekly rate of carer's allowance. In those cases a reduced rate of carer's allowance is paid to bring the total amount of state pension and carer's allowance paid up to the carer's allowance weekly rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.961W.15/3">Carer's allowance and state pension cannot be paid at the same time because both of them are non-income-related benefits designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or forgone income.</p>
	<p pid="c.961W.15/4">In cases where these arrangements preclude the payment of carer's allowance, the carer's entitlement to the allowance gives them access to the carer premium, currently &pound;26.35 a week, in the income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit and to the equivalent additional amount for carers in pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.975W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The Cardinal raised several issues with the Secretary of State including the 24-week time limit on abortion. The Secretary of State reiterated the Government's position that it has long been the parliamentary convention that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government believes this should still be the case and it has no plans to change the law on abortion.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.979W.8/2">District nurses and their teams will play a key role in the future, especially to meet the needs of an ageing population, to support people with long-term conditions and care for people who choose to die at home. There will be a need for nurses with specialist skills and knowledge to lead and provide care for patients in the community. Their role will develop in response to the transfer of care to the community, new technologies, new roles such as community matrons, and patient choice. These changes will require nurses in the community to develop new skills, work in new ways and be part of integrated teams across hospital and community, general practice and social care.</p>

It was agreed that this should be discussed further after the EC has published its discussion documents on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/4">FSA officials have considered the papers provided by the German Government on the safety of boron. FSA officials have discussed with the EC the fact that the issue under consideration is the addition of substances to the annexes in the food supplements directive and, not at this stage, to agree maximum levels for individual vitamins and minerals. The FSA is considering this and the EC is awaiting its advice before there is a further discussion at the EC standing committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/5">The FSA has received a copy of the report published by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany, which outlines recommended levels for certain vitamins and minerals. A response to the report is not planned. No proposals on setting levels have been published by the EC to date, and member states have yet to indicate their negotiating positions.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/6">The outcome of preliminary discussions by the FSA board on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, in the absence of EC proposals, has formed the basis of discussions with member states on this issue. The UK strategy has been to encourage discussion with other key member states and to engage in discussions on this subject at this early stage, prior to papers being published by the EC. This strategy has been developed to implement the objectives of Health Ministers. A number of meetings have been held with member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/7">Right hon. and hon. Members will be updated on the food supplements directive via ministerial correspondence and replies to parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.982W.0/8">No meetings have been held with Ministers from other European Union member states on the food supplements directive. A letter has been sent to all Ministers advising them of the preliminary discussions by the FSA board in September 2005 on setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.</p>

Figures for deaths in males and females aged 14 to 40 years for land transport accidents, suicide or injury/poisoning of undetermined intent, alcohol-related causes, and assault are shown in the attached tables for each year from 1988 to 2005. I am placing copies of these tables in the House of Commons Library. Data for 1986 and 1987 are not available for area boundaries that are consistent with subsequent years and have not therefore been provided. Figures for drug misuse are only available from a special database containing deaths occurring from 1993-2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.1002W.2/2">Misuse of mobile phones was one of the specific issues considered by the Practitioners' Group on School Behaviour and Discipline, in its report &quot;Learning Behaviour&quot; (October 2005). The report points to the fact that, while mobile phones are now a part of daily life, head teachers need a clear policy on their possession and use on school site. The current Education and Inspections Bill re-enacts and strengthens the duty on schools to establish a behaviour policy. The accompanying Explanatory Notes require</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;the head teacher to determine measures (which may include rules and provision for enforcing them) that promote self-discipline and a proper regard for authority, encourage good behaviour and respect for others, prevent bullying, secure that tasks are completed, and generally secure an acceptable standard of behaviour by pupils&quot; (Clause 76).</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.2/4">We will be producing guidance on that duty which will specifically address the issue of mobile phone misuse.</p>
	<p pid="c.1002W.2/5">The seriousness with which bullying by mobile phone should be treated is referred to in our anti-bullying guidance pack for schools &quot;Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;.

	<p pid="c.1004W.0/1">The Department collects data on the number of interventions provided but not on the number of young people receiving support.

	<p pid="c.1004W.0/2">Departmental guidance is that, to count as an intervention there needs to be some element of assistance involving a substantial or meaningful exchange with the young person. This should be of enough significance to be noted in their client record. It would normally exclude straightforward referrals to specific opportunities, e.g. job submissions, the provision of factual information and simple follow up to find out if the young person still wanted assistance.</p>

With a school maintained by a local authority, the responsibility for ensuring that this happens is likely to be shared between the local authority, the governing body and the head teacher.</p>

	<p pid="c.1012W.8/1">To promote the study of foreign languages for learners of all ages, the Government published its national languages strategy: 'Languages for All: Languages for Life&mdash;a strategy for England' in December 2002. To oversee the implementation of the strategy, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills appointed Dr. Lid King as national director for languages in September 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.8/2">In March 2005, the Secretary of State announced a &pound;115 million &quot;Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning until March 2008. For primary schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To date we have trained over 2,000 new primary teachers with a specialism in languages. Last October we published, in hard copy and online, our 'Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages', which sets out learning objectives for the four years of key stage 2. It is supported by a national training programme, guidance and a planning tool.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.8/3">The funding will also support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11 to 18-year-olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational options at key stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies. We are also funding a range of projects and materials to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support. For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to produce 'Languages Work', a suite of materials designed to promote the value of language learning, support take-up of languages beyond key stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future employability.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.8/4">Our key stage 3 strategy continues to impact positively on pupils' attainment in languages, especially boys. We plan to provide additional key stage 3 strategy training for teachers in the next academic year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.8/5">We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications. Most significantly, in September 2005 the new national, voluntary languages recognition scheme, the languages ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is currently available in eight languages, including Mandarin Chinese. In September 2006, 13 other languages will be made available through the scheme. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date over 800 centres&mdash;including local authorities and specialist language colleges&mdash;have registered to take part in the scheme, with over 10,000 learners entered for qualifications across all sectors taking over 26,000 qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.1012W.8/6">To address the decline in take-up at key stage 4, my predecessor wrote to all secondary schools setting out her expectations that, from September 2006, 50-90 per cent. of a school's key stage 4 cohort should study a foreign language leading to a recognised qualification.</p>

These bodies represent faith groups, teachers and local schools. For schools with a religious designation the syllabus is drawn up by the governing body according to the trust deed of the school.

	<p pid="c.1016W.0/1">To promote the study of foreign languages for learners of all ages, the Government published their National Languages Strategy: &quot;Languages for All: Languages for Life&mdash;a Strategy for England&quot; in December 2002. The cornerstone of the strategy is that by 2010 all Key Stage 2 pupils will have the opportunity to study a foreign language in class time. It is for individual schools to decide which languages they offer depending on their expertise and access to resources and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/2">At Key Stages 3 and 4, secondary schools must give access to at least one course in an official working language of the European Union that leads to an approved qualification. The official working languages of the European Union, for which there are approved qualifications, are: Danish, Dutch, French, German, Modern Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. Once this offer has been made schools may then decide to offer additional languages. Approved qualifications are available in a wide range of languages in the categories raised in the question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/3">Ancient languages do not form part of the national curriculum. It is for individual schools and their governing bodies to decide whether to include the classics&mdash;including classical languages&mdash;in their respective curriculum. Their decision may depend on demand for the subject, having a specialist classics teacher available to teach it, and in meeting the needs of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/4">As part of our Specialist Schools Programme, secondary schools can apply to become humanities colleges. As part of this specialism, schools have the option to focus on the teaching and learning of classical studies (that is, Latin, Classical Greek and classical civilisation) alongside a core humanities option of History, Geography or English.</p>
	<p pid="c.1016W.0/5">In 2005 the Department launched the Languages Ladder&mdash;the national, voluntary recognition scheme for languages&mdash;as an alternative qualification route to complement existing qualifications. The Languages Ladder endorses achievement in language skills at all levels of competence for all ages. It is available currently in eight languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Panjabi, Spanish and Urdu. A further 13 languages, in the first three stages of the scheme, will be added in September this year and will include: Arabic, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Modern Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish and Yoruba.</p>

	<p pid="c.1034W.2/1">The Department has commissioned research to assess compliance with statutory National Nutritional Standards and to measure food consumption in maintained schools in England. A study of 'School Meals in Secondary Schools in England' reported in 2004 (DfES Research Report 557). A similar 'Study of School Meals in Primary Schools in England' has been conducted, and reported on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June 2006</phrase> (DfES Research Report 753).</p>
	<p pid="c.1034W.2/2">The Annual Schools Census collects data on free school meal eligibility and take up. An internal DfES survey of local authorities (LA) was conducted in November 2005 to assess the nature of school meal provision and providers, the patter of commercial provision and contractual arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1034W.2/3">The Department has asked the School Food Trust (SFT) as part of its remit to monitor progress on school meals and report regularly to the Department. The SFT plans to collect information about school meals provision using several approaches. First, they are working with Ofsted and the national Healthy Schools Programme to develop a way of assessing whether or not the new DfES standards for school meals are being met. The intention is for this to be completed by early 2007. Second, they plan to undertake national sample surveys of primary and secondary schools' food provision and consumption, similar to the two studies commissioned by the Department. These provide baseline information against which the change in the national profile of provision and consumption of foods in school meals can be evaluated. The timing and scale of the national sample surveys will be confirmed by the end of August 2006. Finally, the SFT has just completed a survey addressed to all local authority catering providers in England to assess school meal take-up, the costs of providing a school meal, factors believed to be associated with increases or decreases in take-up, and perceived barriers to change. The survey will be published in July 2006 and repeated annually at the end of each financial year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1037W.2/2">The Department for Communities and Local Government recently published guidance for schools on the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, &quot;Fire Safety Risk Assessment&mdash;Educational Premises&quot;. This states that the responsibility for complying with the Fire Safety Order rests with the &quot;responsible person&quot;. With a school maintained by a local authority, the duties of the responsible person are likely to be shared between the local authority, the governing body and the head teacher. One of the prime duties of the responsible person is to appoint one or more competent persons&mdash;someone with sufficient training, knowledge and experience to carry out the preventive and protective measures required by the Fire Safety Order. The guidance covers what these are. In Part 1, section 3.41 deals with fire detection and warning systems, and 3.42 with firefighting equipment and facilities. They give advice on what to look for in school premises and provide checklists for both detection and firefighting.</p>

In the south-west as a whole there are 78 children's centres offering services to 57,155<sup>(2)</sup> children under five and their families including 2,234 child care places. Data on how many children have accessed services are based on information collected for Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) because data on numbers using children's centres are not yet available.</p>

The latest information available (at March 2005) shows on average 30 per cent.<sup>(3)</sup> of children in the Somerset and on average 25 per cent.<sup>(4)</sup>of children overall in SSLPs in the south-west had significant contact (that is, a home visit or attendance at a centre-based activity) with Sure Start.</p>
	<p pid="c.1037W.5/3">Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) were set up between 1999 and 2003 offering a range of services to children under four years of age and their families living in defined areas. In 2002, Mini Sure Start programmes were set up in rural areas and pockets of deprivation that would not normally be covered by larger SSLPs. All SSLPs and mini programmes are becoming Sure Start children's centres and will offer services to children under five years of age and their families. Information about the percentage of children reached by SSLP services is now collected once a year. The Department does not keep data on how many children have participated in Mini Sure Start programmes. However, each programme typically covers between 150 and 170 children under four in their catchment areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1040W.5/1">School security is a local matter. Under health and safety law, it is for individual school employers to determine what measures a school should take to keep pupils and staff safe. In the main, schools are very safe places and the majority of pupils have never carried a knife. It is a criminal offence to carry an offensive weapon on school premises. Where schools have suspicions they can call the police, and should do so if they believe pupils or staff are at risk of serious harm. Schools and local police can agree a Safer School Partnership to prevent crime in and around a school. We also propose a power in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to enable schools to search, without consent, pupils they suspect are carrying a knife or other weapon.</p>

The disclosure service operates as a contract between the Criminal Records Bureau and Capita Business Services based upon a public private partnership agreement. Under this agreement, Capita are required to perform contractually specified services and to develop, deliver and maintain the technical infrastructure of the disclosure service. This is to enable the Home Office to discharge its responsibilities under part V of the Police Act 1997 and other supporting legislation, including the Protection of Children Act 1999, to make available to approved organisations information regarding the criminal or related background of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1044W.5/2">Other services carried out by the Criminal Records Bureau that are not undertaken by Capita are carried out by civil servants and include the sensitive matching of an applicants personal details to records held on the Police National Computer (PNC) and other lists held by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.1044W.5/3">A contract schedule sets out the service levels for Capita to meet.

	<p pid="c.1049W.12/1">Figures for the number of items handed in during the first week of the knife amnesty have been collected at police force level. Humberside police report that 259 items were surrendered to them. 17,715 items were handed in England and Wales during the first week of the amnesty. We worked closely with ACPO to develop the arrangements for the amnesty, which was part of our wider strategy to tackle knife crime. We are also focusing on legislation, enforcement, education and prevention. We have brought forward provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill that will raise the age at which someone can be sold a knife to 18; are introducing a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon; and giving head teachers powers to search pupils for knives. The Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase> that he was giving very serious consideration to the suggestion that the maximum sentence for having a knife or blade in a public place should be increased from the current sentence of two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.12/2">Many police forces are undertaking tough enforcement operations, for example, the Metropolitan police's Operation Blunt and the British Transport police's Operation Shield, which uses search equipment to detect those carrying knives and other weapons on our transport network. We are also supporting educational initiatives that demonstrate to young people the dangers of carrying knives, and reinforce the message that carrying a knife can result in it being turned on you. Though our small grants programme, the Connected Fund, we are also supporting a wide range of local community projects which work with young people to provide mentoring, training, education and other support.</p>

An allowance has been made for the fact that not all offenders complete their orders. The estimated total number of hours has been multiplied by the national minimum wage for each year.

	<p pid="c.1052W.5/2">We have no centrally collated data on the numbers of children trafficked into the UK. The Home Office recognises there is an urgent need to improve its intelligence on this issue and for this reason has commissioned a scoping project in partnership with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) to estimate the scale and nature of the problem including source countries. Additionally newly established Minors Intelligence Teams based at Croydon and Liverpool asylum screening units now provide monthly reports on children who have been identified as being at risk, including those that they believe have been trafficked.</p>

	<p pid="c.1058W.3/1">The Home Office controller for HMP Peterborough is the key official who meets with the prison's director to discuss operational matters, including the release of prisoners. Formal meetings take place monthly and in addition there are informal weekly meetings. Since January 2006 the controller has discussed with the director cases involving the release of eight individual prisoners, including five meetings between April and June concerning the release of foreign national prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1058W.3/2">It is a requirement that release licences for prisoners are signed by the Home Office controller in his or her capacity as a Crown servant. As a consequence of this the contractor's custody management team is in regular contact with the controller's team, who make the necessary checks prior to release taking place.</p>

The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued. From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks. Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system.

	<p pid="c.1063W.6/1">The Security Industry Authority (SIA) do not calculate the average processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued.</p>
	<p pid="c.1063W.6/2">From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks. Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between two and four weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 10 weeks to process most applications.</p>

	<p pid="c.1064W.2/1">Under section 167 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as amended by Schedule, Part 1, paragraph 357 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Lord Chief Justice appoints the seven judicial members of the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The four non-judicial members of the Council are appointed by the Home Secretary after consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. A person is eligible to be appointed as a judicial member if he is: a Lord Justice of Appeal; a judge of the High Court; a circuit judge; a district judge (magistrates courts); or a lay justice. The judicial members must include a circuit judge, a district judge and a lay judge. A non-judicial member is eligible if he has experience in one of more of the following areas: policing, criminal prosecution, criminal defence, and the promotion of the welfare of victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1064W.2/2">The Lord Chief Justice nominated the President of the Queen's Bench Division, the Vice President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, the Chair of the Criminal Committee of the Judicial Studies Board, and the Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) to be members of the Council and these appointments were agreed. It was also agreed that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be the member with criminal prosecution experience. The two circuit judges, the lay magistrate and the other non-judicial members were appointed after open competition following advertisements in the national media, and through targeted advertisements in professional publications and websites, including those aimed at BME communities. All appointments were made in accordance with the rules of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and an independent member sat on the interview panels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1064W.2/3">Members of the Sentencing Advisory Panel are appointed by the Lord Chancellor following consultation with the Home Secretary and the Lord Chief Justice. Panel members are appointed following open competition and are drawn from a wide variety of backgrounds both from within and outside the criminal justice system. Panel members serve in a personal capacity, bringing the knowledge and experience they have gained in their professional and voluntary roles to bear on the issues under discussion. As with the appointed members of the Council, advertisements are widely placed and the recruitment process followed the OCPA procedures with an independent member sitting on the interview panels.</p>

	<p pid="c.1066W.2/1">Prisoners and young offenders have a statutory entitlement to domestic or social visits. In addition, many establishments offer extended or family visits. The frequency of these additional visits remains a matter for each establishment, taking account of resources and regime. Statistics on the number of visitors are not routinely collated so there is no recent evidence as to the overall level of take up. However, in order to support and encourage more visitors, the Assisted Prisons Visits Scheme, which provides financial assistance for visitors on a low income, was extended in 2004. Good Practice Guidelines have also recently been issued to enable prisons and YOIs to examine and improve the effectiveness of their visits arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.1067W.0/4" class="indent">Secure training centres: the number of staff supervising trainees ranges between two staff to five to seven trainees and three staff to eight trainees. Other staff at the centre include custody officers to supervise visits, admissions and movements in the centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.1067W.0/5" class="indent">Young offender institutions: no simple ratio is available. On each wing, there are between 40 and 60 trainees, under the supervision of between three and six staff. In addition, there are teachers, learning support assistants and support staff.</p>
