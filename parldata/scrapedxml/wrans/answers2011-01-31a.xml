	<p pid="a.495W.3/1">In its opium survey for 2010, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported stable levels of opium cultivation across the country, with the number of poppy-free provinces remaining at 20. Opium cultivation in Helmand fell by 7%. This follows two successive years of reductions in opium cultivation and a dramatic fall in the wheat price. Current indicators suggest that opium poppy cultivation will remain broadly stable again in 2011, despite continuing low wheat prices. The UNODC intends to release its next assessment in February/March.</p>

In addition, reports suggest the construction of the dam is causing flooding and water shortages, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of people.

	<p pid="a.498W.2/1">International sanctions, including those adopted by the UN and the EU, show the strength of international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. We continue to monitor the progress of that programme closely. It is clear that sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire access to goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it hard to access international finance. We believe these and other pressures brought Iran back into talks with the EU 3+3. But, its disappointing failure to engage on the substance of international concerns in Istanbul and its continuing defiance of Security Council Resolutions; of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community more broadly mean that pressure will need to increase.</p>

Officials in our high commissions in Islamabad and New Delhi regularly discuss the situation in Kashmir with the Indian and Pakistani Governments and with our contacts in Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

It would incur disproportionate cost to compare the flight departure logs which give this information against the engineering unserviceability database. I am able to confirm, however, that in 2010 there were 99 instances where short term TriStar unserviceability caused a delay to an Operation Herrick task departing RAF Brize Norton at the start of an Airbridge flight. In many cases, engineers were able to quickly rectify the unserviceability, or to minimise the overall delay another airframe was substituted to undertake the task.</p>

The analysis set out cost figures for the physical capital; fixed and variable operating costs; fuel; nuclear decommissioning and waste; and infrastructure (such as the electricity transmission and distribution network). It does not consider the cost of financing, carbon, electricity imports, research and development, behavioural change or wider macro-economic impacts. Each of these pathways showed a marked increase in electricity demand, up to a doubling in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.3/2">Compared with a 'no effort' pathway, average annual undiscounted fuel costs are &#163;5-12 billion lower in low carbon generation pathways over the period to 2050, while average annual capital costs for the same period are &#163;7-17 billion per year higher. The relative costs of the high and low carbon pathways were heavily dependent on the assumptions made about technology costs and fossil fuel prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.3/3">As promised in the July publication, the Department is continuing to explore this area in further detail, and will publish an updated version of the Calculator including costs data later this year. Respondents to our Call for Evidence in October indicated strong public support for this course of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.523W.3/4">Further detailed analysis looking at the cost of electricity generation in the short- and medium-term is being carried out in conjunction with the electricity market reform project, which is to report later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.2/1">Since May 2010, the Department has consolidated the seven separate sets of national newspapers previously received by the ministerial and special adviser offices to a single shared set of papers, delivering over &#163;15,000 of ongoing revenue savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.2/2">In addition, the Department's Communications Directorate has undertaken a review that has led to a reduction in the number of magazines and journals it subscribes to and a move to a single supplier, realising further annual savings of approximately &#163;6,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.2/3">In September 2010 the Department's regional cuttings service was cancelled and the national cuttings service moved to an electronic only format with a limited list of recipients. Neither DCLG Ministers nor officials in the Department now receive hard copy press cuttings. Ministers have taken the view that an excessive and unnecessary amount of taxpayers' money was being spent on press cuttings. The Department estimates that the cancellation of the regional cuttings service and streamlining of the national cuttings service will save approximately &#163;16,000 and &#163;19,000 respectively in the remainder of this financial year.</p>

This could provide local authorities with a powerful financial incentive to tackle empty homes as part of their overall approach to meeting housing need.</p>

This programme will deliver maximum efficiency savings across the programme. The programme was previously valued at &#163;2.3 billion (the total of central estimates within a range for each scheme). Given that the agency's work to develop an optimised programme for the schemes is not yet complete, and that the work involves commercial negotiations with the supply chain, it would not be appropriate to attempt to set out scheme estimates in more detail or against individual schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.5/1">The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.5/2">The January 2010 school census allows an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In the Redditch constituency in January 2010 there were approximately 1,760 pupils in Redditch schools known to be eligible (rounded to the nearest 10), which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;756,800. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower. The figures do not include the pupil premium for service children, which is paid at the lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, or for looked after children who attract their own premium, again set at &#163;430 for 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.2/2">For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE. However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.3/1">Under the law of England and Wales anyone may make a will without professional advice. The person making the will (the testator) usually specifies the people he or she wants to administer his or her estate (the executors). It is for the testator to choose his or her executors. Banks appointed as executors cannot charge for their services unless and to the extent that they are authorised to do so by the testator in the will, by the court or by statute. There are no plans to change the law in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.554W.3/2">Nonetheless, the Government acknowledge that making a will is an important act with significant consequences, which should be properly understood by the testator. To help individuals understand the effects of making a will, the Government provide information on a number of websites. Information may also be obtained from other sources. For example, last year, the Office of Fair Trading published advice for consumers on making wills and appointing executors. This advice, available on the Consumer Direct website, helps consumers understand the options available to them and enables them to make an informed choice.</p>

Additionally, there are court orders available to manage the risk of serious sexual and violent offenders whose risk was not considered high enough at the time of conviction for an indefinite sentence, but who appear to present a risk at the end of their sentence.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.2/1">The Ministry of Justice does hold limited data which can be provided relating to the purchase of gym equipment in prisons. Providing you with the information in the format requested would incur a disproportionate cost as locating and consolidating this information at local level would require significant resource within the timescales for submission. We are however able to provide limited information extracted from the MoJ Procurement Directorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.2/2">Since 2007 the NOMS HM Prison Service has contracted with three main suppliers of gym/sports equipment who are Newitts Ltd, Physique plc and Service Sport. Newitts product portfolio consists of mainly light sports equipment, such as rackets, bats, free weights and consumables etc. Physique and Service Sport product ranges mainly consist of gym machines and other light sports equipment. The HM Prison Service where possible purchases remanufactured/refurbished heavy gym equipment. Purchasing equipment is considered the most cost-effective method of procuring those types of goods and where it is possible the HM Prison Service will be continuing with purchasing remanufactured equipment, subject to availability. The MoJ is currently working in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence for the next generation supply framework contract where a collaborative approach will allow the MoJ and MOD to leverage its economies of scale in the market place. This activity is currently being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. The framework contract is due for completion in summer 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.6/2">Group and loss relief policies remain broadly unchanged since the inception of the CT regime in 1965. Group and loss relief are important elements of the corporation tax regime which ensures that companies with similar profits over their life cycle but different patterns of profits and losses over the years, pay broadly the same amounts of tax overall and recognises the economic reality that grouped companies are part of a wider whole. This is balanced, however, with the need for a pragmatic approach to protect tax revenues.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.0/1">We are introducing a time limit of 12 months for entitlement to contributory employment and support allowance for claimants in the Work Related Activity Group. The period of 12 months was chosen because it strikes the best balance between allowing people with longer-term conditions to adjust to their health condition and providing a level of access that is appropriate for contributory benefits. Around 60% of all those claiming ESA already come off this benefit within a year<sup>(1)</sup>. We will be putting in place significant additional employment support through the Work programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.588W.5/1">The effect on a pensioner's income of the change to using the consumer price index (CPI) for indexation will depend on the composition of that income, i.e. the pensions and benefits they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/2">For occupational pension recipients, the change to their occupational pension income will be dependent upon the type of scheme that they are in and the rules of that scheme. Additional pension recipients will be likely to see lower increases in additional pension as a result of using the CPI for indexation rather than the retail price index (RPI).</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/3">As an illustration, where the RPI shows growth of one percentage point above the CPI, a pensioner in receipt of &#163;70 a week in affected income-e.g. made up of any combination of additional pension, an affected occupational pension or an affected benefit-could see a 70p per week difference in the increase applied to that income. This may be offset by increased entitlement to an income-related benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.5/4">It is important to see this change in the context of the more generous increases to the basic state pension which, under a 'triple guarantee' announced by the Government, will increase by the highest of the growth in average earnings, CPI or 2.5%. In 2011-12 only, it is proposed that an increase by the retail prices index will be given to the basic state pension.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.2/1">Analysis carried out by the Department shows that child maintenance payments are estimated to have a small, non-reportable, impact on the number of children in relative income poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.2/2">This is because statutory child maintenance payments to children living on or near the poverty line involve moving relatively small amounts of money between families. These payment levels do not have a reportable impact on lifting children out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.2/3">For those individual households however, where child maintenance provides parents with a stable income stream, it can make a real difference to the lives of children in poor households.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.2/4">We are committed to addressing child poverty and improving children's life chances and we believe that all families should receive the child maintenance that they are due. Beyond actual child maintenance payments, evidence indicates that ongoing involvement of both parents in children's lives is better for children on a range of outcomes. This is why supporting parents to make family-based arrangements for maintenance is absolutely central to our proposals for reforming the child maintenance system.</p>

	<p pid="a.592W.2/2">The employment provisions of the Equality Act 2010 (EA) provide protection from disability discrimination for disabled workers and disabled job applicants. The EA generally defines a disabled person as someone who has a mental or physical impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on the person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. Therefore a person whose dyslexia has these effects would be protected by the Act from discrimination.</p>

As set out in the White Paper on Local Growth local enterprise partnerships will be expected to fund their own day-to-day running costs and will also want to consider how they can obtain the best value for public money by leveraging in private sector investment. Local enterprise partnerships and proposed partnerships may also wish to submit bids to the Regional Growth Fund or European Funding. It is for local authorities to decide how much of their discretionary spending they allocate to local enterprise partnerships.</p>

This document sets out the UK Government's decision on its defence, security, intelligence, resilience, development and foreign affairs capabilities in the round.

	<p pid="a.593W.9/3">In December 2010, following on from the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support and the Minister of State for Security and Counter Terrorism initiated a formal consultation by the publication of a Green Paper on how the UK Government should acquire equipment, support and technology for UK defence and security. This consultation is wide ranging but it seeks to consider how the Government can ensure that the UK creates and retains the skills necessary to support essential national security capabilities and to what extent it should take wider economic considerations into account when taking decisions about fulfilling its defence and security requirements. My officials are working with those from the Ministry of Defence on these issues. I am also engaging on these issues through the National Defence Industries Council. The consultation which ends on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> is part of the process of developing a White Paper on these issues to be published in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.8/1">Professor Sir Adrian Smith's Postgraduate Review from 2010 (One Step Beyond: Making the most of the postgraduate education sector) found that the advanced knowledge and capability of postgraduates were highly prized by business and the public sector. The report noted that the skills of postgraduates, especially researchers, are critical for tackling major business challenges and driving innovation and growth. The UK's ability to provide people skilled to this level is an important factor in attracting global businesses to locate high-value operations in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.596W.8/2">The value of postgraduate education to all areas of the UK economy has also been recognised by a number of other sources. For example, the Royal Society's report &quot;The Scientific Century&quot; (2010) suggested that, while many graduates move out of research following a PhD in a scientific, or closely related, subject, they go on to use their skills to considerable economic and wider benefit, through employment within a large range of sectors.</p>

	<p pid="a.597W.2/1">From next academic year (2011/12), funding allocations for 16 to 18-year-olds will be based on the equivalent of lagged pupil numbers. Individual statements will be sent to each 16 to18 provider by the Young People's Learning Agency at the end of January, which will detail the number of learners they will be funded for in 2011/12 and the make up of those learners. These statements will not include detail on the funding individual providers will receive because the funding rates for schools and colleges will need to be finalised as part of the allocations process taking into account projected national student volumes. The base rate of funding will be announced as part of this process and final funding allocations are due to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.2/2">Should the volume of 16 to 18-year-old learners be greater than projected and individual providers recruit more learners than they have been funded for in year, this growth will be consolidated as part of next year's allocations process for which providers will be funded in 2012/13.</p>
	<p pid="a.597W.2/3">With regard to adult skills (19 and over), 'Investing Skills for Sustainable Growth' was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November 2010</phrase>. In the 2011-12 financial year, we plan to invest &#163;3.9 billion in further education (FE) and skills for post-19 learners. Within this envelope of resource, institutions have the freedom and flexibility to plan their provision to meet the needs of learners, employers and communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.597W.2/5">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will announce its provisional allocations to institutions in March for academic year 2011/12, based on the resources allocated in its grant letter issued in December. For subsequent years we do not have robust data on which to make such as assessment down to institutional level. University income is made up of a number of funding streams from public, private and charitable sources. In terms of public funding our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of resources for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector providing they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. We do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce and we expect improved teaching quality and better informed students to have a positive impact on the economy. Overall we expect the number of university students to remain at current levels.</p>

Individual higher education institutions are responsible for maintaining their own academic standards and quality. QAA checks how well individual higher education institutions meet those responsibilities. In our recent grant letter to HEFCE, the Secretary of State and I reaffirmed our commitment to a regime that is built around assuring and improving the experience of the student. We stressed the importance of HEFCE's work with the sector and the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, in ensuring that strong quality assurance arrangements are in place for the start of the 2011/12 academic year. I continue to keep in touch with that process.

	<p pid="a.599W.2/1">Over 130 attendees from industry participated in the Manufacturing summit I hosted on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-25">25 January</phrase> to discuss how to work together to promote manufacturing excellence and challenge perceptions of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.599W.2/2">The Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, and I emphasised the importance this Government attach to manufacturing for achieving the balanced, sustainable growth essential for our economy. We also highlighted the need to tackle the outdated image of manufacturing that hinders its ability to attract the best talent. To address this challenge, we are asking UK businesses manufacturing cutting-edge products to throw open their doors for a day to students and teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.599W.2/3">Breakout sessions, chaired by Ministers, focused on understanding the key barriers to growth and identifying solutions where industry can work with Government. Outcomes from these sessions will feed into the advanced manufacturing strand of the Government's Growth Review, which will announce policy proposals at Budget 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.5/1">The Government are taking a new approach to local growth that was presented in the Local Growth White Paper (Cm 7961) presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-28">28 October 2010</phrase>. This will <i> (a)</i> shift power to local businesses and communities; <i> (b)</i> create the right conditions for growth and prosperity by promoting efficient and dynamic markets and (c) support focused investment that will have a long term impact on growth.</p>

RGF support will be much larger-it has &#163;1.4 billion over three years at its disposal compared to total GBI expenditure of &#163;54 million in 2009/10-and focused to support those areas and communities that are currently dependent on the public sector make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth. During the first round of the RGF over 400 applications have been received from businesses and local communities around England.</p>

	<p pid="a.600W.5/1">Student loans in England are only available to those who meet the relevant residence requirements. The Student Loans Company (SLC) applies the same mechanisms to all borrowers who move overseas after leaving their course.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.5/2">When borrowers move abroad, whether temporarily or because they live in another country, they must give the SLC information about their location and earnings. SLC will determine whether the borrower should be making repayments and if so, gives them a monthly repayment schedule under the terms of the contract of the loan. The SLC will convert the income into pounds sterling and tell the borrower the amount they will need to pay each month in pounds sterling.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.5/3">Where borrowers move overseas and do not notify the SLC, they may be charged penalties which will be added to the outstanding loan amount. They may also have to pay the costs of any trace agents employed by SLC. In some circumstances, they may have to repay the full outstanding amount in a single payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.5/4">Effective collection of student loans across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries. Borrowers who choose to disregard their obligation will be pursued by SLC and where appropriate, court orders will be sought.</p>

An estimate that included the self-employed at the level of detail requested would only be available through the Labour Force Survey. However, the industrial classification in the Labour Force Survey is known to be weak and as a result the Business Register Employment Survey, which has better accuracy in terms of its industrial classifications, has been used.

	<p pid="a.612W.0/1">A comprehensive assessment is not available. It is estimated that more than one third of all households have insufficient money to meet their basic needs, and 10% of the population do not have enough to eat. One in five children die before they reach the age of five, and one in three is malnourished. 380 of every 100,000 women die unnecessarily in pregnancy or childbirth. 70% of people are at risk from malaria, with 4 million cases and 9,000 deaths each year. Over 95% of health costs are met by people themselves, with government expenditure and international assistance for health care amounting to less than US $1 per person per year. Education is also severely underfunded. It is likely that poverty is particularly severe in areas of eastern Burma affected by armed conflict, in Chin and Rakhine States, and in parts of the central dry zone. Around 500,000 people have been displaced by conflict in eastern Burma, of which about 100,000 are living in areas of continuing fighting. Around 150,000 Burmese people live as refugees in camps in Thailand.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.0/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) is helping to address these needs through an aid programme focused on improving health care, basic education and income-earning opportunities for rural people; and providing assistance for people displaced by conflict, including Burmese refugees in Thailand. DFID's allocation for Burma for 2010-11 is &#163;28 million, to which a further &#163;3 million is being added in order to contribute to the relief and recovery effort following Cyclone Giri which hit Burma in October 2010.</p>

The biggest reduction in energy consumption will be achieved through reducing the number of IT servers. DFID has also installed a green roof at its East Kilbride headquarters, which has reduced carbon emissions from gas usage. A number of other changes have also been made, such as reconfiguring lighting systems and reducing plant operation times and cooling of IT equipment.

	<p pid="a.612W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) takes a broad based approach to financial sector development to provide stable, sustainable and affordable financial services to individuals, households and firms in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.6/2">DFID promotes branchless banking to harness the potential offered by new technologies such as mobile banking, which have made it possible for poor people to access financial services without having to travel long distances to a bank branch and at an affordable cost. We also promote the use of technology to send and receive remittances more cheaply, quickly and safely.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.6/3">DFID will explore innovative financial instruments and new models to scale up financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. We will also support the development of financial market infrastructure, which is essential for attracting commercial players for financing SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.6/4">Building on the lessons learned from microfinance (and in particular from micro-credit), we will continue our work to strengthen microfinance institutions and the development of new products including micro-savings and micro-insurance.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">The hon. Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> was asked by the Prime Minister to review mental health services for serving personnel and veterans. His report, published in October 2010, made a number of recommendations:</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/2" class="indent">Incorporation of a structured mental health inquiry into existing medical examinations performed while serving-Ministry of Defence (MOD) are currently developing an enhanced mental health assessment that will undergo a three-month trial from April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/3" class="indent">Increasing the number of mental health professionals (from 15 to 30) conducting veterans outreach work from mental health trusts in partnership with a leading mental health charity-the Department is working with the NHS armed forces networks and others to scope the requirements for this with a view to commissioning this service soon after April 2011. The specification will look to ensure that the needs of veterans in all parts of England are met, and this will require some flexibility in the number and type of mental health nurses and where they are placed.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/4" class="indent">A Veterans' Information Service will be put in place so that 12 months after a person leaves the armed forces, they will be provided with information offering the opportunity to access guidance and support on health and well-being issues. The Department is developing proposals for this service, working with the Royal British Legion. A limited trial will be conducted during 2011 with roll-out scheduled for early 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/5" class="indent">Trial of an online early intervention service for serving personnel and veterans. The Department is working with MOD and the Big White Wall, a voluntary organisation who specialise in providing a supported, online mental health community for vulnerable adults and other target groups to put this service in place. It is expected that this service will be piloted from April 2011 in selected areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/6" class="indent">Extension of the partnership agreement with Combat Stress-the Department has been working closely with Combat Stress on a number of veterans mental health issues. The Department also links with the devolved Administrations on these and other issues through the MOD/UK Departments of Health Partnership Board. Departmental officials will meet with the new chief executive of Combat Stress in February 2011 at which time the timetable for extending the Combat Stress partnership agreement will be agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/7">The Department is working closely with the MOD and service charities to implement these recommendations along with work already in hand to provide a 24-hour helpline service for veterans seeking help from Combat Stress and work to develop an e-learning package for general practitioners on veterans and military health issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.0/8">Following the announcement of Dr Murrison's report, the Government announced that it wished to see the report's recommendations taken forward. Funding has been made available from the &#163;2 million already identified in 2010-11 and subsequent Treasury approved funding of up to &#163;1.8 million per annum over the next four years will be used to deliver on the recommendations where the Department has lead responsibility. The MOD is responsible for delivery and funding of those aspects of the report relating to in-service provision of mental health services. Work on assessing any future costs and resource requirements for implementing the recommendation is currently under way and will be assessed as part for the MOD's planning process, but it is not possible to give any financial data at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.11/1">The Government remain committed to driving change for adults and children with learning disabilities. Valuing People Now has set priorities until March 2011 of improving outcomes for adults with learning disabilities and their family carers around health, housing and employment. The Government will continue for the future to drive greater personalisation and improved choice and control to improve outcomes for people with learning disabilities and will work with people with learning disabilities and their family carers to ensure that their views are included in the future transformation of the national health service and the new social care vision and across other policies like employment and housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/2">The Department is collaborating with the Department for Education ahead of the publication of the Green Paper on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. The Green Paper will explore how we can achieve public services which are centred on the needs of families and children, joining up support from education, health and social care, particularly for those with the most severe and complex needs and at key transitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/3">NHS West Midlands undertook a review of Child and Young People Disability Services last year, including learning disabilities. Following these reviews each primary care trust developed an action plan with the local authority. Progress is currently being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.632W.11/4">The Health and Social Care Bill will require the establishment of a health and wellbeing board in every upper tier local authority by April 2013. Health and wellbeing boards will bring together elected representatives and the key NHS, public health, social care, and children's services leaders and patient representatives to work in partnership. This will ensure services are joined up around the needs of people using them rather than arbitrarily divided into service types, leading to better outcomes for people using services.</p>

The data provided in the table refer to the number of episodes of care where at least one procedure or intervention was carried out, rather than a count of the number of operations, which is not collected as part of the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).<br/> 3. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> 4. Number of episodes with a main or secondary procedure: The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in an HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so are no longer included in admitted patient HES data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> The NHS Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.658W.2/1">While there was an increase in the number of persons detained under Immigration Act powers in the third quarter of 2010 it is worth noting that the data are a snapshot. They only show the number detained on the last day of the reporting period, therefore, on any other date during the quarter (or in previous quarters) the number detained could have been higher or lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/2">The increase in the detained population may have been, partially, a result of the opening of Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre which provided additional detention space for Immigration Group to progress cases through to removal. There were 360 more adult detainees at Harmondsworth comparing Q2 of 2010 to Q3 (from 250 to 610). The population at Oakington dropped from 395 to 100 but the fall was less than the rise of the detained Harmondsworth population.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/3">The increase may have also occurred due to a higher than average number of charter flight removal operations during that period in which individuals would have required detention prior to removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/4">There is no specific estimate for the number of persons who will be detained in the next eight quarters. However our aim is to maintain and improve the number of removals over the next two years which will inevitably require detention.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.5/1">The priority of the agency remains to secure the border and to control migration while we play our part in reducing the public deficit. We are committed to programmes such as e-Borders and the Immigration Case Working system that will help to reduce the threat of terrorism, crime and immigration abuse and replace costly and outmoded paper work, respectively. These programmes will help improve our productivity and efficiency and will mean that we can target our resources on those people likely to cause most harm to the UK. As a result the UK Border Agency will be able to deliver its objectives while reducing the budget by up to 20% in real terms over the next four years.</p>

	<p pid="a.668W.2/1">The Government have commissioned a review of the Vetting and Barring Scheme and the criminal records regime which we expect to report in the next few weeks. We shall consider carefully and respond to the outcomes and recommendations of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.668W.2/2">Like Lord Bichard, the Government have made the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults the key priority for the reviews, but ensuring that this is achieved in a way which is proportionate and which removes unnecessary barriers to volunteering or working with these groups.</p>
