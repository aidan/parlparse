	<p pid="b.487W.6/2">This month the Prime Minister asked Lord Young to look at what this Government can do to make life easier for small businesses. This will include examining ways in which the government can remove barriers to growth and remove or minimise regulatory and bureaucratic burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/3">Recently, the Better Regulation Executive, published a report 'Lightening the Load' which highlights the cumulative regulatory burden affecting the smallest businesses-the findings will feed into Lord Young's review.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/4">The BRE is actively working with departments to identify regulation which is overly burdensome, particularly on small businesses, and support policy makers in using non-regulatory approaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/5">The BRE are also undertaking a series of regional visits, speaking to SMEs all over the country to further identify ways to improve the business environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/6">In September, the Government introduced the One-in, One-out rule-a significant step in stemming the flow of regulation and will focus Whitehall's attention on finding alternatives to regulation.</p>

While there is a significant literature base examining the link between government science funding and its effect on GDP, it is extremely difficult to derive specific estimates of the income effects of particular changes in science funding. As with all savings being made in the BIS settlement, within the science budget, we are working closely with research councils and HEFCE to deliver savings as far as possible through a combination of reform and efficiencies, for example through the Wakeham proposals to incentivise efficiency in university research.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.2/1">The Government are committed to Britain being a world leading place to do research and despite huge pressure on public spending, the overall level of funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms in a ring-fenced budget. We will, as Lord Browne suggested in his recent review, monitor participation in postgraduate study to identify whether changes to the undergraduate funding and finance system have any effect on entry to postgraduate courses, but we are confident that we will continue to have a world class research base. As now, postgraduate students have access to professional career development loans to support their studies.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.8/1">A relatively small number of prospective students apply each year for deferred entry to higher education, including those who decide to undertake a gap year. Statistics on deferred entry to higher education are available via the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). In 2010, 479,057 applicants accepted a place; 32,983 of these deferred entry to 2011. UCAS have sent a message to those who have applied for 2012 entry alerting them to the Government's recent announcement about future funding for higher education, directing them to the BIS website for additional information and suggesting further discussion with their preferred university. The decision to defer entry to higher education is not generally taken lightly and there will be a number of considerations that individuals will, doubtless, take into account. It is not possible to say at this stage whether any of those who have applied for deferred entry will seek to reapply for 2011 and so no assessment has been made of the impact on gap-year placement organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.506W.2/1">The Department does not collect information on the numbers of children in individual local authority areas that have not been allocated school places. We are keenly aware that in many areas of the country there are sharp increases in demand for primary places. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced a review of all the Department's capital programmes. We are clear that future spending needs to be more efficient and with a sharper focus on real needs. The Secretary of State has also said that providing funding to support the provision of pupil places where they are needed will be a priority for the next spending review period. We will announce allocations to local authorities in due course.</p>
