	<p pid="e.4W.2/1">All armed forces personnel receive a discharge medical assessment 90 days prior to discharge. This detailed examination is undertaken by a doctor and the results are recorded on the individual's F-Med-1 form. This form contains a specific assessment of the mental capacity and emotional stability of the individual. A reassessment is carried out seven days prior to discharge to confirm the record or reflect any further changes.</p>
	<p pid="e.4W.2/2">A summary of each individual's medical history while in the armed forces, including the results of the discharge medical, is recorded on an F-Med-133 form which is given to the individual to pass on to their civilian general practitioner (GP). The F-Med-133 also contains information on how the GP can gain access to the individual's complete service medical records if required.</p>
	<p pid="e.4W.2/3">Following discharge, ex-service personnel with concerns about their mental health should obtain treatment through the NHS. The Department of Health and devolved Administrations, with support from the Ministry of Defence, are undertaking community mental health pilots for veterans at six NHS trusts across the UK in Staffordshire and Shropshire, Camden and Islington, Cardiff, Bishop Auckland, Cornwall and Edinburgh. These arrangements aim to make it easier for veterans with concerns about their mental health to seek and access help. The pilots, which will be evaluated later this year, provide key input into planning future provision across the NHS, including how a dedicated PTSD treatment service within the NHS might best be configured.</p>
	<p pid="e.4W.2/4">Ex-service personnel can also access the Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) which is available to veterans who were deployed on operations since 1982. MAP offers comprehensive physical and mental health assessments who feel that their ill-health may be linked to military service. Veterans are also designated as a special interest group (SIG) in the Department of Health's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme.</p>

	<p pid="e.9W.0/1">We have made no assessment of the reasons for changes in the rate of farmer suicide, or of the specific monthly figures. However, the Office of National Statistics provides us with proportional mortality ratio (PMR). These data are presented as one of the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy indicators. PMRs should be interpreted with care because the proportion of deaths from the cause of interest is affected by the relative frequency of other causes of death.</p>
	<p pid="e.9W.0/2">The following data compare the rate of suicides for farmers and farm workers aged between 20 and 74 years with that for the rest of the working population in England and Wales. The results are expressed as a proportional mortality ratio where the suicide rate for all workers is expressed as 100. Slight classification changes mean that data from 2001 cannot be directly compared with previous years.</p>

Police officers are visiting 'head shops' to ensure substances which may now be controlled are not being offered for sale. Police action on seizures includes prosecution where there is evidence of possession with intent to supply.</p>

The Serious Organised Crime Agency is also actively developing approaches to identify websites offering mephedrone for sale, both at home and abroad, so they can take action at an international level to close these down.</p>

These will take into account both rehabilitation requirements as well as risk assessments that take into account previous offending and current behaviour. Some courses will not be appropriate because of the prisoner's previous offences while others will be inappropriate because they would lead to a vocational qualification that the prisoner would be unable to use. Prisoner's access to computers is tightly controlled and underpinned by rigorous IT security measures.</p>

	<p pid="e.34W.11/1">Decisions about the level of council tax are a matter for individual local authorities. Once an authority has carried out its statutory responsibility of calculating its budget requirement and its basic amount of council tax for a financial year, legislation allows the authority to make substitute calculations-but in doing so the authority may not increase the level of either its budget requirement or its basic amount of council tax. The relevant provisions are section 37 (in relation to billing authorities) and section 49 (in relation to major precepting authorities) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992.</p>
	<p pid="e.34W.11/2">This Department has made no assessment of the likelihood of authorities varying their council tax in this way. Like every other part of the public sector we believe local authorities can make significant efficiencies and, if necessary, reduce spending or reprioritise with no effect on council tax or frontline services.</p>

	<p pid="e.36W.9/1">We will radically reform the planning system to give neighbourhoods far more ability to determine the shape of the places in which their inhabitants live, based on the principles set out in the Conservative Party publication Open Source Planning. We will abolish the unelected Infrastructure Planning Commission and replace it with an efficient and democratically accountable system that provides a fast-track process for major infrastructure projects. We will publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework covering all forms of development and setting out national economic, environmental and social priorities. To be successful it is vital to have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This includes giving communities not only a say, but also a stake, in appropriately-sited renewable energy projects like wind farms. We will therefore encourage community-owned renewable energy schemes where local people benefit from the power produced. We will also allow communities that host renewable energy projects to keep the additional business rates they generate.</p>

Many colleges will benefit from this resource, which will be focused at colleges that have yet to receive significant investment. Following the announcement of revised criteria we hope to invite colleges to apply to this fund shortly with a view to successful projects starting as soon as is practicable.</p>

There are a small number of transport related grants within DFE area based grants totalling &#163;39.76 million.

RSG has been protected at the level set by Parliament and &#163;1.7 billion of central Government revenue and capital grants have been de-ring fenced, giving local authorities maximum flexibility to deliver efficiencies and focus their budgets on services their residents value most.
